[[File:Sneeze.JPG|thumb|Airborne diseases can be spread via respiratory droplets expelled from the mouth and nose.]]

An '''airborne disease''' is any disease that is caused by [[pathogen]]s that can be transmitted through the air. Such diseases include many of considerable importance both in [[Human medicine|human]] and [[veterinary medicine]]. The relevant pathogens may be viruses, bacteria, or fungi, and they may be spread through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, raising of dust, spraying of liquids, toilet flushing or any activities which generates [[aerosol]] particles or droplets. Human airborne diseases do not include conditions caused by air pollution such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), gasses and any airborne particles, though their study and prevention may help inform the science of airborne disease transmission.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Overview==
Airborne diseases include any that are caused via transmission through the air. Many airborne diseases are of great medical importance. The pathogens transmitted may be any kind of microbe, and they may be spread in aerosols, dust or liquids. The aerosols might be generated from sources of [[infection]] such as the bodily secretions of an infected animal or person, or biological wastes such as accumulate in lofts, caves, garbage and the like. Such infected aerosols may stay suspended in air currents long enough to travel for considerable distances, though the rate of infection decreases sharply with the distance between the source and the organism infected.

Airborne pathogens or [[allergens]] often cause [[inflammation]] in the nose, throat, sinuses and the lungs. This is caused by the inhalation of these pathogens that affect a person's respiratory system or even the rest of the body. Sinus congestion, coughing and sore throats are examples of inflammation of the upper respiratory air way due to these airborne agents. Air pollution plays a significant role in airborne diseases which is linked to [[asthma]]. [[Pollutants]] are said to influence lung function by increasing air way inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutramed.com/Air/airborne_diseases.htm |title=Airborne diseases |deadurl=yes |accessdate=21 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628073116/http://www.nutramed.com/Air/airborne_diseases.htm |archivedate=28 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many common infections can spread by airborne transmission at least in some cases, including: [[Anthrax]] (inhalational), [[Chickenpox]], [[Influenza]], [[Measles]], [[Smallpox]], [[Cryptococcosis]], and [[Tuberculosis]].

Airborne diseases can also affect non-humans.  For example, [[Newcastle disease]] is an avian disease that affects many types of domestic poultry worldwide which is transmitted via airborne contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Bailey W.|author2=King, Daniel J.|title=Effect of Negative Air Ionization on Airborne Transmission of Newcastle Disease Virus|journal=Avian Diseases|date=October–December 1994|volume=38|issue=4|jstor=1592107 |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1592107?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102029596263 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Often, airborne pathogens or allergens cause inflammation in the nose, throat, sinuses, and the upper airway lungs. Upper airway inflammation causes coughing congestion, and sore throat. This is caused by the inhalation of these pathogens that affect a person's respiratory system or even the rest of the body. Sinus congestion, coughing and sore throats are examples of inflammation of the upper respiratory air way due to these airborne agents.

==Causes==
An airborne disease can be caused by exposure to a source: an infected patient or animal, by being transferred from the infected person or animal’s mouth, nose, cut, or needle puncture. People receive the disease through a portal of entry: mouth, nose, cut, or needle puncture.

==Transmission==
Airborne transmission of disease depends on several physical variables endemic to the infectious particle. Environmental factors influence the efficacy of airborne disease transmission; the most evident environmental conditions are temperature and relative humidity. The sum of all the factors that influence temperature and humidity, either meteorological (outdoor) or human (indoor), as well as other circumstances influencing the spread of the droplets containing the infectious particles, as winds, or human behavior, sum up the factors influencing the transmission of airborne diseases.

*Climate and living area. Rainfall (number of rainy days&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Environmental Factors Affecting the Transmission of Respiratory Viruses |pmc=3311988 | pmid=22440971 |doi=10.1016/j.coviro.2011.12.003 |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2012 |journal=Curr Opin Virol |pages=90–5 |vauthors=Pica N, Bouvier NM }}&lt;/ref&gt; being more important than total precipitation&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Variation assessment of airborne Alternaria and Cladosporium spores at different bioclimatical conditions.|pmid=15912938 | volume=109 |vauthors=Rodríguez-Rajo FJ, Iglesias I, Jato V |journal=Mycol Res |pages=497–507 |doi=10.1017/s0953756204001777 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Atmospheric concentrations of Cladosporium spp. and Alternaria spp. spores in Zagreb (Croatia) and effects of some meteorological factors.|pmid=15627341 | volume=11 |vauthors=Peternel R, Culig J, Hrga I |journal=Ann Agric Environ Med |pages=303-7 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;), mean of sunshine daily hours,&lt;ref name="pmid10879421"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sabariego S, Díaz de la Guardia C, Alba F | title = The effect of meteorological factors on the daily variation of airborne fungal spores in Granada (southern Spain) | journal = Int J Biometeorol | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10879421 | doi = 10.1007/s004840050131}}&lt;/ref&gt; latitude, altitude&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; are characteristic agents to take in account when assessing the possibility of spread of any airborne infection. Furthermore, some infrequent or exceptional extreme events also influence the dissemination of airborne diseases, as tropical storms, hurricanes, typhoons, or monsoons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Association of climatic factors with infectious diseases in the Arctic and subarctic region – a systematic review|pmc=4079933 | pmid=24990685 |volume=7 |year=2014 |journal=Glob Health Action |pages=24161 |vauthors=Hedlund C, Blomstedt Y, Schumann B |doi=10.3402/gha.v7.24161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate conditions determine temperature, winds and relative humidity in any territory, either all year around or at isolated moments (days or weeks).  Those are the main factors affecting the spread, duration and infectiousness of droplets containing infectious particles. For instance, influenza virus, is spread easily in northern countries (north hemisphere), because of climate conditions which favour the infectiousness of the virus but on the other hand, in those countries, lots of bacterial infections cannot spread outdoor most of the year, keeping in a latent stage.

:UV is harmful to both viruses and bacteria. UV incidence can determine the survival of the infectious particles, so that in those territories with a higher average of sunshine daily hours, and closer to the equator, some particles lose their infectious ability. Infectious particles show an increased survival in the presence of UV light at higher relative humidity levels. It is thought to be due to the protective effect of larger particle sizes, as evaporation would be less at these higher RH levels, showing a protective effect of a thicker water coat.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The effect of environmental parameters on the survival of airborne infectious agents|pmc=2843949 | pmid=19773291 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2009.0227.focus |volume=6 Suppl 6 |year=2009 |journal=J R Soc Interface |pages=S737–46 |author=Tang JW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:After isolated events, as tropical storms, has been determined that firstly the quantity of fungal spores is decreased, but a few days later, an exponentially increased number of spores is found, compared to normal conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An environmental assessment of mold concentrations and potential mycotoxin exposures in the greater Southeast Texas area.|pmid=14672314 | volume=38 |vauthors=Khan NN, Wilson BL |journal=J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng |pages=2759-72 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Socioeconomics and living conditions. They have a minor role in airborne diseases transmission, but they also have to be taken in consideration. Dwelling is an important aspect. In cities the spread of diseases is faster than in rural areas and outskirts. Normally, cities enclose quarters of buildings, in which the transmission of the viral and bacterial diseases among the neighborhoods is uncomplicated. However, suburban areas are generally more favourable for higher airborne fungal spores&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

:Nearness to large sources of water as rivers and lakes can be a cause of some outbreaks of airborne diseases, after changes in local watershed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Poor sewage systems are usually found in poor countries, especially in the rural areas, and can determine the proliferation of infectious bacteria, that once infecting animal or humans can be transmitted throughout the air.

:Working conditions, can also settle infectious airborne diseases. At indoor environments, temperature and relative humidity are mainly affected by HVAC systems (heating, ventilation and air conditioning).&lt;ref name="pmid23365758"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fernstrom A, Goldblatt M | title = Aerobiology and its role in the transmission of infectious diseases | journal = J Pathog | volume = 2013 | issue = | pages = 493960 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23365758 | pmc = 3556854 | doi = 10.1155/2013/493960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inadequate ventilation is implicated in the airborne transmission of respiratory viruses.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; Poor maintenance or defects on those systems can foster the conditions for airborne infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genesisair.com/AirborneHealthcareAquiredInfectionsHAI.htm|title=Aerosolization 's Roll in Transmission of Healthcare Acquired Conditions|accessdate=12 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609170117/http://www.genesisair.com/AirborneHealthcareAquiredInfectionsHAI.htm|archive-date=9 June 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a poor maintenance of air conditioning systems, can lead to an outbreak of Legionella (mainly Legionella pneumophila), that will spread among the population of the building (workers), before the finding of the focal point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000616.htm|title=Legionnaire disease|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hospitals, isolation of patients sick of infectious diseases has to be added as a factor, which is noticeable in poor regions, where lack of resources facilitates the spread of infectious diseases.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Prevention==
Some ways to prevent airborne diseases include [[hand washing|washing hands]], using appropriate hand disinfection, getting regular immunizations against diseases believed to be locally present, wearing a respirator and limiting time spent in the presence of any patient likely to be a source of infection.&lt;ref name="Bloodborne and Airborne Pathogens"&gt;{{cite book |last=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) |year=2011 |publisher=Jones &amp; Barlett Publishers |pages=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8hbEOpBtBJIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=books+airborne+disease&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2l0ed9ULOZ&amp;sig=eGVdwnutqF-3ojWfiMVAzvkUOck&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2iSFUMqKGImN0QHL5ICoBQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ |title=Bloodborne and Airborne Pathogens |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exposure to a patient or animal with an airborne disease does not guarantee receiving the disease. Because of the changes in host immunity and how much the host was exposed to the particles in the air makes a difference to how the disease affects the body.&lt;ref name="Bloodborne and Airborne Pathogens"/&gt;

Antibiotics are not prescribed for patients to control viral infections. They may however be prescribed to a flu patient for instance, to control or prevent bacterial [[secondary infection]]s. They also may be used in dealing with air-borne bacterial primary infections, such as [[pneumonic plague]].&lt;ref name="Prevent and Control Infection"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Laura Ester Ziady |author2=Nico Small |title=Prevent and Control Infection: Application Made Easy |year=2006 |publisher=Juta and Company Ltd. |pages=119–120 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSKwP3v99dYC&amp;pg=PA119 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has told consumers about vaccination and following careful hygiene and sanitation protocols for airborne disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/|title=Redirect - Vaccines: VPD-VAC/VPD menu page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers also have access to preventive measures like UV Air purification devices that FDA and EPA-certified laboratory test data has verified as effective in inactivating a broad array of airborne infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rxair.com/wp-content/themes/rx-wp-amz/lab-results/Eco-RX_Inc_6-13-2007_Rpt_Reprint.pdf |title=Chamber Test Analysis on Eco-RX Inc. Model 400 Air Purifier |accessdate=4 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many public health specialists recommend [[social distancing]] to reduce the transmission of airborne infections.&lt;ref name="pmid17283616"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glass RJ, Glass LM, Beyeler WE, Min HJ | title = Targeted social distancing design for pandemic influenza | journal = Emerging Infect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="72719">Litigation related to [[asbestos]] injuries and property damages has been claimed to be the longest-running [[mass tort]] in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG162/|title=Asbestos-Related Claims Exceed 730,000, Cost More than $70 Billion|date=22 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since asbestos-related disease has been identified by the medical profession in the late 1920s, workers' compensation cases were filed and resolved in secrecy, with a flood of litigation starting in the United States in the 1970s, and culminating in the 1980s and 1990s.  A massive multi-district litigation (MDL) complex filing has remained pending in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for over 20 years.  As many of the scarring-related injury cases have been resolved, asbestos litigation continues to be hard-fought among the litigants, mainly in individually brought cases for terminal cases of asbestosis, mesothelioma, and other cancers.

==Background==
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, asbestos was considered an ideal material for use in the construction industry. It was known to be an excellent fire retardant, to have high electrical resistance, and was inexpensive and easy to use.

The dangers related to asbestos arise mainly when the fibers become airborne and are inhaled. Because of the size of the fibers, the lungs cannot expel them.&lt;ref&gt;''Casarrett &amp; Doull's Toxicology'' (2001), pp 520-522&lt;/ref&gt; These fibers are also sharp and penetrate internal tissues.

Health problems attributed to asbestos include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/asbe.pdf]. EPA publication on Asbestos. Retrieved 15 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

#''[[Asbestosis]]'' - A lung disease first found in textile workers,&lt;ref&gt;Murray, H.M., Departmental Committee for Compensation for Industrial Diseases. Cd 3495 and 3496. London, His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1907, p.127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, W.E., [http://www.asbestoslegaljournal.com/Asbestos-Lawsuit-Documents/1924-Cooke-Fibrosis-of-the-Lungs-Due-to-the-Inhalation-of-Asbestos.pdf "Fibrosis of the lungs due to the inhalation of asbestos dust."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707172946/http://www.asbestoslegaljournal.com/Asbestos-Lawsuit-Documents/1924-Cooke-Fibrosis-of-the-Lungs-Due-to-the-Inhalation-of-Asbestos.pdf |date=2011-07-07 }} B.M.J., 2, 147, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selikoff, I.J. et al., The occurrence of asbestosis among insulation workers in the United States. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences., 132, pp139-155, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; asbestosis is a scarring of the lung tissue resulting from the production of growth factors that stimulate fibroblasts (the scar-producing lung cells) to proliferate and synthesize the scar tissue in response to injury by the inhaled fibers.  The scarring may eventually become so severe that the lungs can no longer function. The latency period (meaning the time it takes for the disease to develop) is often 10–20 years.
#''[[Mesothelioma]]'' - A cancer of the mesothelial lining of the lungs and the chest cavity, the [[peritoneum]] (abdominal cavity) or the [[pericardium]] (a sac surrounding the heart). Unlike lung cancer, mesothelioma has no association with smoking.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name="Muscat"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Muscat JE, Wynder EL | title=Cigarette smoking, asbestos exposure, and malignant mesothelioma | journal=Cancer Research | year=1991 | pages=2263–7| volume=51 | issue=9 | pmid=2015590  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only established causal factor is exposure to asbestos or similar fibers.&lt;ref&gt;Maule, Magnani, Dalmasso, Mirabelli, Merletti &amp; Biggeri, "Modeling Mesothelioma Risk Associated with Environmental Asbestos Exposure", Environmental Health Perspectives, Vol 115, No 7, July 2207, pg 1066&lt;/ref&gt; The latency period for mesothelioma may be 20–50 years.  The prognosis for mesothelioma is grim, with most patients dying within 12 months of diagnosis.
#''[[Cancer]]'' - Cancer of the lung, gastrointestinal tract, kidney and larynx have been linked to asbestos. The latency period for cancer is often 15–30 years. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110606141046/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C06%5C12%5Cstory_12-6-2006_pg6_25]

Considerable international controversy exists regarding the perceived rights and wrongs associated with litigation on [[Workers' compensation|compensation]] claims related to asbestos exposure and alleged subsequent medical consequences. Some measure of the vast range of views expressed in legal and political circles can perhaps be exemplified by the two quotes below, the first &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=490682|title=On the Theory Class's Theories of Asbestos Litigation: The Disconnect Between Scholarship and Reality|first=Lester|last=Brickman|date=1 February 2004|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Prof. [[Lester Brickman]], an American legal [[ethicist]] writing in the ''[[Pepperdine Law Review]]'', and second, [[Michael Wills]], a British [[Member of Parliament]], speaking in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on July 13. 2006:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A review of the scholarly literature indicates a substantial degree of indifference to the causes of this civil justice system failure. Many of the published articles on asbestos litigation focus on transactional costs and ways in which the flow of money from defendants to plaintiffs and their lawyers can be expeditiously and efficiently prioritized and routed. The failure to acknowledge, let alone analyze, the overriding reality of specious claiming and meritless claims demonstrates a disconnect between the scholarship and the reality of the [[litigation]] that is nearly as wide as the disconnect between rates of disease claiming and actual disease manifestation".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Many of those who I see in my surgeries have worked in a number of workplaces and they could have been exposed to asbestos in each of them, but medical science is such that no one can identify which of them it is. As a result, there has been a long and complex history of legal discussion on how to apportion [[legal liability|liability]]. The lawyers and the judiciary have wrestled, rightly and valiantly, with complex and difficult law, but it has created despair for the families whom we represent. Many of my [[Electoral district|constituents]]’ families have been riven by the consequences of litigation in trying to get some compensation for a disease that has been contracted through no fault of theirs. That is cruel and unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060613/halltext/60613h0006.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 13 Jun 2006  (pt 0006)|first=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons,|last=Westminster|website=publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Regulation==
Worldwide, 60 countries (including those in the European Union) have banned  the use of asbestos, in whole or in part.&lt;ref name="industryweek1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industryweek.com/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=12093 |title=France Calls For Worldwide Asbestos Ban |publisher=IndustryWeek |date=2006-06-06 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some examples follow.

===International law===
Asbestos is listed as a category of controlled waste under Annex I of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal [1992]. Specifically, any waste streams having asbestos (dust and fibres) as constituents are controlled (Item Y36). In general terms, Parties to the Convention are required to prohibit and not permit the export of hazardous wastes to the Parties which have prohibited the import of such wastes via the notification procedure in Article 13 of the Convention.

===Australia===
A nationwide ban on importing and using all forms asbestos took effect on 31 December 2003.   Reflecting the ban, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC) revised asbestos-related material to promote a consistent approach to controlling exposure to workplace asbestos and to introduce best-practice health and safety measures for asbestos management, control and removal. The ban does not cover asbestos materials or products already in use at the time the ban was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nohsc.gov.au/NewsAndWhatsNew/MediaReleases/mr_AsbestosBan.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822030538/http://www.nohsc.gov.au/NewsAndWhatsNew/MediaReleases/mr_AsbestosBan.htm |archivedate=2006-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Australia has only a third of the UK's population, its asbestos disease fatalities approximate Britain's of more than 3,000 people per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Fickling in Sydney |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1288221,00.html |title=Dusty death: how asbestos hit Australia &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |date= 2004-08-22|accessdate=2010-09-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western Australia' center of blue asbestos mining was Wittenoom. The mine was run by [[CSR Limited]] (a company that had been the Colonial Sugar Refinery). The main manufacturer of asbestos products was [[James Hardie]], which set up a minor fund for its workers, then transferred operations to the Netherlands where it would be out of reach of the workers when the fund expired.

===Brazil===
The São Paulo State law 12.684/07 prohibits the use of any product which utilizes asbestos. This legislation has been formally upheld by the Brazilian [[Supremo Tribunal Federal]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

===Canada===
Since the 1980s, Canada has not permitted crocidolite asbestos to be used and has had limitations on certain uses of other types of asbestos, notably in some construction materials and textiles.

In late 2011, Canada's remaining two asbestos mines, both located in the [[Province of Quebec]], halted operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2011/11/24/asbestos-shutdown.html|title=Asbestos mining stops for first time in 130 years|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, Quebec's government announced a halt to asbestos mining&lt;ref&gt;[https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Quebec+Budget+Finance+Minister+Nicolas+Marceau+tightens/7586017/story.html Quebec Budget: Finance Minister Nicolas Marceau tightens spending, levies new taxes]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129012206/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Quebec%2BBudget%2BFinance%2BMinister%2BNicolas%2BMarceau%2Btightens/7586017/story.html |date=November 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the federal government announced that it would end its opposition to adding chrysotile asbestos to the list of hazardous substances under the international Rotterdam Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/09/14/montreal-canada-thetford-mines-asbestos.html|title=Canada won't oppose asbestos limits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
France banned the use of asbestos in 1997, and the WTO upheld France's right to the ban in 2000. In addition, France has called for a worldwide ban.&lt;ref name="industryweek1"/&gt;

===Hong Kong===
The import, shipment, supply of, and use of all forms of asbestos is banned in Hong Kong under the Air Pollution Control (Amendment) Ordinance 2014.&lt;ref name="occupantconvicted"&gt;{{cite news|title=Squatter hut occupant convicted for permitting use of asbestos cement sheets for roofing maintenance|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201803/27/P2018032700545.htm|work=Hong Kong Government|date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1980s, use of the material was common in construction, manufacturing, and shipping.

===India===
{{Cleanup section|reason=Needs proper references instead of inline links.|date=February 2018}}
The Vision Statement of the Environment and Human Health of The Government of India clearly states "''Alternatives to asbestos may be used to the extent possible and use of asbestos may be phased out.''"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.envfor.nic.in/sites/default/files/visenvhealth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In Case No.693/30/97-98, [[National Human Rights Commission of India|National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)]] has clearly directed to “''Replace all asbestos sheets roofing with roofing made up of some other material that would not be harmful to inmates''.”

The Secretary of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education &amp; Research (PGIMER, Chandigarh also voiced its opinion “''Asbestos is definitely a harmful material, it causes cancer and other related diseases''.” In their complete statement and recommendation to NHRC they have clearly expressed their concern: “''White Asbestos (Chrysotile Asbestos) is implicated in so many studies with the following diseases:-[[Mesothelioma]] (Cancer of Pleura), Lung Cancer, Peritoneal Cancer, Asbestosis, and is also considered as a cause for Ovarian Cancer, Laryngeal Cancer, Other Cancererous Diseases are produced in the person involved in Asbestos Industry''.” It concludes its position by specifying, “''Hence, Use of White Asbestos should be completely banned in India and the same may be replaced by some safer alternative material''.”

The Joint Secretary, Government of Uttarakhand in Case No.2951/30/0/2011, submitted to the NHRC that “''There is no cure for Asbestos Diseases. Stopping all exposure to Asbestos is only essential.''”

The Union Ministry of Labour’s concept paper declared, "''The Government of India is considering the ban on use of chrysotile asbestos in India to protect the workers and the general population against primary and secondary exposure to Chrysotile form of Asbestos."'' The Concept paper further notes, "''Asbestosis is yet another occupational disease of the Lungs which is on an increase under similar circumstances warranting concentrated efforts of all stake holders to evolve strategies to curb this menace''".

The Indian Factory Act and Bureau of Indian Standard already have rules and regulations for safe usage of asbestos contaminated products such as:

'''However, there is no enforcement of the rules at ground level, hence asbestos usage is prevalent without following even the simplest basic safety rules.'''

The Centre for Pollution Control Board (CPCB) struggles to enforce their own guidelines for Asbestos as Hazardous Waste and relies on Industries and Companies to volunteer themselves to follow Safety Regulations. 
[[File:Asbestos listed as Hazardous Waste.jpg|thumb|Factory displaying using asbestos and listing it under Hazardous as per CPCB guidelines.]]

There continues to be a high usage of friable or dust based asbestos in [http://www.championseals.in/CAF_Jointing_Sheets.php Compressed Asbestos Fibre (CAF) Gaskets], Ropes, Cloth, [http://www.championseals.in/mechanical_gland_packing.php Gland Packings], Millboards, Insulation and [http://hindcompo.com/products/industrial-roll-linings.htm Brake Liners] in Factories and Industries within India as well as inadvertently exported by Equipment Manufacturers without adequate knowledge and information to the other countries.

On 21 January 2011, the Supreme Court of India banned the usage of asbestos in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/darshanp1/supreme-court-of-india-judgement-on-asbestos|title=Supreme Court of India Judgement on Asbestos|first=|last=PGE India - PILOT Gaskets|date=29 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 2016, in the strongest statement till date, the Hon Mr. [[Anil Madhav Dave]], Union Minister of Environment, Forest &amp; Climate Change categorically specified “''Since the use of asbestos is affecting human health, its usage should gradually be minimised and ended.

===South Africa===
Asbestos was banned in South Africa in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/governance/health-services/asbestos-280308 |title=SA bans all use of asbestos |date=28 March 2008 |website=Brand South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the country was one of the global leaders in asbestos production, and consequently had one of the highest rates of mesothelioma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.asbestos.com/mesothelioma/south-africa/ |title=Mesothelioma in South Africa |last=Mauney |first=Matt |website=asbestos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations to ban [[asbestos]] in [[South Africa]] occurred in March 2008 under the leadership of Environmental Affairs and Tourism Minister [[Marthinus van Schalkwyk]]. The first draft regulations were announced in November 2005 for public comment and again in September 2007. The regulations prohibited the use,  processing, manufacturing, and import and export of any asbestos or asbestos-containing materials (ACMs). A grace period of 120 days was allowed to give people or traders currently dealing in asbestos or ACMs to clear their stock. Exemptions would be granted under strict control. The regulations did not prohibit the continued use of asbestos-containing materials that were already in place such as asbestos-cement roof sheets or ceilings, the department was satisfied that there was “no undue risk” and they would be replaced in due time. Penalties for the continued use of asbestos include a fine which would not exceed R100 000 and/or imprisonment of less than ten years. Prior to the regulations' implementation, asbestos had been in the process of being phased out from as early as 2003. Requests from [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Canada]] to be excepted from the prohibition were denied. South also terminated all import of asbestos or ACMs from Zimbabwe. South Africa would allow products to pass through its borders while in transit under strict conditions and if registered with the department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism. Everite, a building company, supported the government’s ban on imports from [[Zimbabwe]]&lt;ref&gt;https://mg.co.za/article/2008-03-27-its-official-asbestos-to-be-banned-in-sa Accessed 1 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.everite.co.za/EN/Content/Pages/Asbestos-Ban Accessed 1 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It became an offence to acquire, process, package or repackage, manufacture or distribute these products from after July 28, 2008.  Kgalagadi Relief Trust (KRT) chair Brian Gibson stated that [[asbestos]] may still be imported into South Africa for research or analysis. Asbestos may also be imported into the country for disposal from Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries that were unable to dispose of the waste themselves.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/asbestos-still-a-persistent-problem-in-south-africa-2008-10-31/rep_id:4136 Accessed 1 August&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===

In May 1997, the manufacture and use of [[crocidolite]] and [[amosite]], commonly known as blue and brown asbestos, were fully banned in [[South Korea]]. In January 2009, a full-fledged ban on all types of asbestos occurred when the government banned the manufacture, import, sale, storage, transport or use of asbestos or any substance containing more than 0.1% of asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hyoung Ryoul|title=Overview of Asbestos Issues in Korea|journal=J Korean Med Sci|date=12 June 2009|volume=24|series=3|pages=363–367|doi=10.3346/jkms.2009.24.3.363|pmid=19543418|pmc=2698178|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, South Korea became the world's sixth country to enact an asbestos harm aid act, which entitles any Korean citizen to free lifetime medical care as well as monthly income from the government if he or she is diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.joseilbo.com/html/news/?f%3Dread%26code%3D1327972365%26seq%3D2992 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402192750/http://health.joseilbo.com/html/news/?f=read&amp;code=1327972365&amp;seq=2992 |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In 1984, the import of raw amphibole (blue and brown) asbestos into New Zealand was banned. In 2002, the import of chrysotile (white) asbestos was banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/117-1205/1153/ Journal of the New Zealand Medical Association, 05-November-2004, Vol 117 No 1205] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022011642/https://nzma.org.nz/journal/117-1205/1153/ |date=2008-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]]'s [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) has promoted rigorous controls on [[asbestos]] handling, based on reports linking exposure to asbestos dust or fibres with thousands of annual deaths from mesothelioma and asbestos-related [[lung cancer]].
*"At least 4,000 people in Great Britain die each year from mesothelioma and asbestos-related lung cancer as a result of past exposure to asbestos. Annual numbers of deaths are predicted to go on rising into the next decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/asbestos.htm |title=Statistics - Asbestos related disease |publisher=Hse.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-09-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100926120045/http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/asbestos.htm| archivedate= 26 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HSE does not assume that any minimum threshold exists for exposure to asbestos below which a person is at zero risk of developing mesothelioma, since they consider that it cannot currently be quantified for practical purposes; they cite evidence from [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies of asbestos exposed groups to argue that even if any such threshold for mesothelioma does exist, it must be at a very low level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/asbfaq.htm |title=Statistics - Asbestos related disease |publisher=Hse.gov.uk |accessdate=2011-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030182149/http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/asbfaq.htm |archivedate=2011-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously it was possible to claim compensation for [[pleural disease|pleural plaques]] caused by negligent exposure to asbestos, on the grounds that although it is in itself asymptomatic, it is linked to development of diffuse pleural thickening, which causes lung impairment.  It has been highly contentious, however, as to the probability of pleural plaques developing into pleural thickening or other asbestos-related illnesses. On October 17, 2007 this point was clarified by the [[Law Lords]]' ruling that workers who have pleural plaques as a result of asbestos exposure will no longer be able to seek compensation as it does not in itself constitute a disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/news/wales-news/2007/10/18/asbestos-workers-lose-right-to-claim-91466-19970287/ |title=WalesOnline - News - Wales News - Asbestos workers lose right to claim |publisher=Icwales.icnetwork.co.uk |date=2007-10-18 |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725060838/http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/news/wales-news/2007/10/18/asbestos-workers-lose-right-to-claim-91466-19970287/ |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling was, however, superseded, so far as sufferers of pleural plaques in Scotland are concerned, by the passing of the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions)(Scotland) Act 2009, which provides that in Scots law pleural plaques are to be considered an actionable type of personal injury.

The Control of Asbestos Regulations were introduced in the UK in November 2006 and are an amalgamation of three previous sets of legislation (Asbestos Prohibition, Asbestos Licensing and the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations) aimed at minimising the use and disturbance of asbestos containing materials within British workplaces. Essentially this legislation bans the import and use of most asbestos products and sets out guidelines on how best to manage those currently in situ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si2006/20062739.htm |title=The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2011-07-04 |accessdate=2011-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724161112/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20062739.htm |archivedate=2010-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutyholders of all non-domestic properties within the UK must establish an asbestos register and a management plan.  The definition of "non-domestic" is "a property or structure (commercial, domestic or residential) where work is carried out" the obligation of the dutyholder is that such operatives are not exposed to any asbestos-based materials during the course of the work, the Asbestos Register states the presence or non-presence of asbestos related to the inside and outside of the structure.  The exception is where the property age (post-1999 when chrysotile asbestos was banned) would indicate that such products will not have been used during the construction of the building.

The removal of high-risk asbestos products from non-domestic properties is tightly controlled by the HSE and high-risk products such as thermal insulation must be removed under controlled conditions by licensed contractors. Further guidance on which products this applies to can be found on the HSE website along with a list of licensees.

The Control of Asbestos Regulations were amended and came into force on 6 April 2012 to take account of the European Commission's view that the UK had not fully implemented the EU Directive on exposure to asbestos (Directive 2009/148/EC).  These changes were relatively minor and included additional requirements for non-licensed asbestos work.  These changes mean that some non-licensed asbestos work now requires notification, and has additional requirements for managing this work (e.g. record keeping and health surveillance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/regulations.htm |title=Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Asbestos and the law (United States)}}
According to the [[Environmental Working Group]] Action Fund, 10,000 people die each year from asbestos-caused diseases in the United States, including one out of every 125 American men who die over the age of 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/facts/fact1.php |title=The Asbestos Epidemic in America |publisher=EWG |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Environmental Protection Agency ([[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]) has no general ban on the use of asbestos. However, asbestos was one of the first hazardous [[Air pollution|air pollutants]] regulated under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act of 1970, and many applications have been forbidden by the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA). The United States has extensive laws regulating the use of asbestos at the federal, state, and local level.

==Litigation==
One of the major issues relating to asbestos in civil procedure is the latency of asbestos-related diseases. Most countries have limitation periods to bar actions that are taken long after the cause of action has lapsed. For example, in Malaysia the time period to file a tort action is six years from the time the tort occurred. Due to several asbestos-related actions, countries such as Australia have amended their laws relating to limitations to accumulate starting from time of discovery rather than time when the cause of action accrued.

[[Guardian Unlimited]] reported a test-case ruling in 2005, that allowed thousands of workers to be compensated for [[pleural]] plaques. Diffuse or localised fibrosis of the pleura, or pleural plaques, is less serious than asbestosis or mesothelioma, but is also considered a disease closely linked to the inhalation of asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/research/success/en/med/0281e.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, insurers claimed the plaques are "simply a marker for asbestos exposure rather than an injury." Mr Justice Holland rejected the insurers' arguments, and counsel for workers hailed the decision as a "victory that puts people before profits." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1415567,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Workers win test case in asbestos claim | first=Clare | last=Dyer | date=February 16, 2005 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal. On 17 October 2007, the House of Lords confirmed the Court of Appeal's decision. Pleural plaques no longer constitute actionable injury in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  The Scottish government introduced legislation in 2009 to preserve the status of pleural plaques as an actionable injury in Scotland&lt;ref&gt;Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Act 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and there are proposals to introduce similar legislation in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) Bill ( Northern Ireland) 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Insurance companies allege that asbestos litigation has taken too heavy a toll on insurance and industry.  A 2002 article in the British ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'''s associate quoted Equitas,  the  reinsurance vehicle which assumed Lloyd's of London's liabilities, which argued that asbestos claims were the "greatest single threat" to [[Lloyd's of London]]'s existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunne|first1=Helen|title=Equitas warns on asbestosis|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2765983/Equitas-warns-on-asbestosis.html|accessdate=18 November 2017|publisher=The Telegraph|date=22 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of note is that Lloyd's of London had been sued for fraud by its investors, who claimed Lloyd's misrepresented pending losses from asbestos claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/658834.stm | work=BBC News | title=Names take Lloyd's to court | date=February 28, 2000 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006,  the House of Lords ruled that compensation for asbestos injuries should be reduced where responsibility could not be attached to a single employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4768057.stm | work=BBC News | title=Asbestos pay-out fight continues | date=May 13, 2006 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics, including trade unions, asbestos groups and Jim Wallace, former justice minister, have condemned the ruling. They said it overturned the traditional Scottish law  to such cases, and was a breach of natural justice. As a result of this outcry, the ruling has been overturned by section three of the [[Compensation Act 2006]].

In February 2010 a court ruling set a new precedent for [[asbestosis]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1193282_wigan_widow_wins_landmark_legal_ruling_on_asbestos_case |title = Wigan widow wins landmark legal ruling on asbestos case |accessdate = 2010-02-03 |date = 20 February 2010 | publisher = Manchester Evening News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case, in which widow Della Sabin attempted to claim compensation following her husband's death from asbestosis, hinged on the issue of how many asbestos fibres must be present in the lungs for a claim to be valid. A research team based at Llandough Hospital initially reported that the minimum amount of fibres that needed to be present for a claim to be valid was 20 million (only 7 million were found in the sample taken from Mrs Sabin's husband Leslie). However, a subsequent US study suggested that, due to the fact that Leslie had lived for more than forty years after his exposure, a large number of fibres would have cleared from his body naturally; had he died twenty years earlier the asbestos count in his lungs would have been about 35 million fibres per gram. The judge preferred this evidence, and ruled in favour of Mrs Sabin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crook|first1=Amanda|title=Wigan widow wins landmark legal ruling on asbestos case|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/wigan-widow-wins-landmark-legal-883567|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=Greater Manchester News|date=20 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relief Trusts====
In 2006, [[Cape plc]] started a trust to compensate those who have suffered from asbestos related diseases as a result of Cape’s historical activities.  To date, this Trust has paid out over £30m to those who have become sick or to their dependents. The Scheme of Arrangement was approved by the High Court and is separately funded. Its funds being administered by two independent trustees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capeplc.com/corporate-responsibility/asbestos-scheme-of-arrangement.aspx Accessed 2 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Asbestos Relief Trust (ART) is regarded as a model of efficient occupational disease compensation in South Africa.  Gencor was a major contributor to the Richard Meeran-run Cape Plc case and the Richard Spoor-run Gencor case. Glencor provided 29% of the R138 million that went to the Cape Plc’s set of claimants, and 96% of the R381 million that formed the ART. An additional sum of R35 million went to environmental rehabilitation, and about R20 million was added to the ART to contribute to supplementary and additional payments. After some time and publicity claims against The Cape Plc list had grown from 2 000 in January 1999 and to 7 500 in August 2001.  The ART settlement was open, and made provision for compensation to any person who met the compensation criteria set out in the Trust deed, until the year 2028.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Scott GI, teWaterNaude JM.

The Trust provides compensation for people in these four categories related to [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARD) namely:

*(ARD1)- asbestosis / pleural thickening with mild to moderate
*(ARD2) -lung function impairment or with severe lung function impairment
*(ARD3) -asbestos-related lung cancer

A model by the ART estimated that about 16 800 individuals would submit claims to the Trust, of which approximately 5 036 (30%) would be successful. This was subsequently revised to 5 162. Of these, 219 (4.2%) would be environmental claimants, 150 (2.9%) would have lung cancer and 556 (10.8%) would have mesothelioma; the balance would have asbestosis and/or pleural thickening.

These amounts are paid over and above any compensation that the claimants might receive under the ODMWA. In order for a case to be compensable, a victim needs to show that he/she was both exposed to asbestos from one of the operations run by the funders of the ART, and has a compensable disease.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A lack of facilities for terminally ill mesothelioma sufferers results in a larger burden of service, according to Sister Phemelo Magabanyane, a palliative care nurse who has cared for over 100 mesothelioma and lung cancer sufferers in the greater [[Kuruman]] district in the [[Northern Cape]]. Mesothelioma is a life-threatening cancer of the [[pleura]] or [[peritoneum]] which can be diagnosed up to 40 years after exposure to asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Gibson.

Since September 2016, five of the 1 600 claimants he represents in the Northern Cape have died. Internationally renowned photographer [[David Goldblatt]] started photographing victims after a friend died of mesothelioma despite never being in close proximity to a mine.

===United States===
{{main | Asbestos and the law (United States)}}
Asbestos litigation is the longest, most expensive mass tort in U.S. history, involving more than 8,000 defendants and 700,000 claimants.&lt;ref name="pointoflaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointoflaw.com/asbestos/overview.php |title=Asbestos |publisher=PointofLaw.com |date=2004-05-21 |accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current trends indicate that the rate at which people are diagnosed with the disease will likely increase through the next decade. Analysts have estimated that the total costs of asbestos litigation in the USA alone will eventually reach $200 to $275 billion. The amounts and method of allocating compensation have been the source of many court cases, and government attempts at resolution of existing and future cases.

In June 1982,  a retired boilermaker, James Cavett, won a record award of $2.3 million compensatory and $1.5 million in punitive damages against Johns-Manville.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;  The Manville Corporation, formerly the [[Johns Manville|Johns-Manville]] Corporation,  filed for reorganization and protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code in August 1982.   At the time, it was the largest company ever to file bankruptcy, and was one of the richest. Manville was then 181st on the [[Fortune 500]], but was the defendant of 16,500 lawsuits related to the health effects of asbestos.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; The company was described by [[Ron Motley]], a South Carolina attorney, as "the greatest corporate mass murderer in history." Court documents show that the corporation had a long history of hiding evidence of the ill effects of asbestos from its workers and the public.  One of many examples is a memo from Manville's medical director to corporate headquarters:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/printerfriendly.php |title=Asbestos |publisher=EWG |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608074844/http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/printerfriendly.php |archivedate=June 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1990s, "more than half of the 25 largest asbestos manufacturers in the US, including Amatex, Carey-Canada, Celotex, [[Eagle-Picher]], Forty-Eight Insulations, Manville Corporation, [[National Gypsum]], Standard Insulation, Unarco, and [[Rohn Industries|UNR Industries]] had declared bankruptcy. Filing for bankruptcy protects a company from its creditors."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

Asbestos-related cases increased significantly on the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] [[docket (court)|docket]] after 1980.  The court has dealt with several asbestos-related cases since 1986. Two large [[class action]] settlements, designed to limit liability, came before the court in 1997 and 1999.  Both settlements were ultimately rejected by the court because they would exclude future claimants, or those who later developed asbestos-related illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-270.ZO.html |title=Amchem Products, Inc. v.

Fibreboard Corp |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rulings addressed the 20-50 year latency period of serious asbestos-related illnesses.

In 1988, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)]] issued regulations requiring certain U.S. companies to report the asbestos used in their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/2607|title=15 U.S. Code § 2607 - Reporting and retention of information|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several legislative remedies have been considered by the U.S. Congress but each time rejected for a variety of reasons.  In 2005, Congress considered but did not pass legislation entitled the "Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005".  The act would have established a $140 billion trust fund in lieu of litigation, but as it would have proactively taken funds held in reserve by bankruptcy trusts, manufacturers and insurance companies, it was not widely supported either by victims or corporations.

On April 26, 2005, Dr. [[Philip J. Landrigan]], professor and chair of the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine at [[Mount Sinai Medical Center]] in New York City, testified before the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary against this proposed legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimony of Dr. Philip Landrigan|url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Landrigan%20Testimony%20042605.pdf|website=Senate Judiciary Committee|publisher=U.S. Senate|accessdate=28 July 2017|date=26 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He testified that many of the bill's provisions were unsupported by medicine and would unfairly exclude a large number of people who had become ill or died from asbestos: "The approach to the diagnosis of disease caused by asbestos that is set forth in this bill is not consistent with the diagnostic criteria established by the American Thoracic Society. If the bill is to deliver on its promise of fairness, these criteria will need to be revised."  Also opposing the bill were the American Public Health Association and the Asbestos Workers' Union.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/05/senate-judiciary-committee-wants.php |title=JURIST - Paper Chase: Senate Judiciary Committee wants sickest asbestos victims compensated fastest |publisher=Jurist.law.pitt.edu |date=2005-05-12 |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111103453/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/05/senate-judiciary-committee-wants.php |archivedate=2011-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2006, the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] approved an amendment to the act which would have allowed victims of [[mesothelioma]] $1.1M within 30 days of their claim's approval.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; This version would have also expanded eligible claimants to people exposed to asbestos from the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, and to construction debris in hurricanes Katrina and Rita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C06%5C12%5Cstory_12-6-2006_pg6_25 |title=Leading News Resource of Pakistan |publisher=Daily Times |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606141046/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C06%5C12%5Cstory_12-6-2006_pg6_25 |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the bill's reliance on funding from private entities large and small, as well as debate over a [[sunset provision]] and the impact on the U.S. budgetary process caused the bill to fail to leave committee.

Since the bankruptcy filing of Johns-Manville in 1984, many U.S. and U.K. asbestos manufacturers have escaped litigation by filing bankruptcy.  Once in bankruptcy, these companies typically are required to fund special "bankruptcy trusts" that pay pennies on the dollar to injured parties.  However, these trusts do permit larger numbers of claimants to receive some kind of compensation, even if greatly reduced from potential recoveries in the tort system.

Since 2002, asbestos lawsuits in the U.S. have included the following as defendants: (1) manufacturers of machinery that are alleged to have required asbestos-containing parts to function properly; (2) owners of premises at which asbestos-containing products were installed (which includes virtually anyone who owned a building prior to 1980); (3) banks that financed ships or buildings where asbestos was installed (on the grounds that no rational lender would take a [[security interest]] in an asset without studying the risks involved); (4) retailers of asbestos-containing products (including hardware, home improvement and automotive parts stores); (5) corporations that allegedly conspired with asbestos manufacturers to deliberately conceal the dangers of asbestos (e.g., [[MetLife]], a well-known insurance company which worked with [[Johns-Manville]]); (6) manufacturers of tools which were used to cut or shape asbestos-containing parts; and (7) manufacturers of respiratory protective equipment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Defendants in the first category have contested liability on the grounds that nearly all of them either did not ship asbestos-containing parts with their products at all (that is, asbestos was installed only by end users) or did not sell replacement parts for their own products (in cases where the plaintiff was allegedly exposed well after any factory-original asbestos-containing parts would have been replaced), and either way cannot be responsible for toxic third-party parts that they did not manufacture, distribute, or sell.   In 2008, the [[Washington Supreme Court]], the first  to reach the issue, decided in favor of the defense.&lt;ref&gt;''Braaten v. Saberhagen Holdings'', 165 Wn.2d 373, 198 P.3d 493 (2008) and ''Simonetta v. Viad Corp.'', 165 Wn.2d 341, 197 P.3d 127 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; On January 12, 2012, the [[Supreme Court of California]] also decided in favor of the defense in ''O'Neil v. Crane Co.''&lt;ref&gt;''O'Neil v. Crane Co.'', 53 Cal.4th 335, 135 Cal. Rptr. 3d 288, 266 P.3d 987 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  This is significant as a 2007 study found that California and Washington were the two most influential state supreme courts in the United States in the period from 1940 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Jake Dear and Edward W. Jessen, ''" Followed Rates" and Leading State Cases, 1940-2005'', &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;[http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/41/2/essay/DavisVol41No2_Dear.pdf 41 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 683, 694]&lt;/span&gt;(2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a decision from January 2014, [[Gray v. Garlock Sealing Technologies]] had entered into bankruptcy proceedings, and discovery in the case uncovered evidence of fraud &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legalnewsline.com/issues/asbestos/247203-defense-attorney-says-filing-bankruptcy-trust-claims-after-trial-verdicts-is-issue-in-asbestos-litigation|title=Defense attorney: Judges should look for asbestos claims fraud|first=Heather Isringhausen|last=Gvillo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that led to a reduction in estimated future liability to a tenth of what was estimated.

Another area of dispute remains the so-called [[chrysotile]]-defense.  Manufacturers of some products containing only [[chrysotile]] fibers claim that these are not as harmful as [[amphibole]]-containing products.  As 95% of the products used in the United States historically were mostly chrysotile, this claim is widely disputed by health officials and medical professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Straif K.

====Criminal prosecutions====

=====Adamo Wrecking Company=====
On February 20, 1973 a federal grand jury in [[Detroit, Michigan]] indicted Adamo Wrecking Company ("Adamo") for violating provisions of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] by knowingly causing the emission of asbestos by failure to wet and remove friable asbestos materials from demolitions.&lt;ref&gt;1987–1988 Preview of U.S. Sup. Ct. Cas. 1 Issue 3, September 19, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Adamo was one of a number of demolition contractors indicted throughout the country for the alleged violation of the Clean Air Act. The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]] dismissed the criminal indictment on the ground that it was not an "emission standard," but a "work practice standard," which under the terms of the statute, did not carry criminal liability.&lt;ref&gt;''National Resources Journal'', vol. 18, p. 677.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government appealed and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] reversed the decision of the trial court, stating that it erred in determining that it had jurisdiction to review the validity of the standard in a criminal proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;''Environmental Law Reporter'', 7 ELR 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adamo's attorneys appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;"Summary of Actions by Supreme Court on Various Cases", ''New York Times'', April 5, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 1978, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Adamo when it held that the trial court did have jurisdiction to review the standard in a criminal proceeding and also agreed with the trial court that the requirements in the act were "not standards" but "procedures" and therefore the proceedings were properly dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', January 11, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Environmental Law Reporter'', 8 ELR 20171.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====W. R. Grace and Company=====
A federal [[grand jury]] indicted [[W. R. Grace and Company]] and seven top executives on February 5, 2005, for its operations of a [[vermiculite]] mine in [[Libby, Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewg.org/reports/lungcancer/wrgrace.php|title=EWG.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The indictment accused Grace of [[wire fraud]], knowing endangerment of residents by concealing air monitoring results, obstruction of justice by interfering with an [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) investigation, violation of the Clean Air Act, providing asbestos materials to schools and local residents, and conspiracy to release asbestos and cover up health problems from asbestos contamination. The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] said 1,200 residents had developed asbestos-related diseases and some had died, and there could be many more injuries and deaths.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/|title=Page Not Found - Baltimore Sun|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/manufacturing/2005-02-08-grace-asbestos_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Indictment charges W.R. Grace over asbestos|website=www.usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. R. Grace and Company]] faced fines of up to $280 million for polluting the town of [[Libby, Montana]].  Libby was declared a [[Superfund]] disaster area in 2002, and the EPA has spent $54 million in cleanup.  Grace was ordered by a court to reimburse the EPA for cleanup costs, but the bankruptcy court must approve any payments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

On June 8, 2006, a federal judge dismissed the [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charge of "knowing endangerment" because some of the defendant officials had left the company before the five-year statute of limitations had begun to run. The wire fraud charge was dropped by prosecutors in March.{{when|what year?|date=March 2014}}

====Abatement cases====
[[File:AsbestosContainment.JPG|right|thumb|275px|Old [[Wailuku]] [[Post Office]] sealed off for asbestos removal.]]
Asbestos abatement (removal of asbestos) has become a thriving industry in the United States.  Strict removal and disposal laws have been enacted to protect the public from airborne asbestos. The Clean Air Act requires that asbestos be wetted during removal and strictly contained, and that workers wear safety gear and masks. The federal government has prosecuted dozens of violations of the act and violations of [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) related to the operations.  Often these involve contractors who hire undocumented workers without proper training or protection to illegally remove asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/24/nyregion/father-and-son-get-long-terms-in-defective-asbestos-removal.html Father and Son Get Long Terms In Defective Asbestos Removal"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 24, 2004. Retrieved April 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 1998, three men were indicted in a conspiracy to use homeless men for illegal asbestos removal from an aging Wisconsin manufacturing plant. Then-US Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] said, "Knowingly removing asbestos improperly is criminal.  Exploiting the homeless to do this work is cruel."{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

On December 12, 2004, owners of New York asbestos abatement companies were sentenced to the longest federal jail sentences for environmental crimes in U.S. history, after they were convicted on 18 counts of conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act and the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]], and actual violations of the Clean Air Act and Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The crimes involved a 10-year scheme to illegally remove asbestos. The RICO counts included obstruction of justice, money laundering, mail fraud and bid rigging, all related to the asbestos cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/b1ab9f485b098972852562e7004dc686/324c5937dc68015a85256f7e0076a213!OpenDocument |title=12/23/2004: Father and Son Sentenced to Longest U.S. Jail Terms for Environmental Crimes |publisher=Yosemite.epa.gov |date=2004-12-23 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 2006, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., two of its employees, and a contractor were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges that they violated safety standards while removing asbestos from pipes in [[Lemon Grove, California]]. The defendants were charged with five counts of conspiracy, violating asbestos work practice standards and [[making false statements]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2449">The '''Baxter Althane disaster''' in autumn 2001 was a series of 53 sudden deaths of [[renal failure]] patients in Spain, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia and the USA (mainly Nebraska and Texas). All had received hospital treatment with Althane [[hemodialysis]] equipment, a product range manufactured by [[Baxter International]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baxter Dialyzer Recall|url=http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BI108/BI108_2007_Groups/group05/pages/baxter.html|work=Major Recalls of Organ Replacement Devices|accessdate=12 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012151427/http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BI108/BI108_2007_Groups/group05/pages/baxter.html|archivedate=12 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baxter Faces Suit On Dialysis Deaths|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/business/baxter-faces-suit-on-dialysis-deaths.html|accessdate=12 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 14, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although official investigations initially found no link between the cases, Baxter Co. eventually published its own findings, admitting that a perfluorohydrocarbon-based cleaning fluid was not properly removed from the tubings during manufacture. Baxter also announced discontinuation and permanent recall of all Althane equipment. Families of most non-US victims were compensated by Baxter voluntarily, while US plaintiffs settled via a [[class action lawsuit]]. The company continues to manufacture dialysis machines of a newer design.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Other Sources of Safety Certification==

===CRSP (Canadian Registered Safety Professional)===

Similar to the CSP in the US, Canada offers the CRSP (Canadian Registered Safety Professional) designation, through the [[Board of Canadian Registered Safety Professionals]]

''' Pre-Requisite:'''

Applicants must meet some prerequisites prior to submitting a formal application:

# Educational Pursuits:  Must have minimally completed high school. By 2009, this requirement will change to college or university education in health and safety.
# Past Work Experience:  Must have at least three years of continuous work experience in the Occupational and Environmental Health &amp; Safety field
# Current Employment: Must include greater than 50% (over 900 hours/year), in Occupational and Environmental Health &amp; Safety activities.

''' Registration Process:'''

1. Application:  Once the applicant has met the prerequisites, they must complete the "Application for Canadian Registered Safety Professional Designation", obtained from the BCRSP board.  The lengthy application requires a compilation of all the applicant’s course and job descriptions.

2. Evaluation:  The BCRSP Board reviews the application.  The applicant is then advised if they meet the minimum requirements or not.  If the application is accepted, then the applicant is advised that they will soon be contacted for an interview.

3. Interview: The interview is set up with a member of the BCRSP’s Regional Screening Centre personnel in the applicant’s geographical area.  It’s an informal meeting, where the applicant’s work and educational Occupational Health &amp; Safety experience are discussed.

4. Examination:  The applicant has to write a comprehensive 3.5 hour multiple choice exam that covers Accident Theory, Environmental Practices, Ergonomics, Fire Prevention and Protection, Health Promotion, HSE Auditing, Law and Ethics, Occupational Health Safety and Environment Systems, Occupational Hygiene, Risk Management, and Safety Techniques and Technology.  Study guides and books are recommended by the Board, and numerous preparatory courses are available through:
::* [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]]
::* [[Canadian Society of Safety Engineering]]
::* [[Institute of Quality, Safety and Environmental Management]]
::* [[Raising the Standard Consulting]]
::* [[Faculty of Extension University of Alberta]]

4. Approval:  If the applicant minimally achieves the passing score on the examination, they receive notification of such.

5. Confirmation:  The applicant revives the CRSP Designation along with their designation registration number.

 
''' Career Development:'''

In Order to maintain a professional safety designation continuing education is often required with most designations.  To be  in good standing with the certification body, continuing education units (CEU) or professional developmental conferences (PDC) must be completed within a designated time frame and approved by the certification body.  Some provincial trade associations and safety associations have their industry designations such as:
::* (NCSO) [[National Construction Safety Officer ]]
::* (HSA) [[Health and Safety Administrator ]]
::* (HSP) [[Health and safety Professional]]
::* (CHSC) [[Certified Health and Safety Consultant]]
::* (CHSMSA) [[Certified Health and Safety Management Systems Auditor]]
::* (QSR)  [[Qualified Safety Professional]]

===Safety Certification in Europe===

Internationally, other countries have set up similar programs. In the UK the highest professional standing is that of a chartered safety and health practitioner or fellow of IIRSM. The standards are maintained by both the UK’s largest body for safety professionals [[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health]] (IOSH) and also the [[International Institute of Risk and Safety Management]] (IIRSM). Like North American safety professional programs, to achieve these grades the applicant must be professionally qualified and have relevant experience. Continuing professional development (CPD) is also a strong requirement of both memberships. [[International Institute of Risk and Safety Management|IIRSM]] also offer [[Recognised Safety Professional]] (not to be confused with 'registered safety practitioners' of OSHCR) these honorary post nominal letters given by IIRSM to recognised safety practitioners.

'''Circle of Health International''', known as COHI for short, is a US based [[non-governmental organization]] founded in 2004 with the mission to work with women and their communities with a community based approach in times of crisis. As of 2016, COHI has responded to eighteen humanitarian emergencies and served over three million women globally. COHI has worked with [[Midwife|midwives]] and [[public health]] professionals in [[Sri Lanka]], [[Louisiana]], [[Tibet]], [[Tanzania]], [[Israel]], the [[Philippines]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Sudan]], [[Haiti]], and [[Afghanistan]].

As of 2016 COHI supports [[Maternal health|maternal]] and [[child health]] clinics in Haiti, midwives in an indigenous women's forum in Nicaragua, midwifery students and [[sexual health]] advocates in [[Nepal]], a clinic for [[refugee]]s in the [[Rio Grande Valley]] on the Mexico/US border, and works with survivors of [[human trafficking]] globally. COHI is also engaged in Austin's [[social enterprise]] community through a program, known as the COHI Cloth Network, to address women's [[poverty]] through income generation initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This Foundation Is Improving Maternal Health Worldwide, One Birth At A Time|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2015/12/98629/circle-of-health-international-psa|website=Refinery29.com|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How U.S. moms can help celebrate International Women's Day|url=http://www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/1075897/international-womens-day-how-you-can-reach-moms-across-the-globe|date=8 March 2015|website=Sheknows.com|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sera Bonds helps refugee women get the care they need|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/sera-bonds-helps-refugee-women-get-the-care-they-need|website=Msnbc.com|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missions==
=== Tibet ===
In 2004, COHI partnered with a local host organization, Tibetan Healing Fund, in Tongren, also known as Repkong, Eastern Tibet to aid with the training of midwives in order to create a more sustainable maternal health care system.

=== Israel/West Bank ===
In 2004, COHI and their partners worked with Israeli and Palestinian woman to address midwifery and gender based violence (GBV). Conducted an assessment based on three main categories

# To produce a substantial GBV ethnography of the region;
# To design and implement specialized programming targeting the cultural nuances of each group; and
# Coalition-building among Israeli and Palestinian organizations to implement relevant projects in partnership with local women's rights organizations.

The assessment included in depth interviews and recommendations for each sector of Israel and the West Bank's diverse populations: religious and secular Jews, immigrant populations (Ethiopian, Russian, Congolese), the Bedouin, and the Palestinian populations of Israel and the West Bank, both Muslim and Christian

The results from the assessment were used to advocate for the needs of Israeli and Palestinian women such as better postpartum care.

The '''Compensation scheme for radiation-linked diseases''' is a workers compensation scheme administered by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]]. It was established in November 1982 by [[British Nuclear Fuels Ltd|British Nuclear Fuels Limited]] and its [[Trade union|trade unions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=shCh5KzE7xEC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=%22compensation+scheme+for+radiation+linked+diseases%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ay7uRDDnnA&amp;sig=bHI_Fkk4rUc8nrJO_z454mgC10E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj6uWFjcPRAhUBTJQKHeIbBFkQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22compensation%20scheme%20for%20radiation%20linked%20diseases%22&amp;f=false|title=The Redfern Inquiry into human tissue analysis in UK nuclear facilities|last=|first=|date=2010-11-16|publisher=The Stationery Office|year=|isbn=9780102966183|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; following legal actions brought against the company by nuclear industry workers in the late 1970s. At the time of its establishment, BNFL and its trade unions agreed that the causation of cancer by radiation was sufficiently well understood that "it should be possible to construct a scheme which would evaluate the probability that a diagnosed cancer may have been caused by radiation exposure at work." Initially the scheme only accepted claims in which a worker had died from a radiation-linked disease. In 1987 this was expanded to allow [[Disease|morbidity]] claims.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/scheme_history.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Scheme history|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of participating member employers and trade unions has grown through the 1990s and 2000s. As of December 2015, 1525 claims have been made out of which 156 have been successful.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/annual_statement.php|title=CSRLD: 2015 Compensation Scheme Annual Statement|last=|first=|date=2015-12-01|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eligibility ==
In order to be eligible for compensation, a worker must have been employed by a listed company, and have received an occupational radiation dose. Then the claimant must have developed [[cancer]] of the [[Bladder cancer|bladder]], [[Bone Cancer|bone]], [[Brain cancer|brain]] and central nervous system, [[Breast cancer|breast]] or [[Uterine cancer|uterus]] (for female workers), [[Colorectal cancer|colon]], [[Liver cancer|liver]], [[Esophageal cancer|oesophagus]], respiratory or [[Lung cancer|lung]], prostate, [[Ovarian cancer|ovary]], skin (non-Melanoma), [[Thyroid cancer|thyroid]] or other tissues. Other compensable diseases include [[Cataract|cataracts]] and [[Leukemia|leukaemias]] (with two exceptions). Some diseases are excluded on the basis that there is no convincing epidemiological evidence to link them with ionising radiation exposure. Excluded diseases include: [[Hodgkin's lymphoma|Hodgkin’s disease]], [[Hairy cell leukemia|hairy cell leukaemia]], [[Chronic lymphatic leukemia|chronic lymphatic leukaemia]] (CLL), [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]] and [[mesothelioma]].

=== Member Trade Unions ===
In 1982, trade union members of the scheme included [[Transport and General Workers' Union|Transport and General Workers Union]], [[Institution of Professional Civil Servants]], [[Amalgamated Engineering Union]], [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] and PCS. Other trades unions joined as the scheme expanded. Later members include the [[Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union|EETPU]] and [[Manufacturing Science Finance|MSF]], [[Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians|UCATT]], [[Engineers and Managers Association]], [[UNISON|Unison]], the [[First Division Association]] of Civil Servants, the AEA Constabulary Federation (now the Civil Nuclear Police Federation) and the [[Defence Police Federation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/scheme_employers.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Scheme employers|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claiming compensation ==
Claims may be lodged by the worker, his or her wife, husband or partner (including same sex), the worker's "first line children" (those born to or legally adopted by the claimant). Once diagnosed with or deceased from an eligible disease, the worker or surviving family members have 30 years in which to make a claim. Claims can be made online, by post, by phone or through the worker's trade union. Once made, claims are assessed on consideration of medical, employment and dosimetry histories and data. These are used to calculate the probability that the cancer could have been caused by occupational exposure to radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/qa.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Q &amp; A|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Payments ==
The payment received following a successful claim varies depending on the actual loss (in earnings and pension) suffered by the claimant and sums for pain and suffering, loss of amenity and number of dependents. The level of payment awarded to a claimant (or estate if deceased) is determined by the "causation probability". The greater the causation probability, the greater the payment. Top tier payments are awarded if the causation probability is 50% or more. The Scheme publishes an Annual statement which is approved by the Scheme Council. The report includes a paragraph updating the number of claims and payments awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/case_processing.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Case Processing|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 22 February 2005, 1000 claims had been made, of which 97 had been awarded to varying degrees along a sliding scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=oxqdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT152&amp;lpg=PT152&amp;dq=%22compensation+scheme+for+radiation+linked+diseases%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sCtN2E6adQ&amp;sig=0MUeAJ5xKrJx-EFVDn_13BMYhEI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj6uWFjcPRAhUBTJQKHeIbBFkQ6AEIRzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22compensation%20scheme%20for%20radiation%20linked%20diseases%22&amp;f=false|title=Assessment of the Scientific Information for the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|date=2005-10-01|publisher=National Academies Press|year=|isbn=9780309096102|location=|pages=137|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2015, 1525 cases had been considered since the compensation scheme for radiation-linked diseases was established. 156 of these claims were successful, and payments totaling £8.24 million had been dispatched.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Degreasing''', often called '''defatting''' or '''fat trimming''', is the removal of fatty acids from an object. In [[culinary]] science, degreasing is done with the intention of reducing the [[fat]] content of a [[meal]].

==Degreasing food==
Degreasing is often used by [[dieting|diet]]ers, particularly those following low-fat diets to reduce their fat consumption to induce weight loss.  The energy content of 1 g of fat is 9 [[calories]], while that of [[carbohydrates]] and [[proteins]] are 4 calories.  Hence, dieters often view decreasing fat consumption as an efficient way of losing weight without greatly sacrificing total volume of food.  Degreasing during meal preparation is used to reduce the energy content of the food being prepared, and degreasing of a prepared food is also often used in social situations where one may have to consume restaurant food which is rich in fat.

Those people who wish to reduce their cholesterol level or fat intake, in particular people with [[hypercholesterolemia]] often use degreasing to reduce their fat consumption.

=== Degreasing of a meal during preparation ===
Fat trimming of a meal can be done during preparation by a variety of methods.  The most common methods involving substituting food items or removal of naturally occurring fat and conservative addition of fat.

Substituting fats is a method in which a certain ingredient is substituted by another ingredient.  A common way of doing this is substituting saturated [[fatty acids]] with unsaturated fatty acids while cooking.  For instance, olive oil can be used instead of butter for seasoning vegetables.

Food items are also substituted to reduce fat content.  For instance, instead of using eggs by using a whole egg, where the egg yolks are high in fat levels, egg whites can instead be used.  Alternatively, [[skimmed milk]] or similar low-fat products can be used as ingredients for [[cooking]].

===Degreasing liquids===
[[File:Degreasing soup.jpg|thumb|right|260px|(''Frozen soup with a layer of fat shown above'') Cooling provides an easy way to degrease food as the fat rises to the surface and solidifies fully.]]

Many different foods can be degreased after preparation. Liquid foods that are high in fat, such as [[braising]] liquids, [[roasting]] juices and [[broth]]s may have floating oil on top throughout and after the cooking process. Fat can be skimmed off the liquid with a small [[ladle (spoon)|ladle]], spoon, or cup as the liquid [[simmer]]s and then discarded. This is done by placing the saucepan with only half of it on the heat source so that the liquid simmers only on one side. This pushes the fat to the opposite side and makes it easier to lift off with the ladle. The fat can then be skimmed off by holding the ladle so that the top of its bowl is almost level with the liquid and then tilting it slightly and in a circular motion toward the edge of the saucepan where the fat accumulates.&lt;ref name='wiley'&gt;{{Cite book | year=2002 | title = Glorious French Food: A Fresh Approach to the Classics | author1=James Peterson | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | isbn=978-0-471-44276-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWSVpBheCnYC&amp;pg=PT46&amp;dq=degreasing+food | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As braising liquids and broths simmer, they typically throw off more fat and protein and sometimes froth, so it is easier to wait at least a few minutes until the liquid has cooled before degreasing. In making slowly reduced liquids it may be ideal to wait for it to cool even longer.&lt;ref name='wiley' /&gt; 

As an alternative to a ladle, a [[degreasing cup]] can be used to skim the fat off hot liquids. This is a clear plastic or glass cup that looks similar to a [[teapot]], with a spout that comes out of the bottom. The liquid and juices are poured into the cup then poured out leaving the fat behind; the liquid comes from the bottom of the cup instead of the top. Degreasing cups come in various sizes.&lt;ref name='wiley' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newitalianrecipes.com/cooking-terms.html | title = Cooking Terms | accessdate = 2010-08-04 | publisher = New Italian Recipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Refrigerating or freezing liquids until the fat congeals and solidifies can make the fat easier to remove with a spoon. If, after removing the congealed fat, the liquid still appears cloudy, it can be made clearer by skimming it again with a ladle after bringing it to a gentle simmer to allow for the release of more fat and insoluble proteins.&lt;ref name='wiley' /&gt;

===Degreasing solid food items===
Some items, such as roasted foods, and other cooked food items, such as pizza, can sometimes be oily and greasy. Degreasing them after preparation may provide a solution to this problem. Fried foods, such as [[French fries]], can often be degreased without decreasing the crispiness of the food item by simply blotting out the oil in the food item with a [[tissue paper]].

==Commercial degreasing==
Many food manufacturing companies such as [[Weight Watchers]] have been developed for people who wish to reduce their fat intake.  The customer need of defatting has also led to the production of low fat products, e.g., low fat cheese.

==Solvent degreasing==
{{Main| Solvent degreasing}}

Solvent degreasing is a process used to prepare a part for further operations such as [[electroplating]] or [[paint]]ing.  Typically it uses [[petroleum]], [[chlorine]], or [[alcohol]] based [[solvent]]s to dissolve the [[machining]] fluids and other contaminants that might be on the part.&lt;ref&gt;Kalpakjian, Serope, Schmid, Steven R. (2006). Manufacturing Engineering and Technology. 5th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall. 1079.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}An '''employee assistance program''' (EAP) is an [[employee benefit]] program that assists employees with personal problems and/or work-related problems that may impact their [[job performance]], [[health]], mental and emotional [[well-being]]. EAPs generally offer free and confidential assessments, short-term counseling, referrals, and follow-up services for employees and their household members. EAP counselors also work in a consultative role with managers and supervisors to address employee and organizational challenges and needs.  Many corporations, academic institution and/or government agencies are active in helping organizations prevent and cope with workplace violence, trauma, and other emergency response situations. There is a variety of support programs offered for employees.   Even though EAPs are mainly aimed at work-related problems, there are a variety of programs that can assist with problems outside of the workplace. EAPs have grown over the years, and are more desirable economically and socially.

== History ==

=== Early formation ===
EAPs have been traced back to the late 1930s, and were formed out of programs that dealt with occupational alcoholism. During a time when drinking on the job was the norm, people began to notice the effects it had on job performance and productivity. This became a major issue for industrial jobs and would become the main focus for correction with job-based alcoholism programs. By 1939, the [[Alcoholics Anonymous|Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)]] movement had begun to spread throughout the Midwestern and Northeastern United States.&lt;ref name="Richard, Hutchinson 2009"&gt;(Richard, Hutchinson, Emener, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; People in “recovery" began to eagerly share their experiences with other workers. This would be the start of the EAP movement. Businesses also started to see the effectiveness of the programs through the rehabilitation of their workers and the rise of productivity. These improvements sparked the thought of what other types of problems this program could address.

=== Taking shape ===
In 1962, The Kemper Group introduced a program to address alcoholic rehabilitation and later expanded the program to address the needs of the families of their employees as well.  Including the families broaden the programs services to deal with marital, emotional, financial, legal, and drug abuse problems.&lt;ref name="Richard, Hutchinson 2009"/&gt; In 1969, Senator Harold Hughes would introduce a bill called The Hughes Act. Sen. Hughes felt that there was a great lack of federal and state involvement in the treatment of alcoholism. In 1970, Congress would pass the [http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/about-niaaa/our-work/history-niaaa Federal Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention Treatment and Rehabilitation Act] creating the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism|National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA)]]. States would then soon begin to follow suit and denounce public intoxication and began treating alcoholism as a disease. The [http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/ NIAAA] priority would be to begin researching and treating alcoholism. They were also focused on providing states with grants to hire and train EAP specialist.

In the 1970s, the Occupational Alcoholism Bureau formed by the [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence|National Council on Alcoholism (NCA)]] and the Association of Labor and Management Administrators and Consultants on Alcoholism (ALMACA) helped to spread EAP concepts. They did this by distributing information, giving conferences and seminars, increasing the knowledge of professionals and the community. A number of treatment centers would also grow after the passing of the Hughes Act. These centers have EAP specialist on site to help in the rehabilitation processes. It is not known the exact amount of treatment centers in the United States.

=== Economic crisis cutbacks ===
Employee Assistance Programs would see a significant shift during the economic crisis of the 1980s. During this time, the government was forced to create cutbacks for programs. This would cause for mental health public agencies, treatment centers, and private counseling firms to survive by partnering with industry wanting to enter the EAP field. This though would also cause the effectiveness of the programs to come into question. The cutbacks began to affect the training of the EAP specialist and their effectiveness. The situations of workers also began to change at this time. People were also having to wait in lines, and were having to search for work due to the crisis.

=== Post September 11 ===
In most recent years, the services provided by EAPs have changed in their direction. With events occurring nationally and around the world has caused for EAPs to rise and the need for them greater in the United States. EAPs have also been affected by technology, terrorism attacks, natural disasters, disabilities act, and workplace violence.&lt;ref name="Richard, Hutchinson 2009"/&gt; Since the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], EAP specialists have become more involved in incident debriefing and implementing plans during emergencies &lt;ref&gt;(Richard, Hutchinson, Emener, 2009 &amp; Masi 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Providers began to report more on the workforce experiencing [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)]], and an increase in stress and depression.&lt;ref&gt;(Richard, Hutchinson, Emener, 2009 &amp; Masi 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The continued threat of terrorism, people are reporting that they are more anxious about the thought of an attack occurring again.

== Benefits ==

Some studies indicate that offering EAPs may result in various benefits for employers, including lower medical costs, reduced turnover and absenteeism, and higher employee productivity.&lt;ref name="Hargrave"&gt;[http://www.choixdecarriere.com/pdf/6573/2010/HargraveHiattAlexanderShaffer2008.pdf EAP Treatment Impact on Presenteeism and Absenteeism: Implications for Return on Investment, Hargrave et Al.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Attridge"&gt;[http://www.easna.org/documents/EASNAResearchNotesNo10ValueModelMAY2010102209.pdf EAP Effectiveness and ROI, Attridge et Al.]&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of these studies question the scientific validity of their findings, noting small sample sizes, lack of experimental control groups, and lack of standardized measures as primary concerns. Proponents, however, argue that the consistency of positive findings across studies in different service sectors denote at least some positive effect of programs, even if the most effective components of such programs have not been determined.&lt;ref name="Attridge" /&gt; EAPs may also provide other services to employers, such as supervisory consultations, support to troubled work teams, training and education programs, and critical incident services.

The provision of employee assistance services has established business benefits, including increased productivity of employees (termed "presenteeism") and decreased [[absenteeism]].&lt;ref name="Hargrave" /&gt; Employees typically have access to an EAP hotline 24 hours a day, so there is no need to wait to seek assistance. If an appointment with a medical professional or counselor is necessary, the employee can arrange to see one in just a few days. Because the employee can call anytime, they do not have to worry about calling from a work phone. You may also be able to minimize the cost of your health insurance plan, because employees can use the EAP to ward off stress-related illnesses, meaning fewer trips to the doctor.

Small businesses can especially benefit from EAP programs.  Even though they may have fewer employees and may not see the need to implement an EAP program, small business owner's bottom line can suffer quicker due to decreased performance and productivity and workplace negativity.  A small company could be severely damaged if they do not seek effective measure to rectify such issues.  An employer that provides an effective, full-service EAP can help both themselves and employees by lowering risk and liability, improving employee satisfaction, and especially decreasing the stress small business owners experience when managing numerous responsibilities with little support.&lt;ref name="Fully Effective Employees"&gt;[http://fee-eap.com/why-should-a-small-business-have-an-eap/.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benefits.org|Benefits]] of EAP are:
* Direct Access: Employees call the psychologist's office directly.
* Quick Response: The first counseling session occurs within a few days, and a crisis is dealt with immediately.
* Professional: Counselors have earned a master's or doctorate in psychology or counseling, and are experts in human behavior.
* Confidentiality: The employer never knows who uses the service.
* Off-Site: Counseling takes place at the Psychologist's office.
* Direct Treatment: Referrals are made only when the patient requires another specialist or long-term care.
* Appropriate Coverage: 24 hours a day hot-line with offices in towns and cities in which employees are located

== Service ==
Employees and their household members may use EAPs to help manage issues in their personal lives. EAP counselors typically provide assessment, support, and referrals to additional resources such as counselors for a limited number of program-paid counseling sessions. The issues for which EAPs provide support vary, but examples include:
* [[substance abuse]]
* [[occupational stress]]
* [[Stress (medicine)|emotional distress]]
* major life events, including births, accidents and deaths
* [[health care]] concerns
* financial or non-work-related legal concerns
* family/personal relationship issues
* work relationship issues
* concerns about aging parents

An EAP's services are usually free to the employee and their household members, having been prepaid by the employer.  In most cases, an employer contracts with a third-party company to manage its EAP.  Some of these companies rely upon other vendors or contracted employees for specialized services to supplement their own services, such as: financial advisors, attorneys, travel agents, elder/child care specialists, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Ann D.|date=2015|title=Quality EAPs Carry Their Weight|url=|journal=Benefit Magazine 52|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Confidentiality]] is maintained in accordance with [[privacy laws]] and [[ethical standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/guidance-materials-for-consumers/index.html|title=Your Rights Under HIPAA|last=(OCR)|first=Office for Civil Rights|date=2008-05-07|work=HHS.gov|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.amstat.org/cpc/lawsregulations|title=Laws &amp; Regulations   - Committee on Privacy and Confidentiality|website=community.amstat.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, California requires EAP providers who deliver actual counseling services on a pre-paid basis for more than 3 sessions within any six-month period to have a Knox-Keene license. This is a specialty license for psychological services and is mandated by the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975. The state's Department of Managed Health Care regulates these licensed plans and assists consumers with regard to grievances, access to quality care, and ensuring that the EAP has an appropriate level of tangible net equity to deliver services to plan members. Title 28, Rule 1300.43.14 of the California Code of Regulations allows EAPs without a Knox-Keene license to request an exemption if they solely refer callers to external services and do not provide the actual services themselves.

Each Federal Executive Branch agency has an Employee Assistance Program (EAP).  An EAP is a voluntary, confidential program that helps employees (including management) work through various life challenges that may adversely affect job performance, health, and personal well-being to optimize an organization's success.  EAP services include assessments, counseling, and referrals for additional services to employees with personal and/or work-related concerns, such as stress, financial issues, legal issues, family problems, office conflicts, and alcohol and substance abuse.  EAPs also often work with management and supervisors providing advanced planning for situations, such as organizational changes, legal considerations, emergency planning, and response to unique traumatic events. EAP’s can reap benefits for agencies, employees, families and communities. Some of those aspects that we will be focusing on are: the improvement of productivity and employee engagement, improving employees’ and dependents’ abilities to successfully respond to challenges, developing employee and manager competencies in managing workplace stress, reducing workplace absenteeism and unplanned absences, supporting employees and managers during workforce restructuring, reduction-in-forces, or other workforce change events, reducing workplace accidents, reducing the likelihood of workplace violence or other safety risks, supporting disaster and emergency preparedness, managing the effect of disruptive incidents, such as workplace, injury, or other crises,facilitating safe, timely, and effective return-to-work for employees short-term and extended absences, reducing healthcare costs associated with stress, depression, and other mental health issues, reducing employee turnover and related replacement costs.

== Military/veterans ==
There are a variety of employee assistance programs in the military, ranging from financial assistance programs, family counseling, depression, and transitional assistance programs.  One of the largest military employee assistance organizations is [https://www.militaryonesourceeap.org Military One Source]. Military One Source offers both services directly to service members and their families, but can also help send people to places in the community if there is a specific need.  If someone is in need of assistance and is: an active duty service member, family member of a service member, a veteran, or family member of a veteran, they can find additional information about the assistance programs offered by Military One Source on their website.

In the last couple decades military employee assistance programs have expanded greatly.  What started as alcohol assistance programs has grown to help people with financial issues, physical health, family health, and since 2000 mental health programs have expanded rapidly as more has become known about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and [[Traumatic brain injury|Traumatic Brain Injuries]] (TBI).  There are several programs for families, and increasing assistance for dual military families, families in which both spouses are active duty military, as they have grown dramatically in number.  Financial programs have been expanded as well, as payday loan establishments grew in popularity in the 2000s; and as a result, debt among military members has grown as well.  The [[Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society]] (NMCRS), is a program started by military members to help other members that have fallen into debt, and has expanded to also help service members reach educational goals.  This society has helped many service members, as a service member can borrow up to 300 dollars without a reason, and more with a valid reason for either no interest or low interest depending on how much and how long they borrow for. The Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society has helped many members of the military when unforeseen problems arise.  More information on the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society can be found at: [http://www.nmcrs.org www.nmcrs.org].

One of the largest veteran employee assistance programs is the Veterans Affairs (VA).  The VA provides a variety of services to veterans including: health care, education assistance, transitional housing assistance, mental health, financial assistance, women veterans assistance, and career search assistance.  The Veteran Affairs is a nationwide system that offers their services to all veterans who attained any discharge other than dishonorable.  More information on Veterans Affairs can be found at: [http://www.va.gov www.va.gov].

[[File:Fall protection allows his men to go home at the end of the day.webm|thumb|A video on the value of fall protection measures]]
'''Fall protection''' is the use of controls designed to protect personnel from [[Falling (accident)|falling]] or in the event they do fall, to stop them without causing severe injury. Typically, fall protection is implemented when working at height, but may be relevant when working near any edge, such as near a pit or hole, or performing work on a steep surface.

There are four generally accepted categories of fall protection: fall elimination, fall prevention, [[fall arrest]] and administrative controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=J. Nigel|title=Introduction to fall protection|date=2011|publisher=[[American Society of Safety Engineers]]|isbn=9781885581587|page=28|edition=4th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the US Department of Labor, falls account for 8% of all work-related trauma injuries leading to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bickrest|first1=Ed|title=Fall Protection: Failure is Not an Option|url=http://ehstoday.com/ppe/fall-protection/falls-remain-occupational-hazard-0309|website=EHS Today|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal statutes, standards and regulations in the United States pertaining to the requirements for employers to provide fall protection are administered by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duty to have fall protection. 1926.501|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10757|website=Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration|publisher=United States Dept. of Labor|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Falls in the workplace ==
Falls from elevations were the fourth leading cause of workplace death from 1980 through 1994, with an average of 540 deaths per year accounting for 10% of all occupational fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2000-116/|title=Worker Deaths by Falls: A Summary of Surveillance Findings and Investigative Case Reports|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|page=xi|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falls are a concern for oil and gas workers, many of whom must work high on a [[derrick]].  A study of falls over the period 2005–2014 found that in 86% of fatal falls studied, fall protection was required by regulation, but it was not used, was used improperly, or the equipment failed.  Many of the fatalities were because, although the workers were wearing harnesses, they neglected to attach them to an anchor point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mason|first=Krystal L.|last2=Retzer|first2=Kyla D.|last3=Hill|first3=Ryan|last4=Lincoln|first4=Jennifer M.|date=2017-01-01|title=Occupational Fatalities Resulting from Falls in the Oil and Gas Extraction Industry, United States, 2005–2014|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6616a2.htm|journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]|language=en-us|volume=66|issue=16|pages=417–421|doi=10.15585/mmwr.mm6616a2|issn=0149-2195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of fall protection ==
In most work-at-height environments, multiple fall protection measures are used concurrently.

=== Fall elimination ===
Fall [[Hazard elimination|elimination]] is often the preferred way of providing fall protection.  This entails finding ways of completing tasks without working at heights.

=== Fall prevention ===
{{main|Fall prevention}}
* Fall guarding is the use of guard rails or other barricades to prevent a person from falling. These barricades are placed near an edge where a fall-hazard can occur, or to surround a weak surface (such as a skylight on a roof) which may break when stepped on.
* Fall restraint is a class of [[personal protective equipment]] to prevent persons who are in a fall hazard area from falling, e.g., fall restraint lanyards. Typically, fall restraint will physically prevent a worker from approaching an edge.

=== Fall arrest ===
{{main article|Fall arrest}}
Fall arrest is the form of fall protection that stops a person who has fallen.

=== Administrative controls ===
[[Administrative controls]] are used along with other measures, but they do not physically prevent a worker from going over an edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fall Protection|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10758|website=United States Department of Labor|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of administrative controls include placing a safety observer or warning line near an edge, or enforcing a safety policy which trains workers and requires them to adhere to other fall protection measures, or prohibiting any un-restrained worker from approaching an edge.

A '''folk healer''' is an unlicensed person who practices the art of healing using [[traditional medicine|traditional practices]], [[herbal medicine|herbal remedies]] and even the [[power of suggestion]]. A folk healer may be a highly trained person who pursues their specialties, learning by study, observation and imitation. In some cultures a healer might be considered to be a person who has inherited the "gift" of healing from his or her parent. The ability to set bones or the power to stop bleeding may be thought of as hereditary powers.

==Granny women==
'''Granny women''' are purported to be [[Traditional medicine|healers]] and [[midwife|midwives]] in Southern [[Appalachia]] and the [[Ozarks]], claimed by a few academics as practicing from the 1880s to the 1930s. They are theorized to be usually elder women in the community and may have been the only practitioners of [[health care]] in the poor rural areas of Southern Appalachia. They are often thought to not have expected or received payment, and were respected as authorities on herbal healing and childbirth.  They are mentioned by [[John C. Campbell]] in ''The Southern Highlander and His Homeland'':&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;
{{quote|There is something magnificent in many of the older women with their stern theology – part mysticism, part fatalism – and their deep understanding of life.  ..."Granny" – and one may be a grandmother young in the mountains – if she has survived the labor and tribulation of her younger days, has gained a freedom and a place of irresponsible authority in the home hardly rivaled by the men of the family.  ...Though superstitious she has a fund of common sense, and she is a shrewd judge of character.  In sickness she is the first to be consulted, for she is generally something of an herb doctor, and her advice is sought by the young people of half the countryside in all things from a love affair to putting a new web in the loom.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;John C. Campbell, ''The Southern Highlander and his Homeland'', Russell Sage foundation, 1921, pg. 140. https://archive.org/details/southernhighland00camp&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==White witch==

{{expert}}

'''White witch''' and '''good witch''' are qualifying terms in [[English language|English]] used to distinguish practitioners of [[folk magic]] for benevolent purposes (i.e. [[white magic]]) from practitioners of malevolent [[witchcraft]] or [[black magic]].&lt;ref&gt;"There were a number of interchangeable terms for these practitioners, 'white', 'good', or 'unbinding' witches, blessers, wizards, sorcerers, however 'cunning-man' and 'wise-man' were the most frequent." Macfarlane 1970 p. 130; also Appendix 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Related terms are "[[cunning-folk]]", "[[witch doctor]]", and the French ''devins-guérisseurs'',  "seer-healers".

During the [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|witch trials]] of Early Modern Europe, many practitioners of folk magic who did not see themselves as witches, but as healers or seers, were convicted of witchcraft ([[Éva Pócs]]' "sorcerer witches"): many English "witches" convicted of consorting with demons seem to have been cunning folk whose [[fairy]] [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s had been demonised,&lt;ref&gt;Emma Wilby 2005 p. 123; See also Alan Macfarlane 1970 p. 127 who notes how 'white witches' could later be accused as 'black witches'.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monter () ''Witchcraft in France and Switzerland''. Ch. 7: "White versus Black Witchcraft"&lt;/ref&gt; and over half the accused witches in Hungary seem to have been healers.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the healers and diviners historically accused of witchcraft have considered themselves mediators between the mundane and spiritual worlds, roughly equivalent to [[shamanism|shamans]].&lt;ref&gt;As defined by [[Mircea Eliade]] in ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Pantheon Books, NY NY 1964, pp.3-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Such people described their contacts with fairies, spirits, or the dead, often involving out-of-body experiences and travelling through the realms of an "other-world".&lt;ref name="Ginzburg 1990 Part 2, Ch. 1"&gt;Ginzburg (1990) Part 2, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Beliefs of this nature are implied in the folklore of much of Europe, and were explicitly described by accused witches in central and southern Europe. Repeated themes include participation in processions of the dead or large feasts, often presided over by a female divinity who teaches magic and gives prophecies; and participation in battles against evil spirits, "vampires", or "witches" to win fertility and prosperity for the community.&lt;ref name="Ginzburg 1990 Part 2, Ch. 1" /&gt;

===Popular culture===
* Sir [[Walter Scott]] spoke of a "white witch" in his novel ''[[Kenilworth (novel)|Kenilworth]]'' (1821)
* The "white witch" [[Glinda]] is the Good Witch in [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|film]] based on it.
* [[C. S. Lewis|C.S. Lewis]] inverted the image of "white" witchcraft as "good" in his children's book series ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', naming one of his primary villains [[White Witch|The White Witch]], although this may be more a reference to her power over snow and winter.
* [[Terry Pratchett]] featured white witches as protagonists in many of his [[Discworld]] novels. He also depicted them as [[fairy godmother]]s and de facto royal wizards (despite their gender).
* The third season of ''[[American Horror Story]]'', subtitled "[[American Horror Story: Coven|Coven]]", uses the term for [[Stevie Nicks]] as Misty Day describes her as one.
*In the second season of ''[[Outlander (TV series)|Outlander]]'', protagonist Claire Fraser is given the name "La Dame Blanche" (or "The White Woman") by the people of 18th-century Paris. She professes to be a [[White Witch]] and practitioner of [[white magic]] in the episode "Faith".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14408">Modern understanding of disease is very different from the way it was understood in ancient Greece and Rome. The way modern physicians approach healing of the sick differs greatly from the methods used by early general healers or elite physicians like Hippocrates or Galen. In modern medicine, the understanding of disease stems from the “germ theory of disease”, a concept that emerged in the second half of the 19th century, such that a disease is the result of an invasion of a microorganism into a living host. Therefore, when a person becomes ill, modern treatments “target” the specific pathogen or bacterium in order to “beat” or “kill” the disease. In Ancient Greece and Rome, disease was literally understood as dis-ease, or physical imbalance. Medical intervention, therefore, was purposed with goal of restoration of harmony rather than waging a war against disease.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkins|first1=John|title=Food in Antiquity|date=1995|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=0-85989-418-5|page=345|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgery was regarded by Greek and Roman physicians as extreme and damaging while prevention was seen as the crucial first step to healing almost all ailments. In both prevention and treatment of disease in classical medicine, food and diet was central. The eating of correctly-balanced foods made up the majority of preventative treatment as well as to restore harmony to the body after it encountered disease.

== Food and Diet in Ancient Greece ==

=== Humours and Causes of Disease ===
Ancient Greek Medicine is described as rational, ethical and based upon observation, conscious learning and experience. Superstition and religious dogmatism are often excluded from descriptions of ancient Greek medicine. It is important, however, to note that this rational approach to medicine did not always exist in the ancient Greek medical world, nor was it the only popular method of healing. Along with rational Greek medicine, disease was also thought of as being of supernatural origin, resulting from the unhappiness of the gods or from demonic possession. Exorcists and religious healers were among the ‘doctors’ that patients sought out when they became ill. Sacrifices, exorcisms, spells and prayers were then carried out in order to reconcile with the gods and restore health to the patient. It was not until the time of [[Hippocrates]], between 450 and 350 BC, that rational, observation and the humoral theory of medicine began to become highly influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nutton|first1=Vivian|title=Healing and the healing act in Classical Greece|journal=European Review|date=1999|volume=7|issue=1|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of the humours or “[[Humorism]]” understood the human body to be composed of fluid (humours) and regarded disease as a result of an imbalance of the four humors: yellow bile, black bile, phlegm and blood.[[File:Humorism.svg|thumb|The four humours and their qualities]] These humours contain qualities such as hot, cool, moist, dry, etc., which must also remain in balance.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity" /&gt;{{rp|337}} Foods can be heating, cooling, or generative of one humour. Some foods produce good juices and others bad juices and often times cooking and preparation of the foods can change or improve the juices of the foods. In addition, foods may be easy to assimilate (easy to pass through the body), easily excreted, nourishing or not nourishing.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity" /&gt;{{rp|338}}  In Hippocratic medicine, the qualities in foods are analogous to the four humors in the body: too much of a single one is bad, a proper mixture is ideal.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity" /&gt;{{rp|347}} Therefore, the consumption of correctly-balanced foods and life-style of the patient was crucial to the prevention and treatment of disease in Ancient Greece.

This brings us to the way in which [[seasonal food]] played an important role in the treatment of ancient disease. According to the Hippocratic author of “Airs, Waters and Places” (there remains debate as to whether Hippocrates himself wrote the Hippocratic Corpus), it is important that a physician learn astronomy because, “the changes of the seasons produce changes in diseases,”.&lt;ref name=Hippocratic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=edited with an introduction by G.E.R. Lloyd ; translated [from the Greek] by J.|last2=al.]|first2=W.N. Mann ... [et|title=Hippocratic writings|date=1983|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|isbn=0-14-044451-3|page=149|edition=[New] ed., with additional material, Repr. in Penguin classics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same Hippocratic text, the author goes on to explain that villages facing east and that are exposed to winds from the north-east, south-east and west tended to be healthy and, “The climate in such a district may be compared with the spring in that there are no extremes of heat and cold. As a consequence, diseases in such a district are few and not severe,”.&lt;ref name="Hippocratic" /&gt;{{rp|151}} As an example of the importance of seasonal food on maintaining balance of the humours and preventing disease is given by Hippocrates in “On Regimen” when the authors state that, “in winter, to secure a dry and hot body it is better to eat wheaten bread, roast meat, and few vegetables; whereas in summer it is appropriate to eat barley cake, barley meat and softer foods,” (qtd. in Wilkins et al., p.&amp;nbsp;346).

=== Food and Diet in the Hippocratic Aphorisms ===
Food and diet feature prominently in the aphorisms of the Hippocratic Corpus. For example, in one aphorism in the first section, Hippocrates states, “Things which are growing have the greatest natural warmth and, accordingly, need most nourishment. Failing this the body becomes exhausted. Old men have little warmth and they need little food which produces warmth; too much only extinguishes the warmth they have. For this reason, fevers are not so acute in old people for then the body is cold”.&lt;ref name="Hippocratic" /&gt;{{rp|208}} Another aphorism says, “It is better to be full of drink than full of food”.&lt;ref name="Hippocratic" /&gt;{{rp|209}} And finally, an aphorism that generally sums up treatment of disease in Hippocratic times states, “Disease which results from over-eating is cured by fasting; disease following fasting, by a surfeit. So with other things; cures may be effected by opposites,”.&lt;ref name="Hippocratic" /&gt;{{rp|210}} This concept of treating diseases opposite to the way it manifests in the individual is concept that is carried over into Roman medicine.

=== Gout in Ancient Greece ===
[[Gout]] was called podagra in ancient Greek medicine and is a common arthritis caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals within the joints.&lt;ref name=Gritzalis&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gritzalis|first1=Konstantinos C.|title=Gout in the Writings of Eminent Ancient Greek and Byzantine Physicians|journal=Acta med-hist Adriat|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gout usually affects the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe and later the other joints of the feet and hands. Hippocrates considered gout to be the result of an accumulation of one of the body humours that distended the joint and caused pain.&lt;ref name=Gout&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Roy|last2=Rousseau|first2=G.S.|title=Gout: The Patrician Malady|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-08274-6|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippocrates also believed gout to be a result from sexual excess or too rich a diet as alluded to in three of his aphorisms “Eunuchs do not take the gout nor become bald”, “A woman does not take the gout unless her menses has stopped”, and “A young man does not take the gout until he indulges coitus”.&lt;ref name="Gritzalis" /&gt;{{rp|84}}&lt;ref name="Gout" /&gt;{{rp|14–15}} As with other diseases, physicians in antiquity believed that diet was the best way to manage gout. Hippocrates recommended high doses of white hellebore because he believed that the best and most natural relief for gout was dysentery.&lt;ref name="Gritzalis" /&gt;{{rp|85}} However, purging with white hellebore was probably for the more chronic cases due to the fact that wine and barleywater drinks were very strongly recommended.&lt;ref name="Gout" /&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

=== Legumes in Ancient Greece ===
The importance of legumes in ancient Greek diet and medical practice is often disregarded. However, legumes improved the quality of the soil and were considered very important to the agriculturalists of the time. Additionally, legumes contain a high amount of albumen, which led them to be a critical dietary supplement in countries where meat was in short supply and difficult to store. Such was the case with Greece. People in the Graeco-Roman world consumed less meat than we do today and therefore, legumes were a necessary source of protein.&lt;ref name="Legumes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flint-Hamilton|first1=Kimberly B.|title=Legumes in Ancient Greece and Rome: Food, Medicine, or Poison?|journal=Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens|date=1999|volume=68|issue=3|page=374|jstor=148493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all legumes, the [[lentil]] [[File:Illustration Lens culinaris0.jpg|thumb|The lentil plant]] appears most frequently in Greek and Roman literature. Medicinally, Hippocrates recommends lentils as a remedy for ulcers and hemorrhoids.&lt;ref name="Legumes" /&gt;{{rp|376}} Bitter vetch, or [[Vicia ervilia]], was also an important legume in ancient Greek medicine. The extensive medicinal qualities of the bitter vetch were thought reliable enough to later administer to Roman emperors such as [[Augustus]].&lt;ref name="Legumes" /&gt;{{rp|379}} Bitter vetch was thought to heal pimples, prevent sores from spreading and soothe spots or sores when they appear on the breasts. It was also reported to relieve painful urination, flatulence, liver problems, and indigestion when roasted and mixed with honey and Hippocrates cautioned that when eaten boiled or raw, the consumption of bitter vetch may cause more flatulence or pain.&lt;ref name="Legumes" /&gt;{{rp|379}}

== Food and Diet in Ancient Rome ==

=== Humours, Anatomy and the Causes of Disease ===
At the heart of Roman Medicine and central to the development of Western Medicine is [[Galen]] [[File:Galenus.jpg|thumb|The Eminent Galen of Pergamum]]of Pergamum (AD 129–c. AD 210).&lt;ref name=WMT&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Lawrence I.|title=The Western medical tradition, 800 BC to AD 1800|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-47564-3|pages=58–70|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galen was a prolific writer from whose surviving works comes what Galen believed to be the definitive guide to a healthy diet, based on the theory of the four humours.&lt;ref name="Galen on Food"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Mark|title=Galen on Food and DIet|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-23232-5|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galen understood the humoral theory in a dynamic sense rather than static sense such that yellow bile is hot and dry like fire; black bile is dry and cold like earth; phlegm is cold and moist like water; and blood is moist and hot.&lt;ref name="A History of Medicine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prioreschi|first1=Plinio|title=A History of Medicine: Roman medicine|date=1998|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|isbn=978-1-888456-03-5|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also understood the humours to be produced by food through digestion and it is with digestion, and respiration, that Galen applies his knowledge of anatomy. According to Galen, digestion begins in the mouth because this where food comes into contact with the saliva. The chewed food is then pulled into the stomach where the heat of the stomach cooks the food into chyle. The chyle is then carried to the liver where the nutrients are converted to blood and transported throughout the body,.&lt;ref name="A History of Medicine" /&gt;{{rp|420–421}} With this understanding of the humours as being dynamic, and his knowledge of anatomy, Galen was able to categorize illnesses as hot, cold, dry or moist and attribute the causes of these illnesses to specific types of foods. For example, in Galen’s own “On the Causes of Disease”, as cited by Mark Grant, Galen says when describing hot diseases that, “[one cause of excessive heat] lies in foods that have hot and harsh powers, such as garlic, leeks, onions, and so on. Immoderate use of these foods sometimes sparks a fever,”.&lt;ref name="Galen on Food" /&gt;{{rp|48}} Galen believed that a good physician must also be a good cook.&lt;ref name="Galen on Food" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Therefore, in Galen’s dietary treatise “On the Powers of Foods”, recipes are often given in addition to descriptions of foods as being salty or sweet, sour or watery, difficult or easy to digest, costive or laxative, cooling or heating, etc. Galen insists that the balance of the four humours can be beneficially or adversely effected by ‘diet’ which in Galenic medicine includes not just food and drink but also physical exercise, baths, massage, and climate&lt;ref name="selected works"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singer|first1=P.N|title=Galen selected works|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=England|isbn=978-0-19-158627-9 |page=X|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;scope=site&amp;db=nlebk&amp;db=nlabk&amp;AN=12310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food and the Treatment of Disease in Ancient Rome ===
As mentioned, certain types of food can affect the balance of the humours in different ways. According to Galen’s “On Humours,” as referenced by Wilkins et al., beef, camel, and goat meat, snails, cabbage, and soft cheeses produce black bile; brains, fungi, and hard apples cause phlegm; bitter almonds and garlic reduce phlegm.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity" /&gt;{{rp|377}} Additionally, for the treatment of gout, Galen suggested a range of dressings to be applied to the affected area made of mandrake, caper, and henbane and for the acute phase, creams made of seeds of conium, mushroom, and deer brain were administered.&lt;ref name="Gritzalis" /&gt;{{rp|86}}

'''Global Oncology''' (GO) is an [[United States|American]] academic community-based healthcare organization. The organization was established at [[Harvard University]] in 2012.

== Background ==
Global Oncology was founded in 2012, by Ami S. Bhatt and Franklin W. Huang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/profiles/profile/person/54250 |title=Ami Bhatt &amp;#124; Harvard Catalyst Profiles &amp;#124; Harvard Catalyst |publisher=Connects.catalyst.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/profiles/profile/person/44526 |title=Franklin Huang &amp;#124; Harvard Catalyst Profiles &amp;#124; Harvard Catalyst |publisher=Connects.catalyst.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is composed of physicians, staff, students, and members of the oncology community and other skilled professional volunteers. The mission of the organization is to improve cancer care and research in resource-limited settings through a variety of programs and efforts, including the development of training and research opportunities in global oncology. The organization supports the efforts of other leading organizations working in global oncology and cancer care including the [[Global Task Force on Expanded Access to Cancer Care and Control in Developing Countries]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The steering committee that advises the organization is composed of academic and faculty experts in cancer care and oncology drawn from Harvard-affiliated institutions and hospitals, including [[Harvard medical school|Harvard Medical School]], [[Harvard School of Public Health]], [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], [[Children's Hospital Boston]], [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]], and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Programming ==
A primary effort of GO has been the creation of the GO! Talks, a unique bi-monthly Global Oncology seminar series that seeks to educate the larger community on global oncology issues and catalyze collaborations in the field. Speakers to date have included [[Paul Farmer]] and Eric Krakauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/ftcc/2012/10/22/paul-farmer-lecture-on-global-oncology-111-at-dana-farber/ |title=Paul Farmer Lecture on Global Oncology 11/1/12 at Dana-Farber » Center for Future Technologies in Cancer Care &amp;#124; Blog Archive &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Global Oncology  developed a first-of-its-kind Global Cancer Project Map that launched in 2015 as a resource for the global cancer community to identify projects and needs in global cancer work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/biotech/2015/03/global-cancer-project-map-stanford-global-oncology.html?page=all |title='Cancer map' looks for global matches for research, care |publisher=San Francisco Business Times |date=2015-03-25 |accessdate=2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''glucosinolates''' are natural components of many [[pungency|pungent]] plants such as [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[cabbage]], and [[horseradish]]. The pungency of those plants is due to [[mustard oil]]s produced from glucosinolates when the plant material is chewed, cut, or otherwise damaged. These natural chemicals most likely contribute to plant defence against pests and [[Plant disease resistance|diseases]], and impart a characteristic [[bitter (taste)|bitter]] flavor property of [[cruciferous vegetables]].&lt;ref name="ishida"&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=4031110|year=2014|last1=Ishida|first1=M|title=Glucosinolate metabolism, functionality and breeding for the improvement of Brassicaceae vegetables|journal=Breeding Science|volume=64|issue=1|pages=48–59|last2=Hara|first2=M|last3=Fukino|first3=N|last4=Kakizaki|first4=T|last5=Morimitsu|first5=Y|pmid=24987290|doi=10.1270/jsbbs.64.48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants with glucosinolates==
Glucosinolates occur as [[secondary metabolite]]s of almost all [[plant]]s of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Brassicales]]. Ordered in the Brassicales are for example the economically important family [[Brassicaceae]] as well as [[Capparaceae]] and [[Caricaceae]].
Outside of the Brassicales, the [[genus|genera]] ''[[Drypetes]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Molecules, Morphology, and Dahlgren's Expanded Order Capparales |author1=James E. Rodman |author2=Kenneth G. Karol |author3=Robert A. Price |author4=Kenneth J. Sytsma |journal=Systematic Botany |volume=21 |issue=3 |year=1996 |page=289 |jstor=2419660 |doi=10.2307/2419660}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Putranjiva]]'' in the family [[Putranjivaceae]] are the only other known occurrence of glucosinolates.
Glucosinolates occur in various edible plants such as [[cabbage]] (white cabbage, Chinese cabbage, [[broccoli]]) [[watercress]], [[horseradish]], [[caper]]s and [[radish]]es where the breakdown products often contribute a significant part of the distinctive taste. The glucosinolates are also found in seeds of these plants.&lt;ref name=ishida/&gt;

==Chemistry==

Glucosinolates constitute a natural class of [[organic compound]]s that contain [[sulfur]] and [[nitrogen]] and are derived from [[glucose]] and an [[amino acid]]. They are water-[[soluble]] [[anion]]s and belong to the [[glucoside]]s. Every glucosinolate contains a central [[carbon]] atom, which is bound via a sulfur atom to the thioglucose group and via a nitrogen atom to a sulfate group (making a sulfated [[aldoxime]]). In addition, the central carbon is bound to a side group; different glucosinolates have different side groups, and it is variation in the side group that is responsible for the variation in the biological activities of these plant compounds. 
The semisystematic naming of glucosinolates consists of the chemical name of that side chain followed by "glucosinolate". Spelling glucosinolate names in one or two words (e.g. allylglucosinolate versus allyl glucosinolate) are both in use and has equivalent meaning. Isothiocyanates must be spelled in two words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Glucosinolate structures in evolution |vauthors=Agerbirk N, Olsen CE |journal=Phytochemistry |volume=77 |year=2012 |pages=16–45|doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.02.005|pmid=22405332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of glucosinolate chemistry is the ability of a glucosinolate to convert into an isothiocyanate (a "mustard oil") upon hydrolysis of the thioglucoside bond by the enzyme myrosinase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Glucosinolate structures in evolution |vauthors=Agerbirk N, Olsen CE |journal=Phytochemistry |volume=77 |year=2012 |pages=16–45|doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.02.005|pmid=22405332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some glucosinolates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Glucosinolate structures in evolution |vauthors=Agerbirk N, Olsen CE |journal=Phytochemistry |volume=77 |year=2012 |pages=16–45|doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.02.005|pmid=22405332}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allylglucosinolate ([[sinigrin]]) is the precursor of [[allyl isothiocyanate]]
* Benzylglucosinolate ([[Glucotropaeolin]]) is the precursor of [[benzyl isothiocyanate]]
* Phenethylglucosinolate ([[Gluconasturtiin]]) is the precursor of [[phenethyl isothiocyanate]]
* (''R'')-4-(methylsulfinyl)butylglucosinolate ([[Glucoraphanin]]) is the precursor of (''R'')-4-(methylsulfinyl)butyl isothiocyanate ([[sulforaphane]])
* (''R'')-2-hydroxybut-3-enylglucosinolate ([[progoitrin]]) is probably the precursor of (''S'')-2-hydroxybut-3-enyl isothiocyanate, which is expected to be unstable and immediately cyclize to form (''S'')-5-vinyloxazolidine-2-thione ([[goitrin]])

==Biochemistry==

===Natural diversity from a few amino acids===
About 132 different glucosinolates are known to occur naturally in plants. They are synthesized from certain [[amino acid]]s: So-called [[aliphatic]] glucosinolates derived from mainly [[methionine]], but also [[alanine]], [[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], or [[valine]]. (Most glucosinolates are actually derived from chain-elongated homologues of these amino acids, e.g. glucoraphanin is derived from dihomomethionine, which is methionine chain-elongated twice). [[Aromatic]] glucosinolates include [[indolic]] glucosinolates, such as [[glucobrassicin]], derived from [[tryptophan]] and others from [[phenylalanine]], its chain-elongated homologue homophenylalanine, and [[sinalbin]] derived from [[tyrosine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Glucosinolate structures in evolution |author1=Niels Agerbirk |author2=Carl Erik Olsen |journal=Phytochemistry |volume=77 |year=2012 |pages=16–45 |doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.02.005 |pmid=22405332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enzymatic activation===
The plants contain the enzyme [[myrosinase]], which, in the presence of water, cleaves off the glucose group from a glucosinolate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bongoni|first1=R|last2=Verkerk|first2=R|last3=Steenbekkers|first3=B|last4=Dekker| first4=M|last5=Stieger|first5=M|title= Evaluation of Different Cooking Conditions on Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) to Improve the Nutritional Value and Consumer Acceptance|journal= Plant Foods for Human Nutrition|doi=10.1007/s11130-014-0420-2|volume=69|issue=3|pages=228–234|pmid=24853375|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining molecule then quickly converts to an [[isothiocyanate]], a [[nitrile]], or a [[thiocyanate]]; these are the active substances that serve as defense for the plant. Glucosinolates are also called [[Glucosinolate–myrosinase complex|mustard oil glycosides]]. The standard product of the reaction is the isothiocyanate (mustard oil); the other two products mainly occur in the presence of specialised plant proteins that alter the outcome of the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burow|first1=M|last2=Bergner|first2=A|last3=Gershenzon|first3=J|last4=Wittstock|first4=U|title=Glucosinolate hydrolysis in Lepidium sativum--identification of the thiocyanate-forming protein|journal=Plant Molecular Biology|volume=63|issue=1|pages=49–61|year=2007|pmid=17139450|doi=10.1007/s11103-006-9071-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thioglycoside––-Isothiocyanate V.1.png|thumb|center|550px|A mustard oil glycoside '''1''' is converted to an isothiocyanate '''3''' (mustard oil). Glucose '''2''' is liberated as well, only the β-form is shown.–                   &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;'''R'''&lt;/span&gt; = [[allyl]], [[benzyl]], 2-phenylethyl etc.{{Citation needed|reason=Unable to find any source for this reaction mechanism other than this article.|date=April 2018}}]]

In the chemical reaction illustrated above, the red curved arrows in the left side of figure are simplified compared to reality, as the role of the enzyme  myrosinase is not shown. However, the mechanism shown is fundamentally in accordance with the enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

In contrast, the reaction illustrated by red curved arrows at the right side of the figure, depicting the rearrangement of atoms resulting in the isothiocyanate, is expected to be non-enzymatic. This type of rearrangement can be named a Lossen-reaarrangement, or a Lossen-''like'' rearrangement, since this name was first used for the analogous reaction leading to an organic isocyanate (R-N=C=O).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

To prevent damage to the plant itself, the myrosinase and glucosinolates are stored in separate compartments of the cell or in different cells in the tissue, and come together only or mainly under conditions of physical injury.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Biological effects==

===Humans and other mammals===

====Toxicity====
The use of glucosinolate-containing crops as primary food source for animals can have negative effects if the concentration of glucosinolate is higher than what is acceptable for the animal in question, because some glucosinolates have been shown to have toxic effects (mainly as [[goitrogens]]) in both humans and animals at high doses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/toxicagents/glucosin.html|publisher=Cornell University, Department of Animal Science|title=Plants Poisonous to Livestock: Glucosinolates (Goitrogenic Glycosides)|date=10 September 2015|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, tolerance level to glucosinolates varies even within the same genus (e.g. [[Cairo spiny mouse|''Acomys cahirinus'']] and [[Golden spiny mouse|''Acomys russatus'']]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samuni Blank|first1=M|last2=Arad|first2=Z|last3=Dearing|first3=MD|last4=Gerchman|first4=Y|last5=Karasov|first5=WH|last6=Izhaki|first6=I|title=Friend or foe?

====Taste and eating behavior====
The glucosinolate [[sinigrin]], among others, was shown to be responsible for the bitterness of cooked [[cauliflower]] and [[Brussels sprouts]].&lt;ref name=ishida/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Doorn|first1=Hans E|last2=Van Der Kruk|first2=Gert C|last3=Van Holst|first3=Gerrit-Jan|last4=Raaijmakers-Ruijs|first4=Natasja C M E|last5=Postma|first5=Erik|last6=Groeneweg|first6=Bas|last7=Jongen|first7=Wim H F|title=The glucosinolates sinigrin and progoitrin are important determinants for taste preference and bitterness of Brussels sprouts|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|volume=78|pages=30–38|year=1998|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199809)78:1&lt;30::AID-JSFA79&gt;3.0.CO;2-N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glucosinolates may alter animal eating behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Samuni-Blank, M; Izhaki, I; Dearing, MD; Gerchman, Y; Trabelcy, B; Lotan, A; Karasov, WH; Arad, Z (2012).

====Research====
Glucosinolates are studied for their potential to affect human health, as well as [[plant breeding]], [[plant physiology|physiology]], [[plant genetics|genetics]], and food applications.&lt;ref name=ishida/&gt; {{as of|2018}}, studies on possible [[chemotherapy|anticancer mechanisms]] have been conducted, but there is no [[evidence-based medicine|clinical evidence]] to indicate the safety and efficacy of using glucosinolates for treating [[cancer]] or any human disease.&lt;ref name=ishida/&gt;&lt;ref name="fuentes"&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=4596548|year=2015|last1=Fuentes|first1=F|title=Dietary Glucosinolates Sulforaphane, Phenethyl Isothiocyanate, Indole-3-Carbinol/3,3′-Diindolylmethane: Anti-Oxidative Stress/Inflammation, Nrf2, Epigenetics/Epigenomics and in Vivo Cancer Chemopreventive Efficacy|journal=Current Pharmacology Reports|volume=1|issue=3|pages=179–196|last2=Paredes-Gonzalez|first2=X|last3=Kong|first3=A.

Amer. Soc. Hort. Sci|volume=112|pages=173–178|via=National Agricultural Library Digital Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insects===
Glucosinolates and their products have a negative effect on many insects, resulting from a combination of deterrence and toxicity. In an attempt to apply this principle in an agronomic context, some glucosinolate-derived products can serve as [[antifeedant]]s, i.e., natural [[pesticide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The efficacy of biofumigant meals and plants to control wireworm populations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926669009002003 | doi=10.1016/j.indcrop.2009.10.012 | volume=31|issue=2 |journal=Industrial Crops and Products|pages=245–254|year=2010 |last1=Furlan |first1=Lorenzo |last2=Bonetto |first2=Christian |last3=Finotto |first3=Andrea |last4=Lazzeri |first4=Luca |last5=Malaguti |first5=Lorena |last6=Patalano |first6=Giampiero |last7=Parker |first7=William }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention and control ==
* Using the '''health warning systems'''. A health system responsive to the needs of the population is required to refine the instruments to ensure adequate preparation before their hatching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/HAN/|title=Health Alert Network (HAN).

Rev Adm Sanit. 2006; 4:425–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Transparency of the institutions''' public or private. The perception of crisis can escape the control of experts or health institutions, and be determined by stakeholders to provide solutions propagate or concerned. This requires a difficult balancing of the need to articulate clear answers and the little-founded fears.&lt;ref&gt;Abouzhr C, Adjei S, Kanchanachitra C. From data to policy: good practices and cautionary tales. Lancet. 2007; 369:1039–46.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adequate '''information policy'''. Irrationality arise when information is distorted, or hidden. Face a health crisis involves: respect for society, coordination of organizations and an institution with scientific weight to the people and to the media, who acted as spokesman in situations of public health risk, to get confidence citizens. The technical capacity of health professionals is more proven than the public officials, which suggests a greater share of the former and better training of the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/Risks/|title=Risk Communication- Gateway to Health Communication - CDC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcs.es/publicaciones/sistema_sanitario_situaciones_crisis.html|title=El Sistema Sanitario ante situaciones de crisis|first=Quodem Consultores S.L.|last=www.quodem.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamata F.

Crises are challenges that must be learned from both the mistakes and successes, since they serve to bring about to the devices and improve the response to other crises. It is important to perform analysis of previous responses, audit risk and vulnerability, research and testing, and drills to prepare themselves against future crises.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel PB, Le P, Ververs MT, et al.

'''Health humanities''' refers to the application of the creative or [[The arts|fine arts]] (including [[visual arts]], [[music]], [[performing arts]]) and [[humanities]] disciplines (including [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], [[languages]], [[law]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[religion]], etc.) to discourse about, express, and/or promote dimensions of [[human]] [[health]] and well being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/labs/scope/about/|title="What is Health Humanities?"|last=|first=|date=2016|website=SCOPE: The Health Humanities Learning Lab|publisher=|access-date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applied capacity of the humanities is not itself a novel idea; however, the construct of the health humanities has only recently begun to emerge over the first decade of the 21st Century. Historically, the roots informing the health humanities can be traced back to, and can now be considered to include, such multidisciplinary areas as the [[medical humanities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mh.bmj.com/ |title=Medical Humanities - BMJ Journals |publisher=Mh.bmj.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Expressive therapy|expressive therapies/creative arts therapies]].

In the health humanities, health (and the promotion of health) is understood according to the [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] (and other [[non-positivist]]) principles indigenous to the humanities, as opposed to the [[positivism]] of [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;Squier, S. M. (2007). Beyond nescience: The intersectional insights of health humanities. ''Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 50'' (3), 334-337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emua.ac.uk/downloads/BBsept09/healthhumanities.pptx&lt;/ref&gt; The health humanities are rooted in dialogical (negotiated, intersubjective voices of multiple truths), versus monological (a singular, authoritative voice of "the" truth) perspectives on health. As such, evidence upon which health practices are based is generally considered [[Axiology|axiological]] (based in meanings, values, and aesthetics), versus [[Epistemology|epistemological]] (based in factual knowledge), in orientation. The health humanities are not an alternative to the health sciences, but rather offer a contrasting paradigm and pragmatic approach with respect to health and its promotion, and can function in a manner that is complementary and simultaneous relative to the health sciences.  

The health humanities are a growing movement internationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthhumanities.org&lt;/ref&gt;  A conference on the health humanities was held October 13–15, 2006, at [[Green College, University of British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthhum.arts.ubc.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was co-organized by Judy Segal (UBC English) and Alan Richardson (UBC Philosophy) and featured presentations by Jacalyn Duffin, Carl Elliott, Nicholas King, Lorelei Lingard, Robert Proctor, Susan Squier, Andrea Tone, and Kathleen Woodward.  In January 2009, [[Paul Crawford (academic)|Paul Crawford]] became the world's first Professor of Health Humanities at [[The University of Nottingham]], and with Dr Victoria Tischler, Charley Baker, Dr Brian Brown, Dr Lisa Mooney-Smith and Professor Ronald Carter created an international health humanities initiative that included the AHRC-funded International Health Humanities Conference (IHHC). The first field description for Health Humanities was presented in the key article "Health Humanities: The future of Medical Humanities" (Crawford, Brown, Tischler, &amp; Baker, 2010), published in the Mental Health Review Journal.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, P., Brown, B., Tischler, V. &amp; Baker, C. (2010) Health Humanities: The future of medical humanities? ''Mental Health Review Journal, 15'' (3): 4-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st International Health Humanities Conference was held 6–8 August 2010, at [[The University of Nottingham]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madnessandliterature.org/Resources/IHHC-flyer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madnessandliterature.org/Resources/First-International-Health-Humanities-Conference-Programme.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference opened with Professor Crawford's address entitled ‘Health humanities: Literature and Madness’ and included keynote lectures by Professor Kay Redfield Jamison and Professor Elaine Showalter. Mark A. Radcliffe, who also spoke at the conference, reported on 'health humanities' in his weekly column for the Nursing Times.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nursingtimes.net/forums-blogs-ideas-debate/nursing-blogs/health-humanities-feared-by-the-bad-loved-by-the-good/5018154.article?referrer=RSS&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was also reported in the Bethlem Blog.&lt;ref&gt;'Madness and Literature: Report from International Health Humanities Conference’, 16 August 2010. http://bethlemheritage.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd International Health Humanities Conference was hosted in the USA, 9–11 August 2012, at [[Montclair State University]] in New Jersey, with the theme of "Music, Health, and Humanity." The 3rd International Health Humanities Conference was held 5-7 September 2014, once again at the University of Nottingham, and featured the theme of "Traumatextualities: Trauma in the Clinical, Arts and Humanities Contexts."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthhumanities.org/blog/view/0/50&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th International Health Humanities Conference was held 30 April and 1-2 May 2015, at the Center for Bioethics and Humanities, [[Anschutz Medical Campus]], [[University of Colorado]], Denver, featuring the theme of "Health Humanities: The Next Decade (Pedagogies, Practices, Politics)." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/centers/BioethicsHumanities/ArtsHumanities/Pages/Health%20Humanities%20Conference.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th International Health Humanities Conference will be held 15-17 September 2016, at the [[University of Seville]], Seville, Spain, featuring the theme of "Arts and Humanities for Improving Social Inclusion, Education, and Health: Creative Practice and Mutuality." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ihhcsevilla2016.es/index?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Textbooks on the health humanities include ''Health Humanities Reader''&lt;ref&gt;Jones, T., Wear, D., &amp; Friedman, L. D. (Eds.). (2014). ''Health Humanities Reader''. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Health Humanities''.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, P., Brown, B., Baker, C., Tischler, V., &amp; Abrams, B. (2015). ''Health Humanities''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a Health Humanities Centre was established at University College London, dedicated to research and teaching in the Health Humanities, including an MA in Health Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/health-humanities|title=UCL Health Humanities Centre|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since health literacy is a primary contributing factor to [[health disparities]], it is a continued and increasing concern for health professionals. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) conducted by the US Department of Education found that 36% of participants scored as either "basic" or "below basic" in terms of their health literacy and concluded that approximately 80 million Americans have limited health literacy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Health Literacy of America's Adults: Results From the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy|last=Kutner|first=MA|last2=Greenberg|first2=E|last3=Jin|first3=Y|last4=Paulson|first4=C|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|year=2006|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals have difficulty with common health tasks including reading the label of a prescribed drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Health Literacy: Why We Need Accessible Health Information|url=http://health.gov/communication/literacy/issuebrief/|website=health.gov|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors may influence health literacy. However, the following factors have been shown to strongly increase this risk: age (especially patients 65 years and older), limited English language proficiency or English as a second language, less education, and lower socioeconomic status. Patients with low health literacy understand less about their medical conditions and treatments and overall report worse health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1999-02-10|title=Health literacy: report of the Council on Scientific Affairs. Ad Hoc Committee on Health Literacy for the Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10022112|journal=JAMA|volume=281|issue=6|pages=552–557|issn=0098-7484|pmid=10022112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various interventions, such as simplifying information and illustrations, avoiding [[jargon]], using "[[The teach-back method|teach-back]]" methods, and encouraging patients' questions, have improved health behaviors in persons with low health literacy. The proportion of adults aged 18 and over in the U.S., in the year 2010, who reported that their health care providers always explained things so they could understand them was about 60.6%.&lt;ref name="healthypeople.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/health-communication-and-health-information-technology/national-snapshot|title=Health Communication and Health Information Technology - Healthy People 2020|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number increased 1% from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref name="healthypeople.gov" /&gt; The [[Healthy People program#Healthy People 2010 and Healthy People 2020|Healthy People 2020]] initiative of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] has included health literacy as a pressing new topic, with objectives for improving it in the decade to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=18|title=Health Communication and Health Information Technology - Healthy People 2020|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Society as a whole is responsible for improving health literacy. Most importantly, improving health literacy is the responsibility of healthcare and public health professionals and systems.

==Characteristics==

=== Plain language ===
In order to have a patient that understands health terms and can make proper health decisions, the language used by health professionals has to be at a level that others who are not in the medical field can understand. Health professionals must know their audience in order to better serve their patients. The language used by these professionals should be [[plain language]]. Plain language is a strategy for making written and oral information easier to understand; it is communication that users can understand the first time they read or hear it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Health Literacy - Fact Sheet: Health Literacy Basics|url = http://health.gov/communication/literacy/quickguide/factsbasic.htm|website = health.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some key elements of plain language include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/FederalPLGuidelines/TOC.cfm|title=Federal Plain Language Guidelines: Table of Contents|website=www.plainlanguage.gov|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Organizing information so most important points come first
* Breaking complex information into understandable chunks
* Using simple language and defining technical terms
* Using active voice
* Using lists and tables to make complex material easier to understand

The National Institute of Health (NIH) recommends that patient education materials should be not written higher than a 6th-7th grade reading level; further recommendations provided by the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison are published in their [https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication "Clear Communication" Initiative.]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication|title=Clear Communication|work=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors ===
Many factors determine the health literacy level of [[health education]] materials or interventions: [[Reading level|readability]] of the text, the patient's current state of health, [[language barrier]]s of the patient, cultural appropriateness of the materials, format and style, sentence structure, use of illustrations, and numerous other factors.

A study of 2,600 patients conducted in 1995 by two US hospitals found that between 26% and 60% of patients could not understand medication directions, a standard [[informed consent]] form, or materials about scheduling an appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. V. Williams|year=1995|title=Inadequate functional health literacy among patients at two public hospitals|journal=JAMA|volume=274|issue=21|pages=677–82|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/274/21/1677|accessdate=2006-06-30|doi=10.1001/jama.274.21.1677|pmid=7474271|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) conducted by the US Department of Education found that 36% of participants scored as either "basic" or "below basic" in terms of their health literacy and  concluded that approximately 80 million Americans have limited health literacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==History==
The young and multidisciplinary field of '''health literacy''' emerged from two groups of experts: physicians, health providers such as nurses,&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, C., and Piano, MR. (2013) "Health literacy and nursing: an update." The American Journal of Nursing.  Jun;113(6):52-7. doi: 10.1097/01.NAJ.0000431271.83277.2f.&lt;/ref&gt; and health educators; and [[Adult Basic Education]] (ABE) and [[English as a second language]] (ESL) practitioners in the field of education. [[Physicians]] and [[nurses]] are a source of patient comprehension and compliance studies. Adult Basic Education / English for Speakers of Languages Other Than English (ABE/ESOL) specialists study and design interventions to help people develop reading, writing, and conversation skills and increasingly infuse curricula with health information to promote better health literacy. A range of approaches to adult education brings health literacy skills to people in traditional classroom settings, as well as where they work and live.

===Biomedical approach===
The [[biomedical approach]] to health literacy that became dominant (in the U.S.) during the 1980s and 1990s often depicted individuals as lacking health literacy or "suffering" from low health literacy. This approach assumed that recipients are passive in their possession and reception of health literacy and believed that models of literacy and health literacy are politically neutral and universally applicable. This approach is found lacking when placed in the context of broader ecological, critical, and cultural approaches to health. This approach has produced, and continues to reproduce, numerous correlational studies.&lt;ref&gt;Pleasant &amp; Kuruvilla, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Level of health literacy is considered adequate when the population has sufficient knowledge, skills, and confidence to guide their own health, and people are able to stay healthy, recover from illness, and/or live with disability or disease.&lt;ref name="McMurray"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne McMurray|title=Community Health and Wellness: A Sociological Approach|location=Brisbane|publisher=Elsevier|year=2007|ISBN=978-0-7295-3788-9|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMurray states that health literacy is important in a community because it addresses health inequities. It is no coincidence that individuals with lower levels of health literacy live, disproportionally, in communities with lower socio-economic standing. A barrier to achieving adequate health literacy for these individuals is a lack of awareness, or understanding of, information and resources relevant to improving their health. This knowledge gap arises from both patients being unable to understand information presented to them and hospitals' inadequate efforts and materials to address these literacy gaps.

A more robust view of health literacy includes the ability to [[Scientific literacy|understand scientific concepts]], content, and health research; skills in spoken, written, and online communication; critical interpretation of mass media messages; navigating complex systems of health care and governance; knowledge and use of community capital and resources; and using cultural and indigenous knowledge in health decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nutbeam|first=D.|date=2000-09-01|title=Health literacy as a public health goal: a challenge for contemporary health education and communication strategies into the 21st century|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|journal=Health Promotion International|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–267|doi=10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|issn=1460-2245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ratzan|first=S. C.|date=June 2001|title=Health literacy: communication for the public good|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11356759|journal=Health Promotion International|volume=16|issue=2|pages=207–214|issn=0957-4824|pmid=11356759}}&lt;/ref&gt; This integrative view sees health literacy as a social determinant of health that offers a powerful opportunity to reduce inequities in health.

This perspective defines health literacy as the wide range of skills, and competencies that people develop over their lifetimes to seek out, comprehend, evaluate, and use health information and concepts to make informed choices, reduce health risks, and increase quality of life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarcadoolas|first=Christina|last2=Pleasant|first2=Andrew|last3=Greer|first3=David S.|date=June 2005|title=Understanding health literacy: an expanded model|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15788526|journal=Health Promotion International|volume=20|issue=2|pages=195–203|doi=10.1093/heapro/dah609|issn=0957-4824|pmid=15788526}}&lt;/ref&gt; While various definitions vary in wording, they all fall within this conceptual framework.

Defining health literacy in that manner builds the foundation for a multi-dimensional model of health literacy built around four central domains:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

*fundamental literacy,
*scientific literacy,
*civic literacy, and
*cultural literacy.

There are several tests, which have verified reliability in the academic literature that can be administered in order to test one's health literacy. Some of these tests include the Medical Term Recognition Test (METER), which was developed in the United States (2 minute administration time) for the clinical setting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altin|first1=Sibel|last2=Finke|first2=Isabelle|last3=Kautz-Freimuth|first3=Sibylle|last4=Stock|first4=Stephanie|title=The evolution of health literacy assessment tools: a systematic review|journal=BMC Public Health|date=2014|volume=14|issue=1|page=1207|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-1207|pmc=4289240|pmid=25418011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The METER includes many words from the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) test.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The Short Assessment of Health Literacy in Spanish and English populations (SAHL-S&amp;E) uses word recognition and multiple choice questions to test a person's comprehension.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The CHC-Test measures Critical Health Competencies and consists of 72 items designed to test a person's understanding of medical concepts, literature searching, basic statistics, and design of experiments and samples.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Patient safety and outcomes==
According to an [[Institute of Medicine]] (2004) report, low health literacy negatively affects the treatment outcome and safety of care delivery.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute of Medicine: [http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10883.html#toc Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confusion] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of health literacy affects all segments of the population.  However, it is disproportionate in certain demographic groups, such as the [[elderly]], [[ethnic minorities]], recent [[immigrants]], and persons with low general [[literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy [http://nces.ed.gov/NAAL/index.asp?file=AssessmentOf/HealthLiteracy/HealthLiteracyResults.asp&amp;PageID=158 The Health Literacy of America's Adults] Retrieved 9 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These populations have a higher risk of hospitalization, longer hospital stays, are less likely to comply with treatment, are more likely to make errors with medication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Terry C.

The mismatch between a clinician's [[communication]] of content and a patient's ability to understand that content can lead to medication errors and adverse medical outcomes. Health literacy skills are not only a problem in the general population. Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, public health workers) can also have poor health literacy skills, such as a reduced ability to clearly explain health issues to patients and the public.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Anesthesiology abstracts (October 25, 2005), Aaron M.

In addition to tailoring the content of what health professionals communicate to their patients, a well arranged layout, pertinent illustrations, and intuitive format of written materials can improve the usability of health care literature. This in turn can help in effective communication between healthcare providers and their patients.&lt;ref name="IJGM_Gill2012"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2012|title=Readability Assessment of Concussion and Traumatic Brain Injury Publications by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|journal=[[International Journal of General Medicine]]|volume=5|pages=923–933|doi=10.2147/IJGM.S37110|first1=P.S.|last1=Gill|first2=T.S.|last2=Gill|first3=A.|last3=Kamath|first4=B.|last4=whisnant|url=http://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=14417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk identification===
Identifying a patient as having low health literacy is essential for a healthcare professional to conform their health intervention in a way that the patient will understand. When patients with low health literacy receive care that is tailored to their more limited medical knowledge base, results have shown that health behaviors drastically improve. This has been seen with: correct medication use and dosage, utilizing health screenings, as well as increased exercise and smoking cessation. Effective visual aids have shown to help supplement the information communicated by the doctor in the office. In particular, easily readable brochures and videos have shown to be very effective.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: Evidence Report/Technology Assessment: Number 87 [http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/epcsums/litsum.htm Literacy and Health Outcomes]&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare professionals can use many methods to attain patients' health literacy. A multitude of tests used during research studies and three minute assessments commonly used in doctors offices are examples of the variety of tests healthcare professionals can use to better understand their patients' health literacy.&lt;ref name="TOFLA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conversation/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPSF/&gt;

The American Medical Association showed that asking simple single item questions, such as "How confident are you in filling out medical forms by yourself?", is a very effective and direct way to understand from a patient's point of view how they feel about interacting with their healthcare provider and understanding their health condition.&lt;ref name=Questions/&gt;

===Intervention===
In order to be understood by patients with insufficient health literacy, health professionals must intervene to provide clear and concise information that can be more easily understood. Avoidance of medical jargon, illustrations of important concepts, and confirming information by a "teach back" method have shown to be effective tools to communicating essential health topics with health illiterate patients.&lt;ref name=Conversation&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/conversation-cultural-competence-cindy-brach-senior-health-policy-researcher-ahrq|title=A Conversation on Cultural Competence With Cindy Brach, Senior Health Policy Researcher, AHRQ|date=2013-04-17|accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A program called "Ask Me 3"&lt;ref name=NPSF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askme3.org/index.asp|title=National Patient Safety Foundation|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308091008/http://www.askme3.org/index.asp|archivedate=2008-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is designed to bring public and physician attention to this issue, by letting patients know that they should ask three questions each time they talk to a doctor, nurse, or pharmacist:
*What is my main problem?
*What do I need to do?
*Why is it important for me to do this?

There have also been large-scale efforts to improve health literacy. For example, a public information program by the US Department of Health and Human Services encourages patients to improve healthcare quality and avoid errors by asking questions about health conditions and treatment.&lt;ref name=Questions&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: [http://www.ahrq.gov/questionsaretheanswer/ Questions Are the Answer], retrieved 2008-10-18&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the IROHLA (Intervention Research on Health Literacy of the Ageing population)  project, funded by the European Union (EU), seeks to develop evidence-based guidelines for policy and practice to improve health literacy of the ageing population in EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irohla.eu/home/|title=Home|publisher=|access-date=2015-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613081655/http://www.irohla.eu/home/|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has developed a framework and identified and validated interventions which together constitute a comprehensive approach of addressing health literacy needs of the elderly.

===Health illiterate-related diabetes prevalence in Vietnamese-American populations===
Diabetes is a rapidly growing health problem among immigrants—affecting approximately 10 percent of Asian-Americans.  It is the fifth-leading cause of death in Asian-Americans between the ages of 45 and 64.  In addition, type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease.  Those who are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes have high levels of blood glucose because the body does not effectively respond to insulin.  It is a lifelong disease with no known cure.  Diabetes is a chronic, debilitating, and costly social burden—costing healthcare systems about $100 billion annually.&lt;ref name="Cabiglio"&gt;Cabiglio, Josie. Diabetes on the rise among Asians.  Nguoi Viet 2. Web. 7 Dec 2010.

Diabetes disproportionately affects underserved and ethnically diverse populations, such as Vietnamese-American communities.  The relationship between the disease and health literacy level is in part because of an individual's ability to read English, evaluate blood glucose levels, and communicate with medical professionals.  Other studies also suggest lack in knowledge of diabetes symptoms and complications.&lt;ref name="Glazier"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Glazier R.H. | year = 2004 | title = Neighborhood recent immigration and hospitalization in Toronto, Canada | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Public Health | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 130–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an observational cross-sectional study conducted, many Vietnamese-American diabetic patients show signs of poor blood glucose control and adherence due to inadequate self-management knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name="Mull"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mull Dorothy S.

Ethnic minority groups and immigrant communities have less knowledge of health promoting behavior, face considerable obstacles to health services, and experience poor communication with medical professionals.&lt;ref name="Simich"&gt;Simich, Laura. "Health Literacy and Immigrant Populations." Public Health Agency of Canada and Metropolis Canada (2009): 1-18.

==== Oral health literacy in school teachers of Mangalore, India ====
The problem of low oral health literacy (OHL) is often neglected which may lead to poor oral health outcomes and under utilization of oral care services. A cross-sectional survey of  school teachers working in schools at Mangalore, India was undertaken. Details regarding demographics, medical, and dental history, oral hygiene practices and habits, diet history, and decay promoting the potential of school teachers were obtained using face-to-face interview method. The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Dentistry-99 (REALD-99) was used to assess their OHL.The OHL was high in the school teachers with the REALD-99 scores ranging from 45 to 95 with a mean score of 75.83 ± 9.94. Th This study found that there was a statistically significant difference between OHL and education, frequency of brushing and the filled teeth. Although this study indicated high OHL levels among school teachers in Mangalore, India the magnitude of dental caries in this population was also relatively high and very few had a healthy periodontium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Arun K|last2=Rao|first2=Ashwini|last3=Rajesh|first3=GuruRaghavendran|last4=Shenoy|first4=Ramya|last5=Pai|first5=Mithun B.

==eHealth literacy==
eHealth literacy describes the relatively modern concept of an individual's ability to search for, successfully access, comprehend, and appraise desired health information from electronic sources and to then use such information to attempt to address a particular health problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmir.org/2006/2/e9/|title=eHealth Literacy: Essential Skills for Consumer Health in a Networked World|first1=Cameron D|last1=Norman|first2=Harvey A|last2=Skinner|date=1 January 2006|publisher=|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.2196/jmir.8.2.e9|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|page=e9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the increasing influence of the internet for information-seeking and health information distribution purposes, eHealth literacy has become an important topic of research in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayat|first=T|last2=Brainin|first2=E|last3=Neter|first3=E|date=|title=With Some Help From My Network: Supplementing eHealth Literacy With Social Ties|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=19|issue=3|pages=e98.|doi=10.2196/jmir.6472|via=|pmc=5391437|pmid=28360024|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stellefson (2011) states, "8 out of 10 Internet users report that they have at least once looked online for health information, making it the third most popular Web activity next to checking email and using search engines in terms of activities that almost everybody has done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmir.org/2011/4/e102/|title=eHealth Literacy Among College Students: A Systematic Review With Implications for eHealth Education|first1=Michael|last1=Stellefson|first2=Bruce|last2=Hanik|first3=Beth|last3=Chaney|first4=Don|last4=Chaney|first5=Bethany|last5=Tennant|first6=Enmanuel Antonio|last6=Chavarria|date=1 January 2011|publisher=|volume=13|issue=4|doi=10.2196/jmir.1703|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|page=e102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though in recent years, individuals may have gained access to a multitude of health information via the Internet, access alone does not ensure that proper search skills and techniques are being used to find the most relevant online and electronic resources. As the line between a reputable medical source and an amateur opinion can often be blurred, the ability to differentiate between the two is important.

Health literacy requires a combination of several different literacy skills in order to facilitate eHealth promotion and care.  Six core skills are delineated by an eHealth literacy model referred to as the Lily model.  The Lily Model's six literacies are organized into two central types: analytic and context-specific.  Analytic type literacies are those skills that can be applied to a broad range of sources, regardless of topic or content (i.e., skills that can also be applied to shopping or researching a term paper in addition to health) whereas context-specific skills are those that are contextualized within a specific problem domain (can solely be applied to health).  The six literacies are listed below, the first three of the analytic type and the latter three of the context-specific:
* Traditional literacy
* Media literacy
* Information literacy
* Computer literacy
* Scientific literacy
* Health literacy

According to Norman (2006), both analytical and context-specific literacy skills are "required to fully engage with electronic health resources."  As the World Wide Web and technological innovations are more and more becoming a part of the healthcare environment, it is important for information technology to be properly utilized to promote health and deliver health care effectively. Furthermore, it was argued by Hayat Brainin &amp; Neter (2017), that digital media fosters the creation of interpersonal ties, that can supplement eHealth literacy. According to Hayat Brainin &amp; Neter (2017), individuals with low eHealth literacy who were able to recruit help when performing online activities demonstrated higher health outcomes compared to similar individuals who did not find help. Also relating to the proliferation of digital media is the fact that many individuals now can create their own ‘media content’ ([[user-generated content]]). This means that the boundary between “information” and “media” content, as proposed by Norman in 2006, now is increasingly blurred, creating additional challenges for health practitioners (Holmberg, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holmberg C | year = 2016 | title = If You can't beat It-Use It: why and how clinicians need to consider social media in the treatment of adolescents with obesity | url = | journal = European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 70 | issue = 9| pages = 977–8 | doi = 10.1038/ejcn.2016.126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the move towards [[Patient-centred care|patient-centered care]] and the greater use of technology for self-care and self-management requires higher health literacy on the part of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Henna|last2=Xie|first2=Bo|title=Health literacy in the eHealth era: A systematic review of the literature|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|date=January 2017|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2017.01.015|volume=100|pages=1073–1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been noted in several research studies, for example among adolescent patients with obesity.&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, C., Berg, C., Dahlgren, J., Lissner, L., &amp; Chaplin, J. E. (2018). Health literacy in a complex digital media landscape: Pediatric obesity patients’ experiences with online weight, food, and health information. Health Informatics Journal.

== Improvement ==

=== Incorporate information through the university level ===
The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] created a National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.gov/communication/hlactionplan/pdf/Health_Literacy_Action_Plan.pdf|title=National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy|date=|accessdate=|website=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of the National Action Plan is to incorporate health and science information in childcare and education through the university level. The target is to educate people at an early stage; that way individuals are raised with health literacy and will have a better quality of life. The earlier an individual is exposed to health literacy skills the better for the person and the community.

Programs such as Head Start&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs|title=Home - Office of Head Start - Administration for Children and Families|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Food and Nutrition Service|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have impacted our society, especially the low income population. Head Start provides low-income children and their families early childhood education, nutrition, and health screenings. Health literacy is integrated in the program for both children and parents through the education given to the individuals. WIC serves low-income pregnant women and new mothers by supplying them with food, health care referrals, and nutrition education. Programs like these help improve the health literacy of both the parent and the child, creating a more knowledgeable community with health education.

Although programs like Head Start and WIC have been working with the health literacy of a specific population, much more can be done with the education of children and young adults. Now, more and more adolescents are getting involved with their health care. It is crucial to educate these individuals in order for them to make informed decisions.

Many schools in the country incorporate a health class in their curriculum. These classes provided an excellent opportunity to facilitate and develop health literacy in today's children and adolescents. The skills of how to read food labels, the meaning of common medical terms, the structure of the human body, and education on the most prevalent diseases in the United States should be taught in both private and public schools. This way new generations will grow with health literacy and would hopefully make knowledgeable health decisions.

=== Framework and potential intervention points ===
The National Library of Medicine defines health literacy as:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confustion|last=Nielsen-Bohlmn|first=Lynn|date=2004|journal=Institute of Medicine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health literacy
information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions."}}

Based on this clinical definition, health literacy gives
individuals the skills that they need to both understand and effectively
communicate information and concerns. Bridging that gap between literacy skills
and the ability of the individual in health contexts, the ''Health Literacy Framework'' highlights the health outcomes and costs
associated with health contexts including cognitive abilities, social skills,
emotional state, and physical conditions such as visual and auditory contributions.

''Potential Intervention Points'' are illustrated in reflection of the ''Health Literacy Framework.''
While these potential intervention points include interactions such as those of individuals and the education systems
that they are engaged with, their health systems, and societal factors as they
relate to health literacy, these points are not 
components of a causal model.  The three
potential intervention points are culture and society, the health system, and
the education system. Health outcomes and costs are the products of the health
literacy developed during diversity of exposure to these three potential intervention
points.

Referring to shared ideas, meanings, and values that
influence an individual's beliefs and attitudes, cultural and societal
influences are a significant intervention point for health literacy
development. As interactions with healthcare systems often first occur at the
family level, deeply rooted beliefs and values can shape the significance of
the experience. Included components that reflect the development of health
literacy both culturally and societally are native language, socioeconomic status,
gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as mass media exposure. These
are pathways to understanding American life paralleling conquests for a health
literate America.

The health system is an intervention point in the ''Health Literacy Framework''. For the
purposes of this framework, health literacy refers to an individual's
interaction with people performing health-related activities in settings such
as hospitals, clinics, physician's offices, home health care, public health agencies,
and insurers.

In the United States, the education system consists of [[K-12]] curricula. In addition to this standard educational
setting, adult education programs are also environments in which individuals
can develop traditional literacy skills founded in comprehension and real-world
application of knowledge via reading and writing.  Tools for educational development provided by
these systems impact an individual's capacity to obtain specific knowledge
regarding health. Reflecting components of traditional literacy such as
cultural and conceptual knowledge, oral literacy (listening and speaking,)
print literacy (reading and writing,) and numeracy, education systems are also
potential intervention points for health literacy development.

=== Development of a health literacy program ===
A successful health literacy program will have many goals that all work together to improve health literacy. Many people assume these goals should communicate health information to the general public, however in order to be successful the goals should not only communicate with people but also take into account social and environmental factors that influence lifestyle choices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nutbeam|first=D.|date=2000-09-01|title=Health literacy as a public health goal: a challenge for contemporary health education and communication strategies into the 21st century|url=https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/15/3/259/551108/Health-literacy-as-a-public-health-goal-a|journal=Health Promotion International|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–267|doi=10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|issn=0957-4824}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of this is the movement to end smoking. When a health literacy program is put into place where only the negative side effects of smoking are told to the general public it is doomed to fail. However, when there is a larger program put in – one that includes strategies outlining how to quit smoking, raises tobacco prices, reduces access to tobacco by minors, and reflect social a social unacceptability of smoking – it will be much more effective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services suggests a National Action Plan to implement a comprehensive Health Literacy Program. They include 7 goals:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|first=Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion|date=2010|title=National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy|url=https://health.gov/communication/hlactionplan/pdf/Health_Literacy_Action_Plan.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Develop and disseminate health and safety information that is accurate, accessible, and actionable
# Promote changes in the health care system that improve health information, communication, informed decision making, and access to health services
# Incorporate accurate, standards-based, and developmentally appropriate health and science information and curricula in child care and education through the university level
# Support and expand local efforts to provide adult education, English language instruction, and culturally and linguistically appropriate health information services in the community
# Build partnerships, develop guidance, and change policies
# Increase basic research and the development, implementation, and evaluation of practices and interventions to improve health literacy
# Increase the dissemination and use of evidence-based health literacy practices and interventions
These goals should be taken into account when implementing a health literacy program.

There are also goals for the outcomes of a Health Literacy Program.

''Health Related Goals''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Promoting and protect health and prevent disease
* Understand, interpret, and analyze health information
* Apply health information over a variety of life events and situations
* Navigate the healthcare system 
* Actively participate in encounters with healthcare professionals and workers
* Understand and give consent

===Libraries===
Libraries have increasingly recognised that they can play a role in health literacy since the 2000s, influenced by the [[Medical Library Association]].  Library initiatives have included running education programs, fostering partnerships with health organisations, and using outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=13 June 2016|title=Health literacy and libraries: a literature review|journal=[[Reference Services Review]]|volume=44|issue=2|pages=191–205|doi=10.1108/RSR-02-2016-0005|last1=Barr-Walker|first1=Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Home health care software''' sometimes referred to as '''home care software''' or '''home health software''' falls under the broad category of [[Health information technology|health care information technology]] (HIT).&lt;ref name=HIMofaSR&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abdelhak|first1=Mervat|last2=Grostick|first2=Sara|last3=Hanken|first3=Mary Alice|title=Health Information: Management of a Strategic Resource|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323295055}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIT is “the application of information processing involving both computer hardware and software that deals with the storage, retrieval, sharing, and use of health care information, data, and knowledge for communication and decision making”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brailer|first1=T|last2=Thompson|first2=D|title=Health IT strategic framework.|journal=Department of Health and Human Services|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home health software is designed specifically for companies employing home health providers, as well as government entities who track payments to home health care providers.&lt;ref name=IWeekGPSCuts&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diana|first1=Alison|title=GPS Cuts Fraud, Costs For Home Healthcare|url=http://www.informationweek.com/healthcare/gps-cuts-fraud-costs-for-home-healthcare/d/d-id/1317202|accessdate=3 April 2015|publisher=Information Week|date=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first use of home health care software was in the 1990s, with companies making software based on the [[CoreOS|Omaha system]] of software.&lt;ref name=HabdookJBarlet&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Marilyn|title=Handbook of Home Health Care Administration|date=2010|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=9780763755829}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first software was made available for public health departments, nurse-managed centers, and community clinics.&lt;ref name=HabdookJBarlet/&gt; The use of home health care software increased with the technologies of cloud computing, [[telehealth]] and business analytical tools. Implementing these technologies with home health software is attributed to the enhancement of quality care at home, and reduction of fraud. During the early stages of 2000s, the home health care software industry expanded from simple databases to agencies being able to transmit electronic health records.&lt;ref name=HabdookJBarlet/&gt; There was also an increase in the available types of software as a result of software vendors working directly with health care providers.&lt;ref name=HabdookJBarlet/&gt;

==Types of software==

There are clinical and non-clinical applications of home health care software. Including types such as agency software, hospice solutions, clinical management systems, telehealth solutions, and electronic visit verification. Depending on the type of software used, companies can track health care employee visits to patients, verify payroll, and document patient care.&lt;ref name=AxxessOW5Facts&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawson|first1=Lisa|title=Five Facts about Electronic Visit Verification for Home Health Agencies|url=http://www.axxess.com/blog/news_n_update/five-facts-about-electronic-visit-verification-evv-for-home-health-agencies/|accessdate=3 April 2015|publisher=Axxess official website|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments can also use home health care software to verify visits from providers who bill them for services.&lt;ref name=AxxessOW5Facts/&gt; Use of some software is mandated by government agencies such as OASIS assessment information that must be transmitted electronically by home health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brunsberg|first1=Sarah|title=The Home Health Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS)|url=http://www.resdac.org/resconnect/articles/129|accessdate=5 April 2015|publisher=Research Data Assistance Center|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agency software===

Agency software is used by home health care providers for office use and is a subset of [[medical practice management software]] used by inpatient clinics and doctors offices. Agency software is used for billing, paying vendors, staff scheduling, and maintaining records associated with the business.&lt;ref name=EnSYouwn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Charlene|title=Start Your Own Senior Services Business: Adult Day-Care, Relocation Service, Home-Care, Transportation Service, Concierge, Travel Service|date=2014|publisher=Entrepreneur Press|isbn=9781599185415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agency software can be standalone or part of software packages, that include electronic visit verification to track hours of employees and time spent on home visits and patient care. Agency software can be purchased or leased through various vendors.&lt;ref name=EnSYouwn/&gt;

===Electronic visit verification===
{{main|Electronic visit verification}}

Electronic visit verification (often referred to as EVV) is a method used to verify home healthcare visits to ensure patients are not neglected and to cut down on fraudulently documented home visits. EVV monitors locations of caregivers, and is mandated by certain states, including [[Texas]] and [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name=IWeekGPSCuts/&gt; Other states do not mandate it, but use it as part of its Medicaid fraud oversight, created by the passing of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=GTechExpansion&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milligan|first1=Susan|title=Medicaid Expansion Spurs States to Fight Fraud, Overpayments|url=http://www.govtech.com/federal/Medicaid-Expansion-Spurs-States-to-Fight-Fraud-Overpayments.html|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=Government Technology|date=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also widely used by employers of home healthcare providers to verify employee's locations and hours of work as well as document patient care.&lt;ref name="AxxessOW5Facts"/&gt;

===Outcome and assessment information set (OASIS)===

Home health care providers that participate in Medicaid are required to report specific data about patient care known as Outcome and Assessment Information Set-C (OASIS-C).&lt;ref name=Comparihim&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peden|first1=Ann|title=Comparative Health Information Management|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781133708124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data includes health status, functional status, and support system information. The data is used to establish a measurement of patient home health care options.&lt;ref name=Comparihim/&gt; Home health care software allows health care providers to obtain and transmit such data while on location with a patient. Data collection is mandated by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]], a division of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref name=Comparihim/&gt; Software for collecting and transmitting data is free through CMM and can also be purchased through private vendors as an add-on to other home health care software.&lt;ref name=Comparihim/&gt;

== Software Delivery Platforms ==

=== On-Site Server Based Model ===
The software is hosted on [[Server (computing)|servers]] located and maintained on-site at the agency. The localization of the data provides the agency direct access to the computers hosting their software and may also require the agency to maintain the technology that hosts the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://datasoftlogic.com/home-health-software/best-practices-for-evaluating-home-health-software|title=Home Health Software Buyer's Guide {{!}} Data Soft Logic|website=Data Soft Logic|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cloud Based Software Model ===
The software is deployed on a [[Cloud computing|cloud]] system maintained by the software vendor. The off-site maintenance of the cloud system results in a lower cost to the home health agency and provides access to the agency's data from off-site locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.capterra.com/comparing-emr-software-must-have-features/|title=Comparing EMR Software: 9 Must-Have Features - Capterra Blog|website=blog.capterra.com|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypersexual disorder''' is a pattern of behavior involving intense preoccupation with [[Sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]], urges and activities, leading to adverse consequences and clinically significant [[Distress (medicine)|distress]] or impairment in social, occupational or other important functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kafka|first=Martin P.|date=2010-04-01|title=Hypersexual Disorder: A Proposed Diagnosis for DSM-V|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-009-9574-7|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=377–400|doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9574-7|issn=0004-0002}} {{url|http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.433.1948&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed in 2010 for inclusion in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fifth Edition ([[DSM-5]]) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). 

==Criteria==
People with hypersexual disorder experience multiple, unsuccessful attempts to control or diminish the amount of time spent engaging in sexual fantasies, urges, and behaviors in response to [[Dysphoria|dysphoric mood states]] or [[Psychological stress|stressful]] life events. 

For a valid diagnosis of hypersexual disorder to be established, symptoms must persist for a period of at least 6 months and occur independently of a  use [[mania]] or a medical condition.&lt;ref name=APApage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=415|title=American Psychiatric Association DSM-5 Development Page for Hypersexual Disorder|website=Dsm5.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hypersexual disorder was recommended for inclusion in the [[DSM-5]] (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) by the Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Workgroup (Emerging Measures and Models, Conditions for Further Study). It was ultimately not approved.&lt;ref name=dsm5sexdysfunc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/SexualDysfunctions.aspx|title=DSM-5 Development Page for Sexual Dysfunctions.|website=Dsm5.org|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''hypersexual disorder'' was reportedly chosen because it did not imply any specific theory for the causes of [[hypersexuality]], which remain unknown.&lt;ref name=Kafka2010&gt;Kafka, M. P. (2010). Hypersexual Disorder: A proposed diagnosis for DSM-V. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 39,'' 377–400.&lt;/ref&gt;  A proposal to add [[sexual addiction]] to the DSM system had been previously rejected by the APA, as not enough evidence suggested to them that the condition is analogous to substance addictions, as that name would imply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-02-10-dsm10_ST_N.htm|title=Psychiatry's bible: Autism, binge-eating updates proposed for 'DSM' - USATODAY.com|website=Usatoday.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-02-10/entertainment/27055937_1_autism-mental-disorders-mental-illness |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055212/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-02-10/entertainment/27055937_1_autism-mental-disorders-mental-illness |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/brain-and-behavior/articles/2010/02/10/new-diagnostic-guidelines-for-mental-illnesses-proposed|title=New Diagnostic Guidelines for Mental Illnesses Proposed|website=Health.usnews.com|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rory Reid, a research psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the [[University of California Los Angeles]] (UCLA), led a team of researchers to investigate the proposed criteria for Hypersexual Disorder. Their findings were published in the ''[[Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'' where they concluded that the given criteria is valid and the disorder could be reliably diagnosed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02936.x/abstract|title=Report of Findings in a DSM-5 Field Trial for Hypersexual Disorder|first1=Rory C.|last1=Reid|first2=Bruce N.|last2=Carpenter|first3=Joshua N.|last3=Hook|first4=Sheila|last4=Garos|first5=Jill C.|last5=Manning|first6=Randy|last6=Gilliland|first7=Erin B.|last7=Cooper|first8=Heather|last8=McKittrick|first9=Margarit|last9=Davtian|first10=Timothy|last10=Fong|date=1 November 2012|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=9|issue=11|pages=2868–2877|accessdate=28 August 2017|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02936.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[DSM-IV-TR]], published in 2000, includes an entry called "Sexual Disorder—Not Otherwise Specified" (Sexual Disorder NOS), for disorders that are clinically significant but do not have code. The DSM-IV-TR notes that Sexual Disorder NOS would apply to, among other conditions, "distress about a pattern of repeated sexual relationships involving a succession of lovers who are experienced by the individual only as things to be used".&lt;ref name=APA2000&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders'' (4th ed., text revision). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4627">An '''infection rate''' (or incident rate) is the [[probability]] or [[risk]] of an [[infection]] in a [[population]]. It is used to measure the [[Rate (mathematics)|frequency of occurrence]] of new instances of infection within a population during a specific time period.

[[File:Infection rate formula.jpg|center|500px||A formula that describes the incidence of infection within a population]]

The number of infections equals the cases identified in the study or observed. An example might by [[HIV|HIV infection]] during a specific time period in the defined population. The population at risk are the cases appearing in the population during the same time period. An example would be all the people in a city during a specific time period. The constant, or K is assigned a value of 100 to represent a percentage. An example would be to find the percentage of people in a city who are infected with HIV: 6,000 cases in March divided by the population of a city (one million) multiplied by the constant (K) would give an infection rate of 0.6%.

Calculating the infection rate is used to analyze trends for the purpose of infection and disease control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Calculation of Infection Rates|url = http://health.utah.gov/epi/diseases/HAI/resources/Cal_Inf_Rates.pdf |publisher = Utah Department of Health|date= 2017| accessdate = 2017-01-09  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online infection rate calculator has been developed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] that allows the determination of the [[Streptococcus|Streptococcal A infection]] rate in a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Group A Streptococcus Calculator | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date= 4 July 2008 |url = https://www2a.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/abcs/calc/calc_new/calculator.html

==Clinical applications==
[[Health facility|Health care facilities]] routinely track their infection rates according to the guidelines issued by the [[Joint Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Basic Statistical Data Used in Acute Care Facilities | publisher = JB Learning | url = http://www.jblearning.com/samples/0763750344/45561_CH01.pdf | accessdate = 2017-01-09  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hospital-acquired infection|healthcare-associated infection]] (HAI) rates measure infection of patients in a particular hospital. This allows rates to compared with other hospitals. These infections can often be [[Infection control|prevented]] when healthcare facilities follow guidelines for safe care. To get payment from [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], hospitals are required to report data about some infections to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Hospitals currently submit information on [[Central line-associated bloodstream infection|central line-associated bloodstream infections]] (CLABSIs), [[Catheter-associated urinary tract infection|catheter-associated urinary tract infections]] (CAUTIs), [[Surgical site infection|surgical site infections]] (SSIs), [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA Bacteremia]], and ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|C. difficile]]'' laboratory-identified events. The public reporting of these data is an effort by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) data | publisher = Medicare.gov| url = https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/Data/Healthcare-Associated-Infections.html | accessdate = 2017-01-09  }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For meaningful comparisons of infection rates, populations must be very similar between the two or more assessments. However, a problem with mean rates is that they cannot reflect differences in risk between populations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= NHSN Standardized Infection Ratio |url = https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps-analysis-resources/nhsn-sir-guide.pdf | accessdate = 2017-01-09 | date= December 2016 }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11886">The '''insulin index''' of a food represents how much it elevates the concentration of [[insulin]] in the blood during the two-hour period after the food is ingested. The index is similar to the [[glycemic index]] (GI) and [[glycemic load]] (GL), but rather than relying on [[blood glucose]] levels, the Insulin Index is based upon blood insulin levels. The Insulin Index represents a comparison of food portions with equal overall caloric content (250 kcal or 1000 kJ), while GI represents a comparison of portions with equal digestible carbohydrate content (typically 50 g) and the GL represents portions of a typical serving size for various foods. The Insulin Index can be more useful than either the glycemic index or the glycemic load because certain foods (e.g., lean meats and proteins) cause an insulin response despite there being no [[carbohydrate]]s present, and some foods cause a disproportionate insulin response relative to their carbohydrate load.

Holt et al.&lt;ref name=Holt1997/&gt; have noted that the glucose and insulin scores of most foods are highly correlated,&lt;ref name="Cure for Diabetes"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gabriel |last=Cousens |title=There Is a Cure for Diabetes: The Tree of Life 21-Day+ Program |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2aTatu9P_XwC&amp;pg=PT144 |year=2008 |publisher=North Atlantic Books |isbn=978-1-55643-691-8 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; but high-protein foods and bakery products that are rich in fat and refined carbohydrates "elicit insulin responses that were disproportionately higher than their glycemic responses." They also conclude that insulin indices may be useful for dietary management and avoidance of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia.

==Explanation of Index==
The Insulin Index is not the same as a glycemic index (GI), which is based exclusively on the digestible carbohydrate content of a food, and represents a comparison of foods in amounts with equal digestible carbohydrate content (typically 50 g). The insulin index compares foods in amounts with equal overall caloric content (250 kcal or 1000 kJ). Insulin indexes are scaled relative to white bread, while glycemic index scores nowadays are usually scaled with respect to pure glucose, although in the past white bread has been a reference point for GI measurements as well.
In the chart below, glycemic and insulin scores show the increase in the blood concentration of each. A higher [[satiety]] score indicates how much less was eaten from a buffet after participants ate the listed food.

Glucose (glycemic) and insulin scores were determined by feeding 1000 kilojoules (239 kilocalories) of the food to the participants and recording the area under the glucose/insulin curve for 120 minutes then dividing by the area under the glucose/insulin curve for white bread.  The result being that all scores are relative to [[white bread]]. The satiety score was determined by comparing how satiated participants felt within two hours after being fed a fixed number of calories (240 kilocalories) of a particular food while blindfolded (to ensure food appearance was not a factor), then dividing that number by how satiated the participants felt after eating white bread.
White bread serves as the baseline of 100. In other words, foods scoring higher than 100 are more satisfying than white bread and those under 100 are less satisfying. The satiety score was negatively correlated to the amount eaten by participants at a subsequent buffet.

± indicate uncertainty in the data.  For example 60 ± 12 means that there's a 95% chance the score is between 60-12 (48) and 60+12 (72), 60 being the highest probability assuming a bell curve.  In practice this means that if two foods have large uncertainty and have values close together then you don't really know which score is the higher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2051">'''Invoke Image Display''' (IID) is an IHE Integration Profile that simplifies the task of integrating non-image-aware systems like EHRs, EMRs, PHRs, RIS and other information systems with image-aware systems like [[Picture Archiving and Communications Systems|PACS]], [[Vendor Neutral Archive|VNA]] and Image Sharing solutions, by providing a standard mechanism to request that imaging studies be displayed.

==Implementation==
'''IID''' defines a simple HTTP GET request that contains in the URL either a patient identifier or a list of study identifiers, and a small set of additional parameters to dictate display behavior.

The profile specifies requirements for the display to provide interactive viewing of a complete set of diagnostic images, if requested. The interactivity required includes windowing, zooming and panning as well as image navigation.

Security is addressed through normal HTTP mechanisms.

The display can take the form of a browser based viewer, a separate applet, plugin or thick client based viewer or even a separate physical machine; the invocation remains the same and is agnostic to the viewer implementation mechanism.

==Specification==

The profile is defined as part of the [http://www.ihe.net/Resources/Technical_Frameworks/#radiology IHE Radiology Technical Framework].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Radiology Technical Committee|first=IHE|title=Invoke Image Display (IID) - Trial Implementation|url=http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/upload/IHE_RAD_Suppl_IID.pdf|accessdate=2017-07-03|date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''John E. Fogarty International Center''' was founded in 1968 by US President [[Lyndon Johnson]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] to support international medical and behavioral research and to train international researchers.

==History==
On July 1, 1968 President [[Lyndon Johnson]] issued an Executive Order establishing the [[John E. Fogarty]] International Center for Advanced Study in the Health Sciences at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) in order to support international medical and behavioral research and to train international researchers..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fogarty International Center|url=http://www.fic.nih.gov/|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, the [[Trump Administration]] proposed cuts to the NIH budget, including elimination of the Fogarty Center, saving $69 million.&lt;ref&gt;Donald G.

'''LTIFR''' refers to '''Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate,''' the number of lost time [[injury|injuries]] occurring in a [[workplace]] per 1 million hours worked. An LTIFR of 7, for example, shows that 7 lost time injuries occur on a jobsite every 1 million hours worked. The formula gives a picture of how safe a workplace is for its workers.

Lost time injuries (LTI) include all on-the-job injuries that require a person to stay away from work more than 24 hours, or which result in [[death]] or permanent [[disability]]. This definition comes from the [[Australia]]n standard 1885.1– 1990 Workplace Injury and Disease Recording Standard.&lt;ref&gt;Lost time injury frequency rates (LTIFR) http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/statistics/ltifr/pages/lost-time-injury-frequency-rates Safe Work Australia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Workplace Injury and Disease Recording Standard in the Workplace http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/about/publications/pages/ns1990injuryanddiseaserecording Safe Work Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leukorrhea''' or ('''leucorrhoea''' [[American and British English spelling differences|British English]]) is a thick, whitish or yellowish [[vaginal discharge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|five/000058899|leukorrhea}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of LEUKORRHEA|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/leukorrhea|website = www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001911.htm|title=Hormonal effects in newborns: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many causes of leukorrhea, the usual one being [[estrogen]] imbalance.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The amount of discharge may increase due to [[vaginal infection]] or [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]], and it may disappear and reappear from time to time. This discharge can keep occurring for years, in which case it becomes more yellow and foul-smelling. It is usually a non-pathological symptom secondary to [[inflammation|inflammatory]] conditions of vagina or [[cervix]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = leukorrhea {{!}} medical disorder|url = http://www.britannica.com/science/leukorrhea|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leukorrhea can be confirmed by finding &gt;10 [[white blood cell|WBC]] under a microscope when examining vaginal fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Workowski, Kimberly A., and Stuart Berman. "Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010." Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 17 Dec. 2010. Web. 28 Oct. 2014. &lt;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5912a1.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaginal discharge is not abnormal, and causes of change in discharge include infection, malignancy, and hormonal changes. It sometimes occurs before a girl has her first [[menstruation|period]], and is considered a sign of [[puberty]].

==Physiologic leukorrhea==
It is not a major issue but is to be resolved as soon as possible. It can be a natural defense mechanism that the vagina uses to maintain its chemical balance, as well as to preserve the flexibility of the vaginal tissue. The term "physiologic leukorrhea" is used to refer to leukorrhea due to estrogen stimulation.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4160-0159-X"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Behrman, Richard E. |author2=Kliegman, Robert |author3=Karen Marcdante |author4=Jenson, Hal B. |title=Nelson essentials of pediatrics |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2006 |pages=348 |isbn=1-4160-0159-X |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leukorrhea may occur normally during [[pregnancy]]. This is caused by increased bloodflow to the vagina due to increased estrogen. Female [[infant]]s may have leukorrhea for a short time after birth due to their in-uterine exposure to estrogen.

Leukorrhea can also be caused by sexual stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=Max|title=The Treatment of Leukorrhea|journal=Medical Clinics of North America|date=May 1940|volume=24|issue=3|pages=911–917|doi=10.1016/S0025-7125(16)36728-1|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025712516367281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inflammatory leukorrhea==
It may also result from [[inflammation]] or congestion of the vaginal [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]]. In cases where it is yellowish or gives off an odor, a doctor should be consulted since it could be a sign of several disease processes, including an organic bacterial infection ([[aerobic vaginitis]]) or [[sexually transmitted disease|STD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = leukorrhea|url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/leukorrhea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Childbirth|delivery]], leukorrhea accompanied by backache and foul-smelling [[lochia]] ([[post-partum]] vaginal discharge, containing blood, mucus, and [[placenta]]l tissue) may suggest the failure of [[Involution (medicine)|involution]] (the [[uterus]] returning to pre-pregnancy size) due to infection. A number of investigation such as [[wet smear]], [[Gram stain]], culture, [[pap smear]] and biopsy are suggested to diagnose the condition.

==Parasitic leukorrhea==
Leukorrhea is also caused by trichomonads, a group of [[parasitic]] [[protozoan]], specifically ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]''. Common symptoms of this disease are burning sensation, itching and discharge of frothy substance, thick, white or yellow mucous.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Textbook of Biology|last = Dhami|first = P.S|publisher = Pradeep Publications|year = 2015|isbn = |location = Jalandhar, Punjab|pages = 1/79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Leukorrhea may be caused by sexually transmitted diseases; therefore, treating the STD will help treat the leukorrhea.

Treatment may include [[antibiotics]], such as [[metronidazole]]. Other antibiotics common for the treatment of STDs include [[clindamycin]] or [[trinidazole]].&lt;ref&gt;"Treatments for Specific Types of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STDs/STIs)." Treatments for Specific Types of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STDs/STIs). Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, n.d. Web. 28 Oct. 2014. &lt;http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/stds/conditioninfo/Pages/specific.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Causes, Symptoms, Treatment and Diet for Leucorrhoea|url = http://www.diethealthclub.com/health-issues-and-diet/womens-ailments/leucorrhoea.html|website = www.diethealthclub.com|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word leukorrhea comes from Greek λευκός (leukós, “white”) + ῥοία (rhoía, “flow, flux”). In Latin leukorrhea is ''fluor albus''.

{{main|Ecological footprint}}

This is a '''list of countries by ecological footprint'''. The table is based on data spanning from 1961 to 2013 from the
[[Global Footprint Network]]'s National Footprint Accounts published in 2016. Numbers are given in [[global hectares]] per capita. The
world-average [[ecological footprint]] in 2012 was 2.84 [[global hectares]] per person (22.1 billion in total). With a world-average [[biocapacity]] of 1.73 global hectares (gha) per person (9.2 billion in total), this leads to a global ecological deficit of 1.1 global hectares per person (7.8 billion in total).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For humanity, having a footprint smaller than the planet's biocapacity is a necessary condition for sustainability. After all, ecological overuse is only possible temporarily. A country that consumes more, on average, than 1.73 gha per person has a resource demand that is not replicable world-wide. Vice versa, with a footprint below 1.73 gha per person, is not necessarily sustainable, because the quality of the footprint may still lead to ecological destruction. If a country does not have enough ecological resources within its own territory to cover its population's footprint, then it runs an ecological deficit and the country is termed an ''ecological debtor''. Otherwise, it has an ecological reserve and it is called a ''creditor''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Countries ==

'' This table below is based on 2012 results (National Footprint Accounts edition 2016). The latest edition (2018) is available on Global Footprint Network's website at http://data.footprintnetwork.org. Note that this list contains only 188 countries, covering most of the countries with more than one million inhabitants.''

Malignant neoplasms are also simply known as [[cancers]]. ''Tumor'' ([[American English]]) or ''tumour'' ([[British English]]), Latin for ''swelling'', one of the cardinal signs of inflammation, originally meant any form of [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], neoplastic or not. Current English, however, both medical and non-medical, uses ''tumor'' as a synonym for a neoplasm (a solid or fluid-filled cystic [[lesion]] that may or may not be formed by an abnormal growth of neoplastic cells) that appears enlarged in size.Some neoplasms do not form a tumor; these include [[leukemia]] and most forms of [[carcinoma in situ]]. ''Tumor'' is also not synonymous with ''[[cancer]].''

'''Mad Pride''' is a mass movement of the users of [[mental health]] services, former users, and the aligned, and that individuals with mental illness should be proud of their 'mad' identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themighty.com/2017/03/healing-voices-mad-pride/|title=The Power of 'Healing Voices'|publisher=The Mighty|first=Oryx|last=Cohen|date=9 March 2017|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed in 1993 in response to local community prejudices towards people with a psychiatric history living in boarding homes in the Parkdale area of [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, and an event has been held every year since then in the city except for 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csinfo.ca/bulletin.html  |first=Geoffrey |last=Reaume |title=A History of Psychiatric Survivor Pride Day during the 1990s |publisher=The Consumer/Survivor Information Resource Centre Bulletin, No. 374 |date=July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar movement began around the same time in the United Kingdom. By the late 1990s similar events were being organized under the Mad Pride name around the globe, including Australia, Ireland, Portugal, Brazil, Madagascar, South Africa and the United States. Events draw thousands of participants, according to [[MindFreedom International]], a United States mental health advocacy organization that promotes and tracks events spawned by the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html?partner=rssnyt 'Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mad Pride activists seek to reclaim terms such as "[[Insanity|mad]]", "[[nutter (disambiguation)|nutter]]", and "[[psychosis|psycho]]" from misuse, such as in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers and in order to switch it from a negative view into a positive view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html|title=Mad Pride’ Fights a Stigma|publisher=New York Times|first=Gabriell|last=Glaser|date=11 May 2008|accessdate=19 September 2018|deadurl= |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through a series of [[mass media]] campaigns, Mad Pride activists seek to re-educate the general public on such subjects as the causes of [[mental disorder|mental disabilities]], the experiences of those using the mental health system, and the global [[suicide]] pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  One of Mad Pride's founding activists in the UK was [[Pete Shaughnessy]], who later died by suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentalmagazine.co.uk/pete_shaughnessy.htm#petemain Pete Shaughnessy r.i.p.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Roberts, [[Robert Dellar]] (who died in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/activists-mourn-robert-dellar-co-founder-of-mad-pride-and-a-tenacious-force-for-good/|title=Activists mourn Robert Dellar, co-founder of Mad Pride and a ‘tenacious force for good’|date=2016-12-22|work=Disability News Service|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Simon Barnet were among the other founders of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/mad-pride-remembering-the-uks-mental-health-pride-movement&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Mad Pride:  A celebration of mad culture'' records the early Mad Pride movement.&lt;ref name="Mad Pride"&gt;{{cite book |author=Theodore R Curtis |year=1996 |title=Mad Pride |publisher=Spare Change Books |location=Hackney, London |isbn=0-95257-445-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Our Own: Patient-Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System'', published in 1978 by [[Judi Chamberlin]], is a foundational text in the Mad Pride movement, although it was published before the movement was launched.&lt;ref name="TBG"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawrence|first=J.M.|title=Judi Chamberlin, writings took on mental health care|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/arlington/articles/2010/01/20/judi_chamberlin_writings_took_on_mental_health_care/?page=full|accessdate=4 March 2011|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known event, specifically organized as a Pride event by people who identified as [[Psychiatric survivors movement|survivors, consumers or ex-patients of psychiatric practices]], was held on 18 September 1993, when it was called "Psychiatric Survivor Pride Day".

==[[Mad Studies]]==
[[Mad Studies]] grew out of Mad Pride and survivor thinking, and focuses on developing scholarly thinking around "mental health" by academics who self-identify as mad. As noted in ''Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies'' (LeFrançois, Menzies and Reaume, 2013),&lt;ref name="brenda"&gt;Brenda LeFrançois, Robert Menzies and Geoffrey Reaume, editors (2013) ''Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies'', Toronto, Canadian Scholars’ Press Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-55130-534-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mad Studies can be defined in general terms as a project of inquiry, knowledge production, and political action devoted to the critique and transcendence of psy-centred ways of thinking, behaving, relating, and being".&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt;{{rp|13}}  As a book, {{"'}}Mad Matters' offers a critical discussion of mental health and madness in ways that demonstrate the struggles, oppression, resistance, agency and perspectives of Mad people to challenge dominant understandings of ‘mental illness’".&lt;ref name="cas"&gt;Mark Anthony Castrodale (2014) "Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies", ''Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research'', {{doi|10.1080/15017419.2014.895415}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  "''Mad Studies'' is a growing, evolving, multi-voiced and interdisciplinary field of activism, theory, praxis and scholarship."&lt;ref name="cas" /&gt;{{rp|1}}

== History ==
Mad Pride was launched alongside a book of the same name, ''Mad Pride:  A celebration of mad culture'', published in 2000.&lt;ref name="Mad Pride" /&gt;  On May 11, 2008, Gabrielle Glaser documented Mad Pride in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="'Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma"&gt;{{cite news |author=Gabrielle Glaser |title='Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma |work= The New York Times |date= May 11, 2008 | publisher= The New York Times Company |access-date= May 11, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glaser stated, "Just as gay-rights activists reclaimed the word [[queer]] as a [[gay pride|badge of honor]] rather than a slur, these advocates proudly call themselves mad; they say their conditions do not preclude them from productive lives."

=== Early origins ===
[[Elizabeth Packard]] (1816-1897) was deemed insane by her husband as she did not agree with his conservative political views. In Illinois at the time, involuntary admission to an asylum did not require a public hearing so long as it was a husband admitting his wife.&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt; Due to this, Packard was institutionalized though she saw herself to be sane. In Packard’s lifetime to be labeled as ‘mad’ was a form of social disapproval. However, she felt solidarity among Mad people due to her experience in the institution. Though she did not personally identify as Mad and had to identify as ‘sane’ in order to be an activist, it is here that we see early forms of organizing from ex-patients.&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt;

==Mad culture and events==
[[File:2016-05-16-Mad Pride Köln 2016-4988.jpg|thumb|Bed Push at Mad Pride parade in Cologne, Germany, in 2016]]
The Mad Pride movement has spawned recurring cultural events in [[Toronto]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and other cities around the world.  These events often include music, poetry readings, film screenings, and [[street theatre]], such as "bed push" protests, which aim to raise awareness about the poor levels of choice of treatments and the widespread [[Involuntary treatment|use of force]] in [[psychiatric hospital]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedpush.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2 The Great Escape Bed Push]&lt;/ref&gt; Past events have included British journalist [[Jonathan Freedland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/08/health.healthandwellbeing |title=Glad to be 'mad'? |work=The Guardian |first=Jo |last=Brand |date=2007-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104141912/http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/may/08/health.healthandwellbeing |archivedate=November 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and popular novelist Clare Allan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Misplaced pride |work=Guardian Unlimited |first=Clare |last=Allan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,1881476,00.html |date=2006-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109101343/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0%2C%2C1881476%2C00.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mad Pride cultural events take a variety of forms, such as the South London collective Creative Routes, the Chipmunka Publishing enterprise, and the many works of Dolly Sen.&lt;ref&gt;Dolly Sen (October 2002) ''World Is Full of Laughter:  1 Million People Commit Suicide Every Year'', Chipmunka Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-95422-181-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bed push===
[[File:peteshaughnessy.jpg|thumb|A flyer for a 2003 Mad Pride event.]]
A Bed Push is a method of activism employed by multiple mental health agencies and advocates as a method of raising awareness about psychiatric care. Activists wheel a gurney through public spaces to provoke discussion about mental health care. [[Mind Freedom]] has a recipe for a successful Bed Push on their website, urging participants to remain peaceful but also be seen by blowing horns, slightly disrupting traffic and playing music.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfreedom.org/campaign/madpride/other-info/how-to/bed-push-tips&lt;/ref&gt; Often patients in psychiatric care feel silenced and powerless, showing resilience in the face of that and securing visibility is a method of regaining dignity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfreedom.org/campaign/media/mf-journal&lt;/ref&gt;

Mad Pride Week in Toronto is proclaimed as such by the city itself.&lt;ref name="blogto.com"&gt;http://www.blogto.com/city/2009/07/mad_pride_breaks_the_stigma_of_mental_illness/&lt;/ref&gt; The festivities surrounding this week are highlighted by the Mad Pride Bed Push, typically on the 14th of July. The event takes place Toronto’s Queen Street West “to raise public awareness about the use of force and lack of choice for people ensnared in the Ontario mental health system” &lt;ref&gt;Brenda LeFrançois, Robert Menzies and Geoffrey Reaume, editors (2013) Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies, Toronto, Canadian Scholars’ Press Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-55130-534-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This week is officially run by Toronto Mad Pride which partners a number of mental health agencies in the city. In recent years, some advocates have pushed for [[Parkdale, Toronto]] to be renamed MAD! Village, to reclaim pride in its surrounding communities' long history of struggle with mental health and addictions &lt;ref name="blogto.com"/&gt;

A series of bed push events take place around London each year.

=== Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours ===
The Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours take place in Toronto, ON at the CAMH facility on Queen St West. The tours show the patient built walls from the 19th century that are located at present day CAMH. The purpose of the tours is to give a history on the lives of the patients who built the walls, and bring attention to the harsh realities of psychiatry.

Geoffrey Reaume and Heinz Klein first came up with the idea of walking tours as part of a Mad Pride event in 2000. The first wall tour occurred on what is now known as Mad Pride Day, on July 14, 2000, with an attendance of about fifty people. Reaume solely leads the tours, and they have grown from annual events for Mad Pride, to occurring several times throughout the year in all non-winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://activehistory.ca/papers/historypaper-10/|title=Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, 2000 – 2010|date=2011-04-19|work=ActiveHistory.ca|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''medical guideline''' (also called a '''clinical guideline''' or '''clinical practice line''') is a document with the aim of guiding decisions and criteria regarding diagnosis, management, and treatment in specific areas of [[healthcare]]. Such documents have been in use for thousands of years during the entire [[history of medicine]]. However, in contrast to previous approaches, which were often based on tradition or authority, modern medical guidelines are based on an examination of current evidence within the paradigm of [[evidence-based medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Burgers JS, Grol R, Klazinga NS, Mäkelä M, Zaat J | year = 2011 | title = Towards evidence-based clinical practice: an international survey of 18 clinical guideline programs | url = | journal = Int J Qual Health Care | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 31–45 | doi=10.1093/intqhc/15.1.31| pmid = 12630799 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12571340 | volume=12 | issue=1 | title=Development and validation of an international appraisal instrument for assessing the quality of clinical practice guidelines: the AGREE project | pmc=1743672 | journal=Qual Saf Health Care | pages=18–23| year=2003 | author1=AGREE Collaboration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine (edt.) [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13058 Clinical practice guidelines we can trust]. Washington DC, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They usually include summarized [[consensus (medical)|consensus statements]] on best practice in [[healthcare]]. A healthcare provider is obliged to know the medical guidelines of his or her profession, and has to decide whether to follow the recommendations of a guideline for an individual treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. [http://www.leitlinien.de/mdb/edocs/pdf/literatur/coe-rec-2001-13.pdf Developing a methodology for drawing up guidelines on best medical practice. Recommendation Rec(2001)13 and explanatory memorandum. Strasbourg: Council of Europe Publishing, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

Modern clinical guidelines identify, summarize and evaluate the highest quality evidence and most current data about [[preventive medicine|prevention]], [[diagnosis]], [[prognosis]], therapy including dosage of medications, [[risk-benefit analysis|risk/benefit]] and [[cost-effectiveness]]. Then they define the most important questions related to clinical practice and identify all possible [[decision-making|decision options]] and their [[upside outcomes|outcomes]]. Some guidelines contain decision or computation [[algorithm (medical)|algorithms]] to be followed. Thus, they integrate the identified decision points and respective courses of action with the clinical judgment and experience of practitioners. Many guidelines place the treatment alternatives into classes to help providers in deciding which treatment to use.

Additional objectives of clinical guidelines are to [[standardization|standardize]] medical care, to raise quality of care, to reduce several kinds of risk (to the patient, to the healthcare provider, to [[medical insurance|medical insurers]] and health plans) and to achieve the best balance between cost and medical parameters such as [[effectiveness]], [[specificity (tests)|specificity]], [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]], resolutiveness, etc. It has been demonstrated repeatedly that the use of guidelines by healthcare providers such as [[hospitals]] is an effective way of achieving the objectives listed above, although they are not the only ones.

Guidelines are usually produced at national or international levels by medical associations or governmental bodies, such as the United States [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]]. Local healthcare providers may produce their own set of guidelines or adapt them from existing top-level guidelines.

Special [[computer software]] packages known as [[guideline execution engine]]s have been developed to facilitate the use of medical guidelines in concert with an [[electronic medical record]] system. 
The [[Guideline Interchange Format]] (GLIF) is a computer representation format for clinical guidelines that can be used with such engines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openclinical.org/gmm_glif.html GLIF website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The USA and other countries maintain medical guideline [[wikt:clearing house|clearinghouses]]. In the USA, the [[National Guideline Clearinghouse]] maintains a catalog of high-quality guidelines published by various health and medical associations. In the United Kingdom, clinical practice guidelines are published primarily by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE). In The Netherlands, two bodies—the [[:nl:Centraal BegeleidingsOrgaan|Institute for Healthcare Improvement]] (CBO) and [[:nl:Nederlands Huisartsen Genootschap|College of General Practitioners]] (NHG)—have published specialist and primary care guidelines, respectively. In Germany, the [[German Agency for Quality in Medicine]] (ÄZQ) coordinates a national program for disease management guidelines. All these organisations are now members of the [[Guidelines International Network]] (G-I-N), an international network of organisations and individuals involved in clinical practice guidelines.

[[Checklists]] have been used  in medical practice to attempt to ensure that clinical practice guidelines are followed. An example is the Surgical Safety Checklist developed for the [[World Health Organization]] by Dr. [[Atul Gawande]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haynes|first1=Alex B.|last2=Weiser|first2=Thomas G.|last3=Berry|first3=William R.|last4=Lipsitz|first4=Stuart R.|last5=Breizat|first5=Abdel-Hadi S.|last6=Dellinger|first6=E.

==Problems==
Guidelines may lose their clinical relevance as they age and newer research emerges.&lt;ref name="pmid11572738"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shekelle PG|author2=Ortiz E|author3=Rhodes S|title=Validity of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality clinical practice guidelines: how quickly do guidelines become outdated? |journal=JAMA |volume=286 |issue=12 |pages=1461–7 |date=2001 |pmid=11572738 |doi=10.1001/jama.286.12.1461|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even 20% of strong recommendations, especially when based on opinion rather than trials, from practice guidelines may be retracted.&lt;ref name="pmid24867012"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Neuman MD| author2=Goldstein JN| author3=Cirullo MA| author4=Schwartz JS| title=Durability of class I American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association clinical practice guideline recommendations | journal=JAMA | date= 2014 | volume= 311 | issue= 20 | pages= 2092–100 | doi=10.1001/jama.2014.4949 | pmid=24867012| pmc=4346183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in 2004 that some simple clinical practice guidelines are not routinely followed to the extent they might be.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gina Kolata]] "[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/25/health/25medicine.html Program Coaxes Hospitals to See Treatments Under Their Noses]". ''[[The New York Times]]'' December 25, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that providing a [[nurse]] or other medical assistant with a [[checklist]] of recommended procedures can result in the attending physician being reminded in a timely manner regarding procedures that might have been overlooked.

Guidelines may have both methodological problems and conflict of interest.&lt;ref name="pmid23752105"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Reames BN| author2=Krell RW| author3=Ponto SN| author4=Wong SL| title=Critical evaluation of oncology clinical practice guidelines | journal=J Clin Oncol | date= 2013 | volume= 31 | issue= 20 | pages= 2563–8 | pmid=23752105 | doi=10.1200/JCO.2012.46.8371 | pmc=5073383}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the quality of guidelines may vary substantially, especially for guidelines that are published on-line and have not had to follow methodological reporting standards often required by reputable clearinghouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Norberg MM, Turner MW, Rooke SE, Langton JM, Gates PJ | year = 2012 | title = An Evaluation of Web-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines for Managing Problems Associated with Cannabis Use | journal = J Med Internet Res | volume = 14 | issue = 6| page = e169 | doi = 10.2196/jmir.2319 | pmid = 23249447 | pmc=3799569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guidelines may make recommendations that are stronger than the supporting evidence.&lt;ref name="pmid23783104"&gt;{{cite journal| display-authors=4| author=Brito JP| author2=Domecq JP| author3=Murad MH| author4=Guyatt GH| author5=Montori VM| title=The Endocrine Society guidelines: when the confidence cart goes before the evidence horse | journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab | date= 2013 | volume= 98 | issue= 8 | pages= 3246–52 | doi=10.1210/jc.2013-1814 | pmid=23783104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to many of these problems with traditional guidelines, the BMJ created a new series of trustworthy guidelines focused on the most pressing medical issues called ''BMJ'' Rapid Recommendations.&lt;ref name="siemieniuk1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siemieniuk RA, Agoritsas T, Macdonald H, Guyatt GH, Brandt L, Vandvik PO | year = 2016 | title = TIntroduction to BMJ Rapid Recommendations | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i5191.long | journal = BMJ | volume = 354 | issue = | pages = i5191 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.i5191 | pmid = 27680768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''men's rights movement''' ('''MRM''') is a part of the larger [[men's movement]]. It branched off from the [[men's liberation movement]] in the early 1970s. The men's rights movement is notably [[anti-feminist]] and made up of a variety of groups and individuals who focus on numerous social issues (including [[family law]], [[parenting]], [[reproduction]], [[domestic violence against men]] and opposition to [[circumcision]]) and government services (including [[education]], [[Conscription|compulsory military service]], [[social safety net]]s, and health policies), which men's rights advocates say discriminate against men.

Scholars have described the men's rights movement or parts of the movement as a [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] against [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=backlash/&gt;

Claims and activities associated with the men's rights movement have been criticized and labeled hateful and violent by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Goldwag | first = Arthur|title=Hatewatch: Intelligence report article provokes fury among Men's Rights Activists|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2012/05/15/intelligence-report-article-provokes-fury-among-mens-rights-activists|website=splcenter.org/hatewatch|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]| date = May 15, 2012|accessdate = May 5, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Political Research Associates]].&lt;ref name="politicalresearch.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.politicalresearch.org/2011/03/01/fathers-rights-groups-threaten-womens-gains-and-their-safety/|title=Father’s Rights Groups Threaten Women’s Gains—And Their Safety |website=[[Political Research Associates]] |language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the Southern Poverty Law Center categorized some men's rights groups as being part of a hate ideology under the umbrella of [[patriarchy]] and [[Patriarchy|male supremacy]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/male-supremacy|title=Male Supremacy|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement and sectors of the movement have been described as [[Misogyny|misogynistic]],&lt;ref name="Ruzankina"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ruzankina | first = E.A. | title = Men's movements and male subjectivity | journal = Anthropology &amp; Archeology of Eurasia | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 8&amp;ndash;16 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.2753/aae1061-1959490101 | date = 2010 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2753/aae1061-1959490101 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and the perceived disadvantage some men feel is argued as often being due to loss of [[entitlement]] and privilege.&lt;ref name="GrauniadSep2016"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hackman | first = Rose | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/straight-while-men-suffering-sex-feminism | title=I didn’t choose to be straight, white and male': are modern men the suffering sex? | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=September 5, 2016 | accessdate=September 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Forerunners===
The term "men's rights" was used at least as early as February 1856 when it appeared in ''[[Putnam's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Staff writer | title = A word for men's rights | journal = [[Putnam's Magazine]] | volume = 7 | issue = 38 | pages = 208&amp;ndash;214 | publisher = [[G.

Three loosely connected men's rights organizations formed in [[Austria]] in the [[interwar period]]. The ''League for Men's Rights'' was founded in 1926 with the goal of "combatting all excesses of women's emancipation".&lt;ref name=geschichtsblaetter&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Der 'Bund für Männerrechte'.

They criticized marriage and family laws, especially the requirement to pay spousal and child support to former wives and [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] children, and supported the use of blood tests to determine paternity.&lt;ref name=geschichtsblaetter/&gt;&lt;ref name=uofvienna/&gt; ''Justitia'' and ''Aequitas'' issued their own short-lived journals ''Men's Rightists Newspaper'' and ''Self-Defense'' where they expressed their views that were heavily influenced by the works of [[Heinrich Schurtz]], [[Otto Weininger]], and [[Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels]]. The organizations ceased to exist before 1939.&lt;ref name=geschichtsblaetter/&gt;&lt;ref name=uofvienna/&gt;

The modern men's rights movement emerged from the [[men's liberation]] movement, which appeared in the first half of the 1970s when scholars began to study feminist ideas and politics.&lt;ref name="Messner 1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Messner | first = Michael A. | author-link = Michael Messner | title = The limits of "The Male Sex Role": an analysis of the men's liberation and men's rights movements' discourse | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 255&amp;ndash;276 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243298012003002 | jstor = 190285 | date = June 1998 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243298012003002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.michaelmessner.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Gender-Society-1998-MESSNER-255-76.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2004|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=bXZkmNTSQUAC&amp;pg=PA190 190–200]}} The men's liberation movement acknowledged men's institutionalized power while critically examining the consequences of hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name="Messner 1"/&gt; In the late 1970s, the men's liberation movement split into two separate strands with opposing views: the [[Pro-feminism#Pro-feminist men|pro-feminist men's movement]] and the [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] men's rights movement.&lt;ref name="Messner 1"/&gt; Men's rights activists have rejected feminist principles and focused on areas in which they believe men are disadvantaged, oppressed, or discriminated against.&lt;ref name="Messner 1"/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2004|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=bXZkmNTSQUAC&amp;pg=PA190 190–200]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Castella|first1=Tom|title=Just who are men's rights activists?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17907534|accessdate=7 March 2015|work=[[BBC News Magazine]]|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masculinities studies scholar [[Michael Kimmel]] notes that their critiques of gender roles "morphed into a celebration of all things masculine and a near infatuation with the traditional masculine role itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Angry White Men: American Masculinity at the End of an Era|last=Kimmel|first=Michael|publisher=The Nation Institute|year=2017|isbn=9781568589626|location=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WVGDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Angry+White+Men:+American+Masculinity+at+the+End+of+an+Era&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC0pKVlODbAhWxwFkKHZw3BTAQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Angry%20White%20Men%3A%20American%20Masculinity%20at%20the%20End%20of%20an%20Era&amp;f=false|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, men's rights activists opposed societal changes sought by feminists and defended the patriarchal gender order in the family, schools and the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lingard |first1= Bob |last2= Mills |first2= Martin |last3= Weaver-Hightower |first3= Marcus B. | title = Interrogating recuperative masculinity politics in schooling | journal = International Journal of Inclusive Education | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 407&amp;ndash;421 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13603116.2011.555095 | date = 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13603116.2011.555095 |quote= The concept of recuperative masculinity politics was developed by Lingard and Douglas (1999) to refer to both mythopoetic (Biddulph 1995, 2010; Bly 1990) and men's rights politics (Farrell 1993). Both of these rejected the move to a more equal gender order and more equal gender regimes in all of the major institutions of society (e.g. the family, schools, universities, workplaces) sought by feminists and most evident in the political and policy impacts in the 1980s and 1990s from second-wave feminism of the 1970s.

==Issues==
Men's rights proponents are concerned with a wide variety of matters, some of which have spawned their own groups or movements, such as the [[fathers' rights movement]], concerned specifically with [[divorce]] and [[child custody]] issues.{{sfn |Messner | 1997 |p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 41–48] }} Some, if not all, men's rights issues stem from [[gender roles]] and, according to sociologist Allan Johnson, [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Gender Knot: Unraveling our Patriarchal Legacy | publisher=Temple University Press | author=Johnson, Allan G. | year=2005 | location=Philadelphia | isbn=978-1592133833 | page=220 | quote= such problems are prominent in many men's lives, but this is no organized male response to the patriarchal system whose dynamics produce much of men's loss, suffering, and grief. Contrary to Bly's claim, it is not a parallel to the women's movement that is merely on a "different timetable." It may be a response to genuine emotional and spiritual needs that are met by bringing men together to drum, chant, and share stories and feelings from their lives. It may help to heal some of the damage patriarchy does to men's lives. But it is not a movement aimed at the system and the gender dynamics that actually cause that damage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He proposes that women be legally required to make every reasonable effort to notify the father of her pregnancy within four to five days.{{sfn|Farrell|2008|p=79–80}} In response, philosopher James P.

===Education===
{{see also|Sex differences in education}}
Men's rights adherents describe the education of boys as being in crisis, with boys having reduced educational achievement and motivation compared to girls.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; Advocates blame the influence of feminism on education for what they believe is discrimination against and systematic oppression of boys in the education system.&lt;ref name="MartinoKehler2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mills| first1 =Martin|last2=Francis| first2 = Becky|last3=Skelton| first3 = Christine|chapter=Gender policies in Australia and the United Kingdom|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouWMouuNuWAC&amp;pg=PA38|editor-last1= Martino | editor-first1 = Wayne|editor-last2= Kehler | editor-first2 = Michael |editor-last3= Weaver-Hightower | editor-first3 = Marcus B. |title=The problem with boys' education: beyond the backlash|date=8 June 2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-56023-683-2|pages=38–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/05/gender-gap-uk-degree-subjects-doubles-eight-years-ucas-study |title=Gender gap in UK degree subjects doubles in eight years, UCAS study finds |work=The Guardian &amp;#124; Education |date=5 January 2016 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They critique what they describe as the "feminization" of education, stating that the predominance of female teachers, a focus on girls' needs, as well as a curricula and assessment methods that supposedly favour girls, have proved repressive and restrictive to men and boys.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name="FrancisSkelton2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Becky Francis]]|author2=Christine Skelton|title=Reassessing gender and achievement: questioning contemporary key debates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XkkfekXzkZMC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=26 December 2011|date=27 September 2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33324-5|pages=18–19, 141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study has also found gender differences in academic achievement not being reliably linked to gender policies, and that female academic achievement is greater than boys' in 70% of studied countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = Gijsbert | last2 = Geary | first2 = David C. | title = Sex differences in academic achievement are not related to political, economic, or social equality | journal = [[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]] | volume = 48 | pages = 137&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2014.11.006 | date = January–February 2015 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2014.11.006 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is contradicted in Australia by ACARA's independent NAPLAN findings that "Since their introduction, a subtle but consistent pattern of gender differences in performance on the NAPLAN tests has emerged, with boys regularly outperforming girls in numeracy, and girls consistently outperforming boys in the reading, writing, spelling, and grammar and punctuation components".&lt;ref name="ro.ecu.edu.au"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leder | first1 = Gilah C. | last2 = Forgasz | first2 = Helen J. | last3 = Jackson | first3 = Glenda  | title = Mathematics, English and Gender Issues: Do Teachers Count? | journal = Australian Journal of Teacher Education | volume = 39 | issue = 9 | page = 2 | publisher = [[Edith Cowan University]] | doi = 10.14221/ajte.2014v39n9.3 | date = September 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.14221/ajte.2014v39n9.3 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2393&amp;context=ajte Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; To further add to the confusion with other evidence presented, there has been an obvious, unexplained and significant drop in the number of boys at university in most countries. Australia, for example, has seen a drop from 61% to 46% since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Parr|first=Nick |title=Who goes to university? The changing profile of our students |url=http://theconversation.com/who-goes-to-university-the-changing-profile-of-our-students-40373 |work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |date=24 May 2015 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar trends have been observed in the UK, which is thought to be influenced primarily by teacher policies and attitudes.&lt;ref name="ro.ecu.edu.au"/&gt;

Men's rights groups call for increased recognition of masculinity, greater numbers of male role models, more competitive sports, and the increased responsibilities for boys in the school setting. They have also advocated clearer school routines, more traditional school structures, including gender-[[Segregated education|segregated]] classrooms, and stricter discipline.&lt;ref name="FrancisSkelton2005"/&gt;

Critics suggest that men's rights groups view boys as a homogeneous group sharing common experiences of schooling and that they fail to account for how responses to educational approaches may differ by age, disability, culture, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, and class.&lt;ref name="FrancisSkelton2005"/&gt;

In Australia, men's rights discourse has influenced government policy documents. Compared to Australia, less impact has been noted in the United Kingdom, where feminists have historically had less influence on educational policy.&lt;ref name="MartinoKehler2009"/&gt; However, [[Mary Curnock Cook]], the UCAs chief executive, argued that in Britain "despite the clear evidence and despite the press coverage, there is a deafening policy silence on the issue. Has the women’s movement now become so normalised that we cannot conceive of needing to take positive action to secure equal education outcomes for boys?”&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Female privilege===
{{See also|Discrimination}}
The men's rights movement rejects the concept that men are privileged relative to women.&lt;ref name=clatter&gt;{{cite book|last=Clatterbaugh|first=Kenneth|title=Contemporary perspectives on masculinity: Men, women, and politics in modern society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfG8qCLMP9EC&amp;lpg|date=1996|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=978-0813327013|edition=Reissued 2nd.|page=11|quote=Indeed the premise of all men's rights literature is that men are ''not'' privileged relative to women... Having denied that men are privileged relative to women, this movement divides into those who believe that men and women are equally harmed by [[sexism]] and those who believe that society has become a bastion of female privilege and male degradation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is divided into two groups: those who consider men and women to be harmed equally by sexism, and those who view society as endorsing the degradation of men and upholding what they term "female privilege".&lt;ref name=clatter/&gt;

Connor et al. have rejected the idea of female privilege, as research since the early 90s on [[ambivalent sexism]] across the world has found that these "privileges" are [[benevolent sexism]], which contributes to women's oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Connor|first=Rachel|title=Ambivalent sexism in the 21st century|date=2016-01-01|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315637642_Ambivalent_sexism_in_the_21st_century|access-date=2018-09-09|last2=Glick|first2=Peter|last3=Fiske|first3=Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that the U.S. government having an Office of Research on Women's Health but no Office of Research on Men's Health, along with the U.S. federal government spending twice as much money on Women's health, shows that society considers men more disposable than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrell|first1=Warren|title=The Myth of Male Power: Why Men are The Disposable Sex|date=February 10, 2014|publisher= Dr. Warren Farrell|location=Chapter 7|edition=21st anniversary|url=http://warrenfarrell.org|accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military conscription===
Men's rights adherents have argued that sole military [[conscription]] of men is an example of discrimination against men.{{sfn |Messner | 1997 |p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 41–48] }}&lt;ref name="BoydLongwood1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Redeeming men: religion and masculinities|editor=Stephen Blake Boyd |editor2=W.

===Paternity fraud===
{{Main|Non-paternity event|paternity fraud}}
Men's and fathers' rights groups have said that there are high levels of mistaken paternity or "paternity fraud", where men are parenting and/or financially supporting children who are not biologically their own.&lt;ref name=cannold/&gt; They hold biological views of fatherhood, emphasizing the imperative of the genetic foundation of paternity rather than social aspects of fatherhood.&lt;ref name=cannold/&gt;&lt;ref name="RothsteinMurray2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Majumber, Mary Anderlik |editor=Mark A.

In addition, they say non-biological fathers are denied the resources to have their own biological children in another relationship.&lt;ref name=cannold/&gt;

To argue the issue of false accusations of rape, the categories of 'false' and 'unsubstantiated' are often conflated, such as the [[National Coalition for Men]] citing reports like the 1996 FBI summary that finds a rate of 8% for unsubstantiated forcible rape, which is four times higher than the average for all [[index crimes]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="ncfmrape" /&gt; Experts emphasize that ''verified'' false allegations are a distinct category from unsubstantiated allegations, and conflating the two is fallacious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lisak|first=David|last2=Gardinier|first2=Lori|last3=Nicksa|first3=Sarah C.|last4=Cote|first4=Ashley M.|date=December 2010|title=False allegations of sexual assault: an analysis of ten years of reported cases|journal=Violence Against Women|volume=16|issue=12|pages=1318–1334|doi=10.1177/1077801210387747|issn=1552-8448|pmid=21164210}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures are widely debated due to the questionable methodology and small sample sizes - see the [[False accusation of rape]] page for wider survey estimates.

It makes them vulnerable to false accusations for a variety of motivations that we know exists"}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the belief that sex within marriage is an irrevocable part of the institution of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Cathy |last= Young |title= Complexities cloud marital rape case; William Hetherington has spent nine years in a Michigan prison, but proclaims his innocence – controversial case that pits one person's word against another in accusations of spousal rape |date= August 1, 1994 |work= Insight on the News |quote= Much of his support has come from men's rights organizations and conservative Christian groups, which tend to argue that a crime such as marital rape should not be on the books because consent to sex is part of the marriage covenant.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Women, Gender and Everyday Social Transformation in India |editor1-last= Nielsen |editor1-first= Kenneth Bo |editor2-last= Waldrop |editor2-first= Anne |publisher= Anthem Press |location= London |year= 2014|isbn= 978-1-78-308269-8| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aA4iBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193 |page= 193}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, there has been anxiety about relationships&lt;ref name="Pandey2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pandey|first=Vineeta|title=Husbands can't get away with marital rape: Government|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_husbands-can-t-get-away-with-marital-rape-government_1356512|newspaper=DNA|accessdate=30 September 2012|quote="no relationship will work if these rules are enforced."|date=8 March 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331132152/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_husbands-can-t-get-away-with-marital-rape-government_1356512|archivedate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the future of marriage that such laws have given women "grossly disproportional rights".&lt;ref name=dhillon&gt;{{cite news |title=Women confident law will end culture of abuse |newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]] |url=http://www.scmp.com/node/569778|first= Amrit |last=Dhillon |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=11 October 2012|quote="The All India Harassed Husbands Association protested last week at the law.

==== Critique of men's rights rape discourse ====

Feminist scholars Lise Gotell and Emily Dutton argue that content on the [[manosphere]] reveals anti-feminist pro-rape arguments, including that sexual violence is a gender-neutral problem, feminists are responsible for erasing men's experiences of victimization, false allegations are widespread, and that [[rape culture]] is a feminist-produced moral panic. They contend it is important to engage [this topic] as there is a real danger that MRA (Men's Rights Activism) claims could come to define the popular conversation about sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gotell|first=Lise|year=2016|title=Sexual Violence in the 'Manosphere': Antifeminist Men's Rights Discourses on Rape|url=|journal=International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy|volume=5|pages=65–80|via=|doi=10.5204/ijcjsd.v5i2.310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproductive rights===
In 2006, the American [[National Center for Men]] backed a lawsuit known as ''[[Dubay v. Wells]]''. The case concerned whether men should have the opportunity to decline all paternity rights and responsibilities in the event of an unplanned pregnancy. Supporters argued that this would allow the woman time to make an informed decision and give men the same reproductive rights as women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Traister | first = R | date = 2006-03-13 | url = http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2006/03/13/roe_for_men/ | title = Roe for men? | publisher = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] | accessdate = 2007-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case and the appeal were dismissed, with the U.S. Court of Appeals (Sixth Circuit) stating that neither parent has the right to sever their financial responsibilities for a child and that "Dubay's claim that a man's right to disclaim fatherhood would be analogous to a woman's right to abortion rests upon a false analogy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/07a0442p-06.pdf |format=PDF|title=U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, case No. 06-11016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valenti2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jessica Valenti|title=Why Have Kids?: A New Mom Explores the Truth About Parenting and Happiness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXnxd2le7XYC&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=11 May 2013|year=2012|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-547-89261-0|pages=103–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social security and insurance===
Men's rights groups argue that women are given superior social security and tax benefits than men.{{sfn|Flood|2007| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jh7y6ELc90YC&amp;pg=PA430#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 430–433]}} Warren Farrell states that men in the United States pay more into social security, but in total, women receive more in benefits, and that discrimination against men in insurance and pensions have gone unrecognized.{{sfn|Farrell|1994|p=350}}

===Suicide===
{{Main|Gender differences in suicide}}
Men's rights activists point to higher [[suicide]] rates in men compared to women.&lt;ref name="HaywoodGhaill2003"/&gt;{{sfn|Menzies|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ASc568aunFoC&amp;pg=PA86 86]}} In the United States for example, the male-to-female suicide death ratio varies, approximately, between 3:1 and 10:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Teen Suicide Statistics | publisher=FamilyFirstAid.org | year=2001 | work=Adolescent Teenage Suicide Prevention | url=http://www.familyfirstaid.org/suicide.html | accessdate=2006-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies have found an over-representation of women in attempted or incomplete suicides and men in complete suicide.&lt;ref name="jad-journal.com"&gt;{{cite web|title = The gender paradox in suicidal behavior and its impact on the suicidal process - Journal of Affective Disorders|url = http://www.jad-journal.com/article/S0165-0327(11)00149-2/abstract|website = www.jad-journal.com|accessdate = 2015-12-23|subscription=yes|pmid=21529962}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon, termed the "gender paradox of suicide", is argued to derive from a tendency for females to use less lethal methods and greater male access and use of lethal methods.&lt;ref name="jad-journal.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.people-press.org/2013/03/12/section-3-gun-ownership-trends-and-demographics/ | title=Section 3: Gun Ownership Trends and Demographics | work=www.people-press.org | publisher=Pew Research Center | date=March 12, 2013 | accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Ruth M. Mann of the [[University of Windsor]] in Canada suggests that men's rights groups fuel an international rhetoric of hatred and victimization by disseminating misinformation via online forums and websites containing constantly-updated "diatribes against feminism, ex-wives, child support, shelters, and the family law and criminal justice systems".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Mann, these stories reignite their hatred and reinforce their beliefs that the system is biased against men and that feminism is responsible for a large scale and ongoing "cover-up" of men's victimization. Mann says that although existing legislation in Canada acknowledges that men are ''also'' victims of domestic violence, men's rights advocates demand government recognition that men are equally or ''more'' victimized by domestic violence, claims not supported by the data.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.brown.uk.com/domesticviolence/mann.pdf|title = Men's Rights and Feminist Advocacy in Canadian Domestic Violence Policy Arenas.|last = Mann|first = Ruth M.|date = 2008|journal = Feminist Criminology| volume = 3| issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/1557085107311067|pmid = |access-date =|pages=44–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann also states that in contrast to feminist groups, who have advocated for domestic violence services on behalf of other historically oppressed groups in addition to women, such as individuals impacted by poverty, ethnicity, disability, [[sexual orientation]], etc., men's rights groups have attempted to achieve their goals by actively opposing and attempting to dismantle services and supports put in place to protect abused women and children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Domestic abuse expert Lundy Bancroft has called men's rights "the abuser's crusade" and said that the attitudes of the movement contribute to abuse of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2014/05/06/domestic-violence-expert-lundy-bancroft-mens-rights-philosophies-make-angry-and-controlling-men-even-worse/|title=Domestic violence expert Lundy Bancroft: Men’s Rights philosophies make angry and controlling men even worse.|date=2014-05-06|work=We Hunted The Mammoth|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Framework ==
Mental health literacy has three major components: recognition, knowledge, and attitudes. A conceptual framework of mental health literacy illustrates the connections between components, and each is conceptualized as an area to target for measurement or intervention.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jorm|first=Anthony F.|year=2000|title=Mental health literacy: Public knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders|url=https://msrc.fsu.edu/system/files/Mental%20health%20literacy%20Public%20knowledge%20and%20beliefs%20about%20mental%20disorders.pdf|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=177|pages=396–401|via=|doi=10.1192/bjp.177.5.396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=Matt|last2=Casey|first2=Leanne|last3=Clough|first3=Bonnie|date=2014-08-01|title=Measuring mental health literacy – a review of scale-based measures|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/09638237.2014.910646|journal=Journal of Mental Health|volume=23|issue=4|pages=197–204|doi=10.3109/09638237.2014.910646|issn=0963-8237}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some researchers have focused on a single component, others have focused on multiple and/or the connection between components. For example, a researcher may focus solely on improving recognition of disorders through an education program, whereas another researcher may focus on integrating all three components into one program.

=== Recognition ===
Recognition can be broken down into symptom or illness recognition. Symptom recognition is the ability to detect beliefs, behaviors, and other physical manifestations of mental illness, without knowing explicitly which disorder they link to. Specific illness recognition is the ability to identify the presentation of a disorder, such as [[major depressive disorder]].

The recognition of difference between knowledge and attitudes is a crucial part of the mental health literacy framework. While some efforts have focused on promoting knowledge, other researchers have argued that changing attitudes by reducing stigma is a more prolific way of creating meaningful change in mental healthcare utilization. Overall, both approaches have benefits for improving outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corrigan|first=Patrick W.|last2=Morris|first2=Scott B.|last3=Michaels|first3=Patrick J.|last4=Rafacz|first4=Jennifer D.|last5=Rüsch|first5=Nicolas|title=Challenging the Public Stigma of Mental Illness: A Meta-Analysis of Outcome Studies|url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ps.201100529|journal=Psychiatric Services|volume=63|issue=10|pages=963–973|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.201100529|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Knowledge ===
Knowledge is the largest component of mental health literacy, and is divided into four sub-components:
* Where/how to get information: the networks and systems individuals use to get information about mental disorders. This may include friends, family, educators, or broader sources, such as entertainment or social media.
* Risk factors: what factors put individuals at greatest risk for specific mental health disorders. Risk factors can be biological, environmental,
* [[Causes of mental disorders]]
* Self-treatment or [[self-help]]: what individuals can do to help themselves recover without consulting with professionals, including the use of self-help books and media. Although many self- treatments are quite ineffective and even harmful due to lack of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guy|first=Sarah|last2=Sterling|first2=Bobbie Sue|last3=Walker|first3=Lorraine O.|last4=Harrison|first4=Tracie C.|title=Mental Health Literacy and Postpartum Depression: A Qualitative Description of Views of Lower Income Women|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2014.04.001|journal=Archives of Psychiatric Nursing|volume=28|issue=4|pages=256–262|doi=10.1016/j.apnu.2014.04.001|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Professional help: where to get professional help and/or what professional help is available.

=== Attitudes ===
Attitudes are studied in two sub-components: attitudes about mental disorders, or persons with mental disorders, and attitudes about seeking professional help or treatment. Attitudes can vary greatly by individual, and can often be difficult to measure or target with intervention. Nonetheless, a large body of research literature exists on both sub-components, though not always explicitly tied to the mental health literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2014.04.001|title=Mental Health Literacy and Postpartum Depression: A Qualitative Description of Views of Lower Income Women|first1=Sarah|last1=Guy|first2=Bobbie Sue|last2=Sterling|first3=Lorraine O.|last3=Walker|first4=Tracie C.|last4=Harrison|publisher=|journal=Archives of Psychiatric Nursing|volume=28|issue=4|pages=256–262|doi=10.1016/j.apnu.2014.04.001|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public attitude ==

Surveys of the public have been carried out in a number of countries to investigate mental health literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Angermeyer | first1 = M.C. | last2 = Matschinger | first2 = H. | year = 2005 | title = Have there been any changes in the public's attitudes towards psychiatric treatment?

(2004). Categorical ethnicity and mental health literacy in New Zealand. Ethnicity and Health, 9(3), 225-252.&lt;/ref&gt; These surveys show that recognition of mental disorders is lacking and reveal negative beliefs about some standard psychiatric treatments, particularly medications.  On the other hand, psychological, complementary and self-help methods are viewed much more positively. Negative attitudes towards people with mental disorders have been found, such as viewing them as having a weak character. These beliefs and attitudes are potential barriers to seeking optimal professional help and being supportive of others.

== Measures ==
Researchers have measured aspects of mental health literacy in several ways.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wei|first=Yifeng|last2=McGrath|first2=Patrick J.|last3=Hayden|first3=Jill|last4=Kutcher|first4=Stan|date=2015-01-01|title=Mental health literacy measures evaluating knowledge, attitudes and help-seeking: a scoping review|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-015-0681-9|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=15|pages=291|doi=10.1186/s12888-015-0681-9|issn=1471-244X|pmc=4650294|pmid=26576680}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popular methodologies include vignette studies and achievement tests. Vignette studies measure mental health literacy by providing a brief, detailed story of an individual (or individuals) with a mental health problem, and asks participants questions to identify what problem the individual is experiencing, and at times, additional questions about how the individual can help themselves.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

Achievement tests measure mental health literacy on a continuum, such that higher scores on a test indicate greater overall knowledge or understanding of a concept. Achievement tests can be formatted using multiple-choice, true/false, or other quantitative scales.

Various scales have been created to measure the various components of mental health literacy, though not all are validated.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mental health literacy has been measured across several populations, varying in age range, culture, and profession. Most studies have focused on adult and young adult populations, though improving literacy in children has been a focus of prevention efforts.

== Improvement approaches ==
A number of approaches have been tried to improve mental health literacy, many of which have evidence of effectiveness. These include:
# '''Whole of community campaigns'''.

The term '''micro-g environment''' (also '''µg''', often referred to by the term '''microgravity''') is more or less a synonym for ''[[weightlessness]]'' and ''zero-g'', but indicates that [[g-force]]s are not quite zero—just very small.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.jamesoberg.com/myth.html |title=Space myths and misconceptions – space flight |journal=[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]] |date=May 1993 |volume=15 |number=7 |page=38ff}}&lt;!-- alternate link: http://lab.machinecode.org/intricate/omni_magazine/Omni%20v15%20%237%20May%201993.html --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol for microgravity, ''µg'', was used on the insignias of [[Space Shuttle]] flights [[STS-87]] and [[STS-107]], because these flights were devoted to microgravity research in [[low Earth orbit]].

==Absence of gravity==
A "stationary" micro-g environment&lt;ref&gt;Depending on distance, "stationary" is meant relative to Earth or the Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; would require travelling far enough into deep space so as to reduce the effect of gravity by [[attenuation]] to almost zero. This is the simplest in conception, but requires traveling an enormous distance, rendering it most impractical. For example, to reduce the gravity of the Earth by a factor of one million, one needs to be at a distance of 6 million kilometers from the Earth, but to reduce the gravity of the Sun to this amount one has to be at a distance of 3.7 billion kilometers. (On Earth the gravity due to the rest of the [[Milky Way]] is already attenuated by a factor greater than one million, so we do not need to move away further from its [[Galactic Center|center]]{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}). Thus it is not impossible, but it has only been achieved so far by four [[interstellar probe]]s ([[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2|2]] of the [[Voyager program]], and [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11|11]] of the [[Pioneer program]]&lt;!-- [[New Horizons]] it's expected to do so in the near future--&gt;) and they did not return to Earth. To reduce the gravity to one thousandth of that on Earth's  surface, one needs to be at a distance of 200,000&amp;nbsp;km.

At a distance relatively close to Earth (less than 3000&amp;nbsp;km), gravity is only slightly reduced. As an object orbits a body such as the Earth, gravity is still attracting objects towards the Earth and the object is accelerated downward at almost 1g. Because the objects are typically moving laterally with respect to the surface at such immense speeds, the object will not lose altitude because of the curvature of the Earth. When viewed from an orbiting observer, other close objects in space appear to be floating because everything is being pulled towards Earth at the same speed, but also moving forward as the Earth's surface "falls" away below. All these objects are in free fall, not zero gravity.

Compare the [[Gravitational potential#Numerical values|gravitational potential at some of these locations]].

==Free fall==
What remains is a micro-g environment moving in [[free fall]], i.e. there are no forces other than gravity acting on the people or objects in this environment. To prevent air drag making the free fall less perfect, objects and people can free-fall in a capsule that itself, while not necessarily in free fall, is accelerated as in free fall.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This can be done by applying a force to compensate for air drag. Alternatively free fall can be carried out in space, or in a vacuum tower or shaft.

Two cases can be distinguished: Temporary micro-g, where after some time the Earth's surface is or would be reached, and indefinite micro-g.

A temporary micro-g environment exists in a [[drop tube]] (in a tower or shaft), a [[sub-orbital spaceflight]], e.g. with a [[sounding rocket]], and in an airplane such as used by [[NASA]]'s Reduced Gravity Research Program, aka the [[Vomit Comet]], and by the [[Zero Gravity Corporation]]. A temporary micro-g environment is applied for training of astronauts, for some experiments, for filming movies, and for recreational purposes.

A micro-g environment for an indefinite time, while also possible in a spaceship going to infinity in a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit, is most practical in an Earth orbit. This is the environment commonly experienced in the [[International Space Station]], [[Space Shuttle]], etc. While this scenario is the most suitable for scientific experimentation and commercial exploitation, it is still quite expensive to operate in, mostly due to launch costs.

==Tidal and inertial acceleration==

Objects in orbit are not perfectly weightless due to several effects:

*Effects depending on relative position in the spacecraft:
**Because the force of gravity decreases with distance, objects with non-zero size will be subjected to a [[tidal force]], or a differential pull, between the ends of the object nearest and furthest from the Earth. (An extreme version of this effect is [[spaghettification]].) In a spacecraft in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), the [[centrifugal force]] is also greater on the side of the spacecraft furthest from the Earth. At a 400&amp;nbsp;km LEO altitude, the overall differential in g-force is approximately 0.384 μ''g''/m. &lt;ref = name=conceptual&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tqpqB5LPxygC&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;ots=pFOiNIwm6m&amp;dq=microgravity%20tidal%20equations&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=microgravity%20tidal%20equations&amp;f=true Conceptual Design and Flight Simulation of Space Stations
By Reinhold Bertrand&lt;/ref&gt;
** "Floating" objects in a spacecraft in LEO are actually in independent orbits around the Earth.  If two objects are placed side-by-side (relative to their direction of motion), they will be orbiting the Earth in different orbital planes.  Since all orbital planes pass through the center of the earth, any two orbital planes intersect along a line.  Therefore, two objects placed side-by-side (at any distance apart) will come together after one quarter of a revolution.  If they are placed so they miss each other, they will oscillate past each other, with the same period as the orbit. This corresponds to an inward acceleration of 0.128 μ''g'' per meter horizontal distance from the center at 400&amp;nbsp;km altitude.&lt;ref = name=conceptual/&gt; If they are placed one ahead of the other in the same orbital plane, they will maintain their separation.  If they are placed one above the other (at different radii from the center of the Earth), they will have different potential energies, so the size, eccentricity, and period of their orbits will be different, causing them to move in a complex looping pattern relative to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chandler, David|title=Weightlessness and Microgravity|journal=The Physics Teacher|date= May 1991|pages=312–13|url=http://www.lcurve.org/writings/PT-WeightlessnessAndMicrogravity.pdf|doi=10.1119/1.2343327|bibcode=1991PhTea..29..312C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Gravity between the spacecraft and an object within it may make the object slowly "fall" toward a more massive part of it. The acceleration is 0.007 μ''g'' for 1000&amp;nbsp;kg at 1&amp;nbsp;m distance.
*Uniform effects (which could be compensated):
**Though very thin, there is some air at orbital altitudes of 185 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;km. This atmosphere causes deceleration due to friction. This could be compensated by a small continuous thrust, but in practice the deceleration is only compensated from time to time, so the small g-force of this effect is not eliminated.
**The effects of the [[solar wind]] and [[radiation pressure]] are similar, but directed away from the Sun. Unlike the effect of the atmosphere, it does not reduce with altitude.

==Commercial applications==

===Metal spheres===
In a [[shot tower]] (now obsolete), molten metal (such as [[lead]] or [[steel]]) was dripped through a sieve into free fall. With sufficient height (several hundred feet), the metal would be solid enough to resist impact (usually in a water bath) at the bottom of the tower. While the shot may have been slightly deformed by its passage through the air and by impact at the bottom, this method produced metal spheres of sufficient roundness to be used directly in [[shotgun]] shells or to be refined by further processing for applications requiring higher accuracy.

===High-quality crystals===
While not yet a commercial application, there has been interest in growing [[crystal]]s in micro-g, as in a [[space station]] or automated artificial [[satellite]], in an attempt to reduce crystal lattice defects.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.discovery.com/space/growing-crystals-in-zero-gravity-121227.htm Growing Crystals in Zero-Gravity]" News Article by [[Discovery Channel|Discovery]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such defect-free crystals may prove useful for certain microelectronic applications and also to produce crystals for subsequent [[X-ray crystallography]].

[[Space adaptation syndrome|Space Motion Sickness]] (SMS) is thought to be a subtype of [[motion sickness]] that plagues nearly half of all astronauts who venture into space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weerts|first=Aurélie P.|last2=Vanspauwen|first2=Robby|last3=Fransen|first3=Erik|last4=Jorens|first4=Philippe G.|last5=Van de Heyning|first5=Paul H.|last6=Wuyts|first6=Floris L.|date=2014-06-01|title=Space Motion Sickness Countermeasures: A Pharmacological Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2014/00000085/00000006/art00008|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|volume=85|issue=6|pages=638–644|doi=10.3357/asem.3865.2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; SMS, along with facial stuffiness from headward shifts of fluids, headaches, and back pain, is part of a broader complex of symptoms that comprise Space Adaptation Syndrome (SAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/Evidence/medicalConditions/Space_Motion_Sickness_(Space_Adaptation).pdf|title=Space Motion Sickness (Space Adaptation)|last=|first=|date=June 15, 2016|website=NASA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   SMS was first described in 1961 during the second orbit of the fourth manned spaceflight when the Cosmonaut, [[Gherman Titov]] aboard the [[Vostok 2]], described feeling disoriented with physical complaints mostly consistent with motion sickness.  It is one of the most studied physiological problems of spaceflight but continues to pose a significant difficulty for many astronauts.  In some instances, it can be so debilitating that astronauts must sit out from their scheduled occupational duties in space – including missing out on a spacewalk they have spent months training to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4270801&amp;page=1|title=Illness keeps astronaut from spacewalk|last=|first=|date=February 12, 2008|website=ABCNews|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, however, astronauts will work through the symptoms even with degradation in their performance.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-32829-4|title=The Human Body and Weightlessness {{!}} SpringerLink|last=Thornton|first=William|last2=Bonato|first2=Frederick|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=32|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-32829-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their experiences in some of the most rigorous and demanding physical maneuvers on earth, even the most seasoned astronauts may be affected by SMS, resulting in symptoms of severe [[nausea]], projectile [[vomiting]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], malaise (feeling sick), and [[headache]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; These symptoms may occur so abruptly and without any warning that space travelers may vomit suddenly without time to contain the emesis, resulting in strong odors and liquid within the cabin which may affect other astronauts.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Symptoms typically last anywhere from one to three days upon entering weightlessness, but may recur upon reentry to Earth’s gravity or even shortly after landing.  SMS differs from terrestrial motion sickness in that sweating and pallor are typically minimal or absent and gastrointestinal findings usually demonstrate absent bowel sounds indicating reduced [[gastrointestinal motility]].&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Space Pharmacology|last=Wotring|first=V. E.|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4614-3396-5|location=Boston|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the nausea and vomiting resolve, some central nervous system symptoms may persist which may degrade the astronaut’s performance.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Graybiel and Knepton proposed the term “[[sopite syndrome]]” to describe symptoms of lethargy and drowsiness associated with motion sickness in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graybiel|first=A.|last2=Knepton|first2=J.|date=August 1976|title=Sopite syndrome: a sometimes sole manifestation of motion sickness|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|volume=47|issue=8|pages=873–882|issn=0095-6562|pmid=949309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, their definition has been revised to include “…a symptom complex that develops as a result of exposure to real or apparent motion and is characterized by excessive drowsiness, lassitude, lethargy, mild depression, and reduced ability to focus on an assigned task.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262582074_Sopite_Syndrome_A_Revised_Definition|title=Sopite Syndrome: A Revised Definition (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these symptoms may pose a substantial threat (albeit temporary) to the astronaut who must remain attentive to life and death issues at all times.

SMS is most commonly thought to be a disorder of the vestibular system that occurs when sensory information from the visual system (sight) and the proprioceptive system (posture, position of the body) conflicts with misperceived information from the semicircular canals and the otoliths within the inner ear.  This is known as the ‘neural mismatch theory’ and was first suggested in 1975 by Reason and Brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2073893|title=Motion sickness|last=T.|first=Reason, J.|date=1975|publisher=Academic Press|others=Brand, J. J.,|isbn=0125840500|location=London|oclc=2073893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the fluid shift hypothesis suggests that weightlessness reduces the hydrostatic pressure on the lower body causing fluids to shift toward the head from the rest of the body. These fluid shifts are thought to increase cerebrospinal fluid pressure (causing back aches), intracranial pressure (causing headaches), and inner ear fluid pressure (causing vestibular dysfunction).&lt;ref name="Heer 77–79"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heer|first=Martina|last2=Paloski|first2=William H.|title=Space motion sickness: Incidence, etiology, and countermeasures|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1566070206002141|journal=Autonomic Neuroscience|volume=129|issue=1–2|pages=77–79|doi=10.1016/j.autneu.2006.07.014|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a multitude of studies searching for a solution to the problem of SMS, it remains an ongoing problem for space travel.  Most non-pharmacological countermeasures such as training and other physical maneuvers have offered minimal benefit.  Thornton and Bonato noted, “Pre- and inflight adaptive efforts, some of them mandatory and most of them onerous, have been, for the most part, operational failures.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-32829-4|title=The Human Body and Weightlessness {{!}} SpringerLink|last=Thornton|first=William|last2=Bonato|first2=Frederick|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-32829-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the most common intervention is [[promethazine]], an injectable antihistamine with antiemetic properties, but sedation can be a problematic side effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461433958|title=Space Pharmacology {{!}} Virginia E. Wotring {{!}} Springer|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=59|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common pharmacological options include [[Metoclopramide|metaclopromide]], as well as oral and transdermal application of [[scopolamine]], but drowsiness and sedation are common side effects for these medications as well.&lt;ref name="Heer 77–79"/&gt;

===Musculoskeletal effects===
In the space (or microgravity) environment the effects of unloading varies significantly among individuals, with sex differences compounding the variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ploutz-Snyder|first=Lori|last2=Bloomfield|first2=Susan|last3=Smith|first3=Scott M.|last4=Hunter|first4=Sandra K.|last5=Templeton|first5=Kim|last6=Bemben|first6=Debra|date=2014-11-01|title=Effects of Sex and Gender on Adaptation to Space: Musculoskeletal Health|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/jwh.2014.4910|journal=Journal of Women's Health|volume=23|issue=11|pages=963–966|doi=10.1089/jwh.2014.4910|issn=1540-9996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in mission duration, and the small sample size of astronauts participating in the same mission also adds to the variability to the [[musculoskeletal disorder]]s that are seen in space.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Narici|first=M. V.|last2=Boer|first2=M. D. de|date=2011-03-01|title=Disuse of the musculo-skeletal system in space and on earth|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-010-1556-x|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|language=en|volume=111|issue=3|pages=403–420|doi=10.1007/s00421-010-1556-x|issn=1439-6319}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to muscle loss, microgravity leads to increased [[bone resorption]], decreased [[bone mineral density]], and increased fracture risks.  Bone resorption leads to increased urinary levels of [[Calcium in biology|calcium]], which can subsequently lead to an increased risk of [[nephrolithiasis]].&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Scott M.|last2=Heer|first2=Martina|last3=Shackelford|first3=Linda C.|last4=Sibonga|first4=Jean D.|last5=Spatz|first5=Jordan|last6=Pietrzyk|first6=Robert A.|last7=Hudson|first7=Edgar K.|last8=Zwart|first8=Sara R.|title=Bone metabolism and renal stone risk during International Space Station missions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S8756328215003658|journal=Bone|volume=81|pages=712–720|doi=10.1016/j.bone.2015.10.002|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first two weeks that the muscles are unloaded from carrying the weight of the human frame during space flight, whole muscle atrophy begins. Postural muscles contain more slow fibers, and are more prone to atrophy than non-postural muscle groups.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The loss of muscle mass occurs because of imbalances in protein synthesis and breakdown.  The loss of muscle mass is also accompanied by a loss of muscle strength, which was observed after only 2–5 days of spaceflight during the [[Soyuz 3|Soyuz-3]] and [[Soyuz 8|Soyuz-8]] missions.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Decreases in the generation of contractile forces and whole muscle power have also been found in response to microgravity.

To counter the effects of microgravity on the musculoskeletal system, aerobic exercise is recommended. This often takes the form of in-flight cycling.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; A more effective regimen includes resistive exercises or the use of a penguin suit&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; (contains sewn-in elastic bands to maintain a stretch load on antigravity muscles), centrifugation, and vibration.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Centrifugation recreates Earth’s gravitational force on the space station, in order to prevent [[muscle atrophy]].  Centrifugation can be performed with centrifuges or by cycling along the inner wall of the space station.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;  Whole body vibration has been found to reduce bone resorption through mechanisms that are unclear.  Vibration can be delivered using exercise devices that use vertical displacements juxtaposed to a fulcrum, or by using a plate that oscillates on a vertical axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elmantaser|first=M.|last2=McMillan|first2=M.|last3=Smith|first3=K.|last4=Khanna|first4=S.|last5=Chantler|first5=D.|last6=Panarelli|first6=M.|last7=Ahmed|first7=S. F.|date=September 2012|title=A comparison of the effect of two types of vibration exercise on the endocrine and musculoskeletal system|journal=Journal of Musculoskeletal &amp; Neuronal Interactions|volume=12|issue=3|pages=144–154|issn=1108-7161|pmid=22947546}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|beta-2 adrenergic agonists]] to increase muscle mass, and the use of essential amino acids in conjunction with resistive exercises have been proposed as pharmacologic means of combating muscle atrophy in space.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

Microgravity can also lead to height increases; in 2018 a Japanese astronout reported growing 2 centimetres in just three weeks of micro-gravity on board the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/japanese-astronaut-concerned-after-growing-3-5-inches-t-1821910135 |title=Japanese Astronaut Concerned After Growing 3.5 Inches Taller in Three Weeks - Update: He Was Wrong |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardiovascular effects ===
[[File:StationLIFE - Cardiovascular (January 2016).webm|thumb|569x569px|Astronaut Tracy Dyson talks about studies into cardiovascular health aboard the International Space Station.]]
Next to the skeletal and muscular system, the cardiovascular system is less strained in weightlessness than on Earth and is de-conditioned during longer periods spent in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0471263869.sst074/abstract|title=Encyclopedia of Space Science and Technology|last=Ramsdell|first=Craig D.|last2=Cohen|first2=Richard J.|date=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9780471263869|language=en|doi=10.1002/0471263869.sst074}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a regular environment, gravity exerts a downward force, setting up a vertical hydrostatic gradient. When standing, some 'excess' fluid resides in vessels and tissues of the legs. In a micro-g environment, with the loss of a [[Hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic gradient]], some fluid quickly redistributes toward the chest and upper body; sensed as 'overload' of circulating blood volume.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23924131_Current_status_and_future_direction_of_NASA's_Space_Life_Sciences_Program|title=Current status and future direction of NASA's Space Life Sciences Program (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the micro-g environment, the newly sensed excess blood volume is adjusted by expelling excess fluid into tissues and cells (12-15% volume reduction) and [[red blood cell]]s are adjusted downward to maintain a normal concentration (relative [[anemia]]).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In the absence of gravity, venous blood will rush to the [[Atrium (heart)|right atrium]] because the force of gravity is no longer pulling the blood down into the vessels of the legs and abdomen, resulting in increased [[stroke volume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bulletin119/bul119_chap4.pdf|title=What Happens to the Human Heart in Space - Parabolic Flights Provide Some Answers|last=Aubert|first=Andre|date=August 2004|website=ESA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fluid shifts become more dangerous upon returning to a regular gravity environment as the body will attempt to adapt to the reintroduction of gravity. The reintroduction of gravity again will pull the fluid downward, but now there would be a deficit in both circulating fluid and red blood cells. The decrease in cardiac filling pressure and stroke volume during the orthostatic stress due to a decreased blood volume is what causes [[orthostatic intolerance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wieling|first=Wouter|last2=Halliwill|first2=John R|last3=Karemaker|first3=John M|date=2002-01-01|title=Orthostatic intolerance after space flight|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=538|issue=Pt 1|pages=1|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2001.013372|issn=0022-3751|pmc=2290012|pmid=11773310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orthostatic intolerance can result in temporary loss of consciousness and posture, due to the lack of pressure and stroke volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Julian M.|date=2013-05-01|title=Common Syndromes of Orthostatic Intolerance|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/131/5/968|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=131|issue=5|pages=968–980|doi=10.1542/peds.2012-2610|issn=0031-4005|pmid=23569093|pmc=3639459}}&lt;/ref&gt; More chronic orthostatic intolerance can result in additional symptoms such as [[nausea]], [[Sleep disorder|sleep problems]], and other vasomotor symptoms as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Julian M.|title=Chronic orthostatic intolerance and the postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002234760400650X|journal=The Journal of Pediatrics|volume=145|issue=6|pages=725–730|doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2004.06.084|year=2004|pmc=4511479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies on the physiological effects of weightlessness on the cardiovascular system are done in parabolic flights. It is one of the only feasible options to combine with human experiments, making parabolic flights the only way to investigate the true effects of the micro-g environment on a body without traveling into space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953694996|title=Cardiovascular system, red blood cells, and oxygen transport in microgravity|others=Gunga, Hanns-Christian,, Ahlefeld, Victoria Weller von,, Coriolano, Hans-Joachim Appell,, Werner, Andreas,, Hoffmann, Uwe,|isbn=9783319332260|location=Switzerland|oclc=953694996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parabolic flight studies have provided a broad range of results regarding changes in the cardiovascular system in a micro-g environment. Parabolic flight studies have increased the understanding of orthostatic intolerance and decreased peripheral blood flow suffered by Astronauts returning to Earth. Due to the loss of blood to pump, the heart can atrophy in a micro-g environment. A weakened heart can result in low blood volume, low blood pressure and affect the body's ability to send oxygen to the brain without the individual becoming dizzy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/652.html|title=Cardiac Atrophy and Diastolic Dysfunction During and After Long Duration Spaceflight: Functional Consequences for Orthostatic Intolerance, Exercise Capability and Risk for Cardiac Arrhythmias (Integrated Cardiovascular)|last=Bungo|first=Michael|date=March 23, 2016|website=NASA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heart arrhythmia|Heart rhythm disturbances]] have also been seen among astronauts, but it is not clear whether this was due to pre-existing conditions of effects of a micro-g environment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fritsch-Yelle|first=Janice M.|last2=Leuenberger|first2=Urs A.|last3=D’Aunno|first3=Dominick S.|last4=Rossum|first4=Alfred C.|last5=Brown|first5=Troy E.|last6=Wood|first6=Margie L.|last7=Josephson|first7=Mark E.|last8=Goldberger|first8=Ary L.|title=An Episode of Ventricular Tachycardia During Long-Duration Spaceflight|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0002-9149(98)00179-9|journal=The American Journal of Cardiology|volume=81|issue=11|pages=1391–1392|doi=10.1016/s0002-9149(98)00179-9|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; One current countermeasure includes drinking a salt solution, which increases the viscosity of blood and would subsequently increase blood pressure which would mitigate post micro-g environment orthostatic intolerance. Another countermeasure includes administration of [[midodrine]], which is a selective alpha-1 adrenergic agonist. Midodrine produces arterial and venous constriction resulting in an increase in blood pressure by baroreceptor reflexes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/768427940|title=Fundamentals of space medicine|last=1956-|first=Clément, Gilles,|date=2011|publisher=Published jointly by Microcosm Press|isbn=9781441999054|edition=2nd|location=El Segundo, Calif.|oclc=768427940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts to worker safety ==
Space Motion Sickness can lead to degraded astronaut performance.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; SMS threatens operational requirements, reduces situational awareness, and threatens the safety of those exposed to micro-g environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1006502642|title=The human body and weightlessness : operational effects, problems and countermeasures|last=William,|first=Thornton,|others=Bonato, Frederick,|isbn=9783319328294|location=Cham, Switzerland|oclc=1006502642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lost muscle mass leads to difficulty with movement, especially when astronauts return to earth.  This can pose a safety issue if the need for emergency egress were to arise. Loss of muscle power makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for astronauts to climb through emergency egress hatches or create unconventional exit spaces in the case of a crash upon landing.  Additionally, bone resorption and inadequate hydration in space can lead to the formation of kidney stones, and subsequent sudden incapacitation due to pain.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  If this were to occur during critical phases of flight, a capsule crash leading to worker injury and/or death could result. Short-term and long-term health effects have been seen in the cardiovascular system from exposure to the micro-g environment that would limit those exposed after they return to Earth or a regular gravity environment. Steps need to be taken to ensure proper precautions are taken into consideration when dealing a micro-g environment for worker safety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Orthostatic intolerance can lead to temporary loss of consciousness due to the lack of pressure and stroke volume. This loss of consciousness inhibits and endangers those affected and can lead to deadly consequences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Simplified world mining map 1.png|thumb|upright=2.25|right|Simplified world active mining map]]
'''Mining''' is the extraction of valuable [[mineral]]s or other geological materials from the earth, usually from an [[ore]]body, [[lode]], [[vein (geology)|vein]], [[coal mining|seam]],  [[quartz reef mining|reef]] or [[placer deposit]]. These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.

Ores recovered by mining include [[Metal#Extraction|metals]], [[Coal mining|coal]], [[oil shale]], [[gemstone]]s, [[limestone]], [[chalk mining|chalk]], [[dimension stone]], [[Sodium chloride|rock salt]], [[potash]], [[gravel]], and [[clay]]. Mining is required to obtain any material that cannot be grown through agricultural processes, or created [[Chemical synthesis|artificially]] in a laboratory or factory. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any [[non-renewable resource]] such as petroleum, natural gas, or even [[fossil water|water]].

Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since [[Prehistory|pre-historic]] times. Modern mining processes involve [[prospecting]] for ore bodies, analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine, extraction of the desired materials, and final [[mine reclamation|reclamation]] of the land after the mine is closed. De Re Metallica, Georgius  Agricola, 1550, Book I, Para. 1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/deremetallica50agri|title=De re metallica|last=Agricola|first=Georg|last2=Hoover|first2=Herbert|date=1950|publisher=New York, Dover Publications|others=MBLWHOI Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact, both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed. Hence, most of the world's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact. [[Mine safety|Work safety]] has long been a concern as well, and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines.

Levels of metals [[recycling]] are generally low. Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up, some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products. Due to the low recycling rates, some [[landfill]]s now contain higher concentrations of metal than mines themselves.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==History==

===Prehistoric mining===
[[File:TimnaChalcolithicMine.JPG|thumb|[[Chalcolithic]] copper mine in [[Timna Valley]], [[Negev Desert]]]]

Since the beginning of civilization, people have used [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[ceramic]]s and, later, [[metal]]s found close to the [[Earth]]'s surface.

[[Mining in Egypt]] occurred in the earliest dynasties. The [[Nubia#Kerma|gold mines of Nubia]] were among the largest and most extensive of any in Ancient Egypt. These mines are described by the Greek author [[Diodorus Siculus]], who mentions [[fire-setting]] as one method used to break down the hard rock holding the gold. One of the complexes is shown in one of the earliest known maps. The miners crushed the ore and ground it to a fine powder before washing the powder for the gold dust.

===Ancient Greek and Roman mining===

Mining in Europe has a very long history. Examples include the silver mines of [[Laurium]], which helped support the Greek [[City-state|city state]] of [[Athens]]. Although they had over 20,000 slaves working them, their technology was essentially identical to their Bronze Age predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MINING GREECE ANCIENT MINES|url = http://www.miningreece.com/mining-greece/mining-history/ancient-mines/|website = www.miningreece.com|accessdate = 2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other mines, such as on the island of [[Thasos|Thassos]], marble was quarried by the [[Paros|Parians]] after they arrived in the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mining Greece Ancient Quarries in Thassos|url = http://www.miningreece.com/mining-greece/ancient-quarries-in-thassos/|website = www.miningreece.com|accessdate = 2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marble was shipped away and was later found by archaeologists to have been used in buildings including the tomb of Amphipolis. [[Philip II of Macedon]], the father of Alexander the Great, captured the gold mines of Mount Pangeo in 357 BC to fund his military campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mining Greece the Goldmines of Alexander the Great|url = http://www.miningreece.com/mining-greece/mining-history/the-goldmines-of-alexander-the-great/|website = www.miningreece.com|accessdate = 2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also captured gold mines in [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace|Thrace]] for minting coinage, eventually producing 26 tons per year.

However, it was the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] who developed large scale mining methods, especially the use of large volumes of water brought to the minehead by numerous [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s. The water was used for a variety of purposes, including removing overburden and rock debris, called [[hydraulic mining]], as well as washing [[comminution|comminuted]], or crushed, ores and driving simple machinery.

The Romans used hydraulic mining methods on a large scale to prospect for the [[vein (geology)|vein]]s of ore, especially a now-obsolete form of mining known as [[hushing]]. They built numerous [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s to supply water to the minehead. There, the water stored in large [[reservoirs]] and tanks. When a full tank was opened, the flood of water [[sluice]]d away the [[overburden]] to expose the [[bedrock]] underneath and any gold veins. The rock was then worked upon by [[fire-setting]] to heat the rock, which would be quenched with a stream of water. The resulting [[thermal shock]] cracked the rock, enabling it to be removed by further streams of water from the overhead tanks. The Roman miners used similar methods to work [[cassiterite]] deposits in [[Cornwall]] and [[lead]] ore in the [[Pennines]].

The methods had been developed by the Romans in [[Spain]] in 25 AD to exploit large [[alluvial]] gold deposits, the largest site being at [[Las Medulas]], where seven long aqueducts tapped local rivers and sluiced the deposits. [[Spain]] was one of the most important mining regions, but all regions of the [[Roman Empire]] were exploited. In Great Britain the natives had mined minerals for [[millennia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2169254.ece |title=The Independent, 20 Jan. 2007: '&amp;#39;The end of a Celtic tradition: the last gold miner in Wales'&amp;#39; |publisher=News.independent.co.uk |date=2007-01-20 |accessdate=2013-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706035317/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2169254.ece |archivedate=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]], the scale of the operations increased dramatically, as the Romans needed [[Britannia]]'s resources, especially [[gold]], [[silver]], [[tin]], and [[lead]].

Roman techniques were not limited to surface mining. They followed the ore veins underground once opencast mining was no longer feasible. At [[Dolaucothi]] they [[stoping|stoped]] out the veins and drove [[adit]]s through bare rock to drain the stopes. The same adits were also used to ventilate the workings, especially important when [[fire-setting]] was used. At other parts of the site, they penetrated the [[water table]] and dewatered the mines using several kinds of machines, especially [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]s. These were used extensively in the [[copper]] mines at [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in Spain, where one sequence comprised 16 such wheels arranged in pairs, and lifting water about {{convert|24|m|ft}}. They were worked as treadmills with miners standing on the top slats. Many examples of such devices have been found in old Roman mines and some examples are now preserved in the [[British Museum]] and the [[National Museum of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romans-in-britain.org.uk/raw_mining.htm ''The Romans in Britain: mining''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720073131/http://www.romans-in-britain.org.uk/raw_mining.htm |date=July 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Europe===
{{main|Mining and metallurgy in medieval Europe}}
[[File:Georgius Agricola.jpg|thumb|upright|Agricola, author of ''[[De Re Metallica]]'']]

Mining as an industry underwent dramatic changes in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]]. The mining industry in the early Middle Ages was mainly focused on the extraction of copper and iron. Other [[precious metal]]s were also used, mainly for gilding or coinage. Initially, many metals were obtained through [[open-pit mining]], and ore was primarily extracted from shallow depths, rather than through deep mine shafts. Around the 14th century, the growing use of weapons, armour, [[stirrup]]s, and horseshoes greatly increased the demand for iron. Medieval knights, for example, were often laden with up to {{convert|100|lb}} of plate or [[Chain mail|chain link armour]] in addition to swords, lances and other weapons.&lt;ref&gt;A culture of Improvement. Robert Friedel. MIT Press. 2007. p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming dependency on iron for military purposes spurred iron production and extraction processes.

The silver crisis of 1465 occurred when all mines had reached depths at which the shafts could no longer be pumped dry with the available technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu/cowen/~GEL115/115CH7.html |title=Chapter 7: Medieval Silver and Gold |publisher=Mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an increased use of [[banknote]]s, credit and copper coins during this period did decrease the value of, and dependence on, precious metals, [[gold]] and silver still remained vital to the story of medieval mining.

Due to differences in the social structure of society, the increasing extraction of mineral deposits spread from central Europe to England in the mid-sixteenth century. On the continent, mineral deposits belonged to the crown, and this regalian right was stoutly maintained. But in England, royal mining rights were restricted to gold and silver (of which England had virtually no deposits) by a judicial decision of 1568 and a law in 1688. England had iron, zinc, copper, lead, and tin ores. Landlords who owned the base metals and coal under their estates then had a strong inducement to extract these metals or to lease the deposits and collect royalties from mine operators. English, German, and Dutch capital combined to finance extraction and refining. Hundreds of German technicians and skilled workers were brought over; in 1642 a colony of 4,000 foreigners was mining and smelting copper at [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] in the northwestern mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Heaton Herbert (1948) ''Economic History of Europe.'' A Harper International Edition. Fifth printing. February 1968. p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of water power in the form of [[water mill]]s was extensive. The water mills were employed in crushing ore, raising ore from shafts, and ventilating galleries by powering giant [[bellows]]. [[gun powder|Black powder]] was first used in mining in [[Banská Štiavnica|Selmecbánya]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now [[Banská Štiavnica]], Slovakia) in 1627.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s00334-007-0096-8|title = Analysis of the fuel wood used in Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age copper mining sites of the Schwaz and Brixlegg area (Tyrol, Austria)| journal=Vegetation History and Archaeobotany| volume=17| issue=2| pages=211–221|year = 2008|last1 = Heiss|first1 = Andreas G.| last2=Oeggl| first2=Klaus| citeseerx=10.1.1.156.1683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black powder allowed blasting of rock and earth to loosen and reveal ore veins. Blasting was much faster than [[fire-setting]] and allowed the mining of previously impenetrable metals and ores.&lt;ref&gt;The use of Firesetting in the Granite Quarries of South India Paul T. Craddock The Bulletin of the Peak District Mines Historical Society, Vol. 13 Number 1. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In 1762, the world's first mining academy was established in the same town there.

The widespread adoption of agricultural innovations such as the iron [[plowshare]], as well as the growing use of metal as a building material, was also a driving force in the tremendous growth of the iron industry during this period. Inventions like the [[arrastra]] were often used by the Spanish to pulverize ore after being mined. This device was powered by animals and used the same principles used for grain [[threshing]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Spanish Tradition in Gold and Silver Mining." Otis E. Young ''[[Arizona and the West]]'', Vol. 7, No. 4 (Winter, 1965), pp. 299–314 (''Journal of the Southwest'') Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40167137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the knowledge of medieval mining techniques comes from books such as [[Biringuccio]]’s ''[[De la pirotechnia]]'' and probably most importantly from [[Georg Agricola]]'s ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556). These books detail many different mining methods used in German and Saxon mines. A prime issue in medieval mines, which [[Georgius Agricola|Agricola]] explains in detail, was the removal of water from mining shafts. As miners dug deeper to access new veins, flooding became a very real obstacle. The mining industry became dramatically more efficient and prosperous with the invention of mechanical and animal driven pumps.

[[Mining in the United States]] became prevalent in the 19th century, and the [[General Mining Act of 1872]] was passed to encourage mining of federal lands.&lt;ref&gt;McClure R, Schneider A.

''Seattle PI''.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the [[California Gold Rush]] in the mid-19th century, mining for minerals and precious metals, along with [[ranching]], was a driving factor in the [[Westward Expansion]] to the Pacific coast. With the exploration of the West, mining camps were established and "expressed a distinctive spirit, an enduring legacy to the new nation;" Gold Rushers would experience the same problems as the Land Rushers of the transient West that preceded them.&lt;ref&gt;Boorstin, D.J. (1965). ''The Americans: The National Experience''. New York: Vintage Books, pp. 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by railroads, many traveled West for work opportunities in mining. Western cities such as [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] originated as mining towns.

When new areas were explored, it was usually the gold (placer and then lode) and then silver that were taken into possession and extracted first. Other metals would often wait for railroads or canals, as coarse gold dust and nuggets do not require smelting and are easy to identify and transport.&lt;ref name="Ricard32"/&gt;

===Modern period===
[[File:View showing miners’ clothes.jpg|thumb|View showing miners' clothes suspended by pulleys, also wash basins and ventilation system, Kirkland Lake, Ontario, 1936.]]
In the early 20th century, the gold and silver rush to the western United States also stimulated mining for coal as well as [[base metal]]s such as copper, lead, and iron. Areas in modern Montana, Utah, Arizona, and later Alaska became predominate suppliers of copper to the world, which was increasingly demanding copper for electrical and households goods.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;Miller C.

''Taylor &amp; Francis''.&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's mining industry grew more slowly than did the United States' due to limitations in transportation, capital, and U.S. competition; Ontario was the major producer of the early 20th century with nickel, copper, and gold.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;

Meanwhile, Australia experienced the [[Australian gold rushes]] and by the 1850s was producing 40% of the world's gold, followed by the establishment of large mines such as the [[Mount Morgan Mine]], which ran for nearly a hundred years, [[Broken Hill ore deposit]] (one of the largest zinc-lead ore deposits), and the iron ore mines at [[Iron Knob]]. After declines in production, another boom in mining occurred in the 1960s. Now, in the early 21st century, Australia remains a major world mineral producer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianminesatlas.gov.au/history/index.html#1900 History of Australia's Minerals Industry].

As the 21st century begins, a globalized [[#Mining industry|mining industry]] of large multinational corporations has arisen. [[Peak minerals]] and [[#Environmental effects|environmental impacts]] have also become a concern. Different elements, particularly [[rare earth mineral]]s, have begun to increase in demand as a result of new technologies.

== Mine development and lifecycle ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Cut and fill schematic.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Schematic of a [[Underground mining (hard rock)|cut and fill mining operation in hard rock]].]]
The process of mining from discovery of an ore body through extraction of minerals and finally to returning the land to its natural state consists of several distinct steps. The first is discovery of the ore body, which is carried out through [[prospecting]] or [[Mineral exploration|exploration]] to find and then define the extent, location and value of the ore body. This leads to a mathematical [[mineral resource classification|resource estimation]] to estimate the size and [[ore grade|grade]] of the deposit.

This estimation is used to conduct a pre-feasibility study to determine the theoretical economics of the ore deposit. This identifies, early on, whether further investment in estimation and engineering studies is warranted and identifies key risks and areas for further work. The next step is to conduct a [[mining feasibility study|feasibility study]] to evaluate the financial viability, the technical and financial risks, and the robustness of the project.

This is when the mining company makes the decision whether to develop the mine or to walk away from the project. This includes mine planning to evaluate the economically recoverable portion of the deposit, the [[metallurgy]] and ore recoverability, marketability and payability of the ore concentrates, engineering concerns, milling and infrastructure costs, finance and equity requirements, and an analysis of the proposed mine from the initial excavation all the way through to reclamation. The proportion of a deposit that is economically recoverable is dependent on the [[enrichment factor]] of the ore in the area.

To gain access to the mineral deposit within an area it is often necessary to mine through or remove [[gangue|waste material]] which is not of immediate interest to the miner. The total movement of ore and waste constitutes the mining process. Often more waste than ore is mined during the life of a mine, depending on the nature and location of the ore body. Waste removal and placement is a major cost to the mining operator, so a detailed characterization of the waste material forms an essential part of the geological exploration program for a mining operation.

Once the analysis determines a given ore body is worth recovering, development begins to create access to the ore body. The mine buildings and processing plants are built, and any necessary equipment is obtained. The operation of the mine to recover the ore begins and continues as long as the company operating the mine finds it economical to do so. Once all the ore that the mine can produce profitably is recovered, [[Land rehabilitation|reclamation]] begins to make the land used by the mine suitable for future use.

== Mining techniques ==
[[File:SL500 01.jpg|thumb|Underground [[longwall mining]].]]
Mining techniques can be divided into two common [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]] types: [[surface mining]] and [[#Underground mining|sub-surface (underground) mining]]. Today, surface mining is much more common, and produces, for example, 85% of minerals (excluding petroleum and natural gas) in the United States, including 98% of metallic ores.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann HL. ''Introductory Mining Engineering'', p. 11. [http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/11/04713485/0471348511.pdf First chapter].&lt;/ref&gt;

Targets are divided into two general categories of materials: ''placer deposits'', consisting of valuable minerals contained within river gravels, beach sands, and other [[alluvium|unconsolidated material]]s; and ''lode deposits'', where valuable minerals are found in veins, in layers, or in mineral grains generally distributed throughout a mass of actual rock. Both types of ore deposit, placer or lode, are mined by both surface and underground methods.

Some mining, including much of the rare earth elements and [[uranium mining]], is done by less-common methods, such as [[in-situ leach]]ing: this technique involves digging neither at the surface nor underground. The extraction of target minerals by this technique requires that they be soluble, e.g., [[potash]], [[potassium chloride]], [[sodium chloride]], [[sodium sulfate]], which dissolve in water. Some minerals, such as copper minerals and [[uranium oxide]], require acid or carbonate solutions to dissolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf27.html |title=In Situ Leach Mining (ISL) of Uranium |publisher=World-nuclear.org |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechanicalseals.net/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface mining ===
{{main|Surface mining}}
[[Surface mining]] is done by removing (stripping) surface vegetation, dirt, and, if necessary, layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits. Techniques of surface mining include: [[open-pit mining]], which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground, [[quarry]]ing, identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand, stone and clay;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mining, Quarrying &amp; Prospecting: The Difference between Mining, Quarrying &amp; Prospecting|url = http://mqp-geotek.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/difference-between-mining-quarrying.html|website = mqp-geotek.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[strip mining]], which consists of stripping surface layers off to reveal ore/seams underneath; and [[Mountaintop removal mining|mountaintop removal]], commonly associated with coal mining, which involves taking the top of a mountain off to reach ore deposits at depth. Most (but not all) placer deposits, because of their shallowly buried nature, are mined by surface methods. Finally, [[landfill mining]] involves sites where [[landfill]]s are excavated and processed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enviroalternatives.com/landfill.html Landfill Mining] Landfill Mining, Preserving Resources through Integrated Sustainable Management of Waste, Technical Brief from the World Resource Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; Landfill mining has been thought of as a solution to dealing with long-term methane emissions and local pollution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-03-01|title=Landfill mining: A critical review of two decades of research|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X11004740|journal=Waste Management|language=en|volume=32|issue=3|pages=513–520|doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2011.10.015|issn=0956-053X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kilianstollen Zug.jpg|thumb|[[Mantrip]] used for transporting miners within an underground mine]]
Sub-surface mining consists of digging tunnels or shafts into the earth to reach buried ore deposits. Ore, for processing, and waste rock, for disposal, are brought to the surface through the tunnels and shafts. Sub-surface mining can be classified by the type of access shafts used, the extraction method or the technique used to reach the mineral deposit. [[Drift mining]] utilizes horizontal access tunnels, [[slope mining]] uses diagonally sloping access shafts, and [[shaft mining]] utilizes vertical access shafts. Mining in [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard]] and [[Underground mining (soft rock)|soft]] rock formations require different techniques.

Other methods include [[shrinkage stope mining]], which is mining upward, creating a sloping underground room, [[long wall mining]], which is grinding a long ore surface underground, and [[room and pillar]] mining, which is removing ore from rooms while leaving pillars in place to support the roof of the room. Room and pillar mining often leads to [[retreat mining]], in which supporting pillars are removed as miners retreat, allowing the room to cave in, thereby loosening more ore. Additional sub-surface mining methods include [[underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock mining]], which is mining of hard rock (igneous, metamorphic or sedimentary) materials, bore hole mining, drift and fill mining, long hole slope mining, sub level caving, and [[block caving]].

=== Highwall mining ===
[[File:Caterpillar Highwall Mine HW300.jpg|thumb|Caterpillar Highwall Miner HW300 - Technology Bridging Underground and Open Pit Mining]]
Highwall mining is another form of surface mining that evolved from auger mining. In Highwall mining, the coal seam is penetrated by a continuous miner propelled by a hydraulic Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM). A typical cycle includes sumping (launch-pushing forward) and shearing (raising and lowering the cutterhead boom to cut the entire height of the coal seam). As the coal recovery cycle continues, the cutterhead is progressively launched into the coal seam for 19.72 feet (6.01 m). Then, the Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM) automatically inserts a 19.72-foot (6.01 m) long rectangular Pushbeam (Screw-Conveyor Segment) into the center section of the machine between the Powerhead and the cutterhead. The Pushbeam system can penetrate nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) into the coal seam. One patented Highwall mining system uses augers enclosed inside the Pushbeam that prevent the mined coal from being contaminated by rock debris during the conveyance process. Using a video imaging and/or a gamma ray sensor and/or other Geo-Radar systems like a coal-rock interface detection sensor (CID), the operator can see ahead projection of the seam-rock interface and guide the continuous miner's progress. Highwall mining can produce thousands of tons of coal in contour-strip operations with narrow benches, previously mined areas, trench mine applications and steep-dip seams with controlled water-inflow pump system and/or a gas (inert) venting system.

[[Heavy machinery]] is used in mining to explore and develop sites, to remove and stockpile overburden, to break and remove rocks of various hardness and toughness, to process the ore, and to carry out reclamation projects after the mine is closed. Bulldozers, drills, explosives and trucks are all necessary for excavating the land. In the case of [[placer mining]], unconsolidated gravel, or [[alluvium]], is fed into machinery consisting of a hopper and a shaking screen or [[trommel]] which frees the desired minerals from the waste gravel. The minerals are then concentrated using [[sluices]] or jigs.

Large [[diamond drilling|drills]] are used to sink shafts, excavate stopes, and obtain samples for analysis. [[Tram]]s are used to transport miners, minerals and waste. Lifts carry miners into and out of mines, and move rock and ore out, and machinery in and out, of underground mines. Huge trucks, shovels and cranes are employed in surface mining to move large quantities of overburden and ore. Processing plants utilize large crushers, mills, reactors, roasters and other equipment to consolidate the mineral-rich material and extract the desired compounds and metals from the ore.

== Processing ==
{{Main|Mineral processing|Extractive metallurgy}}
Once the mineral is extracted, it is often then processed. The science of [[extractive metallurgy]] is a specialized area in the science of metallurgy that studies the extraction of valuable metals from their ores, especially through chemical or mechanical means.

[[Mineral processing]] (or mineral dressing) is a specialized area in the science of metallurgy that studies the mechanical means of crushing, grinding, and washing that enable the separation (extractive metallurgy) of valuable metals or minerals from their [[gangue]] (waste material). Processing of placer ore material consists of gravity-dependent methods of separation, such as [[sluice]] boxes. Only minor shaking or washing may be necessary to disaggregate (unclump) the sands or gravels before processing. Processing of ore from a lode mine, whether it is a surface or subsurface mine, requires that the rock ore be crushed and pulverized before extraction of the valuable minerals begins. After lode ore is crushed, recovery of the valuable minerals is done by one, or a combination of several, mechanical and chemical techniques.

Since most metals are present in ores as oxides or sulfides, the metal needs to be [[Redox|reduced]] to its metallic form. This can be accomplished through chemical means such as [[smelting]] or through electrolytic reduction, as in the case of [[aluminium]]. [[Geometallurgy]] combines the geologic sciences with extractive metallurgy and mining.

In 2018, led by Chemistry and Biochemistry professor Bradley D. Smith, [[University of Notre Dame]] researchers "invented a new class of molecules whose shape and size enable them to capture and contain precious metal ions," reported in a study published by the [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]. The new method "converts gold-containing ore into [[chloroauric acid]] and extracts it using an industrial solvent. The container molecules are able to selectively separate the gold from the solvent without the use of water stripping." The newly developed molecules can eliminate water stripping, whereas mining traditionally "relies on a 125-year-old method that treats gold-containing ore with large quantities of poisonous [[sodium cyanide]]...  this new process has a milder environmental impact and that, besides gold, it can be used for capturing other metals such as platinum and palladium," and could also be used in urban mining processes that remove precious metals from wastewater streams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mining.com/scientists-develop-technique-reduce-cost-environmental-impact-mining-precious-metal/ Leotaud, V. R.] "Scientists develop technique to reduce cost, environmental impact of mining precious metal", by Valentina Ruiz Leotaud''Mining.com'', June 10, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental effects==
{{Main|Environmental impact of mining}}
[[File:Iron hydroxide precipitate in stream.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Iron hydroxide precipitate stains a stream receiving acid drainage from surface coal mining.]]
[[Mineral industry of Peru|Environmental issues]] can include [[erosion]], formation of [[sinkhole]]s, loss of [[biodiversity]], and [[soil contamination|contamination of soil]], [[groundwater]] and [[surface water]] by chemicals from mining processes. In some cases, additional forest logging is done in the vicinity of mines to create space for the storage of the created debris and soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/01/gold/larmer-text/6 |title=Logging of forests and debris dumping |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contamination resulting from leakage of chemicals can also affect the health of the local population if not properly controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/01/gold/larmer-text/12 |title=The Real Price of Gold |publisher=National Geographic |date=January 2009 |first=Brook |last=Larmer }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme examples of pollution from mining activities include [[Coal seam fire|coal fires]], which can last for years or even decades, producing massive amounts of environmental damage.

Mining companies in most countries are required to follow stringent environmental and rehabilitation codes in order to minimize environmental impact and avoid impacting human health. These codes and regulations all require the common steps of [[environmental impact assessment]], development of [[environmental management]] plans, [[mine closure planning]] (which must be done before the start of mining operations), and [[environmental monitoring]] during operation and after closure. However, in some areas, particularly in the developing world, government regulations may not be well enforced.

For major mining companies and any company seeking international financing, there are a number of other mechanisms to enforce good environmental standards. These generally relate to financing standards such as the [[Equator Principles]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]] environmental standards, and criteria for [[Socially responsible investing]]. Mining companies have used this oversight from the financial sector to argue for some level of [[industry self-regulation]].&lt;ref name=RocksHardPlaces&gt;Moody R. (2007). ''Rocks and Hard Places''. Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, a Draft Code of Conduct for Transnational Corporations was proposed at the [[Earth Summit (1992)|Rio Earth Summit]] by the UN Centre for Transnational Corporations (UNCTC), but the Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD) together with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) argued successfully for self-regulation instead.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams D. (2005). [http://www.business-humanrights.org/Links/Repository/276544/link_page_view Regulations for Corporations: A historical account of TNC regulation], p. 6. UNRISD.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by the Global Mining Initiative which was begun by nine of the largest metals and mining companies and which led to the formation of the [[International Council on Mining and Metals]], whose purpose was to "act as a catalyst" in an effort to improve social and environmental performance in the mining and metals industry internationally.&lt;ref name=RocksHardPlaces/&gt; The mining industry has provided funding to various conservation groups, some of which have been working with conservation agendas that are at odds with an emerging acceptance of the rights of indigenous people – particularly the right to make land-use decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Challenge to Conservationists: Can we protect natural habitats without abusing the people who live in them?

Certification of [[Mineral industry of Peru|mines with good practices]] occurs through the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). For example, [[ISO 9000]] and [[ISO 14001]], which certify an "auditable environmental management system", involve short inspections, although they have been accused of lacking rigor.{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--Does everything in this sentence following "which" refer to BOTH ISO 9000 and ISO 14001?

Miscellaneous other certification programs exist for various projects, typically through nonprofit groups.&lt;ref name=RocksHardPlaces/&gt;{{rp|185–6}}

The purpose of a 2012 EPS PEAKS paper&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, M.J. &amp; Denison, M. (2012) Environmental management for extractives, PROFESSIONAL EVIDENCE AND APPLIED KNOWLEDGE SERVICES http://partnerplatform.org/?zl177g4a&lt;/ref&gt; was to provide evidence on policies managing [[Environmental economics|ecological costs]] and maximise [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] benefits of mining using host country regulatory initiatives. It found existing literature suggesting donors encourage developing countries to:

* Make the environment-poverty link and introduce cutting-edge wealth measures and [[natural capital]] accounts.
* Reform old taxes in line with more recent financial innovation, engage directly with the companies, enacting land use and impact assessments, and incorporate specialised support and standards agencies.
* Set in play transparency and community participation initiatives using the wealth accrued.

===Waste===
Ore mills generate large amounts of waste, called [[tailings]]. For example, 99 tons of waste are generated per ton of copper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Consequences of over Exploitation of Mineral Resources|url = http://www.preservearticles.com/2012021323185/consequences-of-over-exploitation-of-mineral-resources.html|website = www.preservearticles.com|accessdate = 2015-06-11|first = Debjani|last = }}&lt;/ref&gt; with even higher ratios in [[gold mining]] - because only 5.3 g of gold is extracted per ton of ore, a ton of gold produces 200,000 tons of tailings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is the Cost of Mining Gold? - Visual Capitalist|url = http://www.visualcapitalist.com/what-is-the-cost-of-mining-gold/|website = Visual Capitalist|accessdate = 2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (As time goes on and richer deposits are exhausted - and technology improves to permit - this number is going down to .5 g and less.) These tailings can be toxic. Tailings, which are usually produced as a [[slurry]], are most commonly dumped into ponds made from naturally existing valleys.&lt;ref name=EPADesignDams&gt;US EPA. (1994). [http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/industrial/special/mining/.../tailings.pdf Technical Report: Design and Evaluation of Tailings Dams]{{dead link|date=November 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These ponds are secured by impoundments ([[dam]]s or [[embankment dam]]s).&lt;ref name=EPADesignDams/&gt; In 2000 it was estimated that 3,500 tailings impoundments existed, and that every year, 2 to 5 major failures and 35 minor failures occurred;&lt;ref name="StewardDams" /&gt; for example, in the [[Marcopper mining disaster]] at least 2 million tons of tailings were released into a local river.&lt;ref name=StewardDams&gt;TE Martin, MP Davies. (2000). [http://www.infomine.com/publications/docs/Martin2000.pdf Trends in the stewardship of tailings dams].&lt;/ref&gt; In central Finland, Talvivaara Terrafame polymetal mine waste effluent since 2008 and numerous leaks of saline mine water has resulted in ecological collapse of nearby lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leppänen|first=Jaakko Johannes|last2=Weckström|first2=Jan|last3=Korhola|first3=Atte|date=2017-09-05|title=Multiple mining impacts induce widespread changes in ecosystem dynamics in a boreal lake|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-11421-8|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-11421-8|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subaqueous tailings disposal is another option.&lt;ref name=EPADesignDams/&gt; The mining industry has argued that submarine tailings disposal (STD), which disposes of tailings in the sea, is ideal because it avoids the risks of tailings ponds; although the practice is illegal in the United States and Canada, it is used in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;Coumans C. (2002). [http://www.bostgroup.com.au/images/mining/Submarine-Tailings-Disposal-Toolkit.pdf Mining’s Problem with Waste]. MiningWatch Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

The waste is classified as either sterile or mineralised, with acid generating potential, and the movement and storage of this material forms a major part of the mine planning process. When the mineralised package is determined by an economic cut-off, the near-grade mineralised waste is usually dumped separately with view to later treatment should market conditions change and it becomes economically viable. Civil engineering design parameters are used in the design of the waste dumps, and special conditions apply to high-rainfall areas and to seismically active areas. Waste dump designs must meet all regulatory requirements of the country in whose jurisdiction the mine is located. It is also common practice to rehabilitate dumps to an internationally acceptable standard, which in some cases means that higher standards than the local regulatory standard are applied.&lt;ref name="StewardDams" /&gt;

===Renewable energy and mining===
Many mining sites are remote and not connected to the grid. Electricity is typically generated with [[diesel generator]]s. Due to high transportation cost and theft during transportation the cost for generating electricity is normally high. Renewable energy applications are becoming an alternative or amendment. Both [[Solar power|solar]] and [[wind power]] plants can contribute in saving diesel costs at mining sites. Renewable energy applications have been built at mining sites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.th-energy.net/english/platform-renewable-energy-and-mining/database-solar-wind-power-plants/&lt;/ref&gt;
Cost savings can reach up to 70%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mining.com/web/at-mining-sites-renewable-energy-systems-are-up-to-70-percent-less-expensive-than-diesel-power/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mining industry==
{{Main|List of mines|List of mining companies|:Category:Mining companies|:Category:Mining industry by country}}
Mining exists in many countries. London is known as the capital of global "mining houses" such as [[Rio Tinto Group]], [[BHP Billiton]], and [[Anglo American PLC]].&lt;ref name=NAIndustryProfile&gt;MacDonald A. (2002). [http://www.iisd.org/publications/pub.aspx?id=448 Industry in Transition: A Profile of the North American Mining Sector]. [http://www.iisd.org/pdf/2001/mmsd_na_mining_profile.pdf Free full-text].&lt;/ref&gt; The US mining industry is also large, but it is dominated by the coal and other nonmetal minerals (e.g., rock and sand), and various regulations have worked to reduce the significance of mining in the United States.&lt;ref name=NAIndustryProfile/&gt; In 2007 the total [[market capitalization]] of mining companies was reported at US$962 billion, which compares to a total global market cap of publicly traded companies of about US$50 trillion in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters.

OECD.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[mineral industry of Africa]] includes the mining of various minerals; it produces relatively little of the industrial metals copper, lead, and zinc, but according to one estimate has as a percent of world reserves 40% of gold, 60% of cobalt, and 90% of the world's [[platinum group]] metals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010108000000/http://www.mbendi.com/indy/ming/af/p0005.htm Mining in Africa – Overview]. Mbendi.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mining in India]] is a significant part of that country's economy. In the developed world, [[mining in Australia]], with [[BHP Billiton]] founded and headquartered in the country, and mining in Canada are particularly significant. For [[rare earth mineral]]s mining, China reportedly controlled 95% of production in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/at-the-edge/2013/04/02/chinas-continuing-monopoly-over-rare-earth-minerals China's Continuing Monopoly Over Rare Earth Minerals]. ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bingham Canyon April 2005.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bingham Canyon Mine]] of Rio Tinto's subsidiary, Kennecott Utah Copper.]]
While exploration and mining can be conducted by individual entrepreneurs or small businesses, most modern-day mines are large enterprises requiring large amounts of capital to establish. Consequently, the mining sector of the industry is dominated by large, often multinational, companies, most of them publicly listed. It can be argued that what is referred to as the 'mining industry' is actually two sectors, one specializing in exploration for new resources and the other in mining those resources. The exploration sector is typically made up of individuals and small mineral resource companies, called "juniors", which are dependent on venture capital. The mining sector is made up of large multinational companies that are sustained by production from their mining operations. Various other industries such as equipment manufacture, environmental testing, and metallurgy analysis rely on, and support, the mining industry throughout the world. Canadian stock exchanges have a particular focus on mining companies, particularly junior exploration companies through Toronto's [[TSX Venture Exchange]]; Canadian companies raise capital on these exchanges and then invest the money in exploration globally.&lt;ref name=NAIndustryProfile/&gt; Some have argued that below juniors there exists a substantial sector of illegitimate companies primarily focused on manipulating stock prices.&lt;ref name=NAIndustryProfile/&gt;

Mining operations can be grouped into five major categories in terms of their respective resources. These are oil and gas extraction, coal mining, metal ore mining, nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying, and mining support activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart_code=21&amp;search=2017%20NAICS%20Search|title=US Census Bureau Site North American Industry Classification System main page|last=ESMD|first=US Census Bureau Classification Development Branch,|website=www.census.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all of these categories, oil and gas extraction remains one of the largest in terms of its global economic importance. Prospecting potential mining sites, a vital area of concern for the mining industry, is now done using sophisticated new technologies such as seismic prospecting and remote-sensing satellites. Mining is heavily affected by the prices of the [[commodity]] minerals, which are often volatile. The [[2000s commodities boom]] ("commodities supercycle") increased the prices of commodities, driving aggressive mining. In addition, the price of gold increased dramatically in the 2000s, which increased [[gold mining]]; for example, one study found that conversion of forest in the Amazon increased six-fold from the period 2003–2006 (292 ha/yr) to the period 2006–2009 (1,915 ha/yr), largely due to artisanal mining.&lt;ref&gt;Swenson JJ, Carter CE, Domec J-C, Delgado CI (2011) [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0018875 Gold Mining in the Peruvian Amazon: Global Prices, Deforestation, and Mercury Imports].

===Corporate classifications===
Mining companies can be classified based on their size and financial capabilities:

* ''Major'' companies are considered to have an adjusted annual mining-related revenue of more than US$500 million, with the financial capability to develop a major mine on its own.
* ''Intermediate'' companies have at least $50 million in annual revenue but less than $500 million.
* ''Junior'' companies rely on [[equity (economics)|equity]] financing as their principal means of funding exploration. Juniors are mainly pure exploration companies, but may also produce minimally, and do not have a revenue exceeding US$50 million.&lt;ref name=MEG-CorpClass&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.metalseconomics.com/pdf/PDAC%202009%20World%20Exploration%20Trends.pdf|title=Metals Economics Group World Exploration Trends Report|accessdate=2009-05-05|publisher=Metals Economics Group Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation and governance===
New regulations and a process of legislative reforms aim to improve the harmonization and stability of the mining sector in mineral-rich countries.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of the 21st century the booming and increasingly complex mining sector in mineral-rich countries was providing only slight benefits to local communities, especially in given the sustainability issues. Increasing debate and influence by [[NGOs]] and local communities called for a new approahes which would also include disadvantaged communities, and work towards [[sustainable development]] even after [[mine closure]] (including transparency and revenue management). By the early 2000s, community development issues and resettlements became mainstream concerns in World Bank mining projects.&lt;ref name="Lucia"/&gt; Mining-industry expansion after mineral prices increased in 2003 and also potential fiscal revenues in those countries created an omission in the other economic sectors in terms of finances and development. Furthermore, this highlighted regional and local demand for mining revenues and an inability of sub-national governments to effectively use the revenues. The [[Fraser Institute]] (a Canadian think tank) has highlighted{{clarify|date=December 2016}} the environmental protection laws in developing countries, as well as voluntary efforts by mining companies to improve their environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miningfacts.org/Environment/Do-Canadian-mining-companies-operating-abroad-face-weaker-environmental-regulations/ Do Canadian mining companies operating abroad face weaker environmental regulations?]. MiningFacts.org. [[Fraser Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the [[Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative]] (EITI) was mainstreamed{{clarify|date=December 2016}} in all countries cooperating with the World Bank in mining industry reform.&lt;ref name="Lucia"/&gt; The EITI operates and was implemented with the support of the EITI multi-donor trust fund, managed by the World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative|title=Governance Structure|url=http://eiti.org/about/governance|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EITI aims to increase transparency in transactions between governments and companies in extractive industries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The entrance process is voluntary for each country and is monitored by multiple stakeholders including governments, private companies and civil society representatives, responsible for disclosure and dissemination of the reconciliation report;&lt;ref name="Lucia"/&gt; however, the competitive disadvantage of company-by company public report is for some of the businesses in Ghana at least, the main constraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Ghanaian Journal|title=At the Fifth EITI Global Conference|url=http://www.theghanaianjournal.com/2011/03/16/at-the-fifth-eiti-global-conference/|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the outcome assessment in terms of failure or success of the new EITI regulation does not only "rest on the government's shoulders" but also on civil society and companies.&lt;ref name="Owona, S.O."&gt;{{cite web|last=Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative|title=Report of 5th EITI Global Conference in Paris, 2011|url=http://eiti.org/files/Report_of_5th_EITI_Global_Conference.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726083709/http://eiti.org/files/Report_of_5th_EITI_Global_Conference.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 July 2011|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, implementation has issues; inclusion or exclusion of [[artisanal mining]] and small-scale mining (ASM) from the EITI and how to deal with "non-cash" payments made by companies to subnational governments. Furthermore, the disproportionate revenues the mining industry can bring to the comparatively small number of people that it employs,&lt;ref name="Lulu"&gt;{{cite web|last=World Bank’s Oil, Gas and Mining Policy and Operations Unit (COCPO)|title=Advancing the EITI in the Mining Sector: Implementation Issues|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTOGMC/Resources/advancing_eiti_mining.pdf|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; causes other problems, like a lack of investment in other less lucrative sectors, leading to swings in government revenuebecause of volatility in the oil markets. Artisanal mining is clearly an issue in EITI Countries such as the Central African Republic, D.R. Congo, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – i.e. almost half of the mining countries implementing the EITI.&lt;ref name="Lulu"/&gt; Among other things, limited scope of the EITI involving disparity in terms of knowledge of the industry and negotiation skills, thus far flexibility of the policy (e.g. liberty of the countries to expand beyond the minimum requirements and adapt it to their needs), creates another risk of unsuccessful implementation. Public awareness increase, where government should act as a bridge between public and initiative for a successful outcome of the policy is an important element to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Revenue Watch Institute 2010 |title=Promoting Transparency in the Extractive Sectors: An EITI Training for Tanzania Legislators |url=http://www.revenuewatch.org/news/news-article/tanzania/promoting-transparency-extractive-sectors-eiti-training-tanzania-legislat |accessdate=6 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720234318/http://www.revenuewatch.org/news/news-article/tanzania/promoting-transparency-extractive-sectors-eiti-training-tanzania-legislat |archivedate=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Bank===
The [[World Bank]] has been involved in mining since 1955, mainly through grants from its [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], with the Bank's [[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency]] offering [[political risk]] insurance.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the Bank and mining, see [http://www.pdac.ca/pdac/publications/papers/2001/pdf/Weber-Fahr(T-8).pdf Mining, Sustainability and Risk:World Bank Group Experiences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929090158/http://www.pdac.ca/pdac/publications/papers/2001/pdf/Weber-Fahr(T-8).pdf |date=2011-09-29 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1955 and 1990 it provided about $2 billion to fifty mining projects, broadly categorized as reform and rehabilitation, greenfield mine construction, mineral processing, technical assistance, and engineering. These projects have been criticized, particularly the [[Carajás Mine|Ferro Carajas project]] of Brazil, begun in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;See the 1995 ''World Development'' '''23'''(3) pp. 385–400.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank established mining codes intended to increase foreign investment; in 1988 it solicited feedback from 45 mining companies on how to increase their involvement.&lt;ref name=RocksHardPlaces/&gt;{{rp|20}}

In 1992 the World Bank began to push for privatization of [[government-owned corporation|government-owned mining companies]] with a new set of codes, beginning with its report ''The Strategy for African Mining''. In 1997, Latin America's largest miner [[Vale (mining company)|Companhia Vale do Rio Doce]] (CVRD) was privatized. These and other developments such as the Philippines 1995 Mining Act led the bank to publish a third report (''Assistance for Minerals Sector Development and Reform in Member Countries'') which endorsed mandatory environment impact assessments and attention to the concerns of the local population. The codes based on this report are influential in the legislation of developing nations. The new codes are intended to encourage development through tax holidays, zero custom duties, reduced income taxes, and related measures.&lt;ref name=RocksHardPlaces/&gt;{{rp|22}} The results of these codes were analyzed by a group from the University of Quebec, which concluded that the codes promote foreign investment but "fall very short of permitting sustainable development".&lt;ref&gt;GRAMA.

==Safety==
[[File:Transporte por cable de minerales, Devnya, Bulgaria, 2016-05-27, DD 65.jpg|thumb|Mining transport in Devnya, Bulgaria.]]
{{Main|Mine safety}}Safety has long been a concern in the mining business, especially in sub-surface mining. The [[Courrières mine disaster]], Europe's worst [[mining accident]], involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern [[France]] on March 10, 1906. This disaster was surpassed only by the [[Benxihu Colliery]] accident in [[China]] on April 26, 1942, which killed 1,549 miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3226,36-749532,0.html|title=Marcel Barrois|date=March 10, 2006|publisher=Le Monde|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades, [[mining accident]]s still occur. Government figures indicate that 5,000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year, while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1595235,00.html Where The Coal Is Stained With Blood]". ''TIME''. March 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Mining accidents continue worldwide, including accidents causing dozens of fatalities at a time such as the 2007 [[Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster]] in Russia, the [[2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion]] in China, and the 2010 [[Upper Big Branch Mine disaster]] in the United States. Mining has been identified by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) as a priority industry sector in the [[National Occupational Research Agenda]] (NORA) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nora/councils/mining/default.html|title=NORA Mining Sector Council {{!}} NIOSH {{!}} CDC|date=2017-10-24|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mine Safety and Health Administration|Mining Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) was established in 1978 to "work to prevent death, illness, and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for US miners." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msha.gov/about/mission|title=Mission {{!}} Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)|website=www.msha.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its implementation in 1978, the number of miner fatalities has decreased from 242 miners in 1978 to 28 miners in 2015.

There are numerous [[occupational hazard]]s associated with mining, including exposure to [[rockdust]] which can lead to diseases such as [[silicosis]], [[asbestosis]], and [[pneumoconiosis]]. Gases in the mine can lead to [[asphyxia]]tion and could also be ignited. Mining equipment can generate considerable noise, putting workers at risk for [[hearing loss]]. [[Cave-in]]s, [[Rockfall|rock falls]], and exposure to excess heat are also known hazards. The current NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) of noise is 85 dBA with a 3 dBA exchange rate and the MSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) is 90 dBA with a 5 dBA exchange rate as an 8-hour time-weighted average. NIOSH has found that 25% of noise-exposed workers in Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction have hearing impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masterson|first=Elizabeth A.|last2=Deddens|first2=James A.|last3=Themann|first3=Christa L.|last4=Bertke|first4=Stephen|last5=Calvert|first5=Geoffrey M.|date=2015-4|title=Trends in worker hearing loss by industry sector, 1981-2010|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Trends+in+worker+hearing+loss+by+industry+sector,+1981-2010.|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=58|issue=4|pages=392–401|doi=10.1002/ajim.22429|issn=1097-0274|pmc=4557728|pmid=25690583}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of hearing loss increased by 1% from 1991-2001 within these workers.

Noise studies have been conducted in several mining environments. Stageloaders (84-102 dBA), shearers (85-99 dBA), auxiliary fans (84-120 dBA), continuous mining machines (78-109 dBA), and roof bolters (92-103 dBA) represent some of the noisiest equipment in underground [[Coal mining|coal mines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/works/coversheet1107.html|title=Summary of Longwall and Continuous Miner Section Noise Studies in Underground Coal Mines|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dragline excavator|Dragline]] oilers, dozer operators, and welders using air arcing were occupations with the highest noise exposures among surface coal miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nioshtic-2/20025335.html|title=NIOSHTIC-2  Publications Search - 20025335 - Worker exposure and equipment noise in large surface coal mines.|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mines had the highest hearing loss injury likelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Kan|last2=Azman|first2=Amanda S.|date=2018-3|title=Evaluating hearing loss risks in the mining industry through MSHA citations|journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|volume=15|issue=3|pages=246–262|doi=10.1080/15459624.2017.1412584|issn=1545-9632|pmc=5848488|pmid=29200378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper [[Underground mine ventilation|ventilation]], [[hearing protection]], and spraying equipment with water are important safety practices in mines.

==Metal reserves and recycling==
{{main|Landfill mining|Recycling}}
{{see also|Conflict resource|List of critical mineral raw materials}}

During the 20th century, the variety of [[metals]] used in society grew rapidly. Today, the development of major nations such as China and India and advances in technologies are fueling an ever-greater demand. The result is that metal mining activities are expanding and more and more of the world’s metal stocks are above ground in use rather than below ground as unused reserves. An example is the in-use stock of [[copper]]. Between 1932 and 1999, copper in use in the US rose from {{convert|73|kg|lb}} to {{convert|238|kg|lb}} per person.&lt;ref name="unep"&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111223004208/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/MetalStocks/tabid/56054/Default.aspx ''The Recycling Rates of Metals: A Status Report''] 2010, [[International Resource Panel]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

95% of the energy used to make aluminium from [[bauxite]] ore is saved by using recycled material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/feb/22/pledges.waste ''Tread lightly: Aluminium attack''] Carolyn Fry, Guardian.co.uk, 22 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, levels of metals recycling are generally low. In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]], hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), published reports on metal stocks that exist within society&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111223004208/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/MetalStocks/tabid/56054/Default.aspx ''Metal Stocks in Society: Scientific Synthesis''] 2010, [[International Resource Panel]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt; and their recycling rates.&lt;ref name="unep" /&gt;

The report's authors observed that the metal stocks in society can serve as huge mines above ground. However, they warned that the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid cars, and fuel cells are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology.

As recycling rates are low and so much metal has already been extracted, some [[landfill]]s now contain a higher concentrations of metal than mines themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.macfarlanes.com/media/1467/landfill-mining-new-opportunities-ahead.pdf|url = http://www.macfarlanes.com/media/1467/landfill-mining-new-opportunities-ahead.pdf|website = www.macfarlanes.com|accessdate = 2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true of aluminium, used in cans, and precious metals, found in discarded electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Landfill Mining|url = http://www.enviroalternatives.com/landfill.html|website = www.enviroalternatives.com|accessdate = 2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, waste after 15 years has still not broken down, so less processing would be required when compared to mining ores. A study undertaken by Cranfield University has found £360 million of metals could be mined from just 4 landfill sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Study shows around £360 million of metals could be mined from just four landfill sites|url = http://www.rebnews.com/news/resource_efficiency/study_shows_around_p360_million_metals_mined_just_four_landfill_sites.html|website = www.rebnews.com|accessdate = 2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also up to 20MJ/kg of energy in waste, potentially making the re-extraction more profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.elfm.eu/Uploads/ELFM/FILE_79F81D49-34DC-4B5B-9BFC-5E5101CE7520.PDF|url = http://www.elfm.eu/Uploads/ELFM/FILE_79F81D49-34DC-4B5B-9BFC-5E5101CE7520.PDF|website = www.elfm.eu|accessdate = 2015-06-11|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150612103124/http://www.elfm.eu/Uploads/ELFM/FILE_79F81D49-34DC-4B5B-9BFC-5E5101CE7520.PDF|archivedate = 2015-06-12|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although the first landfill mine opened in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel in 1953, little work has followed due to the abundance of accessible ores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Assessing the opportunities of landfill mining |publisher= Research database – University of Groningen|url = https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/publications/pub(e2682e00-9881-4bac-ad4e-a4deb0dd4f1e).html|website = www.rug.nl|accessdate = 2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupational noise is considered an [[occupational hazard]] traditionally linked to loud industries such as [[ship-building]], [[mining]], railroad work, [[welding]], and [[construction]], but can be present in any workplace where hazardous noise is present.

== Regulation ==
In the United States, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) work together to provide standards and regulations for noise in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/standards.html|title=Occupational Noise Exposure: Standards|website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA), [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) have all set standards on hazardous occupational noise in their respective industries. Each industry is different, as workers'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''' tasks and equipment differ, but most regulations agree that noise becomes hazardous when it exceeds 85 [[Decibel|decibels]], for an 8-hour time exposure (typical work shift). This relationship between allotted noise level and exposure time is known as an [[Exposure action value]] (EAV) or [[Permissible exposure limit]] (PEL). The EAV or PEL can be seen as equations which manipulate the allotted exposure time according to the intensity of the industrial noise. This equation works as an inverse, exponential, relationship. As the industrial noise intensity increases, the allotted exposure tie, to still remain safe, decreases.

The above calculations of PEL and EAV are based on measurements taken to determine the intensity of that particular industrial noise. [[A-weighting|A-weighted]] measurements are commonly used to determine noise levels that can cause harm to the human ear. There are also special exposure meters available that integrate noise over a period of time to give an [[Sound level meter#LAT or Leq: Equivalent continuous sound level|L&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;]] value (equivalent sound pressure level), defined by standards.

== Risks of Occupational Hearing Loss ==
[[File:Temporary threshold shift (hearing loss) after noise exposure.jpg|thumb|Temporary hearing loss after loud noise exposure. If such exposure is long enough, this temporary threshold shift may become permanent.&lt;ref name="Измеров-2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Izmerov|first1=Nikolai|last2=Suvorov|first2=Herman|last3=Prokopenko|first3=Ludmila|title=The man and the noise (Человек и шум)|year=2001|publisher=ГЕОТАР-МЕД|location=Moscow|language=ru|isbn=5-9231-0057-6|page=103|chapter=Chapter 4. Occupational hearing loss}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Occupational noise, if experienced repeatedly, at high intensity, for an extended period of time, can cause [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL) which is then classified as [[occupational hearing loss]].

Noise, in the context of industrial noise, is hazardous to a person's hearing because of its loud intensity through repeated long-term exposure. In order for [[noise]] to cause [[hearing impairment]] for the worker, the noise has to be close enough, loud enough, and sustained long enough to damage the [[Hair cell|hair cells]] in the auditory system. Please see [[Occupational hearing loss]] or [[Noise-induced hearing loss]] for more information regarding the physiology of hearing loss. These factors have been taken into account by the governing occupational health and safety organization to determine the unsafe noise exposure levels and durations for their respective industries.

Noise can also affect the safety of the employee and others. Noise can be a causal factor in [[Work accident|work accidents]] as it may mask hazards and warning signals and impede concentration. High intensity noise interferes with vital workplace communication which increases the chance of accidents and decreases productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soundcontroltech.com/effects-of-noise-on-the-individual-in-the-workplace/|title=Effects of Noise on The Individual in the Workplace {{!}} Sound Control|website=soundcontroltech.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noise may also act synergistically with other hazards to increase the risk of harm to workers. In particular, toxic materials (e.g. some [[Solvent|solvents]], metals, asphyxiants and pesticides) have some [[Ototoxicity|ototoxic properties]] that may affect hearing function.

Modern thinking in [[occupational safety and health]] further identifies noise as hazardous to workers' safety and health. This hazard is experienced in various places of employment and through a variety of sources.

Noise, in the context of industrial noise, is hazardous to a persons hearing because of its loud intensity through repeated long-term exposure. In order for [[Noise]] to cause [[Hearing impairment]] for the worker, the noise has to be close enough, loud enough and the listener has to be exposed for long enough. These factors have been taken into account by the governing occupational health and safety organizations as they determine the unsafe noise exposure levels and durations for their respective industries.

[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA), [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA)  have all set standards on hazardous occupational noise in their respective industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf|title=Criteria for Recommended Standard: Occupational Noise Exposure|last=|first=|date=|website=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each industry is different, as workers tasks and equipment differ, but most regulations agree that noise becomes hazardous when it exceeds 85 [[Decibel]], for an 8-hour exposure (typical work shift). This relationship between allotted noise level and exposure time is known as an [[Exposure action value]] (EAV) or [[Permissible exposure limit]] (PEL). The EAV or PEL can be seen as equations which manipulate the allotted exposure time according to the intensity of the industrial noise. This equation works as an inverse relationship.

[[File:Hierarchy of Controls (By NIOSH).jpg|thumb|Hierarchy of Controls guideline]]
There are several ways to limit your exposure to hazardous occupational noise. The [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|hierarchy of controls]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/|title=CDC - Hierarchy of Controls - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a guideline for reducing hazardous noise. First, the company can eliminate the noise source. If the noise source cannot be eliminated, the company must try to reduce the noise with alternative methods. This process is called acoustic quieting.  

[[Acoustic quieting]] is the process of making machinery quieter by damping vibrations to prevent them from reaching the observer. The company can isolate the certain piece of machinery by placing materials on the machine or in between the machine and the worker to decreases the signal intensity that reaches the worker's ear.

To decrease an employee's exposure to hazardous noise, the company can also take [[Administrative controls|administrative control]] by limiting the employee's exposure time. This can be done by changing work shifts and switching employees out from the noise exposure area. Lastly, to decrease occupational noise exposure, [[hearing protection]] should be used. There are several types of [[Earplug|earplugs]] and earmuffs that can be used to attenuate the noise to a safe level.

'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''

For a more detailed description of the hierarchy of controls, please see [[Occupational hearing loss]]. 

== Initiatives ==
Since the hazards of occupational noise exposure were realized, programs and initiatives such as the US [[Buy Quiet]] program have been set up to regulate or discourage noise exposure. The Buy Quiet initiative promotes the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourages manufacturers to design quieter machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html|title=Buy Quiet|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] was created to recognize successes in hearing loss prevention programs or initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeinsound.us/|title=Safe-in-Sound:Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|website=Safe-in-Sound|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orchitis''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɔr|ˈ|k|aɪ|t|ɪ|s}} or '''orchiditis''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɔr|k|ɪ|ˈ|d|aɪ|t|ɪ|s}} (from the Ancient Greek [[wikt:ὄρχις#Ancient Greek|ὄρχις]] meaning "testicle"; same root as ''[[orchid]]'') is [[inflammation]] of the [[testes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|six/000075643|orchitis}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also involve swelling, heavy pains and frequent infection, particularly of the epididymis, and is more rarely known as '''didymitis''' (as in ''[[epididymis]]'').

==Symptoms==
[[Symptom]]s of orchitis are similar to those of [[testicular torsion]]. These can include:{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* [[hematospermia]] (blood in the [[semen]])
* [[hematuria]] (blood in the [[urine]])
* severe [[pain]]
* visible [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of a testicle or testicles and often the inguinal lymph nodes on the affected side.

==Causes==
Orchitis can be related to [[epididymitis]] infection that has spread to the [[testicles]] (then called "epididymo-orchitis"), sometimes caused by the [[sexually transmitted disease]]s [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and [[gonorrhea]].  It has also been reported in cases of males infected with [[brucellosis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Brucellosis in Humans and Animals'' World Health Organization Publication number WHO/CDS/EPR/2006.7 [http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/Brucellosis.pdf]{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orchitis can also be seen during active [[mumps]], particularly in adolescent boys.

[[Ischemic]] orchitis may result from damage to the blood vessels of the [[spermatic cord]] during [[Hernia repair|inguinal herniorrhaphy]], and may in the worst event lead to [[testicular atrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Simons MP, Aufenacker T, Bay-Nielsen M, etal |title=European Hernia Society guidelines on the treatment of inguinal hernia in adult patients |journal=Hernia |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=343–403 |date=August 2009  |pmid=19636493 |pmc=2719730 |doi=10.1007/s10029-009-0529-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Ultrasonography of orchitis.jpg|thumb|[[Doppler ultrasound]] of the scrotum, in the [[axial plane]], showing orchitis (as part of [[epididymo-orchitis]]) as [[hypoechogenic]] and slightly heterogenic left testicular tissue (right in image), with an increased blood flow. There is also swelling of peritesticular tissue.]]
* Blood – ESR high
* Urine – Cultural &amp; Sensitivity test
* Ultrasound scanning

==Treatment==
In most cases where orchitis is caused by epididymitis, treatment is an oral antibiotic such as [[cefalexin]] or [[ciprofloxacin]] until infection clears up. In both causes [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] such as [[naproxen]] or [[ibuprofen]] are recommended to relieve pain. Sometimes stronger pain medications in the [[opiate]] category are called for and are frequently prescribed by experienced [[emergency department]] physicians.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

'''The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &amp; Child Health''' (PMNCH) is a multi-constituency partnership hosted by the [[World Health Organization]] and chaired by [[Graça Machel]]. PMNCH seeks to achieve universal access to comprehensive, high-quality reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health care. PMNCH works with more than 650 members in the reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) communities across seven constituencies:

# Academic research and teaching institutions 
# Donors and foundations
# Health-care professionals
# Multilateral agencies
# Non-governmental organizations 
# Partner countries 
# The private sector

PMNCH describes itself as "a platform for knowledge, advocacy and accountability to improve women and children’s health". The Partnership is governed by a Board chaired by [[Graça Machel]].

==Main Activities==

The Partnership plays a central role in facilitating joint action on many fronts, mainly progress towards the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) 4 and 5, to
reduce child mortality and improve maternal health, as tracked by  the Countdown to 2015
initiative, and through support for the [[Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health|Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health]] (Global Strategy) and Every Woman Every Child. PMNCH enables members to share
strategies, align objectives and resources, and collectively agree on policy interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reaching Every Woman and Every Child through Partnership|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/knowledge/publications/20130620_pmnchbrochurelowres.pdf?ua=1|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PMNCH’s work and support to partners is focused on three key Strategic Objectives: 
# Promotion of knowledge and innovation for action in order to enhance policy, service delivery and financing mechanisms.  
# Advocacy to mobilize and consolidate resources and greater engagement towards RMNCH.  
# Promotion of accountability for resources and results in order to strengthen monitoring of RMNCH’s efforts.

The Partnership issues annual reports on progress of commitments from more than 250 stakeholders and estimates that the Global Strategy has leveraged over US$18 billion in new and additional money for women’s and children’s health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The PMNCH 2013 Report|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/knowledge/publications/2013_pmnch_report/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

PMNCH was launched in September 2005 when the world’s three leading maternal, newborn and child health alliances joined forces under the new name of The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &amp; Child Health. 80 original members joined together from the three organizations, which included: the Partnership for Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health, hosted by the World Health Organization in Geneva; the Healthy Newborn Partnership, based at [[Save the Children]] USA; and the Child Survival Partnership, hosted by [[Unicef|UNICEF]] in New York. All three partnerships focused on accelerating action by countries—both donor and
developing countries—to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 ([[Child mortality|reduce child
mortality]]) and 5 ([[Maternal health|improve maternal health]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PMNCH History|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/about/history/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patient portals''' are [[healthcare]]-related [[web application|online application]]s that allow [[patient]]s to interact and communicate with their healthcare providers, such as [[physician]]s and [[hospital]]s. Typically, portal services are available on the Internet at all hours of the day and night. Some patient portal applications exist as stand-alone [[web site]]s and sell their services to healthcare providers.  Other portal applications are integrated into the existing web site of a healthcare provider. Still others are modules added onto an existing [[electronic medical record|electronic medical record (EMR)]] system.  What all of these services share is the ability of patients to interact with their medical information via the Internet. Currently, the lines between an [[electronic medical record|EMR]], a [[personal health record]], and a patient portal are blurring.  For example, Intuit Health and Microsoft [[HealthVault]] describe themselves as personal health records (PHRs), but they can interface with EMRs and communicate through the [[Continuity of Care Record]] standard, displaying patient data on the Internet so it can be viewed through a patient portal.

== Features and benefits ==
{{One source section|date=September 2017}}
The central feature that makes any system a patient portal is the ability to expose individual patient health information in a secure manner through the Internet. In addition, virtually all patient portals allow patients to interact in some way with health care providers. Patient portals benefit both patients and providers by increasing efficiency and productivity. Patient portals are also regarded as a key tool to help physicians meet "meaningful use" requirements in order to receive federal incentive checks, especially for providing health information to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physicianspractice.com/technology/content/article/1462168/1890621 |last=Terry |first=Ken |title=Patient Portals: Beyond Meaningful Use |website=Physicians Practice |publisher=UBM Medica, LLC |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some patient portal applications enable patients to register and complete [[Form (web)|form]]s online, which can streamline visits to clinics and hospitals. Many portal applications also enable patients to request [[Medical prescription|prescription]] refills online, order [[eyeglass]]es and [[contact lenses]], access [[medical record]]s, pay bills, review lab results, and schedule medical appointments. Patient portals also typically allow patients to communicate directly with healthcare providers by asking questions, leaving comments, or sending e-mail messages.

== Disadvantages ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
The major shortcoming of most patient portals is their linkage to a single health organization. If a patient uses more than one organization for healthcare, the patient normally needs to log on to each organization’s portal to access information. This results in a fragmented view of individual patient data.

== Practice portals ==
Portal applications for individual practices typically exist in tandem with patient portals, allowing access to patient information and records, as well as schedules, payments, and messages from patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://practiceportals.com/ |title=AuntMinnie.com Practice Portals |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715013534/http://practiceportals.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most patient portals require the practice to have some type of electronic medical record or patient management system, as the patient data needs to be stored in a data repository then retrieved by the patient portal.
While lauding its ease-of-use, some physicians note that it is hard to encourage patients to utilize online portals to benefit both themselves and the medical practice staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physicianspractice.com/blog/content/article/1462168/2026624 |last=Litton |first=J. Scott, Jr. |title=Encouraging Patients to Use Online Communication |website=Physicians Practice |publisher=UBM Medica, LLC |date=February 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security ==
{{One source section|date=September 2017}}
Health care providers in the US are bound to comply with [[HIPAA]] regulations.  These regulations specify what patient information must be held in confidence.  Something as seemingly trivial as a name is viewed by HIPAA as [[protected health information]].  For this reason, security has always been a top concern for the industry when dealing with the adoption of patient portals.  While there may be systems that are not HIPAA compliant, certainly most patient and practice portals are secure and compliant with HIPAA regulations.  The use of [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] and [[access control]] patterns are commonplace in the industry.  Patient access is typically validated with a user name and password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cms.hhs.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/HIPAA-Administrative-Simplification/EducationMaterials/downloads//HIPAAChecklist.pdf |format=PDF | title=Provider HIPAA Checklist: Moving Toward Compliance | website=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | date=March 2003 | accessdate=April 16, 2012 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912155206/http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/HIPAA-Administrative-Simplification/EducationMaterials/Downloads/HIPAAChecklist.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{One source section|date=September 2017}}
Internet portal technology has been in common use since the 1990s.  The financial industry has been particularly adept at using the Internet to grant individual users access to personal information.  Possibly because of the strictness of [[HIPAA]] regulations, or the lack of financial incentives for the health care providers, the adoption of patient portals has lagged behind other market segments.

The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (ARRA), in particular the HITECH Act within ARRA, sets aside approximately $19 billion for health information technology.  This funding will potentially offset the costs of [[electronic medical record]] systems for practicing physicians.  Because the conversion to electronic medical records is typically complex, systems often transition to patient portals first and then follow with a complete implementation of electronic medical records.

To attest to [[Meaningful Use]] Stage 2, eligible professionals must have 5 percent of their patients view, transmit or download their health information. Additionally, providers must implement notifications for follow up appointments and identify clinically relevant health information for more than 10 percent of their patients with two or more appointments in the preceding two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stage 2 |date=May 12, 2014 |website=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |url=http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Stage_2.html |access-date=25 May 2014 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525233434/http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Stage_2.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Consequently, [[personal health record]] systems are becoming more common and available. In 2012, 57 percent of providers already had a patient portal in place.{{cn|date=April 2015}} At present, individual health data are located primarily on paper in physicians' files. Patient portals have been developed to give patients better access to their information.  Given the patient mobility and the development of clear interoperable standards, the best documentation of patient medical history may involve data stored outside physician offices.

== Future ==
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
{{Speculation section|date=September 2017}}
}}
E-visits (remote use of medical services) may soon become one of the most commonly used options of patient portals.  The most likely demographic for uptake of e-visits are patients who live in remote rural areas, far from clinical services. An Internet session would be much cheaper and more convenient than traveling a long distance, especially for simple questions or minor medical complaints.

Providing a route that does not require in-person patient visits to a clinic may potentially benefit both patients and providers. Many organizations find that overall utilization drops when e-visits are implemented, in some places by as much as 25%.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} This makes e-visits a very interesting proposition for insurance companies, although few actually re-imburse for them currently. E-visits, with the proper functionality, also allow the patient to update their allergies, vital signs, and history information.

Providing e-visits allows the standard healthcare organization to offer a product that can compete on price with the retail clinics that are popping up in strip malls and [[Wal-mart]].

== Vendors ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
Some vendors, such as [[athenahealth]], [[Epic Systems]] and [[Cerner]] offer patient portals as one module of a complete Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. Other vendors, such as [[Allscripts]] and [[MedFusion]], offer patient portals that can be integrated with any EHR.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Recent market surveys{{Specify|date=September 2017}} have highlighted best of breed, or applications that excel at one or two functions, are losing ground to portals provided by large vendors. While best of breed portals are better equipped for [[interoperability]], portals supplied by larger vendors may be overall better equipped to handle the patient engagement requirements of Meaningful Use Stage 2.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3808">In [[obstetrics]], '''position''' is the orientation of the [[fetus]] in the [[womb]], identified by the location of the [[presentation (obstetrics)|presenting part]] of the fetus relative to the [[human pelvis|pelvis]] of the mother. Conventionally, it is the position assumed by the fetus before the process of birth, as the fetus assumes various positions and postures during the course of [[childbirth]].

== Positions ==
Depending upon which part of the fetus is expected to be delivered first (fetal presentation), there are many possible positions:
* [[Vertex presentation]] with longitudinal lie:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name
! Abb.
! Description
|-
| '''Left occipitoanterior'''
| LOA
| [[occiput]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;'''Occiput''' is the prominence of the back of the head&lt;/ref&gt; as against the buttocks, is close to the vagina (hence known as vertex presentation) faces anteriorly (forward with mother standing) and towards left. This is the most common position and lie.
|-
| '''Right occipitoanterior''' 
| ROA
| occiput faces anteriorly and towards right. Less common than LOA, but not associated with labor complications.
|-
| '''Left occipitoposterior'''
| 
| occiput faces posteriorly (behind) and towards left.
|-

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19576">'''Positive deviance''' (PD) is an approach to behavioral and social change based on the observation that in any community there are people whose uncommon but successful behaviors or strategies enable them to find better solutions to a problem than their peers, despite facing similar challenges and having no extra resources or knowledge than their peers. These individuals are referred to as positive deviants.&lt;ref name="Tuhus-Dubrow, R 2009"&gt;Tuhus-Dubrow, R. The Power of Positive Deviants: A promising new tactic for changing communities from the inside. Boston Globe. November 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternin, J., &amp; Choo, R. (2000).

Protecting Children from Exploitation and Trafficking Using the Positive Deviance Approach in Uganda and Indonesia.  Save the Children Federation, Inc., 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept first appeared in nutrition research in the 1970s.  Researchers observed that despite the poverty in a community, some poor families had well nourished children. Some suggested using information gathered from these outliers to plan nutrition programs.&lt;ref&gt;Wishik SM, Van der Vynckt S. The use of nutritional "positive deviants" to identify approaches for modification of dietary practices. Am J Public Health. 1976;66(1):38-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, Marian, Hossein Ghassemi, and Mohamed Mansour. Positive Deviance in Child Nutrition: with Emphasis on Psychosocial and Behavioral Aspects and Implications for Development. The United Nations University, 1990. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
Positive deviance is a strength-based approach which is applied to problems requiring behavior and social change. It is based on the following principles:&lt;ref name="Pascale, Sternin 2010"&gt;Pascale, Sternin, &amp; Sternin. (2010) The Power of Positive Deviance: How Unlikely Innovators Solve the World's Toughest Problems. Harvard Business Press. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Communities already have the solutions. They are the best experts to solve their problems.
* Communities self-organize and have the human resources and social assets to solve an agreed-upon problem.
* Collective intelligence. Intelligence and know-how is not concentrated in the leadership of a community alone or in external experts but is distributed throughout the community. Thus the PD process's aim is to draw out the collective intelligence to apply it to a specific problem requiring behavior or social change.
* Sustainability as the cornerstone of the approach. The PD approach enables the community or organization to seek and discover sustainable solutions to a given problem because the demonstrably successful uncommon behaviors are already practiced in that community within the constraints and challenges of the current situation.
* It is easier to change behavior by practicing it rather than knowing about it. "It is easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than think your way into a new way of acting".

==Original application==
The PD approach was first operationalized and applied in programming in the field by Jerry and Monique Sternin through their work with [[Save the Children]] in [[Vietnam]] in the 1990s (Tuhus-Dubrow, Sternin, Sternin &amp; Pascale).&lt;ref name="Tuhus-Dubrow, R 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pascale, Sternin 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khatoon, Ajeeba, Ambreen, Amama, Shaifique, Mohammad, Sternin, Monique. The Positive Deviance Approach to Improve Household Practice for Better Newborn and Maternal Health Outcomes in Haripur, Pakistan. Operations Manual Saving Newborn Lives. July 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the pilot 64% of children weighed in the pilot villages were malnourished. Through a PD inquiry, the villagers found poor peers in the community that through their uncommon but successful strategies, had well-nourished children. These families collected foods typically considered inappropriate for children (sweet potato greens, shrimp, and crabs), washed their children's hands before meals, and actively fed them three to four times a day instead of the typical two meals a day provided to children.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Marsh DR, Pachon H, Schroeder DG, et al. Design of a prospective, randomized evaluation of an integrated nutrition program in rural Viet Nam. Food Nutr Bull. 2002;23(4):34-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Mackintosh UAT, Marsh DR, Schroeder DG. Sustained positive deviant child care practices and their effects on child growth in Viet Nam. Food Nutr Bull. 2002;23(4):16-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without knowing it, PDs had incorporated foods already found in their community that provided important nutrients: [[protein]], [[iron]], and [[calcium]]. A nutrition program based on these insights was created. Instead of simply telling participants what to do differently, they designed the program to help them act their way into a new way of thinking. To attend a feeding session, parents were required to bring one of the newly identified foods. They brought their children and while sharing nutritious meals, learned to cook the new foods.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At the end of the two year pilot, malnutrition fell by 85%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Results were sustained, and transferred to the younger siblings of participants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

This approach to programming was different in important ways. Based on a community's own assets, the positive deviance approach operates within the specific cultural context of a given community (village, business, schools, ministry, department, hospital) and is therefore always appropriate. It provides to community members the "social proof" that an uncommon behavior can be adopted by all because it is already practiced by a few within the community. The solutions come from the community, therefore avoid the "immune response" that can occur when outside experts enter a community with best practices that are often unsuccessful in promoting sustained change. (Sternin)

Since it was first applied in [[Vietnam]], PD has been used to inform nutrition programs in over 40 countries by [[USAID]], [[World Vision]], [[Mercy Corps]], [[Save the Children]], [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]], [[Plan International]], Indonesian Ministry of Health, [[Peace Corps]], [[Food for the Hungry]], among others.

==Steps==
A positive deviance approach may follow a series of steps.&lt;ref name="Pascale, Sternin 2010"/&gt;

===An invitation to change===
A PD inquiry begins with an invitation from a community that wishes to address an important problem they face. This is an important first step of community ownership of a process that they will lead.

===Defining the problem===
This process occurs with the community at the center of defining the problem for themselves. This will often lead to a problem definition that differs from the outside "expert" opinion of the situation. 
A quantitative baseline is established by the community. This baseline provides an opportunity for the community to reflect on the problem given the evidence at hand, and also measure the progress toward their goals.
This is also the beginning of the process to identify stakeholder and decision-makers regarding the issue at hand. Additional stakeholders and decision-makers will be pulled in throughout the process as they are identified.

===Determining the presence of PD individuals or groups===
Through the use of data and observation, the community establishes that there are Positive Deviants in their midst.

===Discovering uncommon practices or behaviors===
This is the Positive Deviance Inquiry. The community, having identified positive deviants, sets out to find the behaviors, attitudes, or beliefs that allow the PD to be successful. The focus is on the successful strategies of the PD, not on making a hero of the person using the strategy. This self-discovery of people/groups just like them who have found successful solutions provide "social proof" that this problem can be overcome now, without outside resources.

===Program design===
Now that the community has identified successful strategies, they decide what strategies they would like to adopt, and design activities to help others access and practice these uncommon and other beneficial. Program design is not focused on spreading "best practices" but helping community members "act their way into a new way of thinking" through hands-on activities.

===Monitoring and evaluation===
PD-informed projects are monitored their programs and evaluated through a participatory process. As the monitoring will be decided on and performed by the community, the tools they create will be appropriate to the setting. This can allow even illiterate community members to participate through pictorial monitoring forms or other appropriate tools.
Evaluation allows the community to see the progress they are making towards their goals and reinforces the changes they are making in behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs.

===Scaling up===
The scaling up of a PD project may happen through many mechanisms: the "ripple effect" of other communities observing the success and engaging in a PD project of their own, through the coordination of NGOs, or organizational development consultants. However the project is scaled up, the process of community discovery of PDs in their midst remains vital to the acceptance of new behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge.

==Applications==

=== Preventing hospital-acquired infections ===
The PD approach has been applied in hospitals in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and England to stop the spread of hospital acquired infections such as [[c-diff]] and [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA). The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)  evaluated pilot programs in the U.S. and found units using the approach decreased their infections by 30-73%.&lt;ref&gt;Awad S., Palacio C., Subramanian A., et al. Implementation of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) prevention bundle results in decreased MRSA surgical site infections. The American Journal of Surgery. 2009; 198: 607-610.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it has been used in health care setting increase the incidence of hand washing, and improving care for patients immediately after a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;Bradly E, Curry L, Ramanadhan R, et al.  Research in action: using positive deviance to improve quality of health care. Implementation Science. May 2009: 4:25.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primary care (Bright Spotting) ===
Termed "Bright Spotting",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thedo.osteopathic.org/2015/04/public-health-project-taps-into-superstar-patients-expertise/|title = Public health project taps into superstar patients' expertise - The DO|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of positive deviance, the primary care pilot initiative first took place in rural [[New Hampshire]] and is still ongoing.  The outpatient clinic identified a complex patient population, from the clinics perspective, studied the risk factors of that population, then identified measures that would signify that a patient has become healthy and sustained health.  Once these measures were identified, using both data and the practices knowledge of patient's, "Bright Spots" were identified as those that meet both criteria of high risk and achieved health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Finding patient experts: How to conduct positive deviance research|url = http://thedo.osteopathic.org/2015/04/finding-patient-experts-how-to-conduct-positive-deviance-research/|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding positive deviant patients through predictive analytics has also be suggested as a possible tool in discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Big Data With a Personal Touch: The Convergence of Predictive Analytics and Positive Deviance|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cole-zanetti-do/big-data-with-a-personal-_b_5206219.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once these patients were identified the care team performed qualitative research to discover their patterns of behavior.  The results were then shown to the bright spots and their families who then designed a peer learning experience with the results in mind.  The community meetings were then facilitated using both positive deviance facilitation techniques as well as applying the [http://www.cehd.umn.edu/fsos/projects/cpc/pdf/citizenhealth2006.pdf "Citizen Health Care Model"] which is very similar to positive deviance approaches.

=== Public health ===
A PD project helped prisoners in a [[New South Wales]] prison stop smoking.

PD projects to prevent the spread of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] took place in 2002 with motorbike taxi drivers in [[Vietnam]]&lt;ref&gt;Huogn, N, Sternin, S.

Center for Media &amp; Health, Gouda, the Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child protection ===
A five-year PD project starting in 2003 to prevent girl trafficking in [[Indonesia]] with [[Save the Children]] and a local Indonesian NGO, helped them find viable economic options to stay in their communities.&lt;ref name="Singhal, Arvind 2010"/&gt;

A PD project to stop [[Female Genital Mutilation]]/Cutting in [[Egypt]] began in 1998 with CEDPA (Center for Development and Population Activities), COST (Coptic Organization for Services and Training), [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]] in Minya, Community Development Agency (CDA), Monshaat Nasser in Beni Suef governorate, and the Center for Women's Legal Assistance (CEWLA). Efforts have already shown a reduction in the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Masterson J, Swanson J. Female Genital Cutting: Breaking the Silence, Enabling Change. International Center for Research on Women (ICWR) and the Center for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA). Washington, DC. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Uganda]], a project with the Oak Foundation and [[Save the Children]] helped girls who were child soldiers with the [[Lords Resistance Army]] in [[Sudan]] reintegrate into their communities.&lt;ref name="Singhal, Arvind 2010"/&gt;

=== In education ===
PD projects in [[New Jersey]], [[California]], [[Argentina]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Burkina Faso]] have addressed drop out rates and keeping girls in school.

=== Private sector ===
Proponents of PD within management science argue that in any population, even in such seemingly mundane groups as service personnel in a [[fast food]] environment, the positive deviants have attitudes, cognitive processes and behavioral patterns that lead to significantly improved performance in key metrics such as speed-of-service and profitability. Studies claim that widespread adoption of the positive deviant approaches consistently leads to significant performance improvement.

PD had been significantly extended to the private sector, by William Seidman and Michael McCauley. Their extensions include methodologies and technologies for:
* Quickly identifying the positive deviants&lt;ref&gt;Harvesting the Experts '"Secret Sauce" To Close the Performance Gap., Seidman, William &amp; McCauley, Michael. Performance Improvement Journal, Jan 2003 v42 n1 p32-39.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Efficiently gathering and organizing the positive deviant knowledge
* Motivating a willingness in others to adopt the positive deviant approaches&lt;ref&gt;8 Minutes to Performance Improvement. Seidman, William &amp; McCauley, Michael. Performance Improvement. July 2003, v42, n6, pp.23-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sustaining the change by others by integrating it into their pre-existing emotional and cognitive functions&lt;ref&gt;The Performance Improvement Multiplier, Seidman, William &amp; McCauley, Michael. Performance Improvement. October 2003, v42, n9, pp.33-37.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scaling the positive deviant knowledge to large numbers of people simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;Performance Improvement in a Far-flung Enterprise. Seidman, William &amp; McCauley, Michael, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive deviance was further extended to groups or organizations by [[Gary Hamel]].&lt;ref&gt;The Future of Management, Hamel, Gary. Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamel looks to Positive Deviant companies to set the example for "management innovation."

In [[medicine]], '''precocious puberty''' is [[puberty]] occurring at an unusually early age. In most cases, the process is normal in every aspect except the unusually early age, and simply represents a [[human variability|variation]] of [[Human development (biology)|normal development]]. In a minority of children, the early development is triggered by a disease such as a [[tumor]] or [[brain injury|injury]] of the [[Human brain|brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/medical/sexual/precocious.html#|title=Precocious Puberty|publisher=KidsHealth|accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when there is no disease, unusually early puberty can have adverse effects on social behavior and psychological development, can reduce adult [[human height|height]] potential, and may shift some lifelong health risks. Central precocious puberty can be treated by suppressing the [[pituitary]] [[hormone]]s that induce [[sex steroid]] production. The opposite condition is [[delayed puberty]].

The term is used with several slightly different meanings that are usually apparent from the context. In its broadest sense, and often simplified as '''early puberty''', "precocious puberty" sometimes refers to any physical [[sex steroid|sex hormone]] effect, due to any cause, occurring earlier than the usual age, especially when it is being considered as a medical problem. Stricter definitions of "precocity" may refer only to central puberty starting before a statistically specified age based on percentile in the population (e.g., 2.5 standard deviations below the population mean),&lt;ref name="MeshName |precocious+puberty"&gt;{{MeshName|precocious+puberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; on expert recommendations of ages at which there is more than a negligible chance of discovering an abnormal cause, or based on opinion as to the age at which early puberty may have adverse effects. A common definition for medical purposes is onset before 8 years in girls or 9 years in boys.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/000956207|precocious puberty}}{{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
''Pubertas praecox'' is the [[Latin]] term used by physicians in the 19th century. Early [[pubic hair]], [[breast]], or [[genital]] development may result from natural early maturation or from several other conditions.

=== Central ===
If the cause can be traced to the [[hypothalamus]] or [[pituitary]], the cause is considered central. Other names for this type are ''complete'' or ''true precocious'' puberty.&lt;ref&gt;David Gardner, Dolores Shoback. Basic And Clinical Endocrinology. McGraw-Hill Medical; 2011. 9th Edition. Pg. 550&lt;/ref&gt;

Causes of central precocious puberty can include:
* damage to the inhibitory system of the brain (due to [[infection]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], or [[irradiation]]),
* [[Tuber cinereum hamartoma|hypothalamic hamartoma]] produces pulsatile [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH),
* [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]], or
* [[McCune–Albright syndrome]].

Central precocious puberty can be caused by intracranial neoplasm, infection (most commonly central nervous system tuberculosis especially in developing countries), trauma, hydrocephalus, and [[Angelman syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dickerman | first1 = R.

Precocious puberty can make a child fertile when very young, with the youngest mother on record being [[Lina Medina]], who gave birth at the age of 5 years, 7 months and 17 days, in one report&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Six decades later, world’s youngest mother awaits aid|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1020827/asp/foreign/story_1140311.asp|work=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]|date=August 27, 2002|accessdate=April 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iJ65vfQ8?url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1020827/asp/foreign/story_1140311.asp|archivedate=July 16, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at 6 years 5 months in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893791,00.html | publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' | title=Little Mother | date=December 16, 1957 | accessdate=January 9, 2008 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iJ7D1EHq?url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893791,00.html | archivedate=July 16, 2009 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Central precocious puberty (CPP) was reported in some patients with suprasellar [[arachnoid cysts]] (SAC), and SCFE ([[slipped capital femoral epiphysis]]) occurs in patients with CPP because of rapid growth and changes of growth hormone secretion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamato|first=Fumiko|author2=Takaya, Junji |author3=Higashino, Hirohiko |author4=Yamanouchi, Yasuo |author5=Suehara, Hiroshi |author6= Kobayashi, Yohnosuke |title=Slipped capital femoral epiphysis during the treatment of precocious puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone-agonist: aetiological considerations|journal=European Journal of Pediatrics|date=March 2005|volume=164|issue=3|pages=173–174|doi=10.1007/s00431-004-1578-7|pmid=15592875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If no cause can be identified, it is considered [[idiopathic]] or constitutional.

=== Peripheral ===
Secondary sexual development induced by [[sex steroid]]s from other abnormal sources is referred to as ''peripheral precocious puberty'' or ''precocious pseudopuberty.'' It typically presents as a severe form of disease with children. Symptoms are usually as a sequelae from adrenal insufficiency (because of [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency|21-hydroxylase deficiency]] or [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency|11-beta hydroxylase deficiency]], the former being more common), which includes but is not limited to hypertension, hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, ambiguous genitalia in females, signs of virilization in females. Blood tests will typically reveal high level of [[androgen]]s with low levels of cortisol.

Causes can include:
* Endogenous sources
** [[gonad]]al tumors (such as [[arrhenoblastoma]]),
** [[adrenal]] tumors,
** [[germ cell tumor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Masse | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = P.

** [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]],
** [[McCune–Albright syndrome]],
* Exogenous hormones
** [[Environmental exogenous hormones]],
** As treatment for another condition.

=== Isosexual and heterosexual ===
Generally, patients with precocious puberty develop [[phenotype|phenotypically]] appropriate [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s. This is called ''isosexual'' precocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarzabek-Bielecka|first1=G|last2=Warchoł-Biedermann|first2=K|last3=Sowińska|first3=E|last4=Wachowiak-Ochmańska|first4=K|title=[Precocious puberty].|journal=Ginekologia polska|date=April 2011|volume=82|issue=4|pages=281–6|pmid=21735696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a patient may develop in the opposite direction. For example, a male may [[gynecomastia|develop breasts]] and other feminine characteristics, while a female may develop a deepened voice and facial hair. This is called ''heterosexual'' or ''contrasexual'' precocity. It is very rare in comparison to isosexual precocity and is usually the result of unusual circumstances. As an example, children with a very rare genetic condition called [[aromatase excess syndrome]] in which exceptionally high circulating levels of estrogen are present usually develop precocious puberty. Males and females are hyperfeminized by the syndrome.

=== Research ===
Many causes of early puberty are somewhat unclear, though girls who have a high-fat diet and are not physically active or are [[Obesity|obese]] are more likely to physically mature earlier.&lt;ref name="Tanner"&gt;(Tanner, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kaplowitz | first1 = P.

High levels of beta-hCG in serum and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] observed in a 9-year-old boy suggest a pineal gland tumor. The tumor is called a ''chorionic [[gonadotropin]] secreting [[pineal]] tumor''. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy reduced tumor and beta-hCG levels normalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kuo | first1 = H. C. | last2 = Sheen | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Wu | first3 = K.

In a study using neonatal melatonin on rats, results suggest that elevated melatonin could be responsible for some cases of early puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Esouifino | first1 = A.

The gene MKRN3, which is a maternally imprinted gene, was first cloned by Jong et al in 1999.  MKRN3 was originally named Zinc finger protein 127.  It is located on human chromosome 15 on the long arm in the Prader-Willi syndrome critical region2, and has since been identified as a cause of premature sexual development or CPP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abreu AP, Dauber A, Macedo DB, Noel SD, Brito VN, Gill JC, Cukier P, Thompson IR, Navarro VM, Gagliardi PC, etal | year = 2013 | title = Central precocious puberty caused by mutations in the imprinted gene MKRN3 | doi = 10.1056/nejmoa1302160| journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 368 | issue = | pages = 2467–2475 | pmc = 3808195 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of mutations in MKRN3 leading to sporadic cases of CPP has been a significant contribution to better understanding the mechanism of puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Macedo DB, Abreu AP, Reis AC, Montenegro LR, Dauber A, Beneduzzi D, Cukier P, Silveira LF, Teles MG, Carroll RS, etal | year = 2014 | title = Central precocious puberty that appears to be sporadic caused by paternally inherited mutations in the imprinted gene makorin ring finger 3 | url = | journal = J Clin Endocrinol Metab | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = E1097–1103 | doi=10.1210/jc.2013-3126| pmc = 4037732}}&lt;/ref&gt; MKRN3 appears to act as a "brake" on the central hypothalamic-pituitary access.  Thus, loss of function mutations of the protein allow early activation of the GnRH pathway and cause phenotypic CPP. Patients with a MKRN3 mutation all display the classic signs of CCP including early breast and testes development, increased bone aging and elevated hormone levels of GnRH and LH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abreu AP, Macedo DB, Brito VN, etal | year = 2015 | title = A new pathway in the control of the initiation of puberty: the MKRN3 gene | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Endocrinology | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = R131–R139 | doi=10.1530/jme-14-0315| pmc = 4573396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

Studies indicate that breast development in girls and the appearance of pubic hair in girls and boys are starting earlier than in previous generations.&lt;ref name=ncbi/&gt;&lt;ref name="adc.bmj.com"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zukauskaite | first1 = S. | last2 = Lasiene | first2 = D. | last3 = Lasas | first3 = L. | last4 = Urbonaite | first4 = B. | last5 = Hindmarsh | first5 = P. | title = Onset of breast and pubic hair development in 1231 preadolescent Lithuanian schoolgirls | doi = 10.1136/adc.2004.057612 | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 90 | issue = 9 | pages = 932–936 | year = 2005 | pmid =  15855182| pmc =1720558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michelle |last=Roberts |title=Why puberty now begins at seven|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-05-15|accessdate=2010-05-22|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4530743.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, "early puberty" in children, particularly girls, as young as 9 and 10 is no longer considered abnormal, although it may be upsetting to parents&lt;ref name=www.msnbc.msn.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="www.suntimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Ritter|title=Parents worried by girls' earlier start of puberty|publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''|date=2000-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be harmful to children who mature physically at a time when they are immature mentally.&lt;ref name="www.center4research.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.center4research.org/early-puberty-girls/|title=Early Puberty in Girls|author=Diana Zuckerman |publisher=Cornell University Program on Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors |year=2001 |work=The Ribbon |accessdate=18 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No age reliably separates normal from abnormal processes in children, but the following age thresholds for evaluation are thought to minimize the risk of missing a significant medical problem:
*Breast development in boys before appearance of pubic hair or [[testicle|testicular]] enlargement,
*[[Pubic hair]] or genital enlargement ([[gonadarche]]) in boys with onset before 9.5 years,
*Pubic hair ([[pubarche]]) before 8 or breast development ([[thelarche]]) in girls with onset before 7 years,
*[[Menstruation]] ([[menarche]]) in girls before 10 years.

Medical evaluation is sometimes necessary to recognize the few children with serious conditions from the majority who have entered puberty early but are still medically normal. Early sexual development warrants evaluation because it may:
*induce early [[bone maturation]] and reduce eventual adult height,
*indicate the presence of a tumour or other serious problem,
*cause the child, particularly a girl, to become an object of adult sexual interest.&lt;ref name=newscientist.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stattin &amp; Magnussion"&gt;(Stattin &amp; Magnussion, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mendle"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mendle J, Leve L, Van Ryzin M, Natsuaki M | title = Linking Childhood Maltreatment With Girls' Internalizing Symptoms: Early Puberty as a Tipping Point | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 626–30 |date=August 2013 |doi=10.1111/jora.12075| url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jora.12075/abstract |pmc=4236856 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==

Early puberty is believed to put girls at [[Child sexual abuse|higher risk of sexual abuse]],&lt;ref name=newscientist.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mendle"/&gt; unrelated to [[pedophilia]] because the child has developed [[secondary sex characteristic]]s; however, a causal relationship is, as yet, inconclusive.&lt;ref name="Mendle"/&gt; Early puberty also puts girls at a higher risk for teasing or bullying, mental health disorders and short stature as adults.&lt;ref name=newscientist.com/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stattin &amp; Magnussion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caspi"&gt;(Caspi et al.1993: Lanza and Collins, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Helping children control their weight is suggested to help delay puberty. Early puberty additionally puts girls at a "far greater" risk for [[breast cancer]] later in life{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. Girls as young as 8 are increasingly starting to [[Menstruation|menstruate]], develop breasts and grow pubic and underarm hair; these "biological milestones" typically occurred only at 13 or older in the past.  African-American girls are especially prone to early puberty.&lt;ref name=ncbi/&gt; There are theories debating the trend of early puberty, but the exact causes are not known.

Though boys face fewer problems upon early puberty than girls, early puberty is not always positive for boys; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them.&lt;ref name="Garn"&gt;Garn, SM. Physical growth and development. In: Friedman SB, Fisher M, Schonberg SK, editors. Comprehensive Adolescent Health Care. St Louis: Quality Medical Publishing; 1992.

== Treatment ==
One possible treatment is with [[anastrozole]]. [[Histrelin]], [[triptorelin]], or [[leuprorelin]], any GnRH agonists, may be used. Non-continuous usage of GnRH agonists stimulates the pituitary gland to release [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH).&lt;ref name=nejm_PP&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Florence Comite]]|first=|author2=Cutler, Gordon B. |author3=Rivier, Jean |author4=Vale, Wylie W. |author5=Loriaux, D.

Prolonged use has a risk of causing osteoporosis. After stopping GnRH agonists, pubertal changes resume within 3 to 12 months.

'''Prevention through design''' (PtD), also called '''safety by design''' usually in Europe, is the concept of applying methods to minimize [[occupational safety and health|occupational hazards]] early in the design process, with an emphasis on optimizing employee health and safety throughout the [[Product lifecycle|life cycle]] of materials and processes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-147/|title=General Safe Practices for Working with Engineered Nanomaterials in Research Laboratories|last=|first=|date=May 2012|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a concept and movement that encourages [[Construction management|construction]] or [[product design]]ers to "design out" health and safety risks during design development. The concept supports the view that along with quality, programme and cost; safety is determined during the design stage.&lt;ref&gt;Behm M, 2005, Linking Construction Fatalities to the Design for Construction Safety Concept, Safety Science, Number 43, Pages 589-611&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Churcher D W, Alwani-Starr G M,Incorporating construction health and safety into the design process”, Implementation of Health and Safety in Construction Sites, Alvels, Dias &amp; Coble (eds), {{ISBN|90-5410-847-9}}, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ECI 2000 Designing for Safety and Health, Proceedings of the ECI/CIB/HSE international Conference, London, European Construction Institute, Loughborough, ed A G F Gibb, June 245pp ECI, Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gambatese JA,  Hinze J and Haas C, Tool to Design for Construction Worker Safety, Journal of Architectural Engineering, Volume 3, Part 1, Pages 32-42, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gambatese JA, 2003, Safety in design: A Proactive Approach to Construction Worker Safety and Health, Applied Occupational and Environmental Hygiene, Vol 18 (5): pp 339-342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gambatese JA, Hinze J, Addressing Construction Worker Safety in the Design Phase&amp;nbsp;– Designing for worker Safety, Automation in Construction, Volume 8, Issue 6, Pages 643-649, August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hecker S, Gambatese J, Weinstein M, Designing for Worker Safety- Moving the Construction Safety Process Upstream, Professional Safety, Pages 32-44, September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;   It increases the cost-effectiveness of enhancements to occupational safety and health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This method for reducing workplace safety risks lessens workers' reliance on [[personal protective equipment]], which is the least effective of the [[hierarchy of hazard control]].&lt;ref name="niosh"&gt;National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

== Background ==
Each year in the U.S., 55,000 people die from work-related injuries and diseases, 294,000 are made sick, and 3.8 million are injured. The annual direct and indirect costs have been estimated to range from $128 billion to $155 billion. Recent studies in [[Australia]] indicate that design is a significant contributor in 37% of work-related fatalities; therefore, the successful implementation of prevention through design concepts can have substantial impacts on worker health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;Heidel, Donna S., Paul Schulte. [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/blog/nsb060208_ptd.html Making the Business Case for Prevention through Design]. NIOSH Science Blog, 6/2/08. Accessed 9/23/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) in the United States is a major contributor and promoter of PtD policy and guidelines. NIOSH considers PtD to be "the most effective and reliable type" of prevention of [[Occupational injury|occupational injuries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/wp-solutions/2015-198/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - Supporting Prevention through Design (PtD) Using Business Value Concepts (2015-198)|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A core tenet of PtD philosophy the concept of addressing workplace hazards using methods at the top of the [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|Hierarch of Controls]], namely elimination and substitution.

Within Europe, construction designers are legally bound to design out risks during design development to reduce [[Construction site safety#Hazards to construction workers|hazards]] in the construction and end use phases via the Mobile Worksite Directive (also known as CDM regulations in the UK). The concept supports this legal requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/construction/cdm/2015/index.htm|title=Construction Design and Management Regulations 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hse.gov.uk|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[Notified Body|Notified Bodies]] provide testing and design verification services to ensure [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] with the safety standards defined in [[regulation codes]] such as the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tuv.com/en/corporate/business_customers/plants_machinery_1/pressure_equipment_2/asme_1/asme.html|title=Pressure Vessel Inspection According to ASME|last=|first=|date=|website=TÜV Rheinland|language=de|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[non-governmental organization]]s have been established to support this aim, principally in the UK, Australia and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saferdesign.org/Pages/default.aspx|title=Expired Registration Recovery Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saferdesign.org|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415184534/http://www.saferdesign.org/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2013-04-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/swa/HealthSafety/SafeDesign/|title=Safe Work Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=Safe Work Australia|language=en-AU|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214053507/http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/swa/HealthSafety/SafeDesign/|archive-date=2009-12-14|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://secure.sph.harvard.edu/ccpe/programs.cfm?CSID=SDC0210&amp;pg=cluster&amp;CLID=1|title=Executive and Continuing Professional Education|last=|first=|date=|website=Harvard University School of Public Health|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816172545/https://secure.sph.harvard.edu/ccpe/programs.cfm?CSID%3DSDC0210%26pg%3Dcluster%26CLID%3D1|archive-date=2010-08-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While engineering as a rule factors human safety into the design process, a modern appraisal of specific links to design and workers' safety can be seen in efforts beginning in the 1800s.  Trends included the widespread implementation of guards for machinery, controls for [[elevator]]s, and [[boiler]] safety practices. This was followed by enhanced design for [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], enclosures, system monitors, [[Lockout-Tagout|lockout/tagout]] controls, and hearing protectors. More recently, there has been the development of chemical [[process safety]], [[ergonomics|ergonomically]] engineered tools, chairs, and work stations, lifting devices, retractable needles, latex-free gloves, and a parade of other safety devices and processes.&lt;ref name=schulte&gt;Schulte, Paul A., Richard Rinehart, Andrea Okun, Charles L. Geraci, Donna S. Heidel. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V6F-4S3G8HX-2/2/b4749f31e38e327949d99b974a9705f8 ''National Prevention through Design (PtD) Initiative''], ''Journal of Safety Research'', Volume 39, Issue 2. Prevention through Design, 2008, Pages 115-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety]] began its National Initiative on Prevention through Design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-123/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - The State of the National Initiative on Prevention through Design (2014-123)|author=|date=|website=www.CDC.gov|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of promoting prevention through design philosophy, practice, and policy.

==Integration==
Prevention through design represents a shift in approach for on-the-job safety. It involves evaluating potential risks associated with processes, structures, equipment, and tools. It takes into consideration the construction, maintenance, decommissioning, and disposal or recycling of waste material.&lt;ref name=schulte /&gt;
 
The idea of redesigning job tasks and work environments has begun to gain momentum in business and government as a cost-effective means to enhance occupational safety and health. Many U.S. companies openly support PtD concepts and have developed management practices to implement them. Other countries are actively promoting PtD concepts as well. The [[United Kingdom]] began requiring construction companies, project owners, and architects to address safety and health during the design phase of projects in 1994. Australia developed the Australian National OHS Strategy 2002–2012, which set "eliminating hazards at the design stage" as one of five national priorities. As a result, the Australian Safety and Compensation Council (ASCC) developed the Safe Design National Strategy and Action Plans for Australia encompassing a wide range of design areas.&lt;ref name=niosh /&gt;

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] is a large contributor to prevention through design efforts in the United States. Several NIOSH initiatives and guidelines directly or indirectly advocate for PtD practices. Through NIOSH efforts, the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] posted new PtD credits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ptd/greenjobs.html|title=CDC - Prevention Through Design: Green , Safe, and Healthy Jobs - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|author=|date=|website=www.CDC.gov|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; available for [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification]] for construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5897">'''Pseudonymization''' is a [[data management]] and [[de-identification]] procedure by which [[personally identifiable information]] fields within a [[data]] record are replaced by one or more artificial identifiers, or [[pseudonym]]s. A single pseudonym for each replaced field or collection of replaced fields makes the data record less identifiable while remaining suitable for [[data analysis]] and [[data processing]]. 

Pseudonymization can be one way to comply with the [[European Union]]'s new [[General Data Protection Regulation]] demands for secure data storage of personal information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dativa.com/data-science-gdpr-pseudonymization-data-pipeline/ Data science under GDPR with pseudonymization in the data pipeline] Published by Dativa, 17 April, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudonymized data can be restored to its original state with the addition of information which then allows individuals to be re-identified, while anonymized data can never be restored to its original state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protegrity.com/pseudonymization-vs-anonymization-help-gdpr/ Pseudonymization vs. Anonymization and How They Help With GDPR] Published January, 2017 Retrieved April 20, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data fields==
The choice of which data fields are to be pseudonymized is partly subjective. Less selective fields, such as Birth Date or Postal Code are often also included because they are usually available from other sources and therefore make a record easier to identify. Pseudonymizing these less identifying fields removes most of their analytic value and is therefore normally accompanied by the introduction of new derived and less identifying forms, such as year of birth or a larger [[postal code]] region.

Data fields that are less identifying, such as date of attendance, are usually not pseudonymized. It is important to realize that this is because too much statistical utility is lost in doing so, not because the data cannot be identified. For example, given prior knowledge of a few attendance dates it is easy to identify someone's data in a pseudonymized dataset by selecting only those people with that pattern of dates. This is an example of an [[inference attack]].

The weakness of pseudonymized data to inference attacks is commonly overlooked. A famous example is the [[AOL search data scandal]].

Protecting statistically useful pseudonymized data from re-identification requires:
#  a sound [[information security]] base 
#  controlling the risk that the analysts, researchers or other data workers cause a privacy breach

The pseudonym allows tracking back of data to its origins, which distinguishes pseudonymization from [[anonymization]],&lt;ref&gt;http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.31.pdf Anonymity, Unlinkability, Undetectability, Unobservability, Pseudonymity, and Identity Management – A Consolidated Proposal for Terminology&lt;/ref&gt; where all person-related data that could allow backtracking has been purged. Pseudonymization is an issue in, for example, patient-related data that has to be passed on securely between clinical centers.

The application of pseudonymization to e-health intends to preserve the patient's privacy and data confidentiality. It allows primary use of medical records by authorized health care providers and privacy preserving secondary use by researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer T, Heurix J. A methodology for the pseudonymization of medical data. Int J Med Inform. 2011 Mar;80(3) 190-204. doi:10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2010.10.016. {{PMID|21075676}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, plain pseudonymization for privacy preservation often reaches its limits when [[genetic data]] are involved (see also [[genetic privacy]]). Due to the identifying nature of genetic data, depersonalization is often not sufficient to hide the corresponding person. Potential solutions are the combination of pseudonymization with fragmentation and [[encryption]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xylem-technologies.com/2011/09/07/privacy-preserving-storage-and-access-of-medical-data-through-pseudonymization-and-encryption Privacy-Preserving Storage and Access of Medical Data through Pseudonymization and Encryption&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of application of pseudonymization procedure is creation of datasets for [[de-identification]] research by replacing [[Personally identifiable information|identifying]] words with words from the same category (e.g. replacing a name with a random name from the names dictionary),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neamatullah | first1 = Ishna | last2 = Douglass | first2 = Margaret M | last3 = Li-wei | last4 = Lehman | first4 = H | last5 = Reisner | first5 = Andrew | last6 = Villarroe | first6 = Mauricio | last7 = Long | first7 = William J | last8 = Szolovits | first8 = Peter | last9 = Moody | first9 = George B | last10 = Mark | first10 = Roger G | last11 = Clifford | first11 = Gari D | year = 2008 | title = Automated de-identification of free-text medical records | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/8/32 | journal = BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making | volume = 8 | issue ishna neamatullah, automated de-identification of free-text medical records, http://www.physionet.= | page = 32 | doi=10.1186/1472-6947-8-32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;org/physiotools/deid/doc/ishna-meng-thesis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deleger | first1 = L | display-authors = etal   | year = 2014 | title = Preparing an annotated gold standard corpus to share with extramural investigators for de-identification research | url = | journal = J Biomed Inform | volume = 50| issue = | pages = 173–183| doi = 10.1016/j.jbi.2014.01.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in this case it is in general not possible to track data back to its origins.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34160">In the United States, [[prison]]s are obligated to provide [[health care]] to [[prisoner]]s. Such health care is sometimes called ''[[correctional medicine]]''. In women's prisons, correctional medicine includes attention to [[reproductive health]].

The number of [[Incarceration of women in the United States|women incarcerated in the United States]] has increased greatly over the last few decades,{{specify|date=June 2016}} and at a faster rate than the number of incarcerated men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Many of the same factors that increase women's likelihood of incarceration also put them at a higher risk for contracting [[HIV/AIDS]] and other [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, and for having [[High-risk pregnancy|high-risk pregnancies]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braithewaite|first=Ronald L.|last2=Treadwell|first2=Henrie M.|last3=Arriola|first3=Kimberly R J|date=2005|title=Health disparities and incarcerated women: a population ignored|pmc=1449417|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=95|issue=10|pages=1679–1681|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2005.065375|pmid=16186446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The majority of incarcerated women are economically disadvantaged and poorly educated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeve|first=M Katherine|date=1999|title=Adjudicated Health: Incarcerated Women and the Social Constructions of Health|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1008376229520|journal=Crime, Law and Social Change|volume=31|pages=49|doi=10.1023/A:1008376229520|pmid=|access-date=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have not had adequate access to [[preventive healthcare]] prior to their imprisonment,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; such as [[Pap test]]s, [[STI test|STI screening]], and pregnancy counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Jennifer G.|last2=Hebert|first2=Megan R.|last3=Rosengard|first3=Cynthia|last4=Rose|first4=Jennifer S.|last5=DaSilva|first5=Kristen M.|last6=Stein|first6=Michael D.|date=2006|title=Reproductive Health Care and Family Flanning Feeds Among Incarcerated Women|pmc=1470599|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=96|issue=5|pages=834–839|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.060236|pmid=16571701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal standards for health care availability ==
=== Historical precedence ===

==== Estelle v. Gamble (1976) ====
[[Estelle v. Gamble]] obligates prisons to provide for the serious medical needs of their inmates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YdHAAAAMAAJ|title=The Incarcerated Woman: Rehabilitative Programming in Women's Prisons|last=Anderson|first=Tammy L.|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780130940674|editor-last=Sharp|editor-first=Susan F.|pages=49–60|language=en|chapter=Issues in the availability of health care for women prisoners|editor-last2=Muraskin|editor-first2=Roslyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it also requires that an incarcerated person must demonstrate that they had a serious medical need, and that they didn't receive adequate medical care because officials showed "deliberate indifference."  Due to the difficulty inherent in proving that a prison official knew about a medical condition, yet failed to respond to it, this standard makes it difficult to hold correctional facilities accountable for their mistakes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ekaWZJHfqMC|title=Our Bodies, Our Crimes: The Policing of Women’s Reproduction in America|last=Flavin|first=Jeanne|date=2008|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814727553|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Todaro v. Ward (1977) ====
Todaro v. Ward argued that women within a New York prison did not have adequate, constitutional access to healthcare.  Since Todaro v. Ward was the first major court case that called into question incarcerated women's actual access to health care, it spurred organizations such as the American Medical Association, American Correctional Association, and the American Public Health Association to start creating standards for health care within prisons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Brown v. Beck (1980) ====
With this ruling, the court determined that the medical care provided to prisoners must only be "reasonable,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; not necessarily "perfect, the best obtainable, or even very good."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Relevant federal legislation and standards ===
Currently, no national agency monitors the treatment of prisoners, although a few governmental and non-governmental agencies do provide monitoring standards that facilities may use if they wish to become accredited (about thirty percent of prisons are accredited), and some federal legislation has been passed regarding correctional health care.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Federal Prisoner Co-Payment Act (1999) ====
This legislation required that incarcerated individuals pay for some of their health care bill while in prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Prison Litigation Reform Act (1996) ====
The [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] made it much more difficult for prisoners to file class action and individual lawsuits against a prison.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry|first=Ellen M|date=2001|title=Bad Medicine: Health Care Inadequacies in Women's Prisons|url=http://uu5bm5kq6z.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Bad+medicine%3A+Health+care+inadequacies+in+women%27s+prisons&amp;rft.jtitle=Criminal+Justice&amp;rft.au=Ellen+M+Barry&amp;rft.date=2001-04-01&amp;rft.pub=American+Bar+Association&amp;rft.issn=0887-7785&amp;rft.volume=16&amp;rft.issue=1&amp;rft.spage=38&amp;rft.externalDocID=73033132&amp;paramdict=en-US|journal=Criminal Justice|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PRLA) requires that prisoners exhaust a facility's own administrative resources and solutions before attempting to file a lawsuit.  This can be detrimental because prisoners' health problems are often time-sensitive.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roth|first=Rachel|date=2004|title=Searching for the State: Who Governs Prisoners' Reproductive Rights?|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/173809|journal=Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State and Society|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PRLA also includes a cap on attorney fees, which has made fewer attorneys willing to represent prisoners.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Although PRLA applies to all lawsuits filed by incarcerated people, it is particularly relevant for women's health because most lawsuits filed by incarcerated women concern substandard health care.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Correctional reproductive health care ==

=== Pregnancy and prenatal care ===
As of 2005, about five to ten percent of incarcerated women were pregnant (most upon intake), and about 2,000 incarcerated women give birth every year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Incarcerated women already tend to have more high-risk pregnancies, due to possible complications by drug and alcohol abuse and STIs, histories of victimization and abuse, and poor support networks, so they are particularly in need of quality [[prenatal care]] as compared to non-incarcerated women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acoca|first=Leslie|date=January 1998|title=Defusing the Time Bomb: Understanding and Meeting the Growing Health Care Needs of Incarcerated Women in America|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=EAIM&amp;u=mnalmgl&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A20517103&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=mnalmgl&amp;authCount=1|journal=Crime and Delinquency|doi=|pmid=|access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found mixed results when it comes to the effects of incarceration on pregnancy outcomes. Some studies have found that incarceration correlates to lower [[birth weight]], and an increased chance of [[Complications of pregnancy|complications in the pregnancy]]; others have found the opposite: that incarceration is associated with higher birth weight and a decreased likelihood of [[Preterm birth|premature delivery]]. However, the latter finding may simply speak to the low level of medical care available to women in poverty in the free world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 1996 study conducted by the [[National Council on Crime and Delinquency]] (NCCD) on women in California, Connecticut, and Florida state prisons found a lack of adequate prenatal and postnatal medical care, [[prenatal nutrition]], level of [[methadone maintenance]] for opiate-dependent pregnant inmates, education regarding childbirth and parenting, and preparation for the mother's separation from her child.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Often, inmates report receiving no regular pelvic exams or sonograms, and little to no information about proper prenatal care and nutrition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Prison diets often lack proper nutrition, particularly for the changing and special dietary needs of pregnant women, and many women prisoners report not being allowed to alter their diets during their pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Despite the lack or low quality of prenatal care in most institutions, many correctional facilities have made strides to provide adequate care.  For example, Washington State has a program called the Birth Attendants Prison Doula project, which provides support to incarcerated pregnant and [[Postpartum period|postpartum]] women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When asked about her prison's response to pregnancy, Boo, an inmate in an Arizona correctional facility, said:

{{quote|text=They're real good people to me... I get taken care of in here very well. They give us three pregnancy bags a day which contain two cartons of milk, two orange juices, and two fruits, and you get three pills three times a day during breakfast, lunch, and dinner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

In general, pregnant inmates are transported to outside medical facilities to give birth, because most correctional facilities are not medically equipped to provide such services.  These transports often result in complications due to the risk of injury to both the mother and the child, and due to the additional stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The practice of [[shackling]] inmates, both in transit to the hospital and during [[Childbirth|labor]], is also common at many facilities.  Forty-one states permit the use of restraints during transport to the hospital, and twenty-three states and the federal government permit the use of restraints during labor.  These restraints may include [[Belly chain (restraint)|belly chains]], shackles, handcuffs, or nylon "soft restraints."  The use of restraints on women so far into their pregnancy and during labor poses many health risks.  Restraints inhibit the movement of a woman, something that aids the progression of the labor and alleviates some of her discomfort.  They may also hinder the ability of health care professionals to respond quickly to emergencies during the labor.  Organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] have pressured correctional facilities to stop the use of shackles on pregnant women, pointing out the fact that most pregnant women are incarcerated for nonviolent offenses and pose no risk (especially during childbirth), so the restraints are unnecessary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Maria Jones, a pregnant inmate, described her experience being shackled during labor:

{{quote|text=Because I was shackled to the bed, they couldn't remove the lower part of the bed for the delivery, and they couldn't put my feet in the stirrups. My feet were still shackled together, and I couldn't get my legs apart. The doctor called for the [[Prison officer|officer]], but the officer had gone down the hall. No one else could unlock the shackles, and my baby was coming but I couldn't open my legs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

=== HIV/AIDS ===
Incarcerated women are 15 times more likely to be infected with [[HIV]] than are women who are free,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and are also more than twice as likely than incarcerated men to be infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weatherhead|first=Kendra|date=2003|title=Cruel but not Unusual Punishment: The Failure to Provide Adequate Medical Treatment to Female Prisoners in the United States|url=http://uu5bm5kq6z.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Cruel+but+not+Unusual+Punishment%3A+The+Failure+to+Provide+Adequate+Medical+Treatment+to+Female+Prisoners+in+the+United+States&amp;rft.jtitle=Health+Matrix%3A+Journal+of+Law-Medicine&amp;rft.au=Kendra+Weatherhead&amp;rft.date=2003-07-01&amp;rft.pub=Case+Western+Reserve+University+Health+Matrix%3A+Journal+of+Law-Medicine&amp;rft.volume=13&amp;rft.spage=429&amp;rft.epage=429&amp;rft.externalDocID=13_Health_Matrix_429_srctype_smi_srcid_3B15_key_8f97eab4a9b73e1350b316e5e67dcf23|journal=Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandler|first=Cynthia|date=2003|title=Death and Dying in America: The Prison Industrial Complex's Impact on Women's Health|url=http://uu5bm5kq6z.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Death+and+Dying+in+America%3A+The+Prison+Industrial+Complex%27s+Impact+on+Women%27s+Health&amp;rft.jtitle=Berkeley+Women%27s+Law+Journal&amp;rft.au=Cynthia+Chandler&amp;rft.date=2003-01-01&amp;rft.pub=The+Regents+of+the+University+of+California+on+behalf+of&amp;rft.volume=18&amp;rft.spage=40&amp;rft.epage=304&amp;rft.externalDocID=18_Berkeley_Women_s_L_J_40_srctype_smi_srcid_3B15_key_8549afa72665cf5fdaf04f403446adfb&amp;paramdict=en-US|journal=Berkeley Women's Law Journal|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in New York, a state which does [[blind testing]], 14.6% of incarcerated women and 7.3% of incarcerated men tested positive for HIV.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Health Behind Bars: From Prisons to Communities|last=Balis|first=Andrea F.|publisher=Springer New York|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Greifinger|editor-first=Robert B.|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=320–332|chapter=Female Prisoners and the Case for Gender-Specific Reentry Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1996 NCCD study found that female African American and Hispanic/Latina inmates were significantly more likely than their White counterparts to report testing positive for HIV.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many of the same social factors that increase the likelihood of incarceration for women, such as poverty, race, gender, and a history of victimization, are also correlated to HIV infection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2000 study by the [[American Correctional Association]] found that mandatory HIV testing is conducted upon intake in 23 states, and that a few also provide 6-month follow-up testing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Most prisons test inmates who either ask to be tested, or display symptoms of HIV (this is the policy in 44 out of 51 jurisdictions), and fifteen states also specifically test inmates that are in high-risk groups.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Three states, the District of Columbia, and the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] test inmates upon release.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The same American Correctional Association study also found that most prisons provide HIV-positive individuals with medications while they are in the prison, may provide them with a small supply after they are released, and may also direct them towards community resources where they can receive more medication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Treatment of inmates who have tested positive for HIV varies greatly from state to state.  For example, in New Jersey, female HIV positive prisoners were shackled to their beds for up to six months after being diagnosed.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  However, Ohio and New York, among other states, have infirmaries specifically adapted to attend to the needs of inmates with HIV/AIDS, and allow some inmates to reside in a hospital for treatment.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  In addition to this, New York State's Division of Health Services department does regular evaluations of the state prisons' services for AIDS patients, and also provides space for support groups to meet, and patients to be counseled on their illness.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Women's symptoms and treatment needs for HIV infection are quite different from those of men, but the treatment resources for incarcerated women are often limited.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The treatment of HIV requires a specialist, and generally, prison doctors don't have adequate training to treat women effectively.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Or, prisons often do not have adequate facilities, staff, or a follow-up treatment system.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  For example, the 1996 NCCD study also found that within the entire California women's prison system, one of the largest in the nation, there was only one full-time specialist able to provide "gender-specific treatment" to women with HIV.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Male prisoners, however, did have access to gender-specific HIV treatment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Abortion ===
Federal courts have established, according to constitutional law, that prisoners retain the right to have an abortion once they are incarcerated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  However, state standards regarding abortion for incarcerated women are unclear - actions are often left up to the discretion of prison officials on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Most state abortion policies are written and approved without going through the administrative process which other policies are generally subject to; thus, they are frequently incomplete.  In fact, fourteen state [[Department of Corrections|DOCs]] have no official written abortion policies, and others simply will not release or publish their policies.  Alaska has a provision which bans abortion funding in its policy on general medical services, but no specific policy guidelines on abortion.  Other states may not define the exact type of abortions they pay for.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Most states require that women pay for all of the costs of an abortion procedure, including transportation to the clinic (which is often far due to prisons' rural locations, and the urban locations of most abortion clinics), security, and the actual surgery. Minnesota and Wisconsin are the only two states which explicitly mention in their policies that they pay for abortions if a woman has been raped.  The policy of the Federal Bureau of Prisons since 1987 has been to pay for abortion only in the cases of rape or life endangerment (although they do pay for transportation to the clinic).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women's experiences and perceptions of their own access to abortion reflect these policies. In a nationwide survey of correctional health care and inmates' access to abortion, 68% of respondents said that women within their prison were allowed to have an abortion if they requested one.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sufrin|first=Carolyn B.|date=2009|title=Incarcerated Women and Abortion Provision: A Survey of Correctional Health Providers|jstor=20462705|journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|doi=10.1363/4100609|pmid=|volume=41|pages=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many respondents also stated that although their prison did allow access to abortion, women receive little to no help with arranging an appointment, paying for the procedure, and getting themselves to the clinic.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Other reproductive health care ===

==== Cancer and general gynecological care ====
According to the U.S. Department of Justice [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], [[cancer]] is one of the leading causes of death for women (both inside and outside prison), and one-quarter of deaths of incarcerated women due to cancer are from [[Breast cancer|breast]], [[Cervical cancer|cervical]], [[Ovarian cancer|ovarian]], and [[uterine cancer]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In particular, women in prison are at a high risk for contracting cervical cancer due to their high rates of substance abuse and diseases such as [[hepatitis C]], HIV, and other STIs.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Magee|first=Catherine G.|last2=Hult|first2=Jen R.|last3=Turalba|first3=Ruby|last4=McMillan|first4=Shelby|date=2005|title=Preventive Care for Women in Prison: A Qualitative Community Health Assessment of the Papanicolaou Test and Follow-Up Treatment at a California State Women's Prison|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/215091831?pq-origsite=summon|journal=American Journal of Public Health|doi=10.2105/ajph.2005.063677|pmid=|access-date=May 31, 2016|pmc=1449425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; However, reproductive health care reform in prisons generally focuses on pregnancy or HIV.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Incarcerated women have higher rates of STIs and gynecologic infections than non-incarcerated women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In fact, one study estimated that about 9% of incarcerated women tested positive for [[gonococcus]] infection, and between 11 and 17% of incarcerated women are infected with [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  However, not every infected woman will be diagnosed and given treatment, because many prisons only test women who request to be tested, or show symptoms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

States often have their own legislation regarding correctional health care, but it doesn't always completely take into consideration the complexities of women's reproductive health.  For example, the [[New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision]] (DOCCS) has issued two main documents which outline their institutional health care policies: the Health Services Policy Manual, and the Women's Health Primary Care Practice Guideline (first published in 2000, and updated in 2008 and 2011).  Within these documents, the Patient Bill of Rights includes the right of a patient to respectful care, the right to refuse treatment, and the right to complete information regarding a diagnosis; the Professional Code of Ethics outlines the standards that staff must follow, including having a respect for [[human dignity]], and a [[Doctor–patient relationship|professional relationship with the patient]].  The DOCCS does not monitor how well facilities actually adhere to these standards, and there are no consequences for those who do not.  Also, many women are not informed of their patient's rights, so are unaware when standards have been breached.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraft-Stolar|first=Tamar|date=2015|title=Reproductive Injustice: The State of Reproductive Health Care for Women in New York State Prisons|url=http://www.correctionalassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reproductive-Injustice-FULL-REPORT-FINAL-2-11-15.pdf|journal=Women in Prison Project of the Correctional Association of New York|doi=|pmid=|access-date=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DOCCS has no written policies on [[pregnancy test]]s, [[pregnancy options counseling]], [[abortion]], [[ectopic pregnancy]], [[miscarriage]], [[stillbirth]], nutrition for pregnant and nursing women, or [[Hysterectomy|hysterectomies]], and has incomplete policies regarding [[menopause]], vitamins, health care for pregnant women, women in labor, or women who have recently given birth.  The DOCCS policies stray from community standards in the areas of the starting age for yearly GYN check-ups, the frequency of breast exams and [[Pap smear]]s, follow-up for abnormal Pap smears, frequency of prenatal visits and [[Obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasounds]], and the time frame for postpartum check-ups for women who have a [[Caesarean section]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The Federal Bureau of Prisons' policy is to provide each inmate with a complete [[medical exam]] (which includes [[gynecological]] and [[obstetrical]] history) within 30 days of admission.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The BOP currently{{specify|date=June 2016}} adheres to the standards for yearly exams put forth by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  According to a 1997 survey, approximately 90 percent of the inmates in women's state prisons reported having received a gynecologic exam from their institution upon intake.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Additionally, an American Correctional Association study found that  most women's correctional institutions provided [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|OB/GYN]] services, [[Prenatal care|prenatal]] and postpartum care, [[mammography]], and Pap smears upon request.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Fewer provided counseling for inmates regarding their reproductive health,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; many correctional facilities do not provide follow-up exams, and screenings often do not continue on the recommended schedule.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a New York city juvenile detention facility, the 5,000 youth who went through the system annually were all served by a single physician.  Less than one-third of the inmates received a Pap smear test, and one in five were tested for [[gonorrhea]], chlamydia, and [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Women often report long delays and wait times in signing up for appointments with a GYN doctor, and in getting treated.   For example, more than half of respondents in a survey of incarcerated women in New York state prisons said that they were not able to see the GYN when necessary, and 47% of respondents stated that their problems became worse in the time that they had to wait.  In one extreme case, Sara, a woman incarcerated in New York, had to wait seven months before she was finally diagnosed with an aggressive cancer.  Another woman had to wait four months to receive a colposcopy, a follow-up to her Pap test.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Another woman at the same prison wrote:

{{quote|I’ve never seen the GYN. I dropped a tab [note to the doctor] explaining to them about being diagnosed with abnormal cells. . . and how I’d like to get a check-up, but no one answered. This was six months ago.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;}}

In a [[qualitative study]] on the experiences of incarcerated women with the [[Pap test|Papanicolaou test]] (a test which screens for cervical cancer) in California state prisons, researchers found a lack of communication between medical providers within the prison, which tended to result in long delays or cancellations of treatment, no standardized process for scheduling a Pap test, and a lack of education and explanation regarding both the test itself, and how to fill out the medical forms associated with it.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In addition to this, women who aren't called in for a Pap test are sometimes required to pay a $5 fee if they request one.  This can be a significant barrier to requesting a test, considering an average prisoner's wage is around 7 to 13 cents per hour.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In the same study, women brought attention to the discomfort suffered by inmates with personal histories of sexual abuse and victimization when they were forced to be examined by a male physician.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Women interviewed in New York State prisons had similar complaints about their physicians' seeming lack of awareness of female prisoners' past traumas, and the lack of explanation of the procedures.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One woman stated:

{{quote|text=Ninety-nine percent of the women have been abused or raped.  To have a man take us into an office the size of a closet... stripped down... [it's] rough and hurts us... it takes us right back to the beginning."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;}}

==== Perceptions of Medical Care ====
Another consideration in correctional reproductive health care is the relationship between the prisoner-patients and the physicians. Studies have shown that female inmates often report distrust of physicians and disappointment with their interactions with providers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Researchers have found that most of the women interviewed in the 2005 California state prison study had negative perceptions of their gynecologic tests and treatment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to the women interviewed, the prison doctors who performed their tests were often unprofessional and disrespectful.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  One woman described her experience, saying: "They expect us to give them respect, but they don't respect us. They treat us like we are animals just because we are incarcerated."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The [[Prisons in California|California prison system]] employs [[corrections officer]]s who are also trained to be licensed nurses (called medical technical assistants).  Similarly, in Chicago, the county jails train corrections officers as [[doula]]s and [[birth attendant]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Inmates generally must request medical treatment through either these officers, or through other, non-medically trained correctional staff, and studies have shown that female patients' complaints and requests for medical assistance are often not taken as seriously as those of male patients.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The simultaneous positions that these officers hold as both security personnel and medical caretakers or advocates may contribute to female inmates' distrust of them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A 1999 study found that female inmates were more likely than their male counterparts to think that their access to health care was inadequate and that their quality of care was low compared to the care male prisoners were given.  Women in this study also visited the health care facility more often than their male counterparts and reported being healthy less often than men did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindquist|first=Christine H|last2=Lindquist|first2=Charles A|date=2009|title=Health Behind Bars: Utilization and Evaluation of Medical Care Among Jail Inmates|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1018794305843|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=24|issue=4|pages=285|doi=10.1023/A:1018794305843|pmid=10463472|access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues in correctional reproductive health care ==

=== Lack of resources ===
A lack of resources, specifically of adequate staff, within facilities is largely what contributes to the substandard care of inmates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For example, although California's prison system is the largest in the country, an obstetrician/gynecologist was not hired at the [[California Institution for Women]] (CIW) until pregnant prisoners in California filed a class action lawsuit (Harris v. McCarthy) against CIW. The [[Valley State Prison|Valley State Prison for Women]] (VSPW), another prison in California, had just two OB/GYN doctors on staff in 2000 (one of whom was indicted on four counts of sexual misconduct and eventually fired). Albion, a women's prison in New York State, has 1,000 prisoners, but only one GYN doctor, who works only 16 hours per week.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Taconic, another facility in New York, which holds about 370 women, has no GYN doctor on site.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In these cases, routine GYN care falls to the general nurse practitioner or Medical Director.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In addition to the lack of staff, medical doctors are often not on duty on the weekends and during evening hours.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  This can be dangerous if medical emergencies arise during non-business hours.  For example, a prisoner in CIW in 1997 went into labor over the weekend, when there was only one nurse on duty.  The nurse strapped the woman into a gurney, but refused to help with her labor.  When the baby was born not breathing, the nurse had to call paramedics, because she was unable to activate the breathing apparatus.  By the time the newborn was transported to the hospital, he was declared brain dead.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The difficulty with recruiting qualified staff can be attributed to both the physical isolation of women's prisons (often placed in areas that are considered undesirable to live in, where there are few available medical professionals), and to the relative lack of medical resources and low salaries that prisons offer to medical staff.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Dr. Valda Chijide, a former HIV doctor in an Alabama prison, for instance, resigned from her position due to inadequate support.  In this case, the HIV unit was rat-infested, with broken windows covered in plastic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Privatization of prison health care ===
There is also a trend towards privatizing health care by hiring outside, for-profit health care companies to provide medical care to inmates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  According to a 1996 survey by the [[National Institute of Corrections]] (NIC), forty-four state Departments of Corrections contract out at least some of their medical care to private vendors - in 1996 this amounted to $706 million.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This can result in a lack of accountability, as proper monitoring makes a contract more expensive.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Oversight is often lacking. In Alabama, the same official who previously held a high level position at Prison Health Services, one of the nation's largest private vendors, now works in a position within the Alabama Department of Corrections which requires her to oversee Prison Health's compliance to the contract.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Prison Health Services, which has cared for 237,000 inmates, has had to pay millions of dollars in fines and settlements due to inadequate care.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In another example, according to a former supervisory nurse of a jail operated by [[Corizon|Correctional Medical Services]]  (CMS), a large private contractor, the jail would often release pregnant women when they went into labor, and then arrest them again after they gave birth, in order to avoid having to pay for the inmates' medical expenses.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Lack of accountability also results due to varying state and federal laws on private contractors' liability for medical abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Private contractors can be challenged under the same federal civil rights law that applies to state and local governments, but these corporations cannot be sued for unconstitutional medical practices.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3888">The '''Safe bottle lamp''', called '''sudeepa''' or '''sudipa''' for ''good lamp'', is a safer [[kerosene lamp]] designed by [[Wijaya Godakumbura]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101230052253/http://www.theworldchallenge.co.uk/2009-winner.php "A Bright Idea - Winner 2009 (Archived)"]&lt;/ref&gt; of Sri Lanka. The safety comes from heavier glass, a secure screw-on metal lid, and two flat sides which prevent it from rolling if knocked over.

==History==
As surgeon Dr. Godakumbura saw many burn cases caused by kerosene lamp fires.  Over 1 million homes in Sri Lanka do not have electricity, and rely on kerosene lamps for illumination, often [[improvised]] lamps made from [[bottle]]s.  These tall lamps tip easily, and when they do, the [[candle wick|wick]] holder often falls out and starts a sudden, intense fire.  Often the fuel falls on a nearby person, setting them ablaze and resulting in severe [[burn (injury)|burns]], often fatal.

In 1992, Dr. Godakumbura set out to design a new lamp that was both safer, and inexpensive enough to be affordable by the impoverished Sri Lankans at risk for these fires.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Lanka Guardian [http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2010/09/dr-wijaya-godakumbura-and-wonderful.html "Dr. Wijaya Godakumbura and the Wonderful Lamp"], September 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting lamp is a small, flattened sphere, which resists tipping and rolling. It is made of thick glass to resist breaking, and has a screw-on metal cap that holds the wick in place and prevents spilling.

In 1993, with contributions from numerous sources, including [[Science Fiction]] writer and Sri Lanka resident [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and the [[Canada|Canadian High Commission]], the lamp was put into production.

Available for a cost of less than US$0.25 each, over half a million of the new lamps have been sold, and Dr. Godakumbura hopes to continue producing the new lamps until use of improvised lamps drops to a small percentage of lamp use in Sri Lanka.

==The Foundation==
Having received a Rolex Award for Enterprise in 1998, Dr. Godakumbura established the Safe Bottle Lamp Foundation (SBLF), a non-profit organization. The Foundation is governed by a board of directors and employs two full-time staff .

In addition to the [[Rolex award|Rolex Award]], the foundation and Dr. Godakumbura have received a range of other local and international awards and grants. Among these are a Lindbergh Foundation Grant and a BBC [[The World Challenge|World Challenge]] Award. The project has been featured in many international publications such as TIME, Newsweek, Science and Nature, National Geographic and La Figaro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safelamp.org/acclaim.html |title=The Safe Bottle Lamp Foundation (Archived Copy)|accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921172511/http://safelamp.org/acclaim.html|archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Godakumbura has represented the foundation in many international conferences on burn and accident prevention as a speaker or as a participant. The foundation and the Sudeepa lamp have been promoted as a replicable solution for other developing countries where accidental burns due to unsafe lamps is prevalent.

'''Social support''' is the perception and actuality that one is cared for, has assistance available from other people, and most popularly, that one is part of a supportive [[social network]]. These supportive resources can be emotional (e.g., nurturance), tangible (e.g., financial assistance), informational (e.g., advice), or companionship (e.g., sense of belonging) and intangible (e.g., personal advice).

Social support can be measured as the perception that one has assistance available, the actual received assistance, or the degree to which a person is integrated in a social network. Support can come from many sources, such as family, friends, pets, neighbors, coworkers, organizations, etc. Government-provided social support is often referred to as '''public aid''' in foreign nations. 

Social support is studied across a wide range of disciplines including [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[sociology]], [[nursing]], [[public health]], [[education]], [[Psychiatric rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], and [[social work]]. Social support has been linked to many benefits for both physical and mental health, but "social support" (e.g., gossiping about friends) is not always beneficial.

Social support theories and models were prevalent as intensive academic studies in the 1980s and 1990s &lt;ref&gt; Vaux, A. (1988). ''Social Support: Theory, Research and Interventions''. My, NY: Praeger. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Racino, J. (2006). Social support. In: G. Albrecht, ''Encyclopedia on Disability'', 1470-1471. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE. &lt;/ref&gt;, and are linked to the development of caregiving and payment models, and community delivery systems in the US and around the world. &lt;ref&gt; O'Connor, S. (1995). More than they bargained for: The meaning of support to families. In: S. J. Taylor, R. Bogdan, &amp; Lutfiyya, Z.M. ''The Variety of Community Experience'' (pp.193-210). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Two main models have been proposed to describe the link between social support and health: the buffering hypothesis and the direct effects hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q6xkh3QdyGEC&amp;lpg=PA426&amp;dq=%22direct%20effects%20hypothesis%22%20%22main%20effects%20hypothesis%22&amp;pg=PA426#v=onepage&amp;q=%22direct%20effects%20hypothesis%22%20%22main%20effects%20hypothesis%22&amp;f=false | title=DSM-IV Sourcebook| isbn=9780890420744| last1=Association| first1=American Psychiatric| year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gender]] and [[culture|cultural]] differences in social support have also been found &lt;ref&gt;Harry, B., Kaylanpur, M. and Day, M. (1999). ''Building Cultural Reciprocity with Families: Case Studies in Special Education.'' London, Toronto: Brookes. &lt;/ref&gt;in fields such as education "which may not control for age, disability, income and social status, ethnic and racial, or other significant factors".

==Categories and definitions==

===Distinctions in measurement===
Social support can be categorized and measured in several different ways.

There are four common functions of social support:&lt;ref name=Wills91&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wills|first=T.A.|title=Social support and interpersonal relationships|journal=Prosocial Behavior, Review of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=12|pages=265–289|editor1-first=Clark|editor1-last=Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wills|first=T.A.|title=Social support and health|year=1985|publisher=Academic Press|location=Orlando, FL|pages=61–82|editor=S.

Researchers also commonly make a distinction between perceived and received support.&lt;ref name=SETReview /&gt;&lt;ref name=Barrera&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrera|first=M|title=Distinctions between social support concepts, measures, and models|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|year=1986|volume=14|issue=4|pages=413–445|doi=10.1007/bf00922627}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Perceived support'' refers to a recipient’s subjective judgment that providers will offer (or have offered) effective help during times of need.

Data suggests that emotional support may play a more significant role in protecting individuals from the deleterious effects of stress than structural means of support, such as social involvement or activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kessler|first=R.

===Sources===

Social support can come from a variety of sources, including (but not limited to): family, friends, romantic partners, pets, community ties, and coworkers.&lt;ref name=SETReview /&gt; Sources of support can be natural (e.g., family and friends) or more formal (e.g., mental health specialists or community organizations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogan, B.|author2=Linden, W. |author3=Najarian, B. |title=Social support interventions: Do they work?|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|year=2002|volume=22|issue=3|pages=381–440|doi=10.1016/s0272-7358(01)00102-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The source of the social support is an important determinant of its effectiveness as a coping strategy.

Social support is also available among [[social media]] sites. As technology advances, the availability for online support increases. Social support can be offered through social media websites such as [[blog|blogs]], [[Facebook]] groups, health forums, and online support groups. According to Hwang, the support is similar to face-to-face social support, but also offers the unique aspects of convenience, anonymity, and non-judgmental interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social support in an Internet weight loss community|journal = International Journal of Medical Informatics|date = 2010-01-01|issn = 1386-5056|pmc = 3060773|pmid = 19945338|pages = 5–13|volume = 79|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.10.003|first = Kevin O.|last = Hwang|first2 = Allison J.|last2 = Ottenbacher|first3 = Angela P.|last3 = Green|first4 = M.

Social support through social media is available to everyone with internet access and allows users to create relationships and receive encouragement for whatever issue they may be facing.

Coulson claims online support groups provide a unique opportunity for health professionals to learn about the experiences and views of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social support in cyberspace: a content analysis of communication within a Huntington's disease online support group|journal = Patient Education and Counseling|date = 2007-10-01|issn = 0738-3991|pmid = 17629440|pages = 173–178|volume = 68|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.pec.2007.06.002|first = Neil S.|last = Coulson|first2 = Heather|last2 = Buchanan|first3 = Aimee|last3 = Aubeeluck|url = http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/721/1/Coulson_Buchanan_Aubeeluck_2007_PEC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of social support can also benefit users by providing them with a variety of information. Seeking informational social support allows users to access suggestions, advice, and information regarding health concerns or recovery. Many need social support, and with its emergence on social media access can be obtained from a wider range of people in need. Wong and Ma (2016) have done research that shows online social support affects users' online [[subjective well-being]].

In a 2013 study, Akey et al. did a qualitative study of 34 men and women diagnosed with an eating disorder and used the [[Health Belief Model]] (HBM) to explain the reasons for which they forgo seeking social support. Many people with eating disorders have a low perceived susceptibility, which can be explained as a sense of denial about their illness. Their perceived severity of the illness is affected by those to whom they compare themselves to, often resulting in people believing their illness is not severe enough to seek support. Due to poor past experiences or educated speculation, the perception of benefits for seeking social support is relatively low. The number of perceived barriers towards seeking social support often prevents people with eating disorders from getting the support they need to better cope with their illness. Such barriers include fear of social stigma, financial resources, and availability and quality of support. Self-efficacy may also explain why people with eating disorders do not seek social support, because they may not know how to properly express their need for help. This research has helped to create a better understanding of why individuals with eating disorders do not seek social support, and may lead to increased efforts to make such support more available. Eating disorders are classified as mental illnesses but can also have physical health repercussions. Creating a strong social support system for those affected by eating disorders may help such individuals to have a higher quality of both mental and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Akey, J.

Various studies have been performed examining the effects of social support on psychological distress. Interest in the implications of social support were triggered by a series of articles published in the mid-1970s, each reviewing literature examining the association between psychiatric disorders and factors such as change in marital status, geographic mobility, and social disintegration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cobb|first=S.|title=Social support as a moderator of life stress|year=1976|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=98|issue=5|pages=300–314|doi=10.1097/00006842-197609000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cassel|first=J.|title=Psychosocial processes and "stress":theoretical formulation|year=1974|journal=International Journal of Health Services|volume=4|issue=3|pages=471–482|doi=10.2190/wf7x-y1l0-bfkh-9qu2|pmid=4475665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers realized that the theme present in each of these situations is the absence of adequate social support and the disruption of social networks. This observed relationship sparked numerous studies concerning the effects of social support on mental health.

One particular study documented the effects of social support as a coping strategy on psychological distress in response to stressful work and life events among police officers. Talking things over among coworkers was the most frequent form of coping utilized while on duty, whereas most police officers kept issues to themselves while off duty. The study found that the social support between co-workers significantly buffered the relationship between work-related events and distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Patterson|first= George T.|title=Examining the effects of coping and social support on work and life stress among police officers|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|year=2003|volume=31|issue= 3|pages=215–226|doi=10.1016/s0047-2352(03)00003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have examined the social support systems of single mothers. One study by D'Ercole demonstrated that the effects of social support vary in both form and function and will have drastically different effects depending upon the individual. The study found that supportive relationships with friends and co-workers, rather than task-related support from family, was positively related to the mother's psychological well-being. D'Ercole hypothesizes that friends of a single parent offer a chance to socialize, match experiences, and be part of a network of peers. These types of exchanges may be more spontaneous and less obligatory than those between relatives. Additionally, co-workers can provide a community away from domestic life, relief from family demands, a source of recognition, and feelings of competence. D'Ercole also found an interesting statistical interaction whereby social support from co-workers decreased the experience of stress only in lower income individuals. The author hypothesizes that single women who earn more money are more likely to hold more demanding jobs which require more formal and less dependent relationships. Additionally, those women who earn higher incomes are more likely to be in positions of power, where relationships are more competitive than supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Ercole|first=Ann|title=Single Mothers: Stress, Coping, and Social Support|year=1988|journal=Journal of Community Psychology|volume=16|pages=41–54|doi=10.1002/1520-6629(198801)16:1&lt;41::aid-jcop2290160107&gt;3.0.co;2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have been dedicated specifically to understanding the effects of social support in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a study by Haden et al., when victims of severe trauma perceived high levels of social support and engaged in interpersonal coping styles, they were less likely to develop severe PTSD when compared to those who perceived lower levels of social support. These results suggest that high levels of social support alleviate the strong positive association between level of injury and severity of PTSD, and thus serves as a powerful protective factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haden|first=Sara C. |author2=Scarpa, Angela |author3=Jones, Russell T. |author4=Ollendick, Thomas H.|title=Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and injury: the moderating role of perceived social support and coping for young adults|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2007|volume=42|issue=7 |pages=1187–1198|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.09.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, data shows that the support of family and friends has a positive influence on an individual's ability to cope with trauma. In fact, a meta-analysis by Brewin et al. found that social support was the strongest predictor, accounting for 40%, of variance in PTSD severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brewin|first=C. R. |author2=Andrews B. |author3=Valentine, J.

In some cases, support decreases with increases in trauma severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norris|first=F.

College students have also been the target of various studies on the effects of social support on coping. Reports between 1990 and 2003 showed college stresses were increasing in severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benton|first=S. A. |author2=Robertson, J. M. |author3=Tseng, W. C. |author4=Newton F.

R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of such mounting stress, students naturally seek support from family and friends in order to alleviate psychological distress. A study by Chao found a significant two-way correlation between perceived stress and social support, as well as a significant three-way correlation between perceived stress, social support, and dysfunctional coping. The results indicated that high levels of dysfunctional coping deteriorated the association between stress and well-being at both high and low levels of social support, suggesting that dysfunctional coping can deteriorate the positive buffering action of social support on well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chao|first=Ruth Chu-Lien|title=Managing Perceived Stress Among College Students: The Roles of Social Support and Dysfunctional Coping|year=2012|journal=Journal of College Counseling|volume=15|issue=1|pages=5–21|doi=10.1002/j.2161-1882.2012.00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who reported social support were found more likely to engage in less healthy activities, including sedentary behavior, drug and alcohol use, and too much or too little sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thorsteinsson|first= E.

Social support has a clearly demonstrated link to physical health outcomes in individuals, with numerous ties to physical health including [[Death|mortality]].

===Costs===
Social support is integrated into service delivery schemes and sometimes are a primary service provided by governmental contracted entities (e.g., companionship, peer services, family caregiving). Community services known by the nomenclature community support, and workers by a similar title, Direct Support Professional, have a base in social and community support "ideology". &lt;ref&gt; Racino, J. (2000). ''Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life''. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Wehman, P. and Kregel, J. (1998). ''More than a Job: Securing Satisfying Careers for People with Disabilities''. London, Toronto: Paul H. Brookes. &lt;/ref&gt; All supportive services from [[supported employment]] to [[supported housing]], [[family support]], [[supported education]], and [[supportive living]] are based upon the relationship between "informal and formal" supports, and "paid and unpaid caregiving". &lt;ref&gt; Nisbet, J. and Hagner, D. (1988). Natural supports in the workplace: A reexamination of supported employment. ''JASH'', 13(4): 260-267. &lt;/ref&gt;Inclusion studies, based upon affiliation and friendship, or the conversely, have a similar theoretical basis &lt;ref&gt; Sapon-Shevin, M. (1992). Including all children and their gifts within regular classrooms. In: S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Controversial Issues Confronting Special Education'' (pp. 69-81). London: Allyn and Bacon. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Strully, J. and Strully, C. (1985). Friendship and our children. ''JASH,'' 10(4): 224-227. &lt;/ref&gt; as do "person-centered support" strategies.

Social support theories are often found in "real life" in cultural, music and arts communities, and as might be expected within religious communities. Social support is integral in theories of aging, and the "social care systems" have often been challenged (e.g., creativity throughout the lifespan, extra retirement hours). &lt;ref&gt; Maduro, R. (1991, Spring). The 
old man as a creative artist in India. ''Generations'', XV (2):17-20. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Kunkel, S. (1989, Spring). An extra eight hours a day. ''Generations'', XIII(2): 57-60. &lt;/ref&gt; Ed Skarnulis' (state director) adage, "Support, don't supplant the family" applies to other forms of social support networks.

Although there are many benefits to social support, it is not always beneficial.  It has been proposed that in order for social support to be beneficial, the social support desired by the individual has to match the support given to him or her; this is known as the matching hypothesis.&lt;ref name = Cohen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cut&gt;{{cite book|last=Cutrona|first=C.E|title=Russell, D.W.|year=1990|publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|pages=319–366|editor=Sarason, B.R. |editor2=Sarason, I.G. |editor3=Pierce, G.R.|chapter=Types of social support and specific stress: Toward a theory of optimal matching}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen, S., &amp; McKay, G.|title=Handbook of psychology and health|year=1984|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=253–268|editor=Baum, A. |editor2=Taylor, S.E. |editor3=Singer, J.|chapter=Social support, stress, and the buffering hypothesis: A theoretical analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Psychological stress may increase if a different type of support is provided than what the recipient wishes to receive (e.g., informational is given when emotional support is sought).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=L.M.|author2=Krasnoperova, E.N. |author3=Tatar, D.G. |author4=Hansen, M.B. |author5=Person, E.A. |author6=Galvin, K.L. |author7=Nelson, K.L. |title=The way to console may depend on the goal: Experimental studies of social support|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=37|pages=49–61|doi=10.1006/jesp.2000.1435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thoit"/&gt;  Additionally, elevated levels of perceived stress can impact the effect of social support on health-related outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhou|first=Eric S.|author2=Penedo, Frank J. |author3=Lewis, John E. |title=Perceived stress mediates the effects of social support on health-related quality of life among men treated for localized prostate cancer|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=December 2010|volume=69|issue=6|pages=587–590|pmid=21109047|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2010.04.019|pmc=2994072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other costs have been associated with social support. For example, received support has not been linked consistently to either physical or mental health;&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt; perhaps surprisingly, received support has sometimes been linked to worse mental health.&lt;ref name="Bolger 2000 953–961"/&gt;  Additionally, if social support is overly intrusive, it can increase stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shumaker|first=S.A.|author2=Hill, D.R. |title=Gender differences in social support and physical health|journal=Health Psychology|year=1991|volume=10|issue=2|pages=102–111|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.10.2.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important when discussing social support to always consider the possibility that the social support system is actually an antagonistic influence on an individual.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Two dominant models===
There are two dominant hypotheses addressing the link between social support and health: the buffering hypothesis and the direct effects hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;  The main difference between these two hypotheses is that the direct effects hypothesis predicts that social support is beneficial all the time, while the buffering hypothesis predicts that social support is mostly beneficial during [[stress (psychological)|stressful times]].  Evidence has been found for both hypotheses.&lt;ref name=SETReview /&gt;

In the buffering hypothesis, social support protects (or "buffers") people from the bad effects of stressful life events (e.g., death of a spouse, job loss).&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;  Evidence for stress buffering is found when the [[correlation]] between stressful events and poor health is weaker for people with high social support than for people with low social support.  The weak correlation between stress and health for people with high social support is often interpreted to mean that social support has protected people from stress. Stress buffering is more likely to be observed for perceived support than for social integration&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt; or received support.&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt; The theoretical concept or construct of resiliency is associated with coping theories. 

In the direct effects (also called main effects) hypothesis, people with high social support are in better health than people with low social support, regardless of stress.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt; In addition to showing buffering effects, perceived support also shows consistent direct effects for mental health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Lakey, B., &amp; Cronin, A. 2008 385–408"/&gt; Both perceived support and social integration show main effects for physical health outcomes.&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt;  However, received (enacted) support rarely shows main effects.&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt;

===Theories to explain the links===

Several theories have been proposed to explain social support’s link to health. Stress and coping social support theory&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;&lt;ref name = Cut/&gt;&lt;ref name =Thoit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thoits|first=P.A.|title=Social support as coping assistance|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|year=1986|volume=54|issue=4|pages=416–423|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.54.4.416}}&lt;/ref&gt; dominates social support research&lt;ref name=RRT&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lakey|first=B.|author2=Orehek, E. |title=Relational Regulation Theory: A new approach to explain the link between perceived support and mental health|journal=Psychological Review|year=2011|volume=118|issue=3|pages=482–495|doi=10.1037/a0023477|pmid=21534704}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is designed to explain the buffering hypothesis described above. According to this theory, social support protects people from the bad health effects of stressful events (i.e., stress buffering) by influencing how people think about and [[coping (psychology)|cope]] with the events. An example in 2018 are the effects of school shootings on the well being and future of children and children's health. According to stress and coping theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lazarus, R.S., &amp; Folkman, S.|title=Stress, appraisal, and coping|year=1984|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; events are stressful insofar as people have negative thoughts about the event ([[appraisal theory|appraisal]]) and cope ineffectively. Coping consists of deliberate, conscious actions such as problem solving or relaxation. As applied to social support, stress and coping theory suggests that social support promotes [[adaptation|adaptive]] appraisal and coping.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;&lt;ref name = Thoit /&gt; Evidence for stress and coping social support theory is found in studies that observe stress buffering effects for perceived social support.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt; One problem with this theory is that, as described previously, stress buffering is not seen for social integration,&lt;ref name=T95&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thoits|first=P.A.|title=Stress, coping, and social support processes: Where are we? What next?|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|year=1995|volume=35|pages=53–79|doi=10.2307/2626957|jstor=2626957}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that received support is typically not linked to better health outcomes.&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt;

Relational regulation theory (RRT)&lt;ref name=RRT /&gt; is another theory, which is designed to explain main effects (the direct effects hypothesis) between perceived support and mental health. As mentioned previously, perceived support has been found to have both buffering and direct effects on mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wethington|first=E.|author2=Kessler, R.C. |title=Perceived support, received support, and adjustment to stressful life events|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|year=1986|volume=27|issue=1|pages=78–89|doi=10.2307/2136504|pmid=3711634|jstor=2136504}}&lt;/ref&gt;  RRT was proposed in order to explain perceived support’s main effects on mental health which cannot be explained by the stress and coping theory.&lt;ref name=RRT /&gt;  RRT hypothesizes that the link between perceived support and mental health comes from people [[Emotional self-regulation|regulating their emotions]] through ordinary conversations and shared activities rather than through conversations on how to cope with stress. This regulation is relational in that the support providers, conversation topics and activities that help regulate emotion are primarily a matter of personal taste. This is supported by previous work showing that the largest part of perceived support is relational in nature.&lt;ref name=L2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakey|first=B.|title=Social Psychological Foundations of Clinical Psychology|year=2010|publisher=Guildford|location=New York|pages=177–194|editor=Maddux, J.E. |editor2=Tangney, J.P.|chapter=Social support: Basic research and new strategies for intervention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life-span theory&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt; is another theory to explain the links of social support and health, which emphasizes the differences between perceived and received support. According to this theory, social support develops throughout the life span, but especially in childhood [[attachment theory|attachment]] with parents.  Social support develops along with adaptive [[Trait theory|personality traits]] such as low hostility, low neuroticism, high optimism, as well as social and coping skills.  Together, support and other aspects of personality ("psychological theories") influence health largely by promoting health practices (e.g., exercise and weight management) and by preventing health-related stressors (e.g., job loss, divorce).  Evidence for life-span theory includes that a portion of perceived support is trait-like,&lt;ref name = L2010 /&gt; and that perceived support is linked to adaptive personality characteristics and attachment experiences.&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt; Lifespan theories are popular from their origins in Schools of Human Ecology at the universities, aligned with family theories, and researched through federal centers over decades (e.g., University of Kansas, Beach Center for Families; Cornell University, School of Human Ecology).  

Of [[The Big Five personality traits|the Big Five Personality Traits]], agreeableness is associated with people receiving the most social support and having the least-strained relationships at work and home.  Receiving support from a supervisor in the workplace is associated with alleviating tensions both at work and at home, as are interdependency and idiocentrism of an employee.&lt;ref name="The effects of allocentrism, idiocentrism, social support, and big five personality dimensions on work-family conflict."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shafiro|first1=M.|title=The effects of allocentrism, idiocentrism, social support, and big five personality dimensions on work-family conflict.|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering|date=2011|volume=66|issue=3|pages=191–203|doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2010.12.010|ref=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological pathways===
Many studies have tried to identify [[biopsychosocial model|biopsychosocial]] pathways for the link between social support and health. Social support has been found to positively impact the [[immune system|immune]], [[neuroendocrine system|neuroendocrine]], and [[cardiovascular system]]s.&lt;ref name=T07&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=S.E.|title=Foundations of health psychology|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=145–171|editor=Friedman, H.S. |editor2=Silver, R.C.|chapter=Social support}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these systems are listed separately here, evidence has shown that these systems can interact and affect each other.&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt;

*Immune system: Social support is generally associated with better immune function.&lt;ref name=U2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herbert|first=T.B.|author2=Cohen, S. |title=Stress and immunity in humans: A meta-analytic review|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=1993|pages=364–379|doi=10.1097/00006842-199307000-00004|volume=55|issue=4|citeseerx=10.1.1.125.6544}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, being more socially integrated is correlated with lower levels of inflammation (as measured by [[C-reactive protein]], a marker of inflammation),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loucks|first=E.B.|author2=Berkman, L.F. |author3=Gruenewald, T.L. |author4=Seeman, T.E. |title=Relation of social integration to inflammatory marker concentrations in men and women 70-79 years|journal=American Journal of Cardiology|year=2006|volume=97|issue=7|pages=1010–1016|doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2005.10.043|pmid=16563907}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people with more social support have a lower susceptibility to the common cold.&lt;ref name=C97 /&gt;
*Neuroendocrine system: Social support has been linked to lower [[cortisol]] ("stress hormone") levels in response to stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner-Cobb|first=J.M.|author2=Sephton, S.E. |author3=Koopman, C. |author4=Blake-Mortimer, J. |author5=Spiegel, D. |title=Social support and salivary cortisol in women with metastatic breast cancer|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=2000|volume=62|pages=337–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Neuroimaging]] work has found that social support decreases activation of regions in the brain associated with social distress, and that this diminished activity was also related to lowered cortisol levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberger|first=N.I.|author2=Taylor, S.E. |author3=Gable, S.L. |author4=Hilmert, C.J. |author5=Lieberman, M.D. |title=Neural pathways link social support to attenuated neuroendocrine stress response|journal=NeuroImage|year=2007|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1601–1612|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.01.038 |pmid=17395493 |pmc=2710966}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cardiovascular system: Social support has been found to lower cardiovascular reactivity to stressors.&lt;ref name=U2006 /&gt; It has been found to lower [[blood pressure]] and [[heart rate]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unden|first=A.L.|author2=Orth-Gomer, K. |author3=Elofsson, S. |title=Cardiovascular effects of social support in the work place: twenty-four hour ECG monitoring of men and women|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=1991|volume=53|issue=1|pages=50–60|pmid=2011650}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are known to benefit the cardiovascular system.

Though many benefits have been found, not all research indicates positive effects of social support on these systems.&lt;ref name=SETReview /&gt; For example, sometimes the presence of a support figure can lead to increased neuroendocrine and [[physiological]] activity.&lt;ref name=KG /&gt;

===Support groups===
{{Main article|Support group}}

Social support groups can be a source of informational support, by providing valuable educational information, and emotional support, including encouragement from people experiencing similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helgeson|first=V.S.|author2=Cohen, S. |title=Social support and adjustment to cancer: Reconciling descriptive, correlational, and intervention research|journal=Health Psychology|year=1996|volume=15|issue=2|pages=135–148|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.15.2.135|citeseerx=10.1.1.559.9698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottlieb, B.H.|title=Marshalling social support: Formats, processes, and effects|year=1988|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have generally found beneficial effects for social support group interventions for various conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogan|first=B.E.|author2=Najarian, B. |title=Social support interventions: Do they work?|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|year=2002|volume=22|issue=3|pages=381–440|doi=10.1016/s0272-7358(01)00102-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Internet support groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hazzard|first=A.|author2=Celano, M. |author3=Collins, M. |author4=Markov, Y. |title=Effects of STARBRIGHT World on knowledge, social support, and coping in hospitalized children with sickle cell disease and asthma|journal=Children's Health Care|year=2002|volume=31|pages=69–86|doi=10.1207/s15326888chc3101_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups may be termed "self help" groups in nation-states, may be offered by non-profit organizations, and in 2018, may be paid for as part of governmental reimbursement schemes.

===Providing support===
There are both costs and benefits to providing support to others. Providing [[long-term care]] or support for someone else is a chronic stressor that has been associated with anxiety, depression, alterations in the immune system, and increased mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schulz|first=R.|author2=O'Brien, A.T. |author3=Bookwala, J. |author4=Fleissner, K. |title=Psychiatric and physical morbidity effects of dementia caregiving: Prevalence, correlates, and causes|journal=The Gerontologist|year=1995|volume=35|pages=771–791|doi=10.1093/geront/35.6.771 |pmid=8557205 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiecolt-Glaser|first=J.K.|author2=Marucha, P.T. |author3=Malarkey, W.B. |author4=Mercado, A.M. |author5=Glaser, R. |title=Slowing of wound healing by psychological stress|journal=Lancet|year=1995|volume=346|issue=8984|pages=1194–1196|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(95)92899-5 |pmid=7475659}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, family caregivers and "university personnel" alike have advocated for both respite or relief, and higher payments related to ongoing, long-term caregiving. However, providing support has also been associated with health benefits. In fact, providing instrumental support to friends, relatives, and neighbors, or emotional support to spouses has been linked to a significant decrease in the risk for mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=S.L.|author2=Nesse, R.M. |author3=Vinokur, A.D. |author4=Smith, D.M. |title=Providing social support may be more beneficial than receiving it: Results from a prospective study of mortality|journal=Psychological Science|year=2003|volume=14|issue=4|pages=320–327|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.14461|pmid=12807404}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, a recent neuroimaging study found that giving support to a significant other during a distressful experience increased activation in [[reward system|reward]] areas of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inagaki|first=T.K.|author2=Eisenberger, N.I. |title=Neural correlates of giving support to a loved one|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=2011|volume=epub ahead of print|issue=1|doi=10.1097/psy.0b013e3182359335|pmid=22071630|pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social defence system===
In 1959 [[Isabel Menzies Lyth]] identified that threat to a person’s identity in a group where they share similar characteristics develops a defence system inside the group which stems from emotions experienced by members of the group, which are difficult to articulate, cope with and finds solutions to. Together with an external pressure on efficiency a collusive and injunctive system develops that is resistant to change, supports their activities and prohibit others from performing their major tasks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moderntimesworkplace.com/archives/ericsess/sessvol1/Lythp439.opd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesscoachinstitute.com/library/key_concepts.shtml|title=Key Concepts in Interpersonal Psychology|author=|date=|website=www.businesscoachinstitute.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and culture==

===Gender differences===

However, one study indicates that there are no differences in the extent to which men and women seek appraisal, informational, and instrumental types of support.  Rather, the big difference lies in seeking emotional support.&lt;ref name="Gender Differences In Perceptions Of Stressors And Utilization Of Social Support Among University Students"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Day|first1=A.|last2=Livingtone1|first2=H.|title=Gender Differences In Perceptions Of Stressors And Utilization Of Social Support Among University Students|journal=Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science|date=2003|volume=35|issue=2|pages=73–83|ref=109|doi=10.1037/h0087190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tamres|first=L.|author2=Janicki, D. |author3=Helgeson, V.S. |title=Sex differences in coping behavior: A meta-analytic review|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2002|volume=6|pages=2–30|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0601_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, social support may be more beneficial to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwarzer|first=R.|author2=Leppin, A. |title=Social support and health: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychology and Health|year=1989|volume=3|pages=1–15|doi=10.1080/08870448908400361}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Shelley Taylor]] and her colleagues have suggested that these gender differences in social support may stem from the biological difference between men and women in how they respond to stress (i.e., [[flight or fight response|flight or fight]] versus [[tend and befriend]]).&lt;ref name=Tend /&gt;  Married men are less likely to be depressed compared to non-married men after the presence of a particular stressor because men are able to delegate their emotional burdens to their partner, and women have been shown to be influenced and act more in reaction to social context compared to men.&lt;ref name="Hobfoll"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hobfoll | first1 = S.E. | last2 = Cameron | first2 = R.P. | last3 = Chapman | first3 = H.A. | last4 = Gallagher | first4 = R.W. | year = 1996 | title = Social support and social coping in couples | url = | journal = Handbook of Social Support and the Family | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 413–433 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-1388-3_17| isbn = 978-1-4899-1390-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   It has been found that men’s behaviors are overall more antisocial, with less regard to the impact their coping may have upon others, and women more prosocial-active with importance stressed on how their coping affects people around them.&lt;ref&gt;Malek, M.J.

It is important to note that when the perceived stress level is the same, men and women have much fewer differences in how they seek and use social support.&lt;ref name="Gender Differences In Perceptions Of Stressors And Utilization Of Social Support Among University Students"/&gt;

===Cultural differences===

Although social support is thought to be a universal resource, cultural differences exist in social support.&lt;ref name=Cultural /&gt; In many Asian cultures, the person is seen as more of a collective unit of society, whereas Western cultures are more individualistic and conceptualize social support as a transaction in which one person seeks help from another.  In more interdependent Eastern cultures, people are less inclined to enlist the help of others.&lt;ref name="Culture and Social Support: Who Seeks It and Why?"/&gt;  For example, [[European Americans]] have been found to call upon their social relationships for social support more often than [[Asian Americans]] or Asians during stressful occasions,&lt;ref name=S04&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=S.E.|author2=Sherman, D.K. |author3=Kim, H.S. |author4=Jarcho, J. |author5=Takagi, K. |author6=Dunagan, M.S. |title=Culture and social support: Who seeks it and why?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=87|issue=3|pages=354–62|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.3.354 |pmid=15382985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Asian Americans expect social support to be less helpful than European Americans.&lt;ref name=S06&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=H.S.|author2=Sherman, D.K. |author3=Ko, D. |author4=Taylor, S.E |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2006|volume=32|issue=12|pages=1596–1607|doi=10.1177/0146167206291991 |pmid=17122173|title=Pursuit of Comfort and Pursuit of Harmony: Culture, Relationships, and Social Support Seeking|citeseerx=10.1.1.584.9979}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences in social support may be rooted in different cultural ideas about [[social groups]].&lt;ref name=S04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=S06/&gt;  It is important to note that these differences are stronger in emotional support than instrumental support.&lt;ref name="Culture and Social Support: Who Seeks It and Why?"/&gt;  Additionally, ethnic differences in social support from family and friends have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sagrestano|first=L.M.|author2=Feldman, P. |author3=Killingsworth-Rini, C. |author4=Woo, G. |author5=Dunkel-Schetter, C |title=Ethnicity and social support during pregnancy|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|year=1999|volume=27|issue=6|pages=873–902 |doi=10.1023/a:1022266726892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural differences in coping strategies other than social support also exist.  One study shows that Koreans are more likely to report substance abuse than European Americans are.  Further, European Americans are more likely to exercise in order to cope than Koreans. Some cultural explanations are that Asians are less likely to seek it from fear of disrupting the harmony of their relationships and that they are more inclined to settle their problems independently and avoid criticism.  However, these differences are not found among Asian Americans relative to their Europeans American counterparts.&lt;ref name="Culture and Social Support: Who Seeks It and Why?"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9873">'''Species dysphoria''' is the experience of [[dysphoria]] associated with the feeling that one's body is of the wrong species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lupa (2007) ''A Field Guide To Otherkin.'' Megalithica Books''.'' p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of psychological literature, the term is common within the [[otherkin]] and [[Therianthropy|therian]] communities to describe their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Lupa (2007) ''A Field Guide To Otherkin.'' Megalithica Books''.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and symptoms==

Earls and Lalumière (2009) describe it as "the sense of being in the wrong [species'] body...a desire to be an animal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Earls|first=Christopher M|last2=Lalumière|first2=Martin L|date=2009|title=A Case Study of Preferential Bestiality|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/xjw2736170737347/|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=|pages= 3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A term that has also been used is "transspecies", described by Phaedra and Isaac Bonewits as "people who believe themselves to be part animal, or animal souls that have been incarnated in human bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Real Energy: Systems, Spirits, And Substances to Heal, Change, And Grow|last=Bonewits|first=Isaac|last2=Bonewits|first2=Phaedra|publisher=New Page Books|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species dysphoria may include:

* [[dysphoria]] associated with the feeling that one's body is of the wrong species&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
Many find comfort in a form of transition, whether physical or social.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theta.kinfire.org:80/?page_id=11|title=Therianthropy Education and Therapeutic Alliance - For Therapists|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304111301/http://theta.kinfire.org:80/?page_id=11|archive-date=4 March 2015|dead-url=yes|access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little research in surgeries towards the end of looking like another species, amongst what does exist, a 2008 paper by Samuel Poore in ''The Journal of Hand Surgery - American Volume'' details how a wing similar to that of a flightless bird could be constructed from a human arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O Poore|first=Samuel|date=2008|title=The Morphological Basis Of The Arm-to-Wing Transition|url=https://www.jhandsurg.org/article/S0363-5023(07)01042-8/abstract|journal=Journal of Hand Surgery - American Volume|volume=|pages=277–280|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a critical discussion of the work of Gerbasi ''et al.'' (2008), Fiona Probyn-Rapsey (2011) proposes that if "Species Identity Disorder" were to be treated, it may follow paths towards encouraging desistance, mirroring aims for desistance in the treatment of [[gender dysphoria in children]]; perhaps "redirecting a child’s attention away from cross-dressing as an animal" or "limiting the influence of humanimal creatures like stuffed toys".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Probyn-Rapsey|first=Fiona|date=2011|title=Furries and the Limits of Species Identity Disorder: A Response to Gerbasi et al.|url=https://www.animalsandsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/probynrapsey.pdf|journal=Society &amp; Animals|volume=19|pages=294–301|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She proposes alternatively that treatments "might involve counseling to learn to tolerate “atypical” humanimal development for those bothered by furries [with Species Identity Disorder]".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Relationship to gender dysphoria ==
Though not all people with species dysphoria have [[gender dysphoria]], and vice versa, overlap exists. Some people experience both gender dysphoria and species dysphoria and consider them to be related in that they believe them to be similar dysphoric experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Lupa (2007) ''A Field Guide To Otherkin.'' Megalithica Books''.'' p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

"Species dysphoria" is informally used mainly in psychological literature to compare the experiences of some individuals to those in the [[transgender]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of criminology and deviant behavior: Sexual deviance, Volume 3.|last=Bryant|first=Clifton D.|publisher=Brunner/Routledge|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to the furry fandom ==
In a 2008 study by Gerbasi ''et al.'', amongst other things pursuing the potential of a condition termed "Species Identity Disorder", 46% of people surveyed who identified as being in the [[furry fandom]], answered "yes" to the question "Do you consider yourself to be less than 100% human?" and 41% answered "yes" to the question "If you could become 0% human, would you?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerbasi|first=Kathleen C.|last2=Higner|first2=Justin|last3=Paolone|first3=Nicholas|last4=L. Scaletta|first4=Laura|last5=L.

Questions that Gerbasi states as being deliberately designed to draw parallels with gender dysphoria, specifying "a persistent feeling of discomfort" about the human body and the feeling that the person was the "non-human species trapped in a human body", were answered "yes" by 24% and 29% of respondents, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerbasi|first=Kathleen C.|last2=Higner|first2=Justin|last3=Paolone|first3=Nicholas|last4=L.

== Relationship to zoophilia ==
Though not all people with species dysphoria are zoophilic, it has been proposed that there is comorbidity in some zoophiles by Beetz (2004), citing Miletski (2002) as evidence of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M Beetz|first=Andrea|date=2004|title=Bestiality/Zoophilia: A Scarcely Investigated Phenomenon Between Crime, Paraphilia, and Love|url=|journal=Journal of Forensic Psychology Practice|volume=|pages= 26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miletski (2002), in a study contained in their book, involving 67 male and nine female zoophiles, found that 16 (24%) of the men reported that it was ‘‘completely or mostly true’’ that they began having sex with animals because they ‘‘identiﬁed with the animal of [their] gender’’, 0 women reported this, with 1 woman reporting it as "sometimes true" against 14 of the men reporting as "sometimes true".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://resources.pink.horse/books/understanding_bestiality_miletski.pdf|title=Understanding Bestiality and Zoophila|last=Miletski|first=Hani|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=978-0971691704|location=|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study by Williams and Weinberg surveyed 114 self identified zoophilic men and wrote that some admitted to "believing they had animal characteristics or that they felt like they were an animal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J. Williams|first=Colin|last2=S.

== In fiction ==
In 2007, Los Angeles artist [[Micha Cárdenas]] created ''Becoming Dragon'', a "mixed-reality performance" in which a virtual reality experience was created to allow a person to completely experience life through the eyes of a [[dragon]] [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] in the virtual world, [[Second Life]]. After the performance, Cárdenas reported that "some of these people call themselves [[Otherkin]], and feel deeply, truly, painfully that they were born as the wrong species, that they are foxes, dragons and horses. I would refer to them as transspecies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cárdenas|first=Micha|last2=Greco|first2=Kael|last3=Margolis|first3=Todd|last4=Head|first4=Christopher|date=2009|title=Becoming Dragon: a mixed reality, durational performance in Second Life|url=https://transreal.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/becoming-dragon-micha-cardenas-edit1.pdf|dead-url=yes|journal=The International Society for Optical Engineering|volume=|pages=10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215095827/https://transreal.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/becoming-dragon-micha-cardenas-edit1.pdf|archive-date=15 December 2013|access-date=2 August 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J M Barrie's ''[[Peter Pan]]'' has been described as experiencing species dysphoria by Garber (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing and Cultural Anxiety|last=Garber|first=Marjorie|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Dutourd]]'s short novel ''[[Une Tête de Chien]]'' features a spaniel-headed human protagonist described by Giffney and Hird as suffering from species dysphoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.routledge.com/Queering-the-Non-Human/Hird-Giffney/p/book/9780754671282|title=Queering the non/human|last=Giffney|first=Noreen|last2=Hird|first2=Myra J|publisher=Ashgate|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telehealth''' involves the distribution of [[Health care|health-related services]] and information via electronic information and [[Telecommunication|telecommunication technologies]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrsa.gov/healthit/toolbox/RuralHealthITtoolbox/Telehealth/index.html|title=TeleHealth|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Health Resources and Services Administration|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows long distance patient/clinician contact and care, advice, reminders, education, intervention, monitoring and remote admissions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Donald K|date=2009-06-01|title=Overview of Telehealth and Its Application to Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy|journal=Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy Journal|volume=20|issue=2|pages=13–18|issn=1541-7891|pmc=2845264|pmid=20467533}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as provider distance-learning; meetings, supervision, and presentations between practitioners; online information and [[health data]] management and healthcare system integration.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Edward Alan|date=2007-07-01|title=Solving the disjuncture between research and practice: telehealth trends in the 21st century|journal=Health Policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)|volume=82|issue=2|pages=133–141|doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2006.09.011|issn=0168-8510|pmid=17046097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telehealth could include two [[clinician]]s discussing a case over [[Videoconferencing|video conference]]; a robotic surgery occurring through remote access; physical therapy done via digital monitoring instruments, live feed and application combinations; tests being forwarded between facilities for interpretation by a higher specialist; home monitoring through continuous sending of patient [[health data]]; client to practitioner online conference; or even videophone interpretation during a consult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As the population grows and ages, and medical advances are made which prolong life, demands increase on the healthcare system. Healthcare providers are also being asked to do more, with no increase in funding, or are encouraged to move to new models of funding and care such as patient-centered or outcomes based, rather than fee-for-service. Some specific health professions already have a shortage (i.e. Speech-language pathologists). When rural settings, lack of transport, lack of mobility (i.e. In the elderly or disabled), decreased funding or lack of staffing restrict access to care, telehealth can bridge the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mashima|first=Pauline A.|last2=Doarn|first2=Charles R.|date=2008-12-01|title=Overview of telehealth activities in speech-language pathology|journal=Telemedicine Journal and E-Health: The Official Journal of the American Telemedicine Association|volume=14|issue=10|pages=1101–1117|doi=10.1089/tmj.2008.0080|issn=1556-3669|pmid=19119834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Telehealth versus telemedicine ==
{{Main article|Telemedicine}}

Telehealth is sometimes discussed interchangeably with telemedicine. The [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA) distinguishes telehealth from telemedicine in its scope. According to HRSA, telemedicine only describes remote clinical services; such as diagnosis and monitoring, while telehealth includes preventative, promotive and curative care delivery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This includes the above-mentioned non-clinical applications like administration and provider education which make telehealth the preferred modern terminology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
The development and history of telehealth or telemedicine (terms used interchangeably in literature) is deeply rooted in the history and development in not only technology but also society itself. Humans have long sought to relay important messages through [[torch]]es, [[Semaphore line|optical telegraphy]], [[Electroscope|electroscopes,]] and [[Wireless|wireless transmission]]. In the 21st century, with the advent of the [[internet]], [[Portable communications device|portable devices]] and other such digital devices are taking a transformative role in healthcare and its delivery.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jNbPgAACAAJ|title=History of Telemedicine: Evolution, Context, and Transformation|last=Bashshur|first=Rashid|last2=Shannon|first2=Gary William|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert|isbn=9781934854112|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earliest instances ===
Although, [[traditional medicine]] relies on in-person care, the need and want for remote care has existed from the Roman and pre-Hippocratic periods in antiquity. The elderly and infirm who could not visit temples for medical care sent representatives to convey information on symptoms and bring home a diagnosis as well as treatment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In Africa, villagers would use [[smoke signal]]s to warn neighbouring villages of disease outbreak.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakajima|first=I.|last2=Sastrokusumo|first2=U.|last3=Mishra|first3=S. K.|last4=Komiya|first4=R.|last5=Malik|first5=A. Z.|last6=Tanuma|first6=T.|date=2006-08-01|title=The Asia Pacific telecommunity's telemedicine activities|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717870|journal=HEALTHCOM 2006 8th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services|pages=280–282|doi=10.1109/HEALTH.2006.246471}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginnings of telehealth have existed through primitive forms of communication and technology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== 1800s to early 1900s ===
As technology developed and wired communication became increasingly commonplace, the ideas surrounding telehealth began emerging. The earliest telehealth encounter can be traced to [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in 1876, when he used his early telephone as a means of getting help from his assistant Mr. Watson after he spilt acid on his trousers. Another instance of early telehealth, specifically telemedicine was reported in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 1879. An anonymous writer described a case where a doctor successfully diagnosed a child over the telephone in the middle of the night.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This Lancet issue, also further discussed the potential of Remote Patient Care in order to avoid unnecessary house visits, which were part of routine health care during the 1800s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zundel|first=K M|date=1996-01-01|title=Telemedicine: history, applications, and impact on librarianship.|journal=Bulletin of the Medical Library Association|volume=84|issue=1|pages=71–79|issn=0025-7338|pmc=226126|pmid=8938332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other instances of telehealth during this period came from the [[American Civil War]], during which telegraphs were used to deliver mortality lists and medical care to soldiers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

From the late 1800s to the early 1900s the early foundations of [[Wireless|wireless communication]] were laid down.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Radio]]s provided an easier and near instantaneous form of communication. The use of radio to deliver healthcare became accepted for remote areas.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T8gwu1okBW4C|title=E-Health, Telehealth, and Telemedicine: A Guide to Startup and Success|last=Maheu|first=Marlene|last2=Whitten|first2=Pamela|last3=Allen|first3=Ace|date=2002-02-28|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780787959036|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia]] is an example of the early adoption of radios in telehealth.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Mid-1900s to 1980s ===
It was during the mid-1900s well into the 1980s that a lot of the momentum and foundations of telehealth were founded. When the American [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)]], began plans to send astronauts into space, the need for Telemedicine became all too clear. In order to monitor their astronauts in space, telemedicine capabilities were built into the [[spacecraft]] as well as the first [[Space suit|spacesuits]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, during this period, telehealth and Telemedicine were promoted in different countries especially the United States. Different projects were funded across North America and Canada in order to realise the exciting potential of this new innovation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1964, the Nebraska Psychiatric Institute began using television links to form two-way communication with the Norfolk State Hospital which was 112 miles away for the education and consultation purposes between clinicians in the two locations.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://electronicdesign.com/components/brief-history-telemedicine|title=A Brief History Of Telemedicine|last=Allan|first=Roger|date=|website=|publisher=Electronic Design|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Logan International Airport]] in Boston established in-house medical stations in 1967. These stations were linked to [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Clinicians at the hospital would provide consultation services to patients who were at the airport. Consultations were achieved through microwave audio as well as video links.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In 1972, there was a key emphasis on telemedicine so much so that the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] in the United States approved funding for seven telemedicine projects across different states. This funding was renewed and two further projects were funded the following year.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== 1980s to 1990s – maturation and renaissance ===
Although the excitement of telehealth and telemedicine remained, enthusiasm waned in the 1980s. Telehealth projects underway before and during the 1980s would take off but fail to proliferate mainstream healthcare. This put a halt on various projects and reduced opportunities for funding.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; As a result, this period of telehealth history is called the "maturation" stage and made way for sustainable growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Sustained growth happened most notably in North America. Although State funding was beginning to run low, different hospitals in various states began to launch their own telehealth initiatives.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, NASA started experimenting with their ATS-3 satellite. Eventually, NASA started their SateLife/[[Health Net|HealthNet]] programme which tried to increase the health services connectivity in developing countries.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The combination of sustained growth, the advent of the [[internet]] and the increasing adoption of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] in traditional methods of care spurred the revival or "renaissance" of telehealth into the early 2000s and onwards.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cchpca.org/what-is-telehealth.|title=What is Telehealth?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Center for Connected Health Policy|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s and onward ===
The early 2000s were characterised by accelerated development in both science and technology. The early adoption of technology in society made way for widespread adoption in society. The diffusion of portable devices like laptops and mobile devices in everyday life made ideas surrounding telehealth more plausible. This continuing trend of better and innovative technology in homes, schools and organisations is contributing to the growing research in telehealth. Telehealth is no longer bound within the realms of telemedicine but has expanded itself to promotion, prevention and education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Methods and modalities ==
Telehealth requires a strong, reliable [[broadband]] connection. The broadband signal transmission infrastructure includes wires, cables, microwaves and [[Optical fiber|optic fibre]], which must be maintained for the provision of telehealth services. The better the connection (bandwidth quality), the more data can be sent and received. Historically this has priced providers or patients out of the service, but as the infrastructure improves and becomes more accessible, telehealth usage can grow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When a healthcare service decides to provide telehealth to its patients, there are steps to consider, besides just whether the above resources are available. A [[needs assessment]] is the best way to start, which includes assessing the access the community currently has to the proposed specialists and care, whether the organisation currently has underutilized equipment which will make them useful to the area they are trying to service, and the hardships they are trying to improve by providing the access to their intended community (i.e. Travel time, costs, time off work).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A service then needs to consider potential collaborators. Other services may exist in the area with similar goals who could be joined to provide a more holistic service, and/or they may already have telehealth resources available. The more services involved, the easier to spread the cost of IT, training, workflow changes and improve [[Management|buy-in]] from clients. Services need to have the patience to wait for the accrued benefits of providing their telehealth service and cannot necessarily expect community-wide changes reflected straight away.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Once the need for a Telehealth service is established, delivery can come within four distinct domains. They are [[Live video streaming|live video (synchronous)]], [[Store and forward|store-and-forward (asynchronous)]], [[remote patient monitoring]], and [[MHealth|mobile health]]. Live video involves a real-time two-way interaction, such as patient/caregiver-provider or provider-provider, over a digital (i.e. [[broadband]]) connection. This often is used to substitute a face to face meeting such as consults, and saves time and cost in travel. [[Store and forward|Store-and-forward]] is when data is collected, recorded, and then sent on to a provider.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, a patient's' digital health history file including x-rays and notes, being securely transmitted electronically to evaluate the current case. [[Remote patient monitoring]] includes patients' medical and [[health data]] being collected and transferred to a provider elsewhere who can continue to monitor the data and any changes that may occur. This may best suit cases that require ongoing care such as rehabilitation, chronic care, or elderly clients trying to stay in the community in their own homes as opposed to a care facility. Mobile health includes any health information, such as education, monitoring and care, that is present on and supported by mobile communication devices such as [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] or [[tablet computer]]s. This might include an [[Mobile app|application]], or [[Text messaging|text messaging services]] like appointment reminders or public health warning systems.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Major developments ==

=== In policy ===
Telehealth is a modern form of health care delivery. Telehealth breaks away from traditional health care delivery by using modern telecommunication systems including wireless communication methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZNEMwEACAAJ|title=Telehealth Practice in Eight Countries: New Zealand, Australia, the USA, Canada, UK, Malaysia, China and India : a Thesis Presented in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements of Degree of Master in Information Science at Massey University, Albany Campus, Auckland, New Zealand|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Massey University, Albany|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=García-Rojo|first=Marcial|title=International Clinical Guidelines for the Adoption of Digital Pathology: A Review of Technical Aspects|url=http://www.karger.com/?doi=10.1159/000441192|journal=Pathobiology|volume=83|issue=2-3|pages=99–109|doi=10.1159/000441192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional health is legislated through policy to ensure the safety of medical practitioners and patients. Consequently, since telehealth is a new form of health care delivery that is now gathering momentum in the health sector, many organizations have started to legislate the use of telehealth into policy.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keshvari|first=Hamid|last2=Haddadpoor|first2=Asefeh|last3=Taheri|first3=Behjat|last4=Nasri|first4=Mehran|last5=Aghdak|first5=Pezhman|date=2014-01-01|title=Survey Determinant Factors of Telemedicine Strategic Planning from the Managers and Experts Perspective in the Health Department, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences|url=http://www.scopemed.org/?mno=172066|journal=Acta Informatica Medica|volume=22|issue=5|doi=10.5455/aim.2014.22.320-324|pmc=4272851|pmid=25568581|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand, the Medical Council has a statement about telehealth on their website. This illustrates that the medical council has foreseen the importance that telehealth will have on the health system and have started to introduce telehealth legislation to practitioners along with government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcnz.org.nz/assets/News-and-Publications/Statement-on-telehealthv3.pdf|title=Statement on telehealth|last=|first=|date=2013|website=|publisher=Medical Council of New Zealand|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transition to mainstream ===
{{See also|Remote patient monitoring}}

Traditional use of telehealth services has been for specialist treatment. However, there has been a paradigm shift and telehealth is no longer considered a specialist service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hiirc.org.nz/page/41996/clinicians-perceptions-of-telemedicine-opportunities/;jsessionid=7A7875E69BE51E62E5C9527426776857?tag=informationtechnology&amp;tab=4180&amp;contentType=167&amp;section=9088|title=Clinicians' perceptions of telemedicine: Opportunities and barriers for emergency medicine • Health Improvement and Innovation Resource Centre|website=www.hiirc.org.nz|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development has ensured that many access barriers are eliminated, as medical professionals are able to use wireless communication technologies to deliver health care.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laxman|first=Kumar|date=2015|title=Barriers to Adoption of Consumer Health Informatics Applications for Health Self Management|url=|journal=Health Science Journal|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident in rural communities. For individuals living in rural communities, specialist care can be some distance away, particularly in the next major city. Telehealth eliminates this barrier, as health professionals are able to conduct a medical consultation through the use of wireless communication technologies. However, this process is dependent on both parties having Internet access.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Possemato|first=Kyle|last2=Bishop|first2=Todd M.|last3=Willis|first3=Matthew A.|last4=Lantinga|first4=Larry J.|date=2013-04-25|title=Healthcare Utilization and Symptom Variation Among Veterans Using Behavioral Telehealth Center Services|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11414-013-9338-y|journal=The Journal of Behavioral Health Services &amp; Research|language=en|volume=40|issue=4|pages=416–426|doi=10.1007/s11414-013-9338-y|issn=1094-3412}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Darkins|first=Adam|last2=Foster|first2=Linda|last3=Anderson|first3=Carla|last4=Goldschmidt|first4=Leonard|last5=Selvin|first5=Gerald|date=2013-07-01|title=The design, implementation, and operational management of a comprehensive quality management program to support national telehealth networks|journal=Telemedicine Journal and E-Health: The Official Journal of the American Telemedicine Association|volume=19|issue=7|pages=557–564|doi=10.1089/tmj.2012.0263|issn=1556-3669|pmid=23705961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telehealth allows the patient to be monitored between physician office visits which can improve patient health. Telehealth also allows patients to access expertise which is not available in their local area. This remote patient monitoring ability enables patients to stay at home longer and helps avoid unnecessary hospital time. In the long-term, this could potentially result in less burdening of the healthcare system and consumption of resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Technology advancement ===
{{see also|Technology|Emerging technologies}}

The technological advancement of wireless communication devices is a major development in telehealth.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vockley|first=Martha|date=2015-10-01|title=The Rise of Telehealth: 'Triple Aim,' Innovative Technology, and Popular Demand Are Spearheading New Models of Health and Wellness Care|journal=Biomedical Instrumentation &amp; Technology|volume=49|issue=5|pages=306–320|doi=10.2345/0899-8205-49.5.306|issn=0899-8205|pmid=26443907}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows patients to self-monitor their health conditions and to not rely as much on health care professionals. Furthermore, patients are more willing to stay on their treatment plans as they are more invested and included in the process, decision-making is shared.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kvedar|first=Joseph|last2=Coye|first2=Molly Joel|last3=Everett|first3=Wendy|date=2014-02-01|title=Connected health: a review of technologies and strategies to improve patient care with telemedicine and telehealth|journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope)|volume=33|issue=2|pages=194–199|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2013.0992|issn=1544-5208|pmid=24493760}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirani|first=Shashivadan P.|last2=Rixon|first2=Lorna|last3=Beynon|first3=Michelle|last4=Cartwright|first4=Martin|last5=Cleanthous|first5=Sophie|last6=Selva|first6=Abi|last7=Sanders|first7=Caroline|last8=Newman|first8=Stanton P.|date=2016-05-25|title=Quantifying beliefs regarding telehealth: Development of the Whole Systems Demonstrator Service User Technology Acceptability Questionnaire|url=http://jtt.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/05/25/1357633X16649531|journal=Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare|language=en|pages=1357633X16649531|doi=10.1177/1357633X16649531|issn=1357-633X|pmid=27224997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advancement also means that health care professionals are able to use better technologies to treat patients for example in [[surgery]]. Technological developments in telehealth are essential to improve health care, especially the delivery of healthcare services, as resources are finite along with an ageing population that is living longer.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Major implications and impacts ==
Telehealth allows multiple, different disciplines to merge and deliver a much more uniform level of care using the efficiency and accessibility of everyday technology. As telehealth proliferates mainstream healthcare and challenges notions of traditional healthcare delivery, different populations are starting to experience better quality, access and personalised care in their lives.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Books-Telemental-Health-Administrative-Foundations-Evidence-Based/dp/0124160484|title=Telemental Health: Clinical, Technical, and Administrative Foundations for Evidence-Based Practice|date=2012-09-20|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780124160484|editor-last=Professor|editor-first=Kathleen Myers|edition=1|language=English|editor-last2=Professor|editor-first2=Carolyn Turvey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Umefjord|first=Göran|date=2006-01-01|title=Internet consultation in medicine : studies of a text-based Ask the doctor service|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279663013_Internet_consultation_in_medicine_studies_of_a_text-based_Ask_the_doctor_service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health promotion  ===
''See Also: [[Health promotion|Health Promotion]]'' [[File:SmallWorldSocial BreastfeedingSupportProject GeorgiawithBabyEve.jpg|thumb|Baby Eve with Georgia for the Breastfeeding Support Project]]Telehealth can also increase health promotion efforts. These efforts can now be more personalised to the target population and professionals can extend their help into homes or private and safe environments in which patients of individuals can practice, ask and gain health information.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahn|first=Jeremy M.|date=2015-04-30|title=Virtual visits--confronting the challenges of telemedicine|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=372|issue=18|pages=1684–1685|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1500533|issn=1533-4406|pmid=25923547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health promotion using telehealth has become increasingly popular in [[Developing country|underdeveloped countries]] where there are very poor physical resources available. There has been a particular push toward [[mHealth]] applications as many areas, even underdeveloped ones have mobile phone coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQ74YyKYpNMC|title=Cell Phone Culture: Mobile Technology in Everyday Life|last=Goggin|first=Gerard|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415367431|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/mhealth-in-practice-9781780932293/|title=mHealth in Practice|last=Bloomsbury.com|website=Bloomsbury Publishing|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Developed country|developed countries]], health promotion efforts using telehealth have been met with some success. The [[Google Glass breastfeeding app trial|Australian hands-free breastfeeding Google Glass application]] reported promising results in 2014. This application made in collaboration with the Australian Breastfeeding Association and a tech startup called [[Small World Social]], helped new mothers learn how to [[Breastfeeding|breastfeed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hlntv.com/article/2014/04/23/breastfeeding-google-glass-app?sr=fb042414breastfeed10photolink.|title=Google Glass can help you breastfeed|last=|first=|date=2014|website=|publisher=HLN Staff|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/breastfeeding-and-google-glass-application-trial|title=Breastfeeding and Google Glass application trial|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=The Australian Breastfeeding Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smallworldsocial.com/breastfeeding-support-project/.|title=Breastfeeding Support Program Through Gooogle Glass|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|publisher=Small World|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breastfeeding is beneficial to infant health and [[maternal health]] and is recommended by the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]] and health organisations all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/9241595230/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Evidence on the long-term effects of breastfeeding|website=www.who.int|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Victora|first=Cesar G.|last2=Bahl|first2=Rajiv|last3=Barros|first3=Aluísio J.

When the trial ended, all participants were reported to be confident in breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== Health care quality  ===
{{See also|Health care quality|l1=Health Care Quality}}

Theoretically, the whole health system stands to benefit from telehealth. In a UK telehealth trial done in 2011, it was reported that the cost of health could be dramatically reduced with the use of telehealth monitoring. The usual cost of [[in vitro fertilisation]] (IVF) per cycle would be around $15,000, with telehealth it was reduced to $800 per patient.&lt;ref&gt;Chausiaux O, Hayes J, Long C, Morris S, Williams G, Husheer S. Pregnancy Prognosis in Infertile Couples on the DuoFertility Programme Compared with In Vitro Fertilisation/Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection. European Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology 2011;6(2):92-94.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Alaska Federal Health Care Access Network|Alaska the Federal Health Care Access Network]] which connects 3,000 healthcare providers to communities, engaged in 160,000 telehealth consultations from 2001 and saved the state $8.5 million in travel costs for just [[Medicaid]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;The Innovations Exchange Team. Telehealth Improves Access and Quality of Care for Alaska Natives. 2013; Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/telehealth-improves-access-and-quality-care-alaska-natives&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; There are indications telehealth consumes fewer resources and requires fewer people to operate it with shorter training periods to implement initiatives.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

However, whether or not the standard of health care quality is increasing is quite debatable, with literature refuting such claims.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Bardsley M, Steventon A, Doll H. Impact of telehealth on general practice contacts: findings from the whole systems demonstrator cluster randomised trial.

BMJ 2013 Feb 26;346:f653.&lt;/ref&gt; Research is increasingly reporting that clinicians find the process difficult and complex to deal with.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders C, Rogers A, Bowen R, Bower P, Hirani S, Cartwright M, et al. Exploring barriers to participation and adoption of telehealth and telecare within the Whole System Demonstrator trial: a qualitative study. BMC Health Serv Res 2012 Jul 26;12:220-6963-12-220&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are concerns around informed consent, legality issues as well as legislative issues. Although health care may become affordable with the help of technology, whether or not this care will be "good" is the issue.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Economic evaluations ==
Due to its digital nature it is often assumed that telehealth saves the health system money. However, the evidence to support this is varied. When conducting economic evaluations of telehealth services, the individuals evaulating them need to be aware of potential outcomes and extraclinical benefits of the telehealth service&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snoswell|first=Centaine|last2=Smith|first2=Anthony C|last3=Scuffham|first3=Paul A|last4=Whitty|first4=Jennifer A|date=2016-10-27|title=Economic evaluation strategies in telehealth: Obtaining a more holistic valuation of telehealth interventions|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F1357633X16671407|journal=Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare|language=en|volume=23|issue=9|pages=792–796|doi=10.1177/1357633x16671407|issn=1357-633X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Nonclinical uses ==
* [[Distance education]] including continuing medical education, grand rounds, and patient education
* administrative uses including meetings among telehealth networks, supervision, and presentations
* research on telehealth
* online information and [[health data]] management
* healthcare system integration
* asset identification, listing, and patient to asset matching, and movement
* overall healthcare system management
* patient movement and remote admission

== Limitations and restrictions  ==

While many branches of medicine have wanted to fully embrace telehealth for a long time, there are certain risks and barriers which bar the full amalgamation of telehealth into [[best practice]]. For a start, it is dubious as to whether a practitioner can fully leave the "hands-on" experience behind.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Although it is predicted that telehealth will replace many consultations and other health interactions, it cannot yet fully replace a physical examination, this is particularly so in [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostics]], [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] or [[mental health]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

The benefits posed by telehealth challenge the normative means of healthcare delivery set in both legislation and practice. Therefore, the growing prominence of telehealth is starting to underscore the need for updated regulations, guidelines and legislation which reflect the current and future trends of healthcare practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Telehealth enables timely and flexible care to patients wherever they may be; although this is a benefit, it also poses threats to [[privacy]], [[safety]][[Medical license|, medical licensing]] and [[reimbursement]]. When a clinician and patient are in different locations, it is difficult to determine which laws apply to the context.&lt;ref&gt;Keck CS, Doarn CR. Telehealth technology applications in speech-language pathology. Telemed J E Health 2014 Jul;20(7):653-659.&lt;/ref&gt; Once healthcare crosses borders different state bodies are involved in order to regulate and maintain the level of care that is warranted to the patient or telehealth consumer. As it stands, telehealth is complex with many grey areas when put into practice especially as it crosses borders. This effectively limits the potential benefits of telehealth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

An example of these limitations include the current American reimbursement infrastructure, where [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] will reimburse for telehealth services only when a patient is living in an area where specialists are in shortage, or in particular rural counties. The area is defined by whether it is a medical facility as opposed to a patient's' home. The site that the practitioner is in, however, is unrestricted. Medicare will only reimburse live video (synchronous) type services, not store-and-forward, mhealth or remote patient monitoring (if it does not involve live-video). Some insurers currently will reimburse telehealth, but not all yet. So providers and patients must go to the extra effort of finding the correct insurers before continuing. Again in America, states generally tend to require that clinicians are licensed to practice in the surgery' state, therefore they can only provide their service if licensed in an area that they do not live in themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

More specific and widely reaching laws, legislations and regulations will have to evolve with the technology. They will have to be fully agreed upon, for example, will all clinicians need full licensing in every community they provide telehealth services too, or could there be a limited use telehealth licence? Would the limited use licence cover all potential telehealth interventions, or only some? Who would be responsible if an emergency was occurring and the practitioner could not provide immediate help – would someone else have to be in the room with the patient at all consult times? Which state, city or country would the law apply in when a breach or malpractice occurred? &lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Paul DL. Collaborative activities in virtual settings: A knowledge management perspective of telemedicine. J Manage Inf Syst 2006;22(4):143-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major legal action prompt in telehealth thus far has been issues surrounding online prescribing and whether an appropriate clinician-patient relationship can be established online to make prescribing safe, making this an area that requires particular scrutiny.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; It may be required that the practitioner and patient involved must meet in person at least once before online prescribing can occur, or that at least a live-video conference must occur, not just impersonal questionnaires or surveys to determine need.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;Cascella LM. Virtual Risk: An Overview of Telehealth From a Risk Management Perspective. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical issues ==
{{see also|Informed consent|Medical ethics}}

''[[Informed consent]]'' is another issue – should the patient give informed consent to receive online care before it starts? Or will it be implied if it is care that can only practically be given over distance? When telehealth includes the possibility for technical problems such as transmission errors or security breaches or storage which impact on ability to communicate, it may be wise to obtain informed consent in person first, as well as having backup options for when technical issues occur. In person, a patient can see who is involved in their care (namely themselves and their clinician in a consult), but online there will be other involved such as the technology providers, therefore consent may need to involve disclosure of anyone involved in the transmission of the information and the security that will keep their information private, and any legal malpractice cases may need to involve all of those involved as opposed to what would usually just be the practitioner.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

== The state of the market ==

The rate of adoption of telehealth services in any jurisdiction is frequently influenced by factors such as the adequacy and cost of existing conventional [[health care|health services]] in meeting [[patient|patient needs]]; the policies of governments and/or insurers with respect to coverage and payment for telehealth services; and medical licensing requirements that may inhibit or deter the provision of telehealth second opinions or primary consultations by physicians.

Projections for the growth of the telehealth market are optimistic, and much of this optimism is predicated upon the increasing demand for remote medical care.   According to a recent survey, nearly three-quarters of U.S. consumers say they would use telehealth.&lt;ref name="healthdata"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/telemedicine-38701-1.html|title=Survey: Consumers Keen on Telemedicine|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At present, several major companies along with a bevvy of startups are working to develop a leading presence in the field.

In the UK, the Government's Care Services minister, Paul Burstow, has stated that telehealth and telecare would be extended over the next five years (2012–2017) to reach three million people.

'''Thorotrast''' is a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] containing particles of the [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] compound [[thorium dioxide]], ThO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, that was used as a [[radiocontrast agent]] in [[medical radiography]] in the 1930s and 1940s. Use in some countries, such as the [[United States|U.S.]], continued into the 1950s.

[[Thorium]] compounds produce excellent images because of thorium's high opacity to X-rays (it has a high [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] for absorption). However, thorium is retained in the body, and it is radioactive, emitting harmful [[alpha radiation]] as it decays. Because the suspension offered high image quality and had virtually no immediate side-effects compared to the alternatives available at the time, Thorotrast became widely used after its introduction in 1931.  [[António Egas Moniz]] contributed to its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tondreau | first1 = R. | year = 1985 | title = Egas Moniz 1874-1955 | url = | journal = Radiographics | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 994–997 | doi=10.1148/radiographics.5.6.3916824 | pmid=3916824}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 2 to 10 million patients worldwide have been treated with Thorotrast. However, today it has shown an increase risk in certain cancers such as cholangiocarcinomas and angiosarcomas of the liver.

==Safety==
Even at the time of introduction, there was concern about the safety of Thorotrast. Following injection, the drug is distributed to the [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[lymph node]]s, and [[bone]], where it is absorbed. After this initial absorption, redistribution takes place at a very slow pace. Specifically, the [[biological half-life]] is estimated to be 22 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/thorium.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716163231/http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/thorium.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the organs of patients who have been given Thorotrast will be exposed to internal alpha radiation for the rest of their lives. The significance of this long-term exposure was not fully understood at the time of Thorotrast's introduction in 1931.

Due to the release of alpha particles, Thorotrast was found to be extremely carcinogenic. There is a high over-incidence of various cancers in patients who have been treated with Thorotrast. The cancers occur some years (usually 20-30) after injection of Thorotrast. The risk of developing [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] (or [[cholangiocarcinoma|bile duct cancer]]) in former Thorotrast patients has been measured to be well above 100 times the risk of the rest of the population. The risk of [[leukemia]] appears to be 20 times higher in Thorotrast patients.&lt;ref name=Kaick&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/3580117| issn = 0033-7587| volume = 152| issue = 6| pages = S64-S71| last = Kaick| first = Gerhard van|author2=Andreas Dalheimer |author3=Sakiko Hornik |author4=Alexander Kaul |author5=Dagmar Liebermann |author6=Hertha Lührs |author7=Andreas Spiethoff |author8=Kurt Wegener |author9=H. Wesch  | title = The German Thorotrast Study: Recent Results and Assessment of Risks| journal = [[Radiation Research]]| date = 1999-12-01| jstor = 3580117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thorotrast exposure has also been associated with the development of [[angiosarcoma]]. German patients exposed to Thorotrast had their median life-expectancy shortened by 14 years in comparison to a similar non-exposed control group.&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.ejca.2008.02.050| issn = 0959-8049| volume = 44| issue = 9| pages = 1259–1268| last = Becker| first = N|author2=D Liebermann |author3=H Wesch |author4=G Vankaick | title = Mortality among Thorotrast-exposed patients and an unexposed comparison group in the German Thorotrast study| journal = [[European Journal of Cancer]]| accessdate = 2011-04-30| date = June 2008| url = http://www.ejcancer.info/article/S0959-8049(08)00174-3/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorium is no longer used in X-ray contrast agents. Today, [[iodine|iodinated]] hydrophilic (water-soluble) molecules are universally used as injected contrast agents in X-ray procedures.

The [[Denmark|Danish]] director [[Nils Malmros]]'s movie, ''[[Facing the Truth (2002 film)|Facing the Truth]]'' (original [[Danish language|Danish]] title ''At Kende Sandheden'') from 2002, portrays the dilemma that faced Malmros's father, [[Richard Malmros]], when treating his patients in the 1940s. Richard Malmros was deeply concerned about the persistence of Thorotrast in the body but was forced to use Thorotrast, because the only available alternative ([[Propyliodone|per-abrodil]]) had serious immediate side-effects, suffered from image quality problems and was difficult to obtain during the [[Second World War]]. The use of Thorotrast in Denmark ended in 1947 when safer alternatives became available.

==Current use==
Thorotrast has also been used in research to stain neural tissue samples for examination by [[historadiography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 4593184 | volume=118 | issue=4 | title=Contact historadiography of nervous tissue impregnated with thorotrast |date=August 1973 | journal=Am J Roentgenol Radium Ther Nucl Med | pages=923–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
