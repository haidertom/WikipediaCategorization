'''Adrian Johnston''' is an American philosopher. He is a Professor in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of New Mexico]] at [[Albuquerque]] and a faculty member at the Emory Psychoanalytic Institute in [[Atlanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.unm.edu/people/faculty/profile/adrian-johnston.html|title=Adrian Johnston|work=unm.edu|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
Influenced by [[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek]] and his readings of [[German idealism]], Johnston’s work has gained many readers among those making the materialist and realist turns in [[Continental philosophy]].&lt;ref name="societyandspace.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://societyandspace.org/2013/10/07/on-4/|title=Interview with Adrian Johnston on Transcendental Materialism|work=Society and space|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston’s books are guided by his “transcendental materialism,” which in sum calls for a materialist ontology that nevertheless does not reduce away the gap or figure that is human subjectivity. Johnston argues for retooling [[Freud]] and [[Lacan]] after the success of the natural sciences in recent decades, but argues that both Freud and Lacan presaged a lot of these successes. Critical of the thinkers of immanence whom he believes, following [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], can only give us subjectless substance, Johnston’s work has brought [[Lacanianism]] into the 21st century when many wrongly claimed it died long before the end of the last.&lt;ref name="societyandspace.com"/&gt;

Johnston is the author of ''Time Driven: Metapsychology and the Splitting of the Drive'' (2005), ''Žižek’s Ontology: A Transcendental Materialist Theory of Subjectivity'' (2008), ''Badiou, Žižek, and Political Transformations: The Cadence of Change'' (2009), and ''Prolegomena to Any Future Materialism, Volume One: The Outcome of contemporary French Philosophy'' (2013), all published by Northwestern University Press. He is the co-author, with [[Catherine Malabou]], of ''Self and Emotional Life: Philosophy, Psychoanalysis, and Neuroscience'' (Columbia University Press, 2013).

Johnston's most recent book is ''Adventures in Transcendental Materialism: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2014) with Todd McGowan and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. He is also a co-editor of the book series ''Diaeresis'' at Northwestern University Press.

An '''afterword''' is a [[literary device]] that is often found at the end of a piece of [[literature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/afterword "afterword"]. Dictionary.com, LLC. Retrieved 10 August 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; It generally covers the story of how the book came into being, or of how the idea for the book was developed. 

An afterword may be written by someone other than the [[author]] of the book to provide enriching comment, such as discussing the work's historical or cultural context (especially if the work is being reissued many years after its original publication).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Pope| first = Geoff| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = "Foreword" Versus "Forward" | work = Grammar Girl's Quick and Dirty Tips| publisher = MacMillan Holdings, LLC| date = 18 November 2010| url = http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/forward-versus-foreword.aspx| format = | doi = | accessdate = 10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allusion''' is a [[figure of speech]], in which an object or circumstance from unrelated context is referenced covertly or indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=allusion {{!}} Definition of allusion in English by Oxford Dictionaries |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/allusion |website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A covert, implied or indirect reference" (''[[OED]]''); Carmela Perri explored the extent to which an allusion may be overt, in "On alluding" ''Poetics'' '''7''' (1978), and [[M. H. Abrams]] defined allusion as "a brief reference, explicit or indirect, to a person, place or event, or to another literary work or passage". (Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms'' 1971, ''s.v. "Allusion"'').&lt;/ref&gt; It is left to the audience to make the direct connection;&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Fowler, ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage''.&lt;/ref&gt; where the connection is directly and explicitly stated (as opposed to indirectly implied) by the author, it is instead usually termed a [[reference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/allusion|title=the definition of allusion|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reference|title=the definition of reference|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/allusion |title=Allusion |date=2015 |quote=allusion, in literature, an implied or indirect reference to a person, event, or thing or to a part of another text. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the arts, a literary allusion puts the alluded text in a new context under which it assumes new [[poetic function|meanings and denotations]].&lt;ref name="BenPorot76p107"/&gt; It is not possible to predetermine the nature of all the new meanings and inter-textual patterns that an allusion will generate.&lt;ref name="BenPorot76p107"/&gt; Literary allusion is closely related to [[parody]] and [[pastiche]], which are also "text-linking" [[literary device]]s.&lt;ref name="BenPorot76p107"&gt;Ben-Porot (1976) pp.107-8 quotation: {{quotation|The literary allusion is a device for the simultaneous activation of two texts. The activation is achieved through the manipulation of a special signal: a sign (simple or complex) in a given text characterized by an additional larger "referent." This referent is always an independent text. The simultaneous activation of the two texts thus connected results in the formation of intertextual patterns whose nature cannot be predetermined. ... The "free" nature of the intertextual patterns is the feature by which it would be possible to distinguish between the literary allusion and other closely related text-linking devices, such as parody and pastiche.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a wider, more informal context, an allusion is a passing or casually short statement indicating broader meaning. It is an incidental mention of something, either directly or by implication, such as "In the stock market, he met his Waterloo."

==Scope of the term==
[[File:NAMA Tablette 1287.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Backside of a clay tablet from [[Pylos]] bearing the motif of the [[Labyrinth]], an allusion to the mythological fight of [[Theseus#The myth of Theseus and the Minotaur|Theseus and the Minotaur]]]]

In the most traditional sense, ''allusion'' is a literary term, though the word has also come to encompass indirect references to any source, including allusions in [[film]] or the [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name="preminger"&gt;Preminger &amp; Brogan (1993) ''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics.'' Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, allusions are used to link concepts that the reader already has knowledge of, with concepts discussed in the story. In the field of film criticism, a film-maker's intentionally unspoken visual reference to another film is also called an [[Homage (arts)|homage]]. It may even be sensed that real events have allusive overtones, when a previous event is inescapably recalled by a current one. "Allusion is bound up with a vital and perennial topic in literary theory, the place of authorial intention in interpretation", William Irwin observed, in asking "What is an allusion?"&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, "What Is an Allusion?" ''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' '''59''' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the hearer or reader's comprehending the author's intention, an allusion becomes merely a decorative device. 
Allusion is an economical device, a [[figure of speech]] that uses a relatively short space to draw upon the ready stock of ideas, cultural [[meme]]s or emotion already associated with a topic. Thus, an allusion is understandable only to those with prior knowledge of the covert reference in question, a mark of their [[cultural literacy]].&lt;ref name="preminger"/&gt;

==Allusion as cultural bond==
The origin of ''allusion'' is in the Latin verb ''ludere, lusus est'' "to play with, jest."{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Recognizing the point of allusion's condensed riddle also reinforces cultural solidarity between the maker of the allusion and the hearer: their shared familiarity with allusion bonds them. Ted Cohen finds such a "cultivation of intimacy" to be an essential element of many [[jokes]].&lt;ref&gt;(Cohen, ''Jokes: Philosophical Thoughts on Joking Matters'' [University of Chicago Press] 1999:28f). Irwin 2001:note 8 noted the parallel.&lt;/ref&gt; Some aspect of the referent must be invoked and identified for the tacit association to be made; the allusion is indirect in part because "it depends on something more than mere substitution of a referent."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 2001:288&lt;/ref&gt;

The allusion depends as well on the author's intent; a reader may search out parallels to a figure of speech or a passage, of which the author was unaware, and offer them as unconscious allusions—coincidences that a critic might not find illuminating.{{dubious|date=April 2014}} Addressing such issues is an aspect of [[hermeneutics]].

William Irwin remarks that allusion moves in only one direction: "If A alludes to B, then B does not allude to A. The Bible does not allude to Shakespeare, though Shakespeare may allude to the Bible." Irwin appends a note: "Only a divine author, outside of time, would seem capable of alluding to a later text."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 2001:289 and note 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the basis for Christian readings of [[Bible prophecy|Old Testament prophecy]], which asserts that passages are to be read as allusions to future events due to Jesus's revelation in {{Bibleref|Luke|24:25-27|TNIV}}.

Allusion differs from the similar term [[intertextuality]] in that it is an intentional effort on the author's part.&lt;ref name="preminger"/&gt; The success of an allusion depends in part on at least some of its audience "getting" it. Allusions may be made increasingly obscure, until at last they are understood by the author alone, who thereby retreats into a [[private language]] (e.g. "Ulalume", by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]).

==Academic analysis of the concept of allusions==
In discussing the richly allusive poetry of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]'', R. F. Thomas&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Thomas, "Virgil's ''Georgics'' and the art of reference" ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology '' '''90''' (1986) pp 171–98.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished six categories of allusive reference, which are applicable to a wider cultural sphere. These types are:
# ''' Casual Reference''', "the use of language which recalls a specific antecedent, but only in a general sense" that is relatively unimportant to the new context;
# ''' Single Reference''', in which the hearer or reader is intended to "recall the context of the model and apply that context to the new situation"; such a specific single reference in Virgil, according to Thomas, is a means of "making connections or conveying ideas on a level of intense subtlety";
# ''' Self-Reference''', where the ''locus'' is in the poet's own work;
# ''' Corrective Allusion''', where the imitation is clearly in opposition to the original source's intentions;
# ''' Apparent Reference''' "which seems clearly to recall a specific model but which on closer inspection frustrates that intention"; and
# ''' Multiple Reference''' or '''Conflation''', which refers in various ways simultaneously to several sources, fusing and transforming the cultural traditions.

A type of literature has grown round explorations of the allusions in such works as [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' or [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]''.

==Examples==
In [[Homer]], brief allusions could be made to mythic themes of generations previous to the main narrative because they were already familiar to the epic's hearers: one example is the theme of the [[Calydonian Boar|Calydonian boarhunt]]. In [[Hellenistic]] Alexandria, literary culture and a fixed [[literary canon]] known to readers and hearers made a densely allusive poetry effective; the poems of [[Callimachus]] offer the best-known examples.

[[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], alluded to the [[Gettysburg Address]] in starting his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech by saying 'Five score years ago..."; his hearers were immediately reminded of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s "Four score and seven years ago", which opened the Gettysburg Address. King's allusion effectively called up parallels in two historic moments without overwhelming his speech with details.

A [[sobriquet]] is an allusion. By [[metonymy]] one aspect of a person or other referent is selected to identify it, and it is this shared aspect that makes a sobriquet evocative: for example, "the city that never sleeps" is a sobriquet of (and therefore an allusion to) New York.

An allusion may become trite and stale through unthinking overuse, devolving into a mere [[cliché]], as is seen in some of the sections below.

===15 minutes of fame===
[[Andy Warhol]], a 20th-century American artist most famous for his [[pop-art]] images of [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell soup]] cans and of [[Marilyn Monroe]], commented on the explosion of media coverage by saying, "In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes."
Today, when someone receives a great deal of media attention for something fairly trivial, and he or she is said to be experiencing his or her "[[15 minutes of fame]]", that is an allusion to Andy Warhol's famous remark.

===Lot's Wife/Pillar of Salt===
According to the Book of Genesis, God destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, but Lot, the nephew of Abraham, was given time to escape with his family before the destruction. God commanded Lot and his family not to look back as they fled. Lot's wife disobeyed and looked back, and she was immediately turned into a pillar of salt as punishment for her disobedience.

An allusion to Lot's wife or to a pillar of salt is usually a reference to someone who unwisely chooses to look back once he or she has begun on a course of action or to someone who disobeys an explicit rule or command.

===Cassandra===
In [[Greek mythology]], [[Cassandra]], the daughter of [[Troy|Trojan]] king [[Priam]], was loved by [[Apollo]], who gave her the gift of [[prophecy]]. When Cassandra later angered Apollo, he altered the gift so that her prophecies, while true, would not be believed. Thus, her accurate warnings to the Trojans were disregarded, and disaster befell them.

Today, a "Cassandra" refers to someone who predicts disasters or negative results, especially to someone whose predictions are disregarded.

===Catch-22===
This phrase comes from a novel by [[Joseph Heller]]. ''[[Catch-22]]'' is set on a [[U.S. Army Air Force]] base in [[World War II]]. "Catch-22" refers to a regulation that states an airman's request to be relieved from flight duty can only be granted if he is judged to be insane. However, anyone who does not want to fly dangerous missions is obviously sane, thus, there is no way to avoid flying the missions.

Later in the book the old woman in Rome explains that Catch-22 means "They can do whatever they want to do." This refers to the theme of the novel in which the authority figures consistently abuse their powers, leaving the consequences to those under their command. &lt;!--unnecessarily obscure:Catch-22 as it is currently construed is a misnomer as is "[[Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle]]" which is actually "[[Schrodinger's cat]]". (This puts those who know the difference in a double bind but not a Catch-22.)--&gt;

In common speech, "catch-22" has come to describe any absurd or [[no-win situation]].

===T. S. Eliot===
The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot]] is often described as "allusive", because of his habit of referring to names, places or images that may only make sense in the light of prior knowledge. This technique can add to the experience, but for the uninitiated can make Eliot's work seem dense and hard to decipher.

===James Joyce===
The most densely allusive work in modern English may be ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' by [[James Joyce]]. [[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Henry Morton Robinson]] wrote ''[[A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake]]'' (1944) that unlocked some of Joyce's most obscure allusions.

'''Anxiety/Uncertainty Management''' ('''AUM''') theory was introduced by William B. Gudykunst to define how humans effectively communicate based on their balance of anxiety and uncertainty in social situations.&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theorizing About Intercultural Communication|last=Gudykunst|first=William B.|date=2005|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|isbn=9780761927495|editor-last=|editor-first=|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} Gudykunst believed that in order for successful [[intercultural|intercultural communication]] a reduction in anxiety/uncertainty must occur. This is assuming that one person within the intercultural encounter is a stranger. AUM is a theory based on the [[Uncertainty Reduction Theory]] (URT) which was introduced by Berger and Calabrese in 1974.&lt;ref name="Berger&amp;Calabrese"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Charles R.|last2=Calabrese|first2=Richard J.|date=1975-12-01|title=Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication|journal=Human Communication Research|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=99–112|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1975.tb00258.x|issn=1468-2958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Mitchell R.|last2=Wiseman|first2=Richard L.|last3=Rasmussen|first3=J.

==Differences between URT/AUM and the introduction of anxiety==

URT is based on the human's thought process and their approach to social situation in which they have uncertainty. URT suggests that uncertainty stems from the human's attempts to "[proactively predict] ''the other's attitudes, values, feelings, beliefs and behaviors''"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; during social encounters. Humans attempt to reduce their uncertainty in social encounters when there is a motivation to do so,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; URT highlights three core motivations; they anticipate other social interaction at another point in time, the recipient has something the human needs or wants as a form of reward and/or the recipient is acting in a strange or deviant which is unexpected.&lt;ref name="Berger2"&gt;Berger, C. 1979. ''The contact hypothesis in ethnic relations''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

Berger identified 7 axioms and 21 theorems within URT&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (theoretical statements which are generally excepted, but can be used to observe behaviours to be further proved&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/theorem|title=the definition of theorem|last=|first=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with these theorems providing the inspiration for a multitude of expansions to the theory, one of which is AUM. AUM uses the foundations of URT to formulate 47 axioms, with AUM integrating the human anxiety management within social situations, as well as their uncertainty management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; AUM builds on URT's focus on individual or one-to-one communication, as the axioms and theorems focus on intercultural and intergroup communications.&lt;ref name="Gudykunst3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Young Yun|last2=Gudykunst|first2=William B.|date=1988|title=Cross-Cultural Adaptation: Current Approaches.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED351737|journal=International and Intercultural Communication Annual|language=en|volume=11|pages=|issn=0270-6075|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

AUM incorporates both the URT and the works of Stephan and Stephan on anxiety within his axioms to expand URT to explain intergroup communications.&lt;ref name="Stephan&amp;Stephan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephan|first=Walter G.|last2=Stephan|first2=Cookie White|date=1985-10-01|title=Intergroup Anxiety|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=157–175|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1985.tb01134.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt; AUM focuses on both anxiety and uncertainty reduction, this highlights the major difference between URT and AUM, with the intended outcome of URT being simply to reduce [[uncertainty]], whereas AUM's outcome was for cultural adaptation and not solely the reduction of uncertainty. The inherent difference is that managing anxiety is to maintain it between minimum and maximum thresholds along a spectrum while reducing anxiety is unidirectional. This realization, along with the introduction of [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] as a factor of effective communication, led Gudykunst to finally designate an appropriate name for his research: Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory (AUM).

Gudykunst assumed that at least one person in an intercultural encounter is a stranger. He argues that strangers undergo both anxiety and uncertainty; they don’t feel secure and they aren’t sure how to behave. Gudykunst noted that strangers and in-group members experience some degree of anxiety and uncertainty in any new interpersonal situation, but when the encounter takes place between people of different cultures, strangers are hyperaware of cultural differences. They then tend to overestimate the effect of cultural identity on the behavior of people in an alien society, while blurring individuals’ distinctions.

The purpose of the first iteration of AUM was to be a practical application with a high degree of utility. The format of AUM includes numerous [[axioms]], which in turn converge on one another moving in the direction of effective communication. (See Figure X). The specific number of [[axioms]] has varied over the last fifteen years according to updated research in the field of cross-cultural communication.

==Scope of AUM==
Communication theories commonly focus on 4 levels: [[individual]], [[interpersonal]], [[intergroup]], and [[cultural]].&lt;ref name="Doise"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/levels-of-explanation-in-social-psychology/oclc/13004532|title=Levels of explanation in social psychology|last=Doise|first=Willem|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press ; Editions de la Maison des Sciences de l'Homme|isbn=978-0521307482|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]; New York; Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

• The [[individual]] level is the motivation for human communication, influencing the ways humans create and interpret messages (for example the need for group inclusion and self-concept support).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

• The [[interpersonal]] level is the way the message is exchanged when humans are communicating as an individual (for example one-on-one communication, intimate relationships and social networks).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

• The [[intergroup]] level is the exchange of messages when humans are communicating as a collective (for example social identities, collective self-esteem).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

• The [[cultural]] level is how people communicate similarly or differently dependant on their culture (for example dimensions of cultural variability).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

AUM focuses on interpersonal and intergroup levels of communication, with Gudykunst's [[axioms]] fitting into either the interpersonal or the intergroup categories. AUM discriminates between interpersonal and intergroup communications by examining predictions of behaviour. If the behaviour can be explained with cultural norms or with sociological norms, it can be classified as intergroup communication. When the behavior is best explained by psychological factors it is likely interpersonal communication. A second effective differentiator is to examine the identities that guide human behavior. When our behavior is guided by personal or human factors, interpersonal behaviors tend to occur. When it is guided by social factors the opposite is true.

==Working assumptions==
Complex theories such as AUM need to accept certain assumptions as true before the real content can be explored. Some metatheoretical assumptions Gudykunst makes on AUM are on the nature of reality, the way we gain knowledge, and the basis of human behavior. Gudykunst assumes that the basic processes of communication are the same across cultures; only the methods of interpretation vary. Also, he assumes these interpretations are how we gain data to create theories. Finally, and vital to AUM, he assumes that when humans are mindful they have greater control over their communications behaviors. This aspect of human nature is sometimes referred to as determinism.

Gudykunst also employs several theoretical assumptions. The first is that strangers will trigger both interpersonal and intergroup anxiety. The perspective he takes for the sake of developing axioms is that of the stranger immersed in an ingroup.

Another assumption deals with the concept of uncertainty. Gudykunst assumes that when uncertainty falls between an individual's minimum and maximum acceptable levels, effective communication will then take place. The maximum threshold is defined as the amount of uncertainty that we can possess and still comfortably predict the behavior of a stranger. Uncertainty above the minimum threshold keeps us from getting bored with the stranger and hence constraining communication.

[[Anxiety]] for the purposes of anxiety/uncertainty management can be described as an apprehension based on the fear of negative consequences. It is more prevalent in intergroup relations because there is an added fear of appearing [[prejudiced]] when dealing with an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]. Similar to uncertainty, Gudykunst postulates that effective communication relies on managing anxiety between minimum and maximum thresholds. Once we reach our upper limit for anxiety, virtually all of our attention focuses on its source and not on effective communication. The concept of managing levels anxiety can be compared to managing [[eustress]] and [[Distress (medicine)|distress]] to achieve optimum performance. The positive benefit of the optimum amount of anxiety is trust, or "confidence that one will find what is desired from another rather than what is feared"&lt;ref name="Deutsch"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/45409297|title=The Resolution of Conflict : Constructive and Destructive Processes|last=Deutsch|first=Morton|date=1973|publisher=New Haven : Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300016833|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} The negative consequence is avoidance. If we are overcome by anxiety we will simply choose not to communicate.

Another term needing a working definition for the purpose of anxiety/uncertainty management is "effective communication". Simply put, effective communication is the extent to which a message is interpreted by its recipient with the intended meaning from the sender. Communication is more effective when both the sender and receiver use the same frames of reference. However, in [[intercultural communication]] this is often untrue and interactions with strangers can in turn prove more difficult.

Finally, the mechanism around which anxiety/uncertainty management revolves is [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]]. When people communicate mindlessly, they tend to utilize broad categories and [[stereotypes]] to predict behavior. As mindfulness increases, the categories become more specific and typically more accurate predictors. Since being mindful makes us open to more information we are more likely to correctly identify the receiver's frame of interpretation.

Mindfulness refers to a conscious choice rather than scripted behavior. Em Griffin, author of the Communication book; "A First Look At Communication Theory" and Professor Emeritus of Communications at Wheaton College in Illinois defines mindfulness as "the way that in-group members and strangers can reduce their anxiety and uncertainty to optimum levels".&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Scripted behavior serves us well in familiar situations, but not in cross-cultural communication. William Howell suggests four levels of communication competence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

* '''Unconscious incompetence:''' We are unaware that we're misinterpreting others' behavior.
* '''Conscious incompetence:''' We know that we're misinterpreting others' behavior but don't do anything about it.
* '''Conscious competence:''' We think about our communication and continually work to become more effective.
* '''Unconscious competence:''' Our communication skills are automatic.

Gudykunst defined mindfulness as stage three (Conscious competence), in Howell's model. In this stage cognitive choice moderates the destructive force of doubt or fear. The last stage (Unconscious competence), is less competent than stage three and can quickly shift into oblivious incompetence. Mindfulness involves the creation of new categories, a new process of thinking, and formation of a kin which reinforces Delia's description of how a cognitively complex person uses a lot of interpersonal constructs.

==Theory constructions==
[[File:Anxiety-Uncertainty Management Theory - Graphical Representation.svg|thumb|Schematic describing Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory]]
Gudykunst uses two types of theoretical statements to construct his theory; axioms and theorems. Axioms are "propositions that involve variables that are taken to be directly linked causally; axioms should therefore be statements that imply direct causal links among variables"&lt;ref name="Blalock"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/25192027|title=Theory construction : from verbal to mathematical formulations|last=Blalock|first=Hubert M|date=1969|publisher=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. : Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0139133435|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} Some axioms do not apply in all situations. Boundary conditions specify when the axioms hold. The axioms can be combined to derive theorems. When combined the axioms and theorems form a "casual process" theory&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;Reynolds, P. D. 1971.{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primer in theory construction. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc. that explains effective communication.{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2018}} Dialectical processes influence much of our communication within specific interactions. To illustrate, uncertainty involves a dialectic between predictability and novelty. In the current version of the theory, dialectics are incorporated as boundary conditions for the axioms where applicable.

Gudykunst states that in generating the axioms for the theory he assumed that managing anxiety and uncertainty are “basic causes” influencing effective communication. Other variables (e.g. self-concepts, motivation, reactions to strangers, social categorization, situational processes, connections with strangers, ethical interactions, anxiety, uncertainty, mindfulness and effective communication), are treated as "superficial causes" of effective communication. The influence of these “superficial causes” on effective communication is mediated through anxiety and uncertainty. Being mindful allows us to engage in anxiety and uncertainty management.

Gudykunst uses 47 [[axioms]] as building blocks for the theorems of AUM. Axioms can be thought of as the lowest common denominators from which all causal theorems are derived.

==Self-concepts==
Axioms one through five all relate to our views of ourselves, or self-concepts. Gudykunst includes personal identities, social identities, and collective self-esteem in this category. Social identities are employed when we try to predict intergroup behavior and personal identities are naturally employed for interpersonal behavior. They both act in such a way as to help us manage uncertainty and anxiety by sufficiently predicting behavior. If either of these identities feels threatened, Gudykunst believes that we will attempt to raise collective self-esteem and hence fostering a more positive outcome. The greater our self-esteem, the better we are able to manage our anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth and Death of Meaning: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on the Problem of Man.|last=Ernest.|first=Becker|date=1972|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe|isbn=978-0029021903|location=|pages=|oclc=651907062}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Motivation==
Gudykunst's next set of axioms suggest that our motivation to interact with strangers is directly related to the fulfillment of needs. First, we have a need to trust others to behave favorably or at least in an expected manner. Second, and only in the context of intergroup relations, we need to feel inclusion with the group or anxiety will surely develop. Paradoxically, the third need that Gudykunst points out is our need for self-concept confirmation. We want to be included in the group, but not to the extent that our identity is lost in the crowd.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Reactions to strangers==
We tend to act more favorably toward strangers whose mannerisms and beliefs converge with our own. In this case, we have a greater propensity to exhibit empathy, tolerate more ambiguity, and have a less rigid social posture when seeking closure. A rigid attitude, or close-minded thinking, leads us to seek closure to an interaction in the most direct way possible. If we were to exhibit [[empathy]] and attempt to think more objectively about the perspective of the stranger, we should in turn be postured to accept more ambiguity and seek the most appropriate solution instead of the most direct.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Social categorization of strangers==
The next seven axioms of this theory focus on how people order their social environments into categories. When people categorize themselves, they become aware of being members of [[ingroup]]s and [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]s, which generates [[anxiety]] and [[uncertainty]]. People tend to have more categories for their ingroup than they do for an outgroup, but the more familiar they are with an outgroup, the more categories they see. The categories that people create for outgroups will lead to expectations about the behavior of a member of that group, which can be either positive or negative. Expectations then help people predict, accurately or inaccurately, a stranger's behavior.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Situational processes==
The next four [[axioms]] are based on the situations in which communication occurs. People have different [[behavioral script|scripts]] they expect to follow for a given situation, much like actors may follow a [[movie script]]. Miscommunication occurs when people follow a script they assume the stranger with whom they are communicating to be familiar. People also react to strangers differently based on the conditions in which they interact. For example, cooperation was found to lead to positive feelings towards those one is working with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/276646|title=Cooperation: the basis of sociability|last=Argyle|first=Michael|date=1991|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415035453|location=London ; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People also tend to have less anxiety when there are other members of their ingroups present. Power also affects communication, and a person who feels they have less power than the stranger in an interaction will feel more anxiety towards that interaction.

==Connections with strangers==
The next five axioms are based on connections between people. What the axioms come to is the more connected people feel to strangers, the less [[anxiety]] and [[uncertainty]] they feel in communicating with them. These connections come from [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]], [[interdependence]], levels of [[intimacy]], and number of the same people both communicators know.

==Ethical interactions==
The next three axioms are based on [[dignity]] and [[respect]]. Both dignity and respect are assumed to be returned when given to a stranger. This leads to moral inclusiveness, which is good for interactions with strangers because both sides expect the rules of fair play to apply to them. When strangers are considered morally excluded, they are treated almost as nonexistent, or as not deserving of respect or dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Opotow|first=Susan|date=1990-04-01|title=Moral Exclusion and Injustice: An Introduction|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1990.tb00268.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral inclusiveness applies not only to communication, but also to bystanders not actively involved in communication with strangers. For example, if a person makes an anti-[[prejudice]] statement, the people he or she is with are less likely to make a [[prejudiced]] statement towards a stranger.

==Anxiety, uncertainty, mindfulness, and effective communication==
Langer states that mindfulness involves creating new categories, an openness to new information, and being aware of strangers' perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindfulness|last=Langer|first=Ellen J.|date=1989|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub. Co|isbn=978-0201523416|location=Reading, Mass.|pages=|oclc=18779775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness is essential for effective communication and one needs to develop mindful ways of learning about strangers. Langer concludes that this should involve: openness to "novelty", awareness of distinctions, being sensitive to different contexts, an awareness of multiple perspectives, and an orientation to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The power of mindful learning|last=Langer|first=Ellen J.|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=978-0738219080|edition=|location=Boston, MA|pages=|oclc=914195352}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, strangers are usually more mindful and able to "negotiate potentially problematic social interactions more effectively" than ingroup members.&lt;ref&gt;Devine, P., Evett, S., &amp; Vasquez-Suson, K. (1996). "Exploring the interpersonal dynamics of intergroup contact". In R. Sorrentino &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), ''Handbook of motivation and cognition''. (Vol 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;423–464). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ingroup members should be mindful of the process of communicating as opposed to being mindful of the outcome of the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theorizing about intercultural communication|last=Gudykunst|first=William B.|date=2005|publisher=Sage|others=|isbn=9780761927495|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|pages=305|oclc=55800766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following five axioms are essential for effective communication because they focus on the basic causes and processes of effective communication whereas the previous 34 axioms focused on managing our anxiety and uncertainty when communicating with strangers.

==Cross-cultural variability in AUM processes==
Gudykunst believes that for the theory to be complete there must be a cultural level of analysis included and that the axioms regarding cultural variability should only be tested on the cultural level. It is necessary to address cross-cultural variability in the major components of the theory because different types of anxiety are emphasized more in some cultures than in others. This is because there are differences in the dynamics of stranger-ingroup relationships across cultures. For example, Triandis offers that collectivist cultures tend to make a stronger distinction between ingroup and outgroup members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individualism And Collectivism|authorlink1=Harry C.

==Critique==
There are many ways AUM theory can be applied. It can be effective in studying the behavior of a stranger adjusting to a new culture, as well as in examining how individuals communicate with strangers and often accurately predict their behavior; this is done when we are mindful. Gudykunst explains that some axioms can be combined to form theorems. These theorems that are generated might be consistent with previous research, while others might be useful for future study. He notes that not all axioms can be combined to form a new theorem. Huber and Sorrentino&lt;ref name="Huber"&gt;Huber, G., &amp; Sorrentino, R. (1996). ''Uncertainty in interpersonal and intergroup relations.'' In R. Sorrentino &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), ''Handbook of motivation and cognition'' (Vol. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;591–619). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} differentiate between certainty–oriented individuals and uncertainty-oriented individuals and argue that theories of interpersonal and intergroup relations have an "uncertainty orientation" bias. Gudykunst gives three reasons why AUM theory is not limited to uncertainty-oriented individuals. First, uncertainty-orientation is incorporated into the theory. Second, the superficial causes or factors that influence our uncertainty in a situation influence the amount of uncertainty we feel. Lastly, our personality characteristics influence our behavior only when we are not mindful. Gudykunst also defends the number of axioms in the theory because when the goal of a theory is to improve communication, one cannot afford to be vague. Gudykunst acknowledges that there are certain areas where additional research is needed. For instance, one cannot always be mindful when communicating. Potential problems then refer to the recognition of instances in which mindfulness is needed and defining the optimal levels of anxiety or uncertainty. Future research needs to develop ways to measure an individual's minimum and maximum thresholds of uncertainty and anxiety in the same way that anxiety and uncertainty are measured. AUM theory is in a constant state of revision and even the current version of the theory is not complete.

===Critiques by Griffin and Ting-Toomey ===
Griffin identifies the complexity of the AUM theory as a weakness arguing, "hypothetically, the 47 axioms could spawn over a thousand theorems."&lt;ref name="Critique"&gt;.{{Cite journal|last=Yoshitake|first=M.|date=2002|title=Anxiety/uncertainty management (AUM) theory: A critical examination of an intercultural communication theory|url=https://web.uri.edu/iaics/files/13-Masaki-Yoshitake.pdf|journal=Intercultural Communication Studies|volume=11|pages=177–193|via=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Potential expansion of the axioms as a result of incorporation of more cultural variability indicates the possibility of causing greater confusion and complication.

Ting-Toomey explores the content of AUM theory as a potential weakness demanding further revision of the theories. She points out five conceptual issues in relation to URT and the social penetration theory.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

''' Conceptual issues of URT and Social Penetration Theory:'''&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;
## the need for motivational factors and other variables of the host side that influence the uncertainty reduction process;
## the lack of attention to relational changes;
## the necessity of actual research on dyadic effect of reciprocity;
## the inevitability of integration of more contextual dimensions into the theories and research;

===Limited focus: effective communication===
[[File:Anxiety-Uncertainty Management Theory - Critique.svg|thumb|Visual representation of Yoshitake's critique of AUM theory.]]

The AUM theory regards effective communication as a primary construct, defining effective communication as the attribution of the closest meaning to incoming messages as intended by the sender which would minimise misunderstanding. This view leads to two potential problems as the definition of effective communication and effective communication as the goal of ICC.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Problem of the definition of effective communication===
There are various reasons for human communication which lead to questioning the possibility and the necessity of attributing the closest meaning to such great variety of communication situations. The AUM theory regards effective communication as attribution of the closest  meaning to the intended meaning diminishes communication mechanical and linear activity "where messages are transferred from sender to receiver".&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Problem of effective communication as a goal of ICC===

AUM theory defines the goal of effective communication as the decrease of miscommunication. Such perspective on communication is mechanical with little emotional attachment, regarding pure communication without misattribution as ideal. As great importance is given to efficiency, culture is referred to as “noise” that obstructs the smooth transition of communication.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Excessive reliance on consciousness===
Anxiety/uncertainty management theory has been criticised for its heavy focus on the person being mindful during communications, with there being an assumption that a person should have to adopt a high level of consciousness throughout communication. However the theory is difficult to apply to instances where a person is compelled by emotion or irrationality, which overrides conscious thought to reach an end goal during communication.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Meta-theoretical critique===
The meta-theoretical assumptions specific to Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory have been critiqued by Masaki Yoshitake of the University of Oklahoma, who suggests that anxiety/uncertainty management theory is inherently inefficient when attempting to describe a universal experience shared between strangers and members of different cultures. Yoshitake states that it is questionable whether interpersonal communication is really a pure form of communication and suggests a difficulty to determine what is in the mind of a person from another culture altogether. Yoshitake asserts that pure communication never exists in the first place, as every attempt to share a direct experience is mitigated by the limitations of a person's own perceptions. This results in an ever-present "otherness" in communication. Such commentary is a product of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] thought.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

Culture consists of the social behaviour and norms in human societies transmitted through social learning.&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011/&gt; Arthropods play many roles in human culture, including as food, in art, in stories, and in mythology and religion. Many of these [[Insects in culture|concern insects]], which are important both economically and symbolically, from the work of [[honeybee]]s to the [[scarab (artifact)|scarabs]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Other [[arthropods]] with cultural significance include [[crustaceans]] such as [[crab]]s, [[lobster]]s, and [[crayfish]], which are popular subjects in art, especially [[still life]]s, and [[arachnids]] such as [[spider]]s and [[scorpion]]s, whose [[venom]] has medical applications.

[[Crustacean]]s are an important source of food, providing nearly 10,700,000&amp;nbsp;[[ton]]s in 2007; the vast majority of this output is of [[Decapoda|decapods]]: [[crab]]s, [[lobster]]s, [[shrimp]]s, [[crayfish]], and [[Dendrobranchiata|prawns]]. Over 60% by weight of all crustaceans caught for consumption are shrimp and prawns, and nearly 80% is produced in Asia, with China alone producing nearly half the world's total. Non-decapod crustaceans are not widely consumed, with only 118,000&amp;nbsp;tons of [[krill]] being caught, despite krill having one of the greatest [[Biomass (ecology)|biomasses]] on the planet.&lt;ref name=FAOstats&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/TabLandArea?tb_ds=Production&amp;tb_mode=TABLE&amp;tb_act=SELECT&amp;tb_grp=COUNTRY |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |accessdate=February 24, 2010 |title=FIGIS: Global Production Statistics 1950–2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nicol&gt;{{cite book |author1=Steven Nicol |author2=Yoshinari Endo |url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/003/W5911E/W5911E00.HTM |series=Fisheries Technical Paper |volume=367 |title=Krill Fisheries of the World |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |year=1997 |isbn=978-92-5-104012-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crabs make up 20% of all marine crustaceans caught, farmed, and consumed worldwide, amounting to 1.5&amp;nbsp;million [[tonne]]s annually. One species, ''[[Portunus trituberculatus]]'', accounts for one-fifth of that total. Other commercially important [[taxon|taxa]] include ''[[Portunus pelagicus]]'', several species in the genus ''[[Chionoecetes]]'', the blue crab (''[[Callinectes sapidus]]''), [[Charybdis (genus)|''Charybdis'' spp.]], ''[[Edible crab|Cancer pagurus]]'', the [[Dungeness crab]] (''Metacarcinus magister''), and ''[[Scylla serrata]]'', each of which yields more than 20,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/TabLandArea?tb_ds=Capture&amp;tb_mode=TABLE&amp;tb_act=SELECT&amp;tb_grp=COUNTRY |title=Global Capture Production 1950-2004 |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |accessdate=August 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobsters are caught using [[lobster trap|baited, one-way traps]] with a colour-coded marker buoy to mark cages. Lobster is fished in water between {{convert|1|and|500|fathom|m|sigfig=1|disp=flip}}, although some lobsters live at {{convert|2000|fathom|m|disp=flip}}.

==In science and engineering==

Insects feature in a variety of ways in [[biomimicry]], where for example the cooling system of [[termite]] mounds has been imitated  in [[architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Termite research |url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/turner/termitePages/termiteMain.html |publisher=esf.edu |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spider]] [[venom]]s may be a less polluting alternative to conventional [[pesticide]]s, as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to [[vertebrate]]s. Australian [[Australian funnel-web spider|funnel web spiders]] are a promising source, as most of the world's insect pests have had no opportunity to develop any [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to their venom, and funnel web spiders thrive in captivity and are easy to "milk". It may be possible to target specific pests by [[genetic engineering|engineering]] genes for the production of spider [[toxin]]s into [[virus]]es that infect species such as [[cotton bollworm (disambiguation)|cotton bollworm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Spider Venom Could Yield Eco-Friendly Insecticides | publisher=National Science Foundation (USA)| url=https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100676&amp;org=NSF |accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bereavement in Judaism''' ({{Hebrew Name 1|אֲבֵלוּת|avelut|[[mourning]]}}) is a combination of ''[[minhag]]'' and ''[[mitzvah]]'' derived from [[Judaism]]'s classical [[Torah]] and [[Rabbinical literature|rabbinic]] texts.  The details of observance and practice vary according to each [[Jews|Jewish]] community.

{{TOClimit|2}}

==Mourners==
In Judaism, the principal mourners are the first-degree relatives: parent, child, sibling, and spouse. There are some customs that are unique to an individual mourning a parent.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Isaac, A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice, Ktav Publishing House, 1979, page 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Halachot]] concerning mourning do not apply to those under thirteen years of age. Also, ''halachos'' of mourning do not apply when the deceased is aged 30 days or less.&lt;ref name=silverman /&gt;

==Upon receiving news of the passing==
Upon receiving the news of the passing, the following blessing is recited:

:&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;{{Hebrew paragraph|ברוך אתה [[Tetragrammaton|ה']] [[Elohim|אלוהינו]] מלך העולם, דיין האמת.}}&lt;/div&gt;
:Transliteration: ''Barukh atah Adonai Eloheinu melekh ha'olam, dayan ha-emet.''
:Translation: "Blessed are You, Lord, our God, King of the universe, the Judge of Truth [alt., the Just Judge]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/prayer.htm|title=Judaism 101: Prayers and Blessings|work=jewfaq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a custom of rending one's clothes at the moment one hears news of a passing. Another prevalent custom is to tear at the funeral so that the procedure is done properly.&lt;ref name="Klein, Isaac 1979, page 278"&gt;Klein, Isaac, A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice, Ktav Publishing House, 1979, page 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chevra kadisha==
The ''chevra kadisha'' (Hebrew: חברה קדישא "holy society") is a Jewish [[burial society]] usually consisting of volunteers, men and women, who prepare the deceased for proper Jewish burial.&lt;ref name=fG.Chev&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.jewish-funeral-guide.com/tradition/chevra-kadisha.htm
|title=Jewish Funeral Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their job is to ensure that the body of the deceased is shown proper respect, ritually cleansed, and shrouded.

Many local ''chevra kadishas'' in urban areas are affiliated with local [[synagogue]]s, and they often own their own burial plots in various local cemeteries. Some Jews pay an annual token membership fee to the ''chevra kadisha'' of their choice, so that when the time comes, the society will not only attend to the body of the deceased as befits Jewish law, but will also ensure burial in a plot that it controls at an appropriate nearby [[Jewish cemetery]].

If no [[gravedigger]]s are available, then it is additionally the function of the male society members to ensure that graves are dug. In [[Israel]], members of ''chevra kadishas'' consider it an honor to not only prepare the body for burial but also to dig the grave for a fellow Jew's body, particularly if the deceased was known to be a righteous person.

Many burial societies hold one or two annual fast days, especially the 7th day of Adar, Yartzeit of Moshe Rabbeinu.&lt;ref name=fG.Chev/&gt; and organize regular study sessions to remain up to date with the relevant articles of Jewish law.  In addition, most burial societies also support families during the ''[[Shiva (Judaism)|shiva]]'' (traditional week of mourning) by arranging [[Jewish services|prayer services]], preparing meals, and providing other services for the mourners.&lt;ref name=Syd.A&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.chevrakadishasydney.com |title=Sydney Chevra Kadisha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparing the body — Taharah===
There are three major stages to preparing the body for burial: washing (''rechitzah''), ritual purification (''taharah''), and dressing (''halbashah'').  The term ''taharah'' is used to refer both to the overall process of burial preparation, and to the specific step of ritual purification.

Prayers and readings from Torah, including [[Psalms]], [[Song of Songs]], [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], and [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] are recited.

The general sequence of steps for performing ''taharah'' is as follows.

# The body (''guf'') is uncovered (it has been covered with a sheet awaiting ''taharah'').
# The body is washed carefully. Any bleeding is stopped and all blood is buried along with the deceased. The body is thoroughly cleaned of dirt, body fluids, and solids, and anything else that may be on the skin. All jewelry is removed. The beard (if present) is '''not''' shaved.
# The body is purified with water, either by immersion in a ''[[mikveh]]'' or by pouring a continuous stream of 9 kavim (usually 3 buckets) in a prescribed manner.
# The body is dried (according to most customs).
# The body is dressed in traditional burial clothing (''[[tachrichim]]''). A sash (''avnet'') is wrapped around the clothing and tied in the form of the Hebrew letter ''[[Shin (letter)|shin]],'' representing [[Shaddai (god)|one of the names of God]].
# The casket (''aron'') (if there is one) is prepared by removing any linings or other embellishments. A winding sheet (''sovev'') is laid into the casket. Outside the Land of Israel, if the deceased wore a prayer shawl (''[[tallit]]'') during their life, one is laid in the casket for wrapping the body once it is placed therein. One of the corner fringes (''[[tzitzit]]'') is removed from the shawl to signify that it will no longer be used for prayer and that the person is absolved from having to keep any of the ''mitzvot'' (commandments).
# The body is lifted into the casket and wrapped in the prayer shawl and sheet. Soil (''afar'') from [[Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]], if available, is placed over various parts of the body and sprinkled in the casket.
# The casket is closed.

After the closing of the casket, the ''chevra'' asks forgiveness of the deceased for any inadvertent lack of honor shown to the deceased in the preparation of the body for burial.

There is no viewing of the body and no open casket at the funeral. Sometimes the immediate family pay their final respects before the funeral.
In [[Israel]] caskets are not used at all, with the exception of military and state funerals. Instead, the body is carried to the grave wrapped in a ''tallit'' and placed directly in the earth. In the Diaspora, in general, a casket is only used if required by local law.

From death until burial, it is traditional for guards or [[Shemira|watchers]] (''shomrim'') to stay with the deceased. It is traditional to recite [[Psalms]] (''tehillim'') during this time.

==Funeral service==
The Jewish funeral consists of a burial, also known as an interment. Cremation is forbidden. Burial is considered to allow the body to decompose naturally, therefore [[embalming]] is forbidden. Burial is intended to take place in as short an interval of time after death as possible. Displaying of the body prior to burial does not take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/282548/jewish/The-Basics.htm |title=Death &amp; Mourning: The Basics}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soultalk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/282505/jewish/Soul-Talk.htm |title=Death &amp; Mourning: Soul Talk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flowers are usually not found at a traditional Jewish funeral but may be seen at statesmen's or heroes' funerals in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oztorah.com/2013/08/flowers-on-graves-ask-the-rabbi/ |title=Flowers on graves - Ask the Rabbi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, the Jewish funeral service usually commences at the burial ground. In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the funeral service commences either at a [[funeral home]] or at the [[cemetery]]. Occasionally the service will commence at a [[synagogue]]. In the case of a prominent individual, the funeral service can begin at a synagogue or a [[yeshivah]]. If the funeral service begins at a point other than at the cemetery, the entourage accompanies the body in a procession to the cemetery. Usually the funeral ceremony is brief and includes the recitation of psalms, followed by a eulogy, or ''hesped'' and finishes with a traditional closing prayer, the El Moley Rachamim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shermanschapel.com/the-jewish-funeral-ceremony.html|title=The Jewish Funeral Ceremony - Brooklyn Funeral Home|website=www.shermanschapel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral, the procession accompanying the body to the place of burial, and the burial, are referred to by the word ''levayah,'' meaning "escorting." ''Levayah'' also indicates "joining" and "bonding." This aspect of the meaning of ''levayah'' conveys the suggestion of a commonality among the souls of the living and the dead.&lt;ref name=soultalk /&gt;

[[Yemenite Jews]], prior to their immigration to the land of Israel, maintained an ancient practice during the funeral procession to halt at at least seven stations before the actual burial of the dead, beginning from the entrance of the house from whence the bier is taken, to the graveyard itself.  This has come to be known as ''Ma'amad u'Moshav'', (lit. "Standing and Sitting"), or "seven standings and sittings," and is mentioned in [[Tosefta]] ''Pesahim'' 2: 14-15, during which obsequies only men and boys thirteen years and older took part, but never women. At these stations, the bier is let down by the pallbearers upon the ground, and those accompanying will recite "''Hatzur Tamim Pe'ulo''," etc. "''Ana Bakoach''," etc., said in a doleful dirge-like melody, and which verses are followed by one of the party reading certain Midrashic literature and liturgical verse that speaks about death, and which are said to eulogize the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosef Qafih]], ''Halikhot Teiman'' (3rd edition), [[Ben-Zvi Institute]]: Jerusalem 1982, pp. 250–251; cf. [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Megillah'' 26a), the words of Rabbi Menahem, the son of Rabbi Yosi, ibid. See also [[Tosefta]] ''Megillah'' 4:14, where it states: "They do not perform [the solemn obsequies of] ''Ma'amad u'Moshav'' with less than ten persons, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Keriah''===
The mourners traditionally make a tear (''keriah'' קריעה) in an outer garment before or at the funeral.&lt;ref name="Klein, Isaac 1979, page 278"/&gt; The tear should be on the left side (over the heart and clearly visible) for a parent, including foster parents, and on the right side for siblings (including half-brothers and half-sisters&lt;ref name=silverman&gt;{{cite book |title=Prayers of Consolation |first=Morris |last=Silverman |publisher=Media Judaica Inc. |year=1984 |isbn=0-87677-062-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;), children, and spouses (and does not need to be visible). Non-Orthodox Jews will often make the ''keriah'' in a small black ribbon that is pinned to the lapel rather than in the lapel ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.funeralwise.com/customs/jewish"
|title=Jewish Funeral Customs - Funeralwise.com
|accessdate=2017-02-08}} - says "The service .. begins with the cutting of a black ribbon"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://secure.whctemple.org/site/usermedia/application/7/guide-for-jewish-funeral-practices.pdf
|title=Guide for Jewish Funeral Practices - Washington Hebrew Congregation
|accessdate=2017-02-08}} says - "Among Conservative and Reform Jews, a black ribbon is..."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the instance when a mourner receives the news of the death and burial of a relative after an elapsed period of 30 days or more, there is no ''keriah'', or tearing of the garment, except in the case of a parent. In the case of a parent, the tearing of the garment is to be performed no matter how long a period has elapsed between the time of death and the time of receiving the news.&lt;ref name=silverman /&gt;

If a child of the deceased needs to change clothes during the ''[[Shiva (Judaism)|shiva]]'' period, s/he must tear the changed clothes. No other family member is required to rend changed clothes during ''shiva''. Children of the deceased may never sew the rent clothes, but any other mourner may mend the clothing 30 days after the burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=281558 |title=Death &amp; Mourning: Keriah |first=Maurice |last=Lamm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eulogies===
A ''hesped'' is a [[eulogy]], and it is common for several people to speak at the start of the ceremony at the funeral home, as well as 
prior to burial at the gravesite.

"and [[Abraham]] came to eulogize [[Sarah]]." Gen. 23:2 uses the word "Lispod" from which is derived the Hebrew term Hesped.

There is more than one purpose for the eulogy.
* it is both for the deceased and the living, and should appropriately praise the person's good deeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/underhesped.html|title=Jewish Law - Articles - Understanding The Mitzvah of Hesped|website=www.jlaw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* to make us cry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ezrabessaroth.net/leadership/rabbi-s-blog/entry/rabbi-herschel-schacter-zt-l|title=Rabbi Herschel Schacter zt"l|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people specify in their wills that nothing should be said about them.

====Days of "no eulogy"====
Eulogies are forbidden on certain days; likewise on a Friday afternoon.

Some other times are:
* each month's Jewish New Moon ([[Rosh Chodesh]])
* the four days between [[Yom Kippur]] and [[Sukkot]]
* ''[[Chol HaMo'ed]]'' ("intermediate days" of [[Jewish holiday]]s)
* during the month of [[Nisan]]

A more general guideline is that when the [[Tachanun]] (supplication prayer) is omitted, it is permitted to deliver a brief eulogy emphasizing only the praise of the departed; the extensive eulogy is postponed, and may be said at another time during the year of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewish-funeral-guide.com/tradition/eulogy.htm|title=Jewish Funeral Guide - Jewish Funeral Services - לוויה - Eulogy - הספד|website=www.jewish-funeral-guide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burial==
[[File:Karczewski Jewish funeral.jpg|thumb|''Jewish funeral in Vilnius'' (1824), [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]]]

''Kevura'', or burial, should take place as soon as possible after death. The ''[[Torah]]'' requires burial as soon as possible, even for executed criminals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deuteronomy]] 21:23&lt;/ref&gt; Burial is delayed "for the honor of the deceased," usually to allow more time for far-flung family to come to the funeral and participate in the other post-burial rituals, but also to hire professionals, or to bury the deceased in a cemetery of their choice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sanhedrin]] 47a&lt;/ref&gt;

Respect for the dead can be seen from many examples in the ''[[Torah]]'' and ''[[Tanakh]]''. For example, one of the last events in the ''Torah'' is the death of [[Moses]] when [[Names of God in Judaism|God himself]] buries him: "[God] buried him in the depression in the land of [[Moab]], opposite Beth Peor. No man knows the place that he was buried, even to this day."&lt;ref&gt;http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=34&lt;/ref&gt;

In many traditional funerals, the casket will be carried from the hearse to the grave in seven stages. These are accompanied by seven recitations of [[Psalm 91]]. There is a symbolic pause after each stage (which are omitted on days when a eulogy would also not be recited.)

When the funeral service has ended, the mourners come forward to fill the grave. Symbolically, this gives the mourners closure as they observe, or participate in, the filling of the grave site. One custom is for all people present at the funeral to take a spade or shovel, held pointing down instead of up, to show the antithesis of [[death]] to [[life]] and that this use of the shovel is different from all other uses, to throw three shovelfuls of dirt into the grave.

Some have the custom to initially use the shovel "backwards" for the first few shovelfuls. Even within those who do it, some limit this to just the first few participants.

When someone is finished, they put the shovel back in the ground, rather than handing it to the next person, to avoid passing along their [[grief]] to other mourners.  This literal participation in the burial is considered a particularly good [[mitzvah]] because it is one for which the beneficiary&amp;nbsp;— the deceased&amp;nbsp;— can offer no repayment or gratitude and thus it is a pure gesture.

Some have a custom, once the grave is filled, to make a rounded topping shape.&lt;ref&gt;Tzuras ..&lt;/ref&gt;

After burial, the [[Tziduk Hadin]] prayer may be recited affirming that [[Divine Judgment]] is righteous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Zalman |last=Goldstein|title=The Burial|website=chabad.org|url= http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/368092/jewish/The-Burial.htm|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family of deceased may then be comforted by other mourners with the formula:
:הַמָּקוֹם יְנַחֵם אֶתְכֶם בְּתוֹךְ שְׁאָר אֲבֵלֵי צִיּוֹן וִירוּשָׁלָיִם
:Hamakom y'nachem etkhem b'tokh sha'ar avelei tziyon viyrushalayim.
:[[Names of God in Judaism|The Omnipresent]] will comfort you (pl.) among the mourners of [[Zion]] and [[Jerusalem]].

==Mourning==

===''Aninut''===
[[Image:Yiskor for Herzl.jpg|thumb|Yiskor for Herzl, by [[Boris Schatz]].]]

The first stage of mourning is ''aninut'', or "intense mourning." ''Aninut'' lasts until the burial is over, or, if a mourner is unable to attend the funeral, from the moment he is no longer involved with the funeral itself.

An ''onen'' (a person in ''aninut'') is considered to be in a state of total shock and disorientation. Thus the ''onen'' is exempt from performing [[Mitzvah|mitzvot]] that require action (and attention), such as [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|praying and reciting blessings]], wearing ''[[tefillin]]'' (phylacteries), in order to be able to tend unhindered to the funeral arrangements. However the ''onen'' is still obligated in commandments that forbid an action (such as not violating the Shabbat).

===''Avelut''===
''Aninut'' is immediately followed by ''avelut'' ("mourning"). An ''avel'' ("mourner") does not listen to [[music]] or go to [[concert]]s, and does not attend any joyous events or parties such as [[Jewish view of marriage|marriages]] or [[B'nai Mitzvah|Bar or Bat Mitzvahs]], unless absolutely necessary. (If the date for such an event has already been set prior to the death, it is strictly forbidden for it to be postponed or cancelled.)

''Avelut'' consists of three distinct periods.

====''Shiva'' – Seven days====
{{main|Shiva (Judaism)}}
The first stage of ''avelut'' is ''shiva'' ({{Hebrew Name 1|שבעה||"seven"|nobold}}), a week-long period of grief and [[mourning]]. Observance of ''shiva'' is referred to by [[Jewish English languages|English-speaking Jews]] as "sitting ''shiva''". During this period, mourners traditionally gather in one home and receive visitors.

When they get home, the mourners refrain for a week from showering or bathing, wearing leather shoes or jewelry, or shaving. In many communities, mirrors in the mourners' home are covered since they should not be concerned about their personal appearance. It is customary for the mourners to sit on low stools or even the floor, symbolic of the emotional reality of being "brought low" by the grief. The meal of consolation ([[Seudah#Seudat Havraah|''seudat havra'ah'']]), the first meal eaten on returning from the funeral, traditionally consists of hard-boiled [[egg (food)|eggs]] and other round or oblong foods. This is often credited to the Biblical story of [[Jacob]] purchasing the birthright from [[Esau]] with stewed [[lentils]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 25:34);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0125.htm|title=Genesis 25 / Hebrew - English Bible / Mechon-Mamre|work=mechon-mamre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is traditionally stated that Jacob was cooking the lentils soon after the death of his grandfather [[Abraham]]. During this seven-day period, family and friends come to visit or call on the mourners to comfort them ("''shiva'' calls").

It is considered a great ''[[mitzvah]]'' (commandment) of kindness and compassion to pay a home visit to the mourners. Traditionally, no greetings are exchanged and visitors wait for the mourners to initiate conversation. The mourner is under no obligation to engage in conversation and may, in fact, completely ignore his/her visitors.

Visitors will traditionally take on the hosting role when attending a Shiva, often bringing food and serving it to the mourning family and other guests. The mourning family will often avoid any cooking or cleaning during the Shiva period; those responsibilities become those of visitors.

There are various customs as to what to say when taking leave of the mourner(s). One of the most common is to say to them:
:הַמָּקוֹם יְנַחֵם אֶתְכֶם בְּתוֹךְ שְׁאָר אֲבֵלֵי צִיּוֹן וִירוּשָׁלָיִם
:''Hamakom y'nachem etkhem b'tokh sha'ar avelei tziyon viyrushalayim'':
:"[[Names of God in Judaism|The Omnipresent]] will comfort you (pl.) among the mourners of [[Zion]] and [[Jerusalem]]"

Depending on their community's customs, others may also add such wishes as: "You should have no more ''tza'ar'' (distress)" or "You should have only ''simchas'' (celebrations)" or "we should hear only ''besorot tovot'' (good tidings) from each other" or "I wish you a long life".

Traditionally, [[Jewish services|prayer services]] are organized in the house of mourning. It is customary for the family to lead the services themselves.

====Commencing and calculating the seven days of mourning====
If the mourner returns from the cemetery after the burial before sundown, then the day of the funeral is counted as the first of the seven days of mourning.  Mourning generally concludes in the morning of the seventh day.  No mourning may occur on [[Shabbat]] (the Jewish Sabbath), nor may the burial take place on Shabbat, but the day of Shabbat does count as one of the seven days. If a [[Jewish holiday]] occurs after the first day, that curtails the mourning period. If the funeral occurs during a festival, the start of the mourning period is delayed to the end of the festival. Some holidays, such as [[Rosh Hashanah]], cancel the mourning period completely.

====''Shloshim'' – Thirty days====
The thirty-day period following burial (including ''shiva'')&lt;ref&gt;''od 23 yamim'' (page 330, Pnai Baruch) = "an additional 23 days"&lt;/ref&gt; is known as ''shloshim'' ({{Hebrew Name 1|שלושים||"thirty"|nobold}}). During ''shloshim'', a mourner is forbidden to marry or to attend a ''[[seudat mitzvah]]'' (religious festive meal). Men do not shave or get haircuts during this time.

Since Judaism teaches that a deceased person can still benefit from the merit of ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'' (commandments) performed in their memory, it is considered a special privilege to bring merit to the departed by [[Torah study|learning Torah]] in their name. A popular custom is to coordinate a group of people who will jointly study the complete [[Mishnah]] during the ''shloshim'' period. This is due to the fact that "Mishnah" (משנה) and "Neshamah" (נשמה), soul, have the same (Hebrew) letters.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Yehoyada to Sanhedrin 42a and Aruch HaShulchan, Yoreh Deah, 376:13&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Shneim asar chodesh'' – Twelve months====
Those mourning a parent additionally observe a twelve-month period ({{Hebrew Name 1|שנים  עשר חודש|shneim asar chodesh|"twelve months"|nobold}}), counted from the day of death. During this period, most activity returns to normal, although the mourners continue to recite the [[Kaddish#Mourners.27 Kaddish|mourner's kaddish]] as part of synagogue services for eleven months. In Orthodox tradition, this is an obligation of the sons (not daughters)&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Maurice Lamm uses the phrase "the son's recitation of kaddish" in the middle of page 158 and then again in the middle of page 159 of the original/pre-2000 edition; the latter is now available online at http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/281541/jewish/The-Jewish-Way-in-Death-and-Mourning.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artscroll has substantiation, including not carrying out a father's wish when there are daughters and not sons, on pp.359-360 of {{cite book
|title=Mourning in Halachah |isbn=0-89906-171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;	as mourners. There remain restrictions on attending festive occasions and large gatherings, especially where live music is performed.

==''Matzevah'' (Unveiling of the tombstone)==
A [[headstone]] (tombstone) is known as a ''matzevah'' (monument). Although there is no [[Halakhic]] obligation to hold an unveiling ceremony (the ritual became popular in many communities toward the end of the 19th century), there are varying customs about when it should be placed on the grave. Most communities have an unveiling ceremony a year after the death. Some communities have it earlier, even a week after the burial. In Israel it is done after the ''shloshim'' (the first 30 days of mourning). There is no universal restriction about the timing, other than the unveiling cannot be held during Shabbat, (work-restricted) Jewish holidays, or [[Chol HaMoed|Chol Ha'Moed]].&lt;ref&gt;Mourning in Halacha, 42:8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There is also a known restriction regarding the month of Nisan:
{{cite web
|url=http://5tjt.com/visiting-cemeteries-in-nissan |title=Visiting Cemeteries In Nissan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the ceremony, a cloth or shroud covering that has been placed on the headstone is removed, customarily by close family members. Services include reading of several psalms. [[Gesher HaChaim]] cites (chapters) "33, 16, 17, 72, 91, 104, and 130; then one says Psalm 119 and recites the verses that spell the name of the deceased and the letters of the word ''Neshama''.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/18/Q2
|title=What happens at an "Unveiling"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another possible list is: (1, 23, 24, 103). Different communities have different customs.&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by the Mourner's Kaddish (if a ''[[minyan]]'' is available), and the prayer "[[El male rachamim|El Malei Rachamim]]". The service may include a brief eulogy for the deceased.

===Monuments===
Originally, it was not common practice to place names on tombstones. The general custom for engraving the name of the deceased on the monument is a practice that goes back (only) "the last several hundred years."&lt;ref&gt;Gesher HaChaim,Ch.28 {{cite web
|url=http://www.pikholz.org/Hevron/Gesher.html  |title=From GESHER HAHAYYIM, Chapter 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yemenite Jews|Jewish communities in Yemen]], prior to their immigration to the Land of Israel, did not place headstones over the graves of the dead, except only on rare occasions, choosing rather to follow the dictum of Rabban [[Shimon ben Gamliel II|Shimon ben Gamliel]] who said: “They do not build monuments (i.e. tombstones) for the righteous. Their words, lo! They are their memorial!”&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]], ''Sheqalim'' 7a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mishne Torah of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'', ed. [[Yosef Qafih]], Jerusalem, s.v. ''Hil. Avel'' 4:4&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher and [[Halachic decisor]], [[Maimonides]], likewise, ruled that it is not permissible to raise headstones over the graves of righteous men, but permits doing so for ordinary men.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''[[Mishne Torah]]'', ''Hil. Avel'' 4:4&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the more recent custom of [[Spanish Jews|Spanish Jewry]], following the teachings of the [[Yitzhak Luria|Ari z”l]] (''Shaʿar Ha-Mitzvot, Parashat Vayeḥi''), is to build tombstones over the grave, seeing it as part of the complete atonement and amendment for those who have died. Likewise, Rabbi [[Shlomo ben Aderet|Shelomo b. Avraham Aderet]] (RASHBA) wrote that it is a way of showing honor to the dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Questions &amp; Responsa of Rabbi Shelomo ben Aderet'', ''responsum'' # 375&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner the custom did spread, especially among the Jews of Spain, North Africa and [[Ashkenaz]]. Today, in Israel, all Jewish graves are marked with headstones.

==Annual remembrances==

==={{anchor|Yahrtzeit|Yartzeit|Yahrzeit}}Yahrtzeit===
{{redirect|Yahrzeit|the CSI: NY episode|Yahrzeit (CSI: NY)}}
[[File:Yahrtzeit candle.JPG|thumb|A [[yahrtzeit candle]] lit in memory of a loved one on the anniversary of the death]]
''Yahrtzeit'', יאָרצײַט, means ''"Time (of) Year"'' in [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=139&amp;letter=J |title=Jahrzeit |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative spellings include ''yortsayt'' (using the [[YIVO]] standard [[Yiddish orthography]]), ''Jahrzeit'' (in German), ''Yohr Tzeit'', ''yahrzeit'', and ''yartzeit''.  The word is used by Yiddish speaking Jews, and refers to the anniversary of the day of death of a relative. Yahrtzeit literally means "time of [one] year".

===Nachala===
The commemoration is known in [[Hebrew]] as ''nachala'' ("legacy," or "inheritance").  This term is used by most Sephardic Jews, although some use the [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] terms ''meldado'' or less commonly, ''anyos'' ("years").&lt;ref name=SephRel&gt;{{cite book |title=Sephardi Religious Responses|first=Norman A. |last=Stillman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KT8AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12 |page=12 |isbn=9781134365494 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rhodesjewishmuseum.org/ssb/ATimeToWeep.pdf |title=Meldado |publisher=Rhodes Jewish Museum |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely observed, and based on the Jewish tradition that mourners are required to commemorate the death of a relative.

===Commemorating===
Jews are required to commemorate the death of parents, siblings, spouses, or children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/death.htm|title=Judaism 101: Life, Death and Mourning|work=jewfaq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#When an immediate relative (parent, sibling, spouse or child) initially hears of the death of a relative, it is traditional to express one's grief by tearing their clothing and saying "Baruch Dayan HaEmet" (Blessed is the True Judge).
#Shiva is observed by parents, children, spouses and siblings of the deceased, preferably all together in the deceased's home.The main ''[[Halakha|halakhic]]'' obligation is to recite the mourner's version of the ''[[Kaddish]]'' prayer at least three times, ''[[Maariv]]'' at the evening services, ''[[Shacharit]]'' at [[Jewish services|morning services]], and ''[[Mincha]]'' at the afternoon services. The customs are first discussed in detail in ''Sefer HaMinhagim'' (pub. 1566) by [[Rabbi]] [[Isaac Tyrnau]].

The ''Yahrtzeit'' usually&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewish-funeral-guide.com/tradition/yahrzeit-date.htm|title=Jewish Funeral Guide - Remembrance - Yahrzeit Date Calculation|work=jewish-funeral-guide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; falls annually on the Hebrew date of the deceased relative's death according to the [[Hebrew calendar]].  There are questions that arise as to what the date should be if this date falls on Rosh Chodesh or in a leap year of the Hebrew calendar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/281636/jewish/Yahrzeit-Memorial-Anniversary.htm Yahrzeit: Memorial Anniversary] on [http://chabad.org Chabad.org] as part of a series "The Jewish Way in Death and Mourning" by Maurice Lamm, author of a book by the same title.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, there are a few permutations, as follows:

Yahrzeit is done each year, for a full day on the date of death according to the Hebrew calendar. The Synagogue notifies members of the secular date.

The main ''halachic'' obligation is to recite the mourner's version of the ''[[Kaddish]]'' prayer three times (evening of the previous day, morning, and afternoon), and many attend synagogue for the evening, morning, and afternoon services on this day.

During the morning prayer service the mourner's Kaddish is recited at least three times, two that are part of the daily service and one that is added in a house of mourning.  Both there and in the synagogue, another Kaddish, the Rabbi's Kaddish, is also said in the morning service once in Nusach Ashkenaz and twice in Sfard/Sfardi.

As a widely practiced [[Minhag|custom]], mourners also light a special candle that burns for 24 hours, called a [[yahrtzeit candle|"''Yahrzeit'' candle"]].

Lighting a [[yahrtzeit candle]] in memory of a loved one is a ''minhag'' ("custom") that is deeply ingrained in Jewish life honoring the memory and souls of the deceased.

Some Jews believe that strict Jewish law requires that one should fast on the day of a parent's Yahrzeit;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://rabbikaganoff.com/fasting-and-feasting-on-a-yahrtzeit/ rabbikaganoff.com] where Rabbi Yirmiyohu Kaganoff Shlita finds references to this in [[Sefer Hasidim]] and the writings of [[Moses Isserles]].&lt;/ref&gt; although most believe this is not required, some people do observe the custom of fasting on the day of the ''Yahrtzeit'', or at least refraining from meat and wine. Among many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Jews it has become customary to make a [[siyum]] by completing a tractate of [[Talmud]] or a volume of the [[Mishnah]] on the day prior to the ''Yahrtzeit'', in the honor of the deceased. A ''halakha'' requiring a ''siyum'' ("celebratory meal"), upon the completion of such a study, overrides the requirement to fast.

Many synagogues will have lights on a special memorial plaque on one of the synagogue's walls, with names of synagogue members who have died. Each of these lights will be lit for individuals on their ''Yahrzeit'' (and in some synagogues, the entire Hebrew month).&lt;ref&gt;".. during the month of the Yahrzeit. (Chabad of Commerce) {{cite web
|url=https://www.jewishcommerce.org/memorial-wall  |title=MEMORIAL WALL}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the lights will be lit for a ''[[Bereavement in Judaism#Yizkor|Yizkor]]'' service.&lt;ref&gt;"At the side of each nameplate, there is a Memorial Light, which is lit each year 
on the Yahrzeit and for all Yizkor commemorations." {{cite web
|url=http://ohrkodesh.org/jewish-living/life-cycle-events/memorial-plaque |title=Memorial Plaque}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some synagogues will also turn on all the lights for memorial days, such as ''[[Yom Ha'Shoah]]''.

===Visiting the gravesite===
[[File:Grave of Shlomo Carlebach.jpg|thumb|The grave of rabbi-singer [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]] in Jerusalem is piled with stones left by visitors.]]

Some have a custom to visit the cemetery on fast days ([[Shulchan Aruch]] Orach Chayim 559:10) and before [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]] (581:4, 605), when possible, and for a ''Yahrzeit.''  During the first year the grave is often visited on the shloshim, and the yartzeit (but may be visited at any time).

Even when visiting Jewish graves of someone that the visitor never knew, the custom is to place a small stone on the grave using the left hand. This shows that someone visited the gravesite, and is also a way of participating in the mitzvah of burial. Leaving flowers is not a traditional Jewish practice. Another reason for leaving stones is to tend the grave. In Biblical times, gravestones were not used; graves were marked with mounds of stones (a kind of [[cairn]]), so by placing (or replacing) them, one perpetuated the existence of the site.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli, Masechet Moe'ed Katan&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition to travel to the graveside on the occasion of a Yahrzeit is ancient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=WITTENBERG, CJN Staff Reporter|first1=Ed|title=Remembering the Lubavitcher Rebbe On 20th yahrzeit, Rabbi Schneerson still making an impact in world|url=http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/news/local/article_a42334e4-fc7e-11e3-9082-0019bb2963f4.html|agency=Cleveland Jewish News|date=June 27, 2014|quote="This Jewish tradition to travel to the graveside on the occasion of a Yahrzeit is ancient... said Chabad of Cleveland has planned a series of events to commemorate Schneerson’s 20th yahrzeit.

==Memorial through prayer==

===Mourner's Kaddish===
{{main|Kaddish}}
Kaddish Yatom (''[[Hebrew Language|heb.]]'' [[w:he:קדיש יתום|קדיש יתום]] ''lit. "Orphan's Kaddish"'') or the "Mourner's" Kaddish, is said at all [[Jewish services|prayer services]], as well as at funerals and memorials.  Customs for reciting the Mourner's Kaddish vary markedly among various communities.  In many [[Ashkenazi]] synagogues, particularly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] ones, it is customary that everyone in the synagogue stands.  In Sephardi synagogues, most people sit for most sayings of Kaddish.&lt;ref&gt;The following or similar wording appear in several religious sources: "The prevalent practice among Sepharadim is to sit during Kaddish '''unless one had been standing when Kaddish began. Many have the custom to stand during the half-kaddish recited during the Friday night prayer service, given the significant spiritual benefits that one can receive at that time. It is proper for a Sephardic Jew praying in an Ashkenazic minyan to stand for Kaddish and Barechu (Rav David Yosef, Halachah Berurah (56:17).''' (emphasis added). This quote is from a widely circulated Sephardic periodical, Community Magazine, http://www.communitym.com/article.asp?article_id=103875&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ben Ish Chai, a widely respected Sephardic source, refers to "the congregation rises slightly" regarding Barchu, a similar situation, as noted in the prior quote regarding "to stand for Kaddish and Barechu." {{cite web
|url=http://halachayomit.co.il/en/Default.aspx?HalachaID=3544&amp;PageIndex=44
|title=The Obligation to Stand While Kaddish and Barechu are Recited}} As for Orthodox Ashkenaz practice, "Some rise partially when the words Amen, yehei shemei rabba are said." {{cite web
|url=https://www.moreshesashkenaz.org/mm/publications/MadrichEnglish.pdf
|title=Guide to Minhag Ashkenaz - Machon Moreshes Ashkenaz}} These agree with a TALK PAGE comment regarding saying "Amen, YeHay ShMay...," that there are those who  ''"elevate"'' - meaning that they are not actually fully sitting, but neither are they standing.&lt;/ref&gt; In many non-Orthodox Ashkenaz ones, the custom is that only the mourners themselves stand and chant, while the rest of the congregation sits, chanting only responsively. &lt;!-- In [[Spanish and Portuguese]] [[esnogas]]/[[synagogues]] there is no Mourner's Kaddish and the [[Hazzan]] recites it while the congregants follow him. --&gt;

===Hashkabóth===
In many Sephardic communities, Hashkabóth ("remembrance") prayers are recited for the deceased in the year following death, on the deceased's death anniversary ("nahalah" or "años"), and upon request by the deceased's relatives.  Some Sephardic communities also recite Hashkabóth for all their deceased members on Yom Kippur, even those who died many years before.

===Yizkor===
[[File:Joods monument gedenksteen.JPG|thumb|Remembrance plaque in [[Tiel]].]]

''Yizkor'' ("remembrance") prayers are recited by those that have lost either one or both of their parents. These may additionally says Yizkor for other relatives.&lt;ref&gt;The Artscroll Siddur specifically mentions other titles, "Mitzad Avi.. MiTzad Imi" = on my father's side, on my mother's side&lt;/ref&gt; Some might also say Yizkor for a deceased close friend.&lt;ref name=Yizk.Chabad&gt;Chabad mentions this at {{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/371509/jewish/Yizkor-The-Memorial-Prayer.htm|title=Yizkor - The Memorial Prayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is customary in many communities for those with both parents alive to leave the synagogue during the Yizkor service&lt;ref name=Yizk.Chabad/&gt; while it is said."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shimonapisdorf.com/yizkor-a-four-part-guide|title=Yizkor: A four part guide - Shimon Apisdorf|website=www.shimonapisdorf.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The OU is more detailed but ends on "one should follow one’s own family minhag or the practice of one’s community."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yizkor prayers are recited four times a year, and are intended to be recited in a synagogue with a [[minyan]]; if one is unable to be with a minyan, one can recite it without one. These four Yizkor services are held on [[Yom Kippur]], [[Shemini Atzeret]], on the last day of [[Passover]], and on [[Shavuot]] (the second day of Shavuot, in communities that observe Shavuot for two days).

The ''[[El Malei Rachamim]]'' prayer, in which  God is asked to remember and grant [[wiktionary:repose|repose]] to the souls of the departed, is recited as the primary prayer of the ''Yizkor'' services.&lt;ref name="BJC33"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birnbaum|first1=Philip|title=A Book of Jewish Concepts|date=1975|publisher=Hebrew Publishing Company|location=New York|page=33|edition=Revised|chapter=El Male Rahamim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yizkor is customarily not said within the first year of mourning, until the first ''[[yahrzeit]]'' has passed. This practice is a custom and historically not regarded to be obligatory.&lt;ref name=MLammBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamm|first=Maurice|title=The Jewish Way in Death and Mourning, Revised and Expanded|year=2000|publisher=Jonathan David Publishers, Inc.|location=Middle Village, NY|isbn=0-8246-0422-9|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sephardic Judaism|Sephardic]] custom there is no Yizkor prayer, but the ''Hashkabóth'' serve a similar role in the service.

===Av HaRachamim===
{{main|Av HaRachamim}}
[[Av Harachamim]] is a Jewish memorial prayer that was written in the late 11th Century, after the destruction of the German Jewish communities around the [[Rhine river]] by Crusaders.&lt;ref name=JewTrad&gt;{{cite book |title=Jewish Traditions: A JPS Guide|first=Ronald |last=Eisenberg |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_qGHi_9K154C&amp;pg=PA461 |page=461 |isbn=9780827610392 |date=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is recited on many [[Shabbat]]ot before [[Musaf]], and also at the end of the Yizkor service.&lt;ref name=JewTrad /&gt;

==Communal responses to death==
Most Jewish communities of size have non-profit organizations that maintain cemeteries and provide ''chevra kadisha'' services for those in need. They are often formed out of a synagogue's women's group.

===''Zihui Korbanot Asson'' (ZAKA)===
{{main|ZAKA}}
ZAKA ([[Hebrew language|heb.]] [[w:he:זק"א|זק"א]] ''abbr. for Zihui Korbanot Asson lit. "Identifying Victims of Disaster"'' – [[w:he:חסד של אמת|חסד של אמת]] ''Hessed shel Emet lit. "True Kindness"'' – [[w:he:איתור חילוץ והצלה|איתור חילוץ והצלה]]), is a [[community emergency response team]] in the State of [[Israel]], officially recognized by the government. The organization was founded in 1989. Members of ZAKA, most of whom are [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], assist [[ambulance]] crews, identify the victims of [[Palestinian political violence|terrorism]], road accidents and other disasters and, where necessary, gather body parts and spilled [[blood]] for proper burial. They also provide [[first aid]] and [[rescue]] services, and help with the search for missing persons. In the past they have responded in the aftermath of disasters around the world.

===''Hebrew Free Burial Association'' (HFBA)===
[[File:Triangle Fire Grave.jpg|thumb|Tombstone of victim of [[Triangle Shirtwaist Fire]] at the [[Hebrew Free Burial Association#Cemeteries|Hebrew Free Burial Association's Mount Richmond Cemetery]].]]
{{main|Hebrew Free Burial Association}}
The Hebrew Free Burial Association is a non-profit agency whose mission is to ensure that all Jews receive a proper Jewish burial, regardless of their financial ability.  Since 1888, more than 55,000 Jews have been buried by HFBA in their cemeteries located on [[Staten Island, New York]], Silver Lake Cemetery and Mount Richmond Cemetery.

===Hebrew Benevolent Society of Los Angeles===
Formed in 1854 for the purpose of "…procuring a piece of ground suitable for the purpose of a burying ground for the deceased of their own faith, and also to appropriate a portion of their time and means to the holy cause of benevolence…," the Hebrew Benevolent Society of Los Angeles established the first Jewish cemetery in [[Los Angeles]] at Lilac Terrace and Lookout Drive&lt;ref&gt;The original cemetery land is at Lilac Terrace and Lookout Drive ({{coord| 34.0691|-118.2411|type:landmark|display=inline|name=Hebrew Benevolent Society - Site of first Jewish cemetery in LA}})&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Chavez Ravine]] (current home to [[Dodger Stadium]]). In 1968, a plaque was installed at the original site, identifying it as [[California Historical Landmark]] #822.&lt;ref name="WSJH"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Thomas|title=Early Jewish LA|url=http://www.wsjhistory.com/early_jewish_la.htm|publisher=Western States Jewish History|accessdate=2012-05-08|location=Vol #1, Issue #3|date=April 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, because of poor environmental conditions due to the unchecked expansion of the oil industry in the area, it was proposed by Congregation B'nai B'rith to secure a new plot of land in what is now [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]], and to move the buried remains to the new site, with a continued provision for burial of indigent people. This site, the Home of Peace Memorial Park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home of Peace Memorial Park|url=http://www.homeofpeacememorialpark.com/|publisher=Home of Peace Memorial Park|accessdate=2012-05-08|location=4334 Whittier Blvd., Los Angeles, CA, 90023, Phone +1 323 261 6135, {{coord|34.022|-118.175|type:landmark|display=inline|name=Home of Piece Memorial Park}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; remains operational and is the oldest Jewish cemetery in Los Angeles. The original society is now known as the "Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles".&lt;ref name="WSJH" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles|url=http://www.jfsla.org|publisher=Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy following death==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}

===Donating organs===
{{main|Organ donation in Jewish law}}
Being an organ donor is absolutely prohibited by some, and permitted, in principle, by others.&lt;ref&gt;That there is a card carried by some, stating "I do not give my permission to take from me, not in life or in death, any organ or part of my body for any purpose" supports this.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some [[Jewish denominations]], once death has been clearly established, provided that instructions have been left in a written [[living will]], donation may be done.  However, there are a number of practical difficulties for those who wish to adhere strictly to Jewish law. For example, someone who is dead by clinical standards may not yet be dead according to Jewish law. Jewish law does not permit donation of organs that are vital for survival from a donor who is in a near-dead state but who is not yet dead according to Jewish law. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews may need to consult their rabbis on a case-by-case basis.

Since 2001, with the founding of the [[Halachic Organ Donor Society]], organ donation has become more common in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|modern orthodox Jewish]] communities, especially with the support of rabbis like [[Moshe Tendler]] and [[Norman Lamm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Berg |first1=Elaine |title=Beating the Organ Donor Taboo |url=https://forward.com/opinion/743/beating-the-organ-donor-taboo/ |accessdate=12 September 2018 |work=The Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HUNDREDS OF ORTHODOX RABBIS CARRY ORGAN DONOR CARDS - HODS |url=https://hods.org/about-hods/orthodox-rabbis/ |website=HODS |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish view of cremation===
[[Halakha]] (Jewish law) forbids [[cremation]].&lt;ref&gt;Yesodei Smachos (p. 38 in 1978 edition), citing Gesher HaChaim, 28:9.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ancient historian&lt;ref name=MLammBook/&gt;{{rp|56}}&lt;ref&gt;citing [[Tacitus]]&lt;/ref&gt; described as "a distinguishing characteristic" that 
"Jews buried, rather than burned, their dead." Judaism stresses burial in the earth (included entombment, as in caves) as a religious duty of laying a person's remains to rest.  This, as well as the belief that the human body is created in the image of the divine and is not to be vandalized before or after death, teaches the belief that it was necessary to keep the whole body intact in burial, in anticipation of the eventual resurrection of the dead in the messianic age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oztorah.com/2007/09/cremation-ask-the-rabbi/ |title=Cremation - Ask the Rabbi |first=Raymond |last=Apple}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, some Jews who are not religiously adherent, or who have attached to an alternative movement or religious stream that does not see some or all the laws of the Torah as binding upon them, have chosen cremation, either for themselves prior to death, or for their loved ones, a choice made in 2016 by more than 50% of non-Jews in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=Chabad International |date=February 2017|title=The Jewish Way in Death and Burial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide===
{{main|Religious views of suicide#Judaism}}

As Judaism considers suicide to be a form of murder, a Jew who commits suicide is denied some important after-death privileges: No eulogies should be given for the deceased, and burial in the main section of the Jewish cemetery is normally not allowed.

In recent times, most people who die by suicide have been deemed to be the unfortunate victims of [[Clinical depression|depression]] or of a serious [[mental illness]]. Under this interpretation, their act of "self-murder" is not deemed to be a voluntary act of self-destruction, but rather the result of an involuntary condition. They have therefore been looked upon as having died of causes beyond their control.

Additionally, the [[Talmud]] (in Semakhot, one of the [[minor tractates]]) recognizes that many elements of the mourning ritual exist as much for the living survivors as for the dead, and that these elements ought to be carried out even in the case of the suicide.

Furthermore, if reasonable doubt exists that the death may not have been suicide or that the deceased might have changed her mind and repented at the last moment (e.g., if it is unknown whether the victim fell or jumped from a building, or if the person falling changed her mind mid-fall), the benefit of the doubt is given and regular burial and mourning rituals take place. Lastly, the suicide of a [[Minor (law)|minor]] is considered a result of a lack of understanding ("da'at"), and in such a case, regular mourning is observed.

===Tattoos===
[[Halakha]] (Jewish law) forbids [[tattoo]]s, and there is a persistent myth that this prevents burial in a Jewish cemetery, but this is not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ou.org/index.php/jewish_action/print/69707/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115071205/http://www.ou.org/index.php/jewish_action/print/69707 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-01-15 |title=What's the truth about... |publisher=Orthodox Union |first=Ari |last=Zivotofsky }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishanswers.org/ask-the-rabbi-category/from-idolatry-to-conversion/?p=120 |title=Burying a Tattooed Person in a Jewish Cemetery |first=Azriel |last=Schreiber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/17/fashion/17SKIN.html |title=Skin Deep: For Some Jews, It Only Sounds Like ‘Taboo’
|date=July 17, 2008 |first=Kate |last=Torgovnick |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small minority of burial societies will not accept a corpse with a tattoo, but Jewish law does not mention burial of tattooed Jews, and nearly all burial societies have no such restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/533444/jewish/Can-a-person-with-a-tattoo-be-buried-in-a-Jewish-cemetery.htm|title=Can a person with a tattoo be buried in a Jewish cemetery?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing the tattoo of a deceased Jew is forbidden as it would be considered ''damaging the body''.  This case has been one of public interest in the current generations due to the large population [[Identification in Nazi camps|tattooed]] in [[Nazi concentration camps]] between 1940 and 1945.  However, it must be noted that, since those tattoos were forced upon the recipients in a situation where any resistance could expect official murder or brutality, their presence is not in any way reflective of any violation of Jewish law on the part of both the living and deceased; rather under these circumstances it shows adherence to the positive command to preserve innocent life, including one's own, by passively allowing the mark to be applied.

===Death of an apostate Jew===
There is no mourning for an [[Jews in apostasy|Apostate Jew]] according to Jewish law.  (See that article for a discussion of precisely what actions and motivations render a Jew an "apostate.")

In the past several centuries, the custom developed among [[Ashkenazic]] [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] (including [[Hassidic]] and [[Haredi]] Jews), that the family would "[[Shiva (Judaism)|sit shiva]]" if and when one of their relatives would leave the fold of traditional Judaism.  The definition of "leaving the fold" varies within communities; some would sit ''shiva'' if a family member married a non-Jew; others would only sit ''shiva'' if the individual actually converted to another faith, and even then, some would make a distinction between those who chose to do so of their own will, and those who were pressured into conversion.  (In [[Sholom Aleichem]]'s [[Tevye]], when the title character's daughter converts to [[Christianity]] to marry a [[Christian]], Tevye sits ''shiva'' for her and generally refers to her as "dead.")  At the height of the [[Mitnagdim]] (anti-[[Hassidic]]) movement, in the early-to-mid nineteenth century, some [[Mitnagdim]] even sat ''shiva'' if a family member joined [[Hassidism]].  (It is said that when [[Leibel Eiger]] joined Hassidism, his father, Rabbi [[Shlomo Eiger]] sat ''shiva'', but his grandfather, the famed Rabbi [[Akiva Eiger]], did not. It is also said that [[Leibel Eiger]] came to be ''menachem avel'' [console the mourner]).  By the mid-twentieth century, however, [[Hassidism]] was recognized {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} as a valid form of [[Orthodox Judaism]], and thus the (controversial) practice of sitting ''shiva'' for those who realign to [[Hassidism]] ceased to exist.

Today, some [[Orthodox Jews]], particularly the more traditional ones (such as many [[Haredi]] and [[Hassidic]] communities), continue the practice of sitting ''shiva'' for a family member who has left the religious community.  More liberal Jews, however, may question the practice, eschewing it as a very harsh act that could make it much more difficult for the family member to return to traditional practice if/when s/he would consider doing so.

[[File:Hjalmars avsked av Orvar Odd efter striden på Samsö.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The Norwegian warrior [[Örvar-Oddr]] bids a last farewell to his blood brother, the Swedish warrior [[Hjalmar]], by [[Mårten Eskil Winge]] (1866).]]
'''Blood brother''' can refer to one of two things: a male [[Kinship|related by birth]], or two or more men not related by [[birth]] who have sworn loyalty to each other. This is in modern times usually done in a ceremony, known as a '''blood [[oath]]''', where each person makes a small cut, usually on a finger, hand or the [[forearm]], and then the two cuts are pressed together and bound, the idea being that each person's blood now flows in the other participant's [[veins]]. The act may carry a risk due to [[blood-borne disease]]s. In modern times, some gangs have also been rumored to make blood pacts. The process usually provides a participant with a heightened symbolic sense of attachment with another participant.

==Cultures==

===Scandinavia===

The Norsemen entering into the pact of foster brotherhood ({{lang-is|[[:is:Fóstbræðralag|Fóstbræðralag]]}}) involved a rite whereby they let their blood flow while they ducked underneath an arch formed by a strip of turf propped up by a spear or spears. An example is described in ''[[Gísla saga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Poole |first=Russell |author-link=Russell Poole |title=Claiming Kin Skaldic-Style |work=Verbal Encounters: Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse Studies for Roberta Frank |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8naeLlWGikC&amp;pg=PA278 |page=278 |isbn=9780802080110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref={{SfnRef|Dasent|1866}}|translator=George Webbe Dasent|translator-link=George Webbe Dasent |others=Mildmay, C.

''[[Örvar-Oddr's saga]]'' contains another notable account of blood brotherhood. [[Örvar-Oddr]], after fighting the renowned Swedish warrior [[Hjalmar]] to a draw, entered into foster-brotherhood with him {{Dubious span|by this turf-raising ritual. Afterwards, the strand of turf was put back during oaths and incantations.|date=May 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} 

In the mythology of northern Europe, [[Gunther]] and [[Högni]] became the blood brothers of [[Sigurd]] when he married their sister [[Gudrun]]; in [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Ring Cycle]]'', the same occurs between [[Gunther]] and Wagner's version of Sigurd, [[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]], which is marked by the "Blood Brotherhood [[Leitmotiv]]". Additionally, it is briefly stated in [[Lokasenna]] that [[Odin]] and [[Loki]] are blood brothers.

===Scythia===
Among the [[Scyth]]ians, the covenantors would allow their blood to drip into a cup; the blood was subsequently mixed with wine and drunk by both participants. Every man was limited to having at most three blood brotherhoods at any time, lest his loyalties be distrusted; as a consequence, blood brotherhood was highly sought after and often preceded by a lengthy period of affiliation and friendship ([[Lucian]], ''[[Toxaris]]''). 
4th-century BC depictions of two Scythian warriors drinking from a single [[drinking horn]] (most notably in a gold appliqué from [[Kul-Oba]]) have been associated with the Scythian oath of blood brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar Meyer, ''Greco-Scythian Art and the Birth of Eurasia: From Classical Antiquity to Russian Modernity'',  OUP (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=884TAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 246 (fig. 98b)] "Gold relief appliqué showing two Scythians drinking from one drinking horn. From [[Kul-Oba]] (Inventory 2, K.12h). Rostoftzeff identified the scene with the Scythain sacred oath described in Herodotus 4.70. Fourth century BC. 5 × 3.7 cm, 28.35 gr."; see also

The Hungarian [[hajduk]]s had a similar ceremony, though the wine was often replaced with milk so that the blood would be more visible.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Asia===
In [[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]], the act and ceremony of becoming blood brothers is generally seen as a [[tribal]] relationship, that is, to bring about alliance between tribes. It was practiced for this reason most notably among the [[Mongol]]s and [[Chinese history|early Chinese]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'','' the Chinese classical literature, the three main characters took an oath of blood brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Oath of the Peach Garden|date=2018-07-28|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oath_of_the_Peach_Garden&amp;oldid=852357830|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mongolian history, Genghis Khan the Great had an anda, blood brother in Mongolian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/anda|title=Anda {{!}} oath|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
The blood oath was used in much the same fashion as has already been described in much of 
[[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The British colonial administrator [[Lord Lugard]] is famous for having become blood brothers with numerous African chiefs as part of his political policy while in Africa. A powerful blood brother of his was the 
[[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] chieftain [[Waiyaki Wa Hinga]].

===Americas===
There may be some evidence that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] performed blood oathes to bring about [[Political alliance|alliances]] between tribes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Southeastern Europe===
Blood brothers among larger groups were common in ancient [[Southeastern Europe]] where, for example, whole companies of soldiers would become one family through the ceremony. It was perhaps most prevalent in the [[Balkans]] during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, as it helped the oppressed people to fight the enemy more effectively; blood brotherhoods were common in what is today [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Greece]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Christianity also recognized sworn brotherhood in a ceremony (known as {{lang-gr|[[adelphopoiesis]]}}, {{lang-sla|pobratimstvo}} in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches; known as {{lang-la|ordo ad fratres faciendum}} in the [[Roman Catholic]] church). The tradition of intertwining arms and drinking wine is also believed to be a representation of becoming blood brothers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Caucasus===
Blood brotherhood, highly ritualized and subjected to a strong code, was a common practice in the [[Caucasus]], especially among the mountaineers. Some relics of this tradition survive to this day.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The Burnt Generation shaped their future dreams based on their parents' values and lifestyle. These values described success, convenience and social acceptance as simply achievable goals through hard work and right education. Their parents, a [[Baby boomer|Baby Boomer]]-like generation, had rebuilt the country after World War II, established public education and women’s rights, nationalized the oil industry, and enhanced the public health system. Although there was a growing dissatisfaction with the government and Shah’s approach to a variety of political and social issues, the public's assumption was that those issues would be resolved through a democratic system.

After the Shah's exile in the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]], the clash between various political groups and new government created a suspicious environment that deeply affected the beliefs and values of the Burnt Generation. They are marked by lack of optimism for the future, nihilism, cynicism, skepticism, political apathy, alienation and distrust in traditional values and institutions which describe the similarities between Gen X and the Burnt Generation.

Another important event that influenced this generation was the [[Iranian Cultural Revolution|Cultural Revolution]] and the shutting down colleges and universities for several years. After reopening, every applicant had to pass an interview with the government-approved committees and women were only allowed to apply for certain limited majors. At that time, many of Burnt Generation, ranged between 13 and 25 years old, were fighting in the [[Iran–Iraq War]], which lasted from 1980 to 1988 with a million casualties on both sides.

As a result of growing up in that environment, they either have strong religious beliefs or are completely distrustful of religion and God. Some believe in God but disconnect themselves from any religious beliefs or groups. Their most common values include loyalty to family and friends, compassion, and high work ethics. The uncertainties of their future, either for those who lived in Iran or elsewhere, leave a deep sense of insecurity in the Burnt Generation.

'''''Chu''''' (廚, lit. "kitchen") is a [[Daoist]] name used for various religious practices including communal ''chu'' (Kitchen) banquet rituals in [[Way of the Celestial Masters]] liturgy, the legendary ''xingchu'' (行廚, Mobile Kitchen) associated with Daoist ''[[xian (Daoism)|xian]]'' ("transcendents; 'immortals'"), and ''wuchu'' (五廚, Five Kitchens) representing the ''[[Zang-fu#Yin/yang and the Five Elements|wuzang]]'' (五臟, Five Viscera) in ''[[neidan]]'' meditation techniques.

==Terminology==
''Chú'' ("kitchen; to cook; a cook") can be written with three [[Chinese characters]] 廚, 㕑, and 厨. The common [[traditional Chinese character]] [[wikt:廚|廚]] combines the [[Radical 53|"house radical"]] [[wikt:广|广]] with a phonetic indicator ''shù'' [[wikt:尌|尌]] (joining ''zhù'' [[wikt:壴|壴]] "drum" and ''cùn'' [[wikt:寸|寸]] "hand"); and the [[Variant Chinese character|variant]] traditional character [[wikt:㕑|㕑]] has [[Radical 27|"cliff radical"]] [[wikt:厂|厂]] instead of 广. The [[simplified Chinese character]] [[wikt:厨|厨]] omits the [[wikt:士|士]] element in 壴, leading to a "graphic [[folk etymology]]" of "A 厂 'room' for cooking [[wikt:豆|豆]] 'beans' with your 寸 'hands'." (Bishop 2016). The Chinese [[logograph]] 廚 was anciently used as a [[Chinese character classification#Rebus (phonetic loan) characters|loan character]] for ''chú'' [[wikt:櫥|櫥]] (with the [[Radical 75|"wood radical"]] 木, "cabinet") or ''chú'' [[wikt:幮|幮]] ([[Radical 50|"cloth radical"]] 巾, "a screen used for a temporary kitchen").

The [[Modern Standard Chinese]] lexicon uses ''chu'' in many [[Compound (linguistics)|compound words]], for instance, ''chúfáng'' ([[wikt:廚房|廚房]] with 房 "room", "kitchen"), ''chúshī'' ([[wikt:廚師|廚師]] with 師 "master", "cook; chef"), ''chúdāo'' ([[wikt:廚刀|廚刀]] with 刀 "knife", "kitchen knife"), and ''páochú'' ([[wikt:庖廚|庖廚]] with 庖 "kitchen", meaning "kitchen").

In Daoist specialized vocabulary, ''chu'' names a Kitchen-feast communal meal, and sometimes has a technical meaning of "magic", "used to designate the magical recipes through which one becomes invisible" (Maspero 1981: 290). The extensive [[semantic field]] of ''chu'' can be summarized in some key Daoist expressions: ritual banquets, communion with divinities, granaries (''zang'' 藏, a word that also denotes the viscera), visualization of the Five Viscera (''wuzang'' 五臟, written with the [[Radical 130|"flesh radical"]] ⺼), and abstention from cereals (''[[Bigu (grain avoidance)|bigu]]''), and other food proscriptions (Mollier 2008a: 279). According to Daoist classics, when ''[[Bigu (grain avoidance)|bigu]]'' "grain avoidance" techniques were successful, ''xingchu'' (行廚, Mobile Kitchens or ''tianchu'' (天廚, Celestial Kitchens) were brought in gold and jade vessels by the ''yunü'' (玉女, Jade Women) and ''jintong'' (金僮, Golden Boys), associated with the legendary [[Jade Emperor]] (Despeux 2008: 233-234).

[[Chinese Buddhist]] terminology applies ''chu'' (廚, cf. 櫥 "cabinet") "kitchen; kitchen cupboard" to denote the "cabinet for an image or relic of the Buddhas", translating [[Sanskrit]] ''bhakta-śālā'' "food-hall" or ''mahânasa'' "kitchen" ([[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]).

In [[Chinese astronomy]], ''Tiānchú'' (天廚, Celestial Kitchen) is the name of an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] in the constellation [[Draco in Chinese astronomy|Draco]], located next to ''Tiānbàng'' (天棓, Celestial [[Flail]]), and ''Nèichú'' (內廚, Inner Kitchen).

==Translations==
There is no standard English translation for either Daoist ''chu'' (廚, Kitchen) or ''xingchu'' (行廚, Mobile Kitchen). The former is rendered as:
*"kitchen festival", "kitchen feast" (Stein 1979)
*"Kitchens" (Maspero 1981)
*"kitchen banquets" (Verellen 2004)
*"cuisines" (Campany 2005, Kleeman 2008, Mollier 2008a)
*"Kitchens" (Mollier 2009)
*"cuisines" (Kroll 2017) 
These [[Anglophone]] scholars render Chinese ''chu'' as either English ''[[wikt:kitchen|kitchen]]'' ("a room for preparing food"), optionally clarified with ''K-'', -''festival'' or -''feast'', or ''[[wikt:cuisine#English|cusine]]'' ("a characteristic style of cooking, often associated with a place of origin"). The latter follows [[Francophone]] sinologists, for instance [[Henri Maspero|Maspero]] (1971) and Mollier (1999), who accurately translated Chinese ''chu'' as French ''[[wikt:cuisine#French|cuisine]]'' ("kitchen; cooking") and ''xingchu'' as ''cusine de voyage'' ("travel kitchen"). Although English ''kitchen'' and French ''cuisine'' are [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] deriving from Latin [[wikt:coquina#Latin|''cocīna'']] ("cooking; kitchen"), they are [[false friends]] with significant semantic differences between English ''kitchen'' and ''cuisine''. Chinese usually translates English ''kitchen'' as chúfáng ([[wikt:廚房|廚房]], "kitchen") and ''cuisine'' as ''pēngrèn'' ([[wikt:烹飪|烹飪]], "art of cooking").

[[File:Traveling canteen given by Tsar Nicholas I to the 6th Duke of Devonshire in 1826, French or Russian, mid 1700s, red agate mounted with gold - Chatsworth House - Derbyshire, England - DSC03126.jpg|thumb|Traveling canteen presented by [[Nicholas I of Russia]] to [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|William Cavendish]] in 1826]]
The term ''xingchu'' (行廚) has been translated as
*"Traveling Canteen" (Ware 1966)
*"mobile kitchen" (Sivin 1968)
*"perform the Kitchen" (Maspero 1981)
*"travelling kitchen-feast" (Penny 2000)
*"traveling canteen' (Campany 2002)
*"traveling kitchen" (Campany 2005)
*"movable cuisines" (Despeux 2008, Mollier 2008a)
*"Mobile Kitchens" (Mollier 2009)
[[Joseph Needham]] calls Ware's "Traveling Canteen" a "bizarre translation" (1976: 29). While Maspero uniquely interprets the ''xing'' ([[wikt:行|行]]) in ''xingchu'' as a verb ("to perform"), the other scholars read it as a modifier ("to go; to move") translated as ''traveling'', ''mobile'', or ''movable'' (cf. ''[[wikt:movable feast|movable feast]]''). The ''chu'' noun in ''xingchu'' is translated as English ''kitchen'', ''cuisine'', or ''[[wikt:canteen|canteen]]''. However, the latter ambiguous word has several meanings besides ''[[cafeteria|canteen]]'' ("a cafeteria or snack bar provided by an organization"), ''[[Canteen (bottle)|canteen]]'' ("a small water bottle"), and [[British English]] ''canteen'' ("a case or box containing a cutlery set"). To further complicate translating ''xingchu'', ''travelling canteen'' was the 18th-century equivalent of a [[picnic basket]]. In modern terms, the ''xingchu'' is comparable with a [[Mobile catering|mobile kitchen]] (Sivin's translation), military [[field kitchen]], [[food truck]], or [[food cart]].

==''Chu'' Kitchen feast== 
The ''chu'' (廚, Kitchen), also known as ''fushi'' (福食, "good luck meal"), was a religious banquet that usually involved preliminary fasting and purification before consuming a meal of vegetarian food and [[Alcoholic drinks in China|Chinese wine]]. The banquet was hosted by families on the occasion of births and deaths, prepared for a ritually-fixed number of parishioners, and accompanied by specific ritual gifts to the Daoist priest. Although the Kitchen Feast became a regular element of organized Daoist religious traditions, scholars do not know the date when it was introduced into the liturgy. One early textual record is the c. 499 ''[[Zhen'gao]]'' saying that Xu Mi (許谧, 303-376) offered a Kitchen meal to five persons (Stein 1979: 57). 

These communal ''chu'' Kitchen banquets have a pre-Daoist antecedent in popular [[Chinese folk religion]]: the term ''chu'' was anciently used for the ceremonial meals organized by communities to honor the ''[[Tudigong#Names|she]]'' (社, God of the Soil). Although orthodox Daoists criticized, and sometimes banned, these ''chuhui'' (廚會, "cuisine congregations") for making immoral animal sacrifices, they nevertheless perpetuated the custom by adapting and codifying it (Mollier 2008a: 279). ''Chu'' kitchen-feasts have many features in common with another Daoist ritual meal, the ''zhāi'' (齋, "fast; purification; retreat"), and the two are frequently treated as having the same functions. The 7th-century Daoist ''Zhaijielu'' (齋戒錄, Records of Fasting) suggested that ''zhai'' were anciently called ''shehui'' (社會, "festival gatherings of the soil god"—now the modern Chinese word for "society"), which was later changed into ''zhaihui'' (齋會) (Stein 1979: 75).
 
The [[Way of the Celestial Masters]] religion, founded by [[Zhang Daoling]] in 142 CE, celebrated ''chu'' kitchen festivals at New Year and the annual ''sanhui'' (三會, Three Assemblies), which were major Daoist festivals held in the first, seventh, and tenth lunar months, when believers assembled at their local parish to report any births, deaths, or marriages, so that the population registers could be updated. Parishioners who had reason to celebrate on these occasions would host a ''chu'' feast for other members of the community in proportion to the significance of their auspicious event and their means. Accounts of these banquets "emphasize both the sharing of food and the affirmation of the unique, religious merit-based social order of the Daoist community" (Kleeman 2008: 839-840).

The ''chu'' sacrament had three levels of banquets and ritual gifts, depending upon what the family was celebrating. For the birth of a boy, the ''shangchu'' (上廚, Superior Ceremony of the Kitchen) was a banquet offered to the priest and ten members of the parish, with gifts to the priest of a hundred sheets of paper, a pair of [[ink brushes]], an [[inkstick]], and an ink scraper. For the birth of a girl, it was the less expensive ''zhongchu'' (中廚, Middle Ceremony of the Kitchen) with a banquet for five parishioners, and the gifts, which the parents had to provide within one month following the birth, were a mat, a wastebasket, and a broom. For the death of a family member, the ''xiachu'' (下廚, Inferior Ceremony of the Kitchen), also called ''jiechu'' (解廚, Kitchen of Deliverance), is not described in Daoist texts, and we only know that the rival Buddhist polemicists claimed it was a "great orgy" (Maspero 1981: 290). 

The anti-Daoist ''Erjiaolun'' (二教論, Essay on Two Religions) by the Buddhist monk [[Dao'an]] (312–385) said ''chu'' kitchen-feasts were intended to bring about ''jiěchú'' (解除, "liberation and elimination") from pollution and sins, which were connected with the soil god and tombs (Stein 1979: 71). The parallel passage in the 6th-century ''Bianhuolun'' (辯惑論, Essay on Debating Doubts) uses the homophonous [[Variant Chinese character|graphic variant]] of ''jiěchú'' (解廚, "liberation kitchen"), thus connecting both ''chú'' "kitchen" and ''chú'' "liberation" to non-Daoist gods of the soil (Stein 1979: 74).

Daoist sources record that the people invited to a ''chu'' Kitchen feast would first observe a period of purification that included fasting and abstention from sex. Kitchen rituals lasted for one, three, or seven days. Participants consumed exclusively vegetarian food and moderate amounts of wine, which was considered as a mandatory element of the banquet (Mollier 2008a: 279). For the Superior Kitchens five ''[[Chinese units of measurement#Volume|sheng]]'' of wine (about a liter) per person was planned, for the Middle Kitchens, four ''sheng'', and for the Inferior Kitchen three. The participants "must have departed a bit happy, but not drunk." (Maspero 1981: 290). The leftovers were given to other parishioners who could thereby share in the ritual. 

Besides annual festivals on fixed dates like the Three Assemblies, ''chu'' Kitchen ceremonies were also performed in special circumstances, particularly when there was disease, sin, or death pollution. They were believed to have exorcistic and salvific powers and to confer good luck or merit upon the adepts (Mollier 2008a: 279). Kitchen ceremonies often involved Daoist ritual ''jiao'' (醮, "offerings") of cakes and pieces of fabric in order to obtain particular favors, such as petitions for recovery from illnesses, prayers for rain in time of drought, and thanksgivings for favors received. An altar was laid out in the open air, and the priest recited prayers (Maspero 1981: 34-35).

[[Ge Hong]]'s c. 318 ''[[Baopuzi]]'' (see below) mentions profligately expensive ''chu'' Kitchen Feasts in contrasting heterodox ''yaodao'' (妖道, "demonic cults"), which involved sacrificing animals to gods who enjoyed their blood, with the undefined term ''Lijia dao'' (李家道, "religion of the adepts of Li") (Stein 1979: 56). The context praises the contemporary charlatan healer Li Kuan (李寬) for not following the ancient tradition of animal sacrifice, while blaming him for extravagance. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The more than a hundred ways for dealing with demons [諸妖道百餘種] all call for slaying living creatures so that their blood may be drunk. Only the doctrine of the Lis [李家道] is slightly different. Yet, though it does no butchering, whenever its "good-luck food" is served [每供福食], it includes varieties of mixtures without limit. In planning the meal, one strives for sumptuousness, and the rarest things must be purchased. Several dozen may work in the kitchen [或數十人廚], and costs for food can run high indeed. In tum, these are not completely disinterested affairs, and they might well be classed with things to be forbidden. (tr. Ware 1966: 158) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Xingchu'' Mobile Kitchen traditions==
In Daoist hagiographies and stories, the esoteric ability to summon a ''xingchu'' (行廚, Mobile Kitchen) was a standard [[Trope (literature)|trope]] for the powers of a ''xian'' transcendent. The ''xingchu'', which Campany called a "curious business" (2002: 29), was a sumptuous banquet of rare delicacies, exotic foods, and wines that could be instantly served up by spirits anywhere on command.

The tradition of ''xingchu'' "meditational cuisines" or "contemplative cuisines" seems to have developed in a parallel and complementary manner to the ''chu'' "communal cuisine liturgy" (Mollier 2008a: 280). ''Xian'' transcendents were portrayed as eschewing what counted in China as ordinary foods, especially grains (see ''[[Bigu (grain avoidance)|bigu]]''), and instead eating superior, longevity-inducing substitutes such as sesame seeds and ''[[Lingzhi mushroom|lingzhi]]'' mushrooms, typically found in distant and legendary places removed from the heartland of agriculture-based Chinese civilization. Transcendents were frequently depicted as winged beings able to fly long distances rapidly and summoning a ''xingchu'' banquet at will eliminated the need to travel across the world and heavens in order to obtain rare foodstuffs of immortality (Campany 2005: 46-47).

The [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] Daoist scholar [[Ge Hong]] compiled the two primary sources of information about ''xingchu'' Mobile Kitchens, the ''Baopuzi'' and ''Shenxian zhuan''. Ge portrayed adepts seeking ''xian''-hood as avoiding ordinary food such as grains, instead eating "rare, exotic foodstuffs from the far reaches of the cosmos", marvelous products conveying the "numinous power" suggested by their peculiarity. "The ability to command at will a spirit-hosted serving of exotic food and drink in elegant vessels may seem trivial, but when one recalls that many Daoist scriptures prohibit the feasting on sacrificial meats and liquors enjoyed by the aristocracy, and that many adepts did their work on mountains and were isolated from agricultural communities and markets, the practice assumes a more serious aspect." (Campany 2002: 221)

===Baopuzi===
The c. 318 CE "Inner Chapters" of the ''[[Baopuzi]]'' (Master Who Embraces Simplicity) have nine occurrences of the word ''xingchu'' (行廚, Mobile Kitchen). Seven of them are in contexts of alchemical medicines and elixirs, most of which have poisonous [[toxic heavy metal]] ingredients. The ''Baopuzi'' uses two related verbs for beckoning a Mobile Kitchen: ''zhì'' (至, "arrive at; reach; come") and ''zhì'' (致, "cause to arrive at; get to; come to"). The other two ''xingchu'' usages are in proper names of a Daoist [[Fulu|amulet]] and book, the ''Xingchu fu'' (行廚符, Amulet of the Traveling Kitchen), and the ''Xingchu jing'' (行廚經, Scripture of the Traveling Kitchen). The ''Baopuzi'' also lists another book titled ''Riyue chushi jing'' (日月廚食經, Scripture of the Kitchen Meals of the Sun and the Moon) (19, Ware 1966: 384, 380, 381).

Three of the seven ''Baopuzi'' elixirs are said to have dual purpose usages, long-term consumption is said to grant ''xian'' transcendence, including the ability to summon ''xingchu'', and short-term consumption provides a panacea—specifically for eliminating the [[Three Corpses]] or Three Worms, demons that live within the human body and hasten their host's death, and the [[Three Corpses#Baopuzi|Nine Worms]] or Nine Vermin, broadly meaning internal worms and parasites. First, the ''Xian Menzi dan'' (羡門子丹, Master Xian Men's Elixir) is prepared from wine and cinnabar. "After it has been taken for one day the Three Worms and all illnesses are immediately purged from the patient. If taken for three years, it will confer geniehood and one is sure to be served by two fairies, who can be employed to summon the Traveling Canteen [可役使致行廚]." (4, tr. Ware 1966: 84; cf. Campany 2002: 290). Second, a list of methods for eating and drinking realgar says, "In each case it confers Fullness of Life; all illnesses are banished; the Three Corpses drop from the body; scars disappear; gray hair tums black; and lost teeth are regenerated. After a thousand days, fairies [translating ''yunu'' 玉女 Jade Maiden] will come to serve you and you can use them to summon the Traveling Canteen [以致行廚]." (11, tr. Ware 1966: 188). Third, consuming pure, unadulterated [[Lacquer#Urushiol-based lacquers|lacquer]] will put a man in communication with the gods and let him Enjoy Fullness of Life. When eaten with pieces of crab in mica or jade water, "The Nine Insects will then drop from you, and the bad blood will leave you through nose-bleeds. After a year, the six-''chia'' gods and the Traveling Canteen will come to you [一年六甲行廚至也]." (11, tr. Ware 1966: 190). This ''liujia'' (六甲, Six ''[[Celestial stem#Table|Jia]]'' Gods) and the ''liuyin'' (六陰, Six Yin) below refer to [[Chinese astrology|astrological]] [[Qimen Dunjia|Dunjia]] divination. An alternate translation is "the six ''jia'' and the traveling canteen will arrive" (Campany 2002: 75),

The remaining four ''Baopuzi'' formulas are said to create stronger and more versatile elixirs. Fourth, the ''Jiuguang dan'' (九光丹, Ninefold Radiance Elixir) is made by processing certain unspecified ingredients with the ''wushi'' (五石, Five Minerals, see [[Cold-Food Powder]]), i.e., [[cinnabar]], [[realgar]], purified [[potassium alum]], laminar [[malachite]], and [[magnetite]] (Needham et al. 1976: 86). Each mineral is put through five alchemical cycles and assumes five hues, so that altogether twenty-five hues result, each with specific powers, for example, the blue elixir will revive a recently deceased person. "If you wish to summon the Traveling Canteen [欲致行廚], smear your left hand with a solution of black elixir; whatever you ask for will be at your beck and call, and everything you mention will arrive without effort. You will be able to summon any thing or any creature in the world." (tr. Ware 1966: 82-83, noting "fragrant foods served in plates of gold and cups of jade"). Fifth, the ''Baopuzi'' quotes from ''Shennong sijing'' (神農四經, [[Shennong]]'s Four Classics), "Medicines of the highest type put the human body at ease and protract life so that people ascend and become gods in heaven, soar up and down in the air, and have all the spirits at their service. Their bodies grow feathers and wings, and the Traveling Canteen comes whenever they wish [行廚立至]." (11, tr. Ware 1966: 177). Sixth, the method of Wu Chengzi (務成子) compounds alchemical gold from realgar, yellow sand, and mercury, and then forms it into small pills. Coating the pills with different substances will produce magical effects, for instance, if one is smeared with ram's blood and thrown into a stream, "the fish and the dragons will come out immediately, and it will be easy to catch them." And, "If it is coated with hare's blood and placed in a spot belonging to the Six Yin, the Traveling Canteen and the fairies will appear immediately and place themselves at your disposal [行廚玉女立至], to a total of sixty or seventy individuals." (16, tr. Ware 1966: 276). Seventh, Liu Gen (劉根, or Liu Jun'an 劉君安), who Ware wrongly identifies as the Daoist prince and author [[Liu An]] (劉安, Campany 2002: 248), learned the art of metamorphosis from an alchemical text attributed to the [[Mohist]] founder [[Mozi]], the ''Mozi wuxing ji'' (墨子五行記, Master Mo's Records of the [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]]), and successfully used its medicines and amulets, "By grasping a pole he becomes a tree. He plants something, and it immediately produces edible melons or fruit. He draws a line on the ground, and it becomes a river; he piles up dirt and it becomes a hill. He sits down and causes the Traveling Canteen to arrive [坐致行廚]." (19, tr. Ware 1966: 316).

===Shenxian zhuan===
The c. 318 ''[[Shenxian zhuan]]'' (Hagiographies of Divine Transcendents) uses ''xingchu'' (行廚, Mobile Kitchen) six times. The hagiography of Wang Yuan gives a detailed description of summoning a ''xingchu''. Other adepts who are also said to have this ability include Li Gen, Liu Jing, Zuo Ci, Liu Zheng, and Taixuan nü (Campany 2002: 222).

[[File:Portrait of the Immortal Magu - Ma Hezhi - Song Dynasty.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of the Immortal Magu'' ([[National Palace Museum]], Taipei)]]
First, the hagiography of Wang Yuan (王遠) and [[Magu (deity)|Magu]] (Cannabis Maiden) says Wang was a Confucianist scholar who quit his official post during the reign (146-168 CE) of [[Emperor Huan of Han]] and went into the mountains to study Daoist techniques. Wang achieved ''xian'' transcendence through ''[[Shijie (Daoism)#Shenxian zhuan|shijie]]'' "liberation by means of a simulated corpse", described with the traditional [[Shijie (Daoism)#Cicada metaphor|cicada metaphor]], his "body disappeared; yet the cap and garments were completely undisturbed, like a cicada shell." During his travels, Wang met the peasant Cai Jing (蔡經), whose [[physiognomy]] indicated he was destined to become a transcendent, so Wang took him on as a disciple, taught him the basic techniques, and left. Soon afterwards Cai also used alchemical ''shijie'' liberation, his body became extremely hot, and his flesh and bones melted away for three days. "Suddenly he had vanished. When his family looked inside the blanket, only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell." (tr. Campany 2002: 260).

After Cai had been gone for "over a decade", he unexpectedly returned home, looking like a young man, announced to his family that Lord Wang would visit on the "seventh day of the seventh month" (later associated with the [[Cowherd and Weaver Girl]] lovers' festival), and ordered them to "prepare great quantities of food and drink to offer to his attendants." When Wang Yuan and his heavenly entourage arrived on the auspicious "double-seven" day, he invited his old friend Magu to join their celebration because it had been over five hundred years since she had been "in the human realm." When the Cannabis Maiden and her attendants arrived at Cai's household,
&lt;blockquote&gt;She appeared to be a handsome woman of eighteen or nineteen; her hair was done up, and several loose strands hung down to her waist. Her gown had a pattern of colors, but it was not woven; it shimmered, dazzling the eyes, and was indescribable – it was not of this world. She approached and bowed to Wang, who bade her rise. When they were both seated, they called for the travelling canteen [坐定召進行廚]. The servings were piled up on gold platters and in jade cups without limit. There were rare delicacies, many of them made from flowers and fruits, and their fragrance permeated the air inside [Cai's home] and out. When the meat was sliced and served, [in flavor] it resembled broiled ''mo'' and was announced as ''kirin'' meat. (tr. Campany 2002: 262) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare Maspero's translation, "everyone steps forth to 'perform the Kitchen'" (1981: 291). [[Guo Pu]]'s commentary to the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'' described the ''[[Mo (Chinese zoology)|mò]]'' (貘, [[giant panda]]) as "bear-like, black and white, and metal-eating" (tr. Harper 2013: 216); and the mystical ''[[qilin]]'' beast is sometimes identified as a Chinese unicorn (Penny 2008: 731).

Wang Yuan then announced to the Cai family that he had brought some exceptional wine from the Tianchu (天廚, Heavenly Kitchen) asterism.
&lt;blockquote&gt;I wish to present you all with a gift of fine liquor. This liquor has just been produced by the celestial kitchens. Its flavor is quite strong, so it is unfit for drinking by ordinary people; in fact, in some cases it has been known to burn people's intestines. You should mix it with water, and you should not regard this as inappropriate." With that, he added a ''dou'' of water to a ''sheng'' of liquor, stirred it, and presented it to the members of Cai Jing's family. On drinking little more than a ''sheng'' of it each, they were all intoxicated. After a little while, the liquor was all gone. (tr. Campany 2002: 263) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In traditional [[Chinese units of measurement ]], a ''dǒu'' ([[wikt: 斗| 斗]]) was approximately equivalent to 10 liters and a ''shēng'' [[wikt:升|升]]) approximately 1 liter. 

Second, the ''Shenxian zhuan'' narrative of Li Gen (李根) says he studied under Wu Dawen (吳大文) and obtained a method for producing alchemical gold and silver.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Li Gen could transform himself [into other forms] and could enter water and fire [without harm]. He could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive, and with it could serve twenty guests [坐致行廚能供二十人]. All the dishes were finely prepared, and all of them contained strange and marvelous foods from the four directions, not things that were locally available. (tr. Campany 2002: 219) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Third, Liu Jing (劉京) was an official under [[Emperor Wen of Han]] (r. 180-157 BCE) who "abandoned the world and followed Lord Zhang 張君 of [[Handan]] to study the Way." By using methods for subsisting on "efflorescence of vermilion" pills [朱英丸] and "cloud-mother [mica]" pills, Liu "lived to be one hundred thirty years old. To look at him, one would judge him to be a person in his thirties." He could also foretell the auspiciousness of future events. (tr. Campany 2002: 249).

The Shangqing (Supreme Purity) tradition ''Han Wu Di neizhuan'' (漢武帝内傳, Esoteric Traditions of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Han Emperor Wu]]), which was written between 370 and 500, has some later accretions that resemble ''Shenxian zhuan'' (Campany 2002: 76). The passage about Liu Jing says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Later he served Ji Zixun [薊子訓, i.e., Ji Liao 薊遼] as his teacher. Zixun transmitted to him all the secret essentials of the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Five Thearchs]], Numinous Flight (''lingfei'', 靈飛), the six ''jia'' spirits, the Twelve Matters (''shier shi'' 十二事), and the Perfected Forms of the Ten Continents of Divine Transcendents (shenxian shizhou zhenxiang 神仙十洲真形). Liu Jing practiced them all according to the instructions, and they were mightily efficacious. He could summon ghosts and spirits, immediately cause wind and rain to arise, cause the traveling canteen to arrive [名致行廚], and appear and disappear at will. He also knew the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of people's future affairs and of particular days. (tr. Campany 2002: 449) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fourth, the transcendent [[Zuo Ci]] (左慈) was a ''[[fangshi]]'' ("method master") famous for his abilities at divination, ''[[fenshen]]'' multilocation, and [[shapeshifting]] (Pregadio 2008: 1305),
&lt;blockquote&gt;Seeing that the fortunes of the Han house were about to decline, he sighed and said, "As we move into this declining [astral] configuration, those who hold eminent offices are in peril, and those of lofty talent will die. Winning glory in this present age is not something to be coveted." So he studied arts of the Dao. He understood particularly well [how to summon] the six ''jia'' spirits, how to dispatch ghosts and other spirits, and how to sit down and call for the traveling canteen [坐致行廚]. (tr. Campany 2002: 279) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fifth, the ''Shenxian zhuan'' says that Liu Zheng (劉政) used the same alchemical text attributed to Mozi that the ''Baopuzi'' says was used by Liu Gen (劉根, or Liu Jun'an 劉君安, see Campany 2002: 240-249).
&lt;blockquote&gt;Later he arranged [a copy of] Master Mo's Treatise on the Five Phases (''Mozi wuxing ji'' 墨子五行記) and, [based on it], ingested "efflorescence of vermilion" pills. He lived for more than one hundred eighty years, and his complexion was that of a youth. He could transform himself into other shapes and conceal his form; multiply one person into a hundred or a hundred into a thousand or a thousand into ten thousand; conceal a military force of three brigades by forming them into a forest or into birds and beasts, so that they could easily take their opponents' weapons without their knowledge. Further, he was capable of planting fruits of all types and causing them immediately to flower and ripen so as to be ready to eat. He could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive [生致行廚], setting out a complete meal for up to several hundred people. His mere whistling could create a wind to set dust swirling and blow stones about. (tr. Campany 2002: 322) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Transcendental whistling]] was an ancient Daoist yogic technique.

Sixth, the brief hagiography of the female transcendent Taixuan nü (太玄女, Woman of the Grand Mystery) says.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Woman of the Grand Mystery was surnamed Zhuan 顓 and named He 和. While still young, she was bereaved of her husband, so she practiced the Way. Disciplining herself in the arts of the Jade Master, (Yuzi) she could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive [坐致行廚], and there was no sort of transformation she could not accomplish. (tr. Campany 2002: 367). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, the ''Shenxian zhuan'' hagiography for Mao Ying (茅盈) describes what sounds like a ''xingchu'' without using the name (Campany 2002: 328). After twenty years studying the Dao, Mao Ying returned home to his parents and announced that he had been commanded to enter heaven and become a transcendent. The people of his home village came to give him a going-away party, and Mao said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am touched by your sincere willingness to send me off, and I deeply appreciate your intention. But please come empty-handed; you need not make any expenditure. I have a means whereby to provide a feast for us all." On the appointed day, the guests all arrived, and a great banquet was held. Awnings of blue brocade were spread out, and layers of white felt were spread out beneath them. Rare delicacies and strange fruits were piled up and arrayed. Female entertainers provided music; the sounds of metal and stone mingled together, and the din shook Heaven and Earth; it could be heard from several ''li'' away. Of the more than one thousand guests present that day, none failed to leave intoxicated and sated. (tr. Campany 2002: 327) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mao Ying and his brothers Mao Gu (茅固) and Mao Zhong (茅衷) are considered of the founders of the [[Shangqing School]] of Daoism.

Shangqing Daoists took the stock literary phrase ''zuo zhi xingchu'' (坐致行廚)—used above in the ''Baopuzi'' for Liu Gen, "sits down and causes the Traveling Canteen to arrive" (tr. Ware), and in the ''Shenxian zhuan'' for Li Gen, Zuo Ci, and Taixuan nü, "sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive" (tr. Campany)—and actualized it as a visualization technique for "making the movable cuisines come [while] sitting [in meditation]" (tr. Mollier). "This method, accessible only to the initiate who possessed the proper series of talismans (''fu'' 符) and had mastered certain visualization techniques, conferred powers to become invisible, to cause thunder, and to call for rain." This form of [[zazen|sitting meditation]] was so popular during the Tang period that [[Chinese Esoteric Buddhism]] also adopted it. (Mollier 2008a: 280)

==''Wuchu'' Five Kitchens meditation== 
Following upon the Celestial Masters liturgical Kitchen feasts and ''xian'' transcendents' Mobile Kitchens, the third stage of Daoist ''chu'' traditions was the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) ''wǔchú'' (五廚, Five Kitchens) contemplation technique, which recast the concept of ritual banquets in terms of psychophysiological ''[[neidan]]'' Internal Alchemy (Verellen 2004: 351). In Chinese cosmological [[Wu Xing|wuxing]] Five Phases correspondence theory, the ''wuchu'' Five Kitchens or ''wuzang'' (五臟, Five Viscera / Orbs) system includes not only the physiological internal organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and spleen), but also the associated psychological range of mental and emotional states (Roth 1999: 41-42). The 735 ''Wuchu jing'' (五廚經, Scripture of the Five Kitchens), which poetically describes a visualization practice for circulating ''[[qi]]'' energies through the Five Viscera, was so popular that Tang Buddhists forged the esoteric ''Sānchú jīng'' (三廚經, Sutra of the Three Kitchens) based on the Daoist text (Mollier 2008b: 1051).

There are two extant editions of ''Wuchu jing'' (translated by Kohn 2010: 198-206). First, the 763 Tang ''[[Daozang]]'' (Daoist Canon) edition titled ''Laozi shuo Wuchu jing zhu'' (老子說五廚經, Commentary to the Scripture of the Five Kitchens as Revealed by [[Laozi]]) contains a preface dated 735 and a commentary, both signed by Yin Yin (尹愔, d. 741). The [[List of people with reduplicated names|reduplicatedly named]] Yin Yin was a prominent Daoist and Confucian scholar under [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (r. 712-756), and abbot of the Suming guan (肅明觀, Abbey of Reviving Light) temple in the capital [[Chang'an]]. The late Tang [[Way of the Celestial Masters|Celestial Master]] Zhao Xianfu (趙仙甫, fl. 732) also wrote a commentary (Verellen 2004: 351). Second, the 1019 ''[[Yunji Qiqian]]'' (Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel) anthology edition titled ''Wuchu jing qifa'' (五廚經氣法, Energetic Methods of the Scripture of the Five Kitchens), also includes Yin's commentary, with slight variations, such as noting the text was presented to the emperor in 736 (Verellen 2004: 351). The ''qi'' "energetic" methods of the text are recommended by [[Zuowanglun#Author|Sima Chengzhen]] (司馬承禎, 647–735) in his ''Fuqi jingyi lun'' (服氣精義論, Essay on the Essential Meaning of Breath Ingestion) text on physical self-cultivation (Mollier 2008b: 1051). Although the presence of Yin's preface might suggest a Tang date for the ''Wuchu jing'', the origins of this text may be much earlier. [[Ge Hong]]'s c. 318 ''Baopuzi'' mentions a ''Xingchu jing'' (行廚經, Scripture of the Movable Kitchens) and a ''Riyue chushi jing'' (日月廚食經, Scripture of the Kitchen Meals for the Sun and the Moon), which could be the ancestors of the received texts (Mollier 2008b: 1051). 

The c. 905 ''Daojiao lingyan ji'' (道教靈驗記, Record of Daoist Miracles, written by the Daoist priest, author, and court official [[Du Guangting]], says a [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] fraudulently transformed the ''Wuchu jing'' Scripture of the Five Kitchens into the ''Sanchu jing'' (三廚經, Sutra of the Three Kitchens). Du records that the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] of the Tang period contained a text titled ''Fo shuo san tingchu jing'' (佛說三停廚經, Sutra of the Three Interrupted Kitchens, Preached by the Buddha) (Verellen I992: 248-249). According to Du Guangting, the monk Xingduan (行端), who had "a presumptuous and fraudulent disposition", saw that the widely-circulated Daoist ''Wuchu jing'' consisted of five stanzas (''jì'' 偈, "''[[gatha]]''; poetic verse; versified utterance") of incantations (''zhòu'' 咒, "''[[mantra]]''; religious incantation; mystical invocation"), rearranged them, and expanded the title into ''Fo shuo san tingchu jing'' (佛說三停廚經). "The five incantations he turned into 'five sutras spoken by [[Tathagata]],' and at the end he added a hymn. The additional phrases amounted to no less than a page." Verellen suggests that the scripture, with its "Buddho-Daoist content and quasi-magical use", originated as a late [[Six Dynasties]] (220-589) Tantric ''zhoujing'' (咒經, "incantations scripture", cf. the ''[[Divine Incantations Scripture]]''). (1992: 250-51).

Du Guangting gives a lengthy narrative about the Daoist miracle involving supernatural retribution for Xingduan's forgery. One day after the monk had already given several copies of the altered scripture to others, a "divine being eight or nine feet tall" and holding a sword reprimands him for the counterfeiting and brandishes his sword to strike the monk. As Xingduan "wards off the blow with his hand, several fingers are lopped off", he begs for mercy, and the Daoist deity agrees to spare his life if he retrieves and destroys all the fakes. Xingduan and his companions search everywhere for the texts, but can only find half of them, the remainder having already been carried abroad by Buddhist monks. Xingduan prepares ten fresh copies of the original scripture, offers incense, repents, and burns the altered copies. Then the divine being reappears and announces: "Having vilified the sage's text, restitution won't save you—you do not deserve to escape death", the monk falls prostrate and dies on the spot (Verellen 1992: 251). 

In the present day, early copies of this apocryphal Buddhist sutra have been preserved. Four textual versions were discovered in the Chinese [[Dunhuang manuscripts]], two versions, dated 1099 and 1270, are kept in the Japanese [[Koyasan Reihōkan|Mount Kōya]] manuscripts. In addition, the modern Japanese [[Taishō Tripiṭaka]] canon includes the text (Mollier 2009: 26-28).

The highly abstract ''Wuchu jing'' mystical poem comprises five stanzas consisting of four five-character lines each. The ''Yunqi qiqian'' edition shows that the five stanzas were associated with the Five Directions of space: east (lines 1-4), south (lines 5-8), north (lines 9-12), west (lines 13-16), and center (lines 17-20) (Verellen 2004: 351). For example, the first four lines (tr. Kohn 2010: 200-201):
{{Verse translation|lang=zh|italicsoff=y|rtl1=y|一氣和泰和
得一道皆泰
和乃無一和
玄理同玄際
|The ''qi'' of universal oneness merges with the harmony of cosmic peace. 
Attaining universal oneness, Dao rests in cosmic peace.
Cosmic harmony really is neither universal oneness nor harmony.
Mysterious cosmic order joins the mysterious moment of eternity.
}}

The content of the ''Wuchu jing'' guides adepts toward a detached mental state of non-thinking and equanimity. The Five Kitchens refer to ''neidan'' Internal Alchemy "''qi''-processing on a subtle-body level", and signify the energetic, transformative power of the Five Viscera (Kohn 2010: 71). Yin Yin's introduction says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;As long as you dwell in the ''qi'' of universal oneness [一氣] and in the harmony of cosmic peace [泰和], the five organs [五臟] are abundant and full and the five spirits [五神] are still and upright. "When the five organs are abundant, all sensory experiences are satisfied; when the five spirits are still, all cravings and desires are eliminated. This scripture expounds on how the five organs taking in ''qi'' is like someone looking for food in a kitchen. Thus, its title: "Scripture of the Five Kitchens." (tr. Kohn 2010: 200) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Commenting on Yin's interpretation, Du Guangting claims more explicitly that practicing this scripture will enable an adept to stop eating. (Verellen 2004: 352)

Techniques in the ''Wuchu jing'' (五廚經, Scripture of the Five Kitchens) mainly involve visualizing the Five Viscera of the body and chanting incantations. These methods supposedly allow the adept to obtain satisfaction and harmony, and, after some years of training, even transcendence (Mollier 2008a: 279-280). Despite this concern with the human body, the text strongly emphasizes mental restructuring over physical practices, saying that "accumulating cultivation will not get you to detachment" and that methods of ingestion are ultimately useless. However, reciting the scripture is beneficial, especially if combined with mental and ethical practices, so that "you will easily get the true essentials of cultivating the body-self and protecting life." More specifically, chanting the text one hundred times and practicing the harmonization of the five ''qi'' allows adepts to abstain from grain and eliminate hunger (Mollier 1999: 62-63). Many present-day Daoists consider the ''Wuchu jing'' as a talismanic text to be chanted for protection (Kohn 2010: 71).

'''''Ciubotaru v. Moldova''''' (application No. 27138/04) was a case decided by [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2010. Ciubotaru sought to have his ethnicity changed from [[Moldova]]n to [[Romania]]n on his birth and marriage certificates, which Moldova refused. The Court found that Moldova's procedure for changing ethnicity of record violated [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8 (right to private life)]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

==Background==
In 2002, when applying to have his old [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] identity card replaced with a Moldovan one, Mr. Ciubotaru submitted that his ethnicity was Romanian. As he was told that his application would not be accepted unless he indicated Moldovan ethnicity, as in his and his parents' Soviet documents, he complied.

Afterwards he requested the relevant State authority to change his ethnic identity entry from “Moldovan” to “Romanian”. His request was refused with the argument that since his parents had not been recorded as ethnic Romanians in their birth and marriage certificates, it was impossible for him to be recorded as an ethnic Romanian. He was advised to search the archives for traces of Romanian origin of his ancestors. Appeals to domestic courts were refused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867119&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Judgment (Paras. 6-13)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==

The Court found for Ciubotaru. The Court explained that it understood that authorities should be able to refuse a claim to change ethnicity of record when the claim is based purely on unsubstantiated subjective grounds. However, Moldova's legal requirements created insurmountable barriers on an individual wishing to record an ethnicity other than the ethnicity that Soviet authorities defined for the individual's parents. The Court also found that Ciubotaru's claim was based on more than merely subjective grounds, as Ciubotaru could produce objectively verifiable links with [[Romanians|Romanian ethnic groups]]. Evidence such as language, name, and empathy cannot be relied on under Moldovan law in force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867119&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Judgment (Paras. 57-58)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court concluded, that the procedure of changing ethnicity record violated Article 8 (right to private life) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and ordered Moldova to pay the applicant 5,000 [[Euros]].

==Concurrence==

Judge Mijović filed a concurring opinion, pointing that ''I consider self-identification primarily as a matter of personal perception rather than a matter based on objective grounds, and that is why I do not share the Chamber's reasoning in the judgment''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867119&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Judgment (concurring opinion of Judge Mijović)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clinical lycanthropy''' is defined as a rare [[psychiatric]] syndrome that involves a [[delusion]] that the affected person can transform into, has transformed into, or is a non-human [[animal]].&lt;ref name=Garlipp&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Garlipp P, Gödecke-Koch T, Dietrich DE, Haltenhof H |title=Lycanthropy--psychopathological and psychodynamical aspects |journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=19–22 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14674954 |doi=10.1046/j.1600-0447.2003.00243.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0001-690X&amp;date=2004&amp;volume=109&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name is associated with the [[mythology|mythical]] condition of [[lycanthropy]], a [[supernatural]] affliction in which humans are said to physically [[shapeshift]] into wolves. It is purported to be a rare disorder.&lt;ref name="Degroot"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.J.M. |last=Degroot |title=Religious System of China |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |pages=484 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
Affected individuals believe that they are in the process of transforming into an animal or have already transformed into an animal. It has been associated with the altered states of mind that accompany [[psychosis]] (the [[:wikt:mental state|mental state]] that typically involves delusions and [[hallucination]]s) with the [[Shapeshifting|transformation]] only seeming to happen in the mind and [[behavior]] of the affected person.

A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keck PE, Pope HG, Hudson JI, McElroy SL, Kulick AR |title=Lycanthropy: alive and well in the twentieth century |journal=Psychol Med |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=113–20 |date=February 1988 |pmid=3363031 |doi=10.1017/S003329170000194X}}&lt;/ref&gt; on lycanthropy from the [[McLean Hospital]] reported on a series of cases and proposed some diagnostic criteria by which lycanthropy could be recognised:

* A patient reports in a moment of lucidity or reminiscence that they sometimes feel as an animal or have felt like one.
* A patient behaves in a manner that resembles animal behavior, for example howling, growling, or crawling.

According to these criteria, either a delusional belief in current or past transformation or behavior that suggests a person thinks of themselves as transformed is considered evidence of clinical lycanthropy. The authors note that, although the condition seems to be an expression of psychosis, there is no specific diagnosis of [[mental illness|mental]] or [[neurology|neurological illness]] associated with its behavioral consequences.

It also seems that lycanthropy is not specific to an experience of human-to-wolf transformation; a wide variety of creatures have been reported as part of the shape-shifting experience. A review&lt;ref name=Garlipp/&gt; of the medical literature from early 2004 lists over thirty published cases of lycanthropy, only the minority of which have [[wolf]] or [[dog]] themes. Canines are certainly not uncommon, although the experience of being transformed into a [[hyena]], [[cat]], [[horse]], [[bird]] or [[tiger]] has been reported on more than one occasion. Transformation into [[frog]]s, and even [[bee]]s, has been reported in some instances. In Japan, transformation into [[fox]]es and dogs was usual ([[:ja:狐憑き]], [[:ja:犬神]]). A 1989 case study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dening TR, West A |title=Multiple Serial Lycanthropy. A Case Report |journal=Psychopathology |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=344–7 |year=1989 |pmid=2639384 |doi=10.1159/000284617}}&lt;/ref&gt; described how one individual reported a serial transformation, experiencing a change from human to dog, to horse, and then finally cat, before returning to the reality of human existence after treatment. There are also reports of people who experienced transformation into an animal only listed as "unspecified".

There is a case study of a psychiatric patient who had both clinical lycanthropy and [[Cotard delusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Nejad, A. G., Toofani, K. (2005). "Co-Existence of Lycanthropy and Cotard's Syndrome in a Single Case". ''Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica'' 111: 250–252.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''ophidianthropy'' refers to the delusion that one has been transformed into a snake. Two case studies have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;Kattimani, S, Menon, V., Srivastava, M.K. &amp; Aniruddha Mukharjee, A. (2010). [http://www.priory.com/psychiatry/ophidianthropy.htm "Ophidianthropy: The Case of a Woman Who 'Turned into a Snake{{'"}}] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416100712/http://www.priory.com//psychiatry/ophidianthropy.htm |date=2014-04-16 }}. Psychiatry Reports.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mondal ''et al''. (2014). "The 'Snake' Man: Ophidianthropy in a Case of Schizophrenia, Along With Literature Review". ''Asian Journal of Psychiatry'' 12: 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed mechanisms==
Clinical lycanthropy is a rare condition and is largely considered to be an idiosyncratic expression of a psychotic episode caused by another condition such as [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]] or [[clinical depression]].

However, there are suggestions that certain [[neurological]] conditions and [[culture|cultural]] influences may result in the expression of the human-animal transformation theme that defines the condition.

===Neurological factors===
One important factor may be differences or changes in parts of the [[human brain|brain]] known to be involved in representing body shape (e.g., see [[proprioception]] and [[body image]]). A [[neuroimaging]] study of two people diagnosed with clinical lycanthropy showed that these areas display unusual activation, suggesting that when people report their bodies are changing shape, they may be genuinely perceiving those feelings.&lt;ref name="Moselhy 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moselhy HF |title=Lycanthropy: New Evidence of its Origin |journal=Psychopathology |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=173–176 |year=1999 |pmid=10364725 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=psp32173 |doi=10.1159/000029086 |access-date=2009-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615022547/http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=psp32173 |archive-date=2011-06-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related disorders==
In rare cases, individuals may believe that other people have transformed into animals.&lt;ref name="Nejad 2007"&gt;Nejad, A. G. (2007). ''Belief in Transforming Another Person into a Wolf: Could it be a Variant of Lycanthropy?'' Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica 115: 159–161.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been termed "lycanthropic intermetamorphosis"{{r|Moselhy 1999}} and "lycanthropy spectrum".{{r|Nejad 2007}} A 2009 study reported that, after the consumption of the drug [[MDMA]] (Ecstasy), a man displayed symptoms of paranoid psychosis by claiming that his relatives had changed into various animals such as a [[boar]], a [[donkey]] and a [[horse]].&lt;ref&gt;Nasirian ''et al''. (2009). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3905497/ "Rare Variant of Lycanthropy and Ecstasy"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726094149/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3905497/ |date=2018-07-26 }}. ''Addiction and Health'' 1: 53–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Catherine Clark Kroeger has written that several parts of the [[Bible]] refer to [[Nebuchadnezzar II|King Nebuchadnezzar]]'s behavior in the book of Daniel 4 as a being manifestation of clinical lycanthropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kroeger, Catherine Clark |title=The Women's Study Bible: New Living Translation |year=2009 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-529125-4 |edition=Second |author2=Evans, Mary J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKT7ftnh0xYC&amp;pg=PA1003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurologist Andrew J. Larner has written that the fate of [[Odysseus]]'s crew due to the magic of Circe may be one of the earliest examples of clinical lycanthropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larner |first=Andrew J |title=Neurological Signs: Lycanthropy |journal=Advances in Clinical Neuroscience and Rehabilitation |date=September–October 2010 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=50 |accessdate=6 January 2012 |url=http://www.acnr.co.uk/SO10/ACNRSO10_50_neuro_signs.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030105014/http://www.acnr.co.uk/SO10/ACNRSO10_50_neuro_signs.pdf |archive-date=30 October 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, it is believed that the king of [[Armenia]] [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]] also suffered from this disorder. He was cured by [[Gregory the Illuminator]]. As a sign of gratitude, Tiridates proclaimed [[Christianity]] as the state religion during 301, thus making Armenia the first Christian state.

According to [[Persian literature|Persian tradition]], the [[Buyid]] prince [[Majd ad-Dawla]] was suffering from an illusion [[Boanthropy|that he was a cow]]. He was cured by [[Avicenna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://article.tebyan.net/72602/%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%87-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A2%D9%86-%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A8-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%AE%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%A7-%D8%B1%D8%A7 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612031430/http://article.tebyan.net/72602/%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%87-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A2%D9%86-%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A8-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%AE%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%A7-%D8%B1%D8%A7 |archive-date=2017-06-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notions that lycanthropy was due to a medical condition go back to the seventh century, when the Alexandrian physician Paulus Aegineta attributed lycanthropy to [[Melancholia]] or an "excess of black bile".{{sfn|Sconduto|2008|p=131}} During 1563, a Lutheran physician named Johann Weyer wrote that werewolves suffered from an imbalance in their melancholic humour and exhibited the physical symptoms of paleness, "a dry tongue and a great thirst" as well as sunken, dim and dry eyes.{{sfn|Sconduto|2008|p=131}} Even King [[James VI and I]] in his 1597 treatise ''[[Daemonologie]]'' does not blame werewolf behaviour on delusions created by the Devil but "an excess of melancholy as the culprit which causes some men to believe that they are wolves and to 'counterfeit' the actions of these animals".{{sfn|Sconduto|2008|p=156}} The perception of an association between mental illness and animalistic behaviour can be traced throughout the history of folklore from many different countries.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, N.

A '''clip show''' is an episode of a [[Television program|television series]] that consists primarily of excerpts from previous episodes. Most clip shows feature the format of a [[frame story]] in which cast members recall past events from past installments of the show, depicted with a clip of the event presented as a [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]].  Clip shows are also known as '''cheaters''', particularly in the field of animation. Clip shows are often played before [[series finale]]s, or once [[100 episodes|syndication becomes highly likely]]. Other times, however, clip shows are simply produced for budgetary reasons (i.e. to avoid additional costs from shooting in a certain setting, or from casting actors to appear in new material).

==Origin==
Clip shows have their origin in theatrical [[short film]]s and [[Serial (film)|serials]]. Every serial chapter always had a brief recap showing where the previous chapter left off, but, beginning in 1936, entire chapters were largely devoted to material that audiences had already seen. In these '''recap chapters''' (also called "economy chapters"),
previous chapters were summarized for those who may have missed some episodes (which were unlikely to be rerun). The practice began with the [[Republic Pictures]] serial ''[[Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island]]''. Adverse weather conditions slowed the filming of this outdoor adventure budgeted for 12 chapters, and screenwriter Barry Shipman was forced to create two more chapters to recoup the lost production costs. Shipman wrote a few scenes in which the screen characters recount their adventures to date, and [[stock footage]] from previous chapters is shown instead of new sequences. Shipman's brainstorm was a convenient way to economize on production, and soon Republic made the recap chapter standard procedure.

Movie studios often resorted to old footage to save money. The most famous example is the short comedies of [[The Three Stooges]] which, from 1949 until 1957, borrowed lengthy sequences and often entire storylines from old shorts. Only a few new scenes would be filmed as a framework for the old footage. This practice was  adopted because the studios could charge more money for "new" films than for old ones.

Animation studios were also known to periodically make cartoon shorts - often referred to as "cheaters" - made up primarily of clips for earlier cartoons in order to save money. Examples of this include ''[[Betty Boop's Rise to Fame]]'' ([[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer]]/[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], 1934), ''[[What's Cookin' Doc?]]'' (1944, [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Schlesinger]]/[[Warner Bros.]]) and a regular yearly series of ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry]]'' "cheaters" such as ''[[Smitten Kitten]]'' (1952, [[MGM cartoon studio|MGM]]).

==Variations==
One variant of the modern clip show is the '''compilation episode''', using clips from the most popular episodes, assembled together in one episode, sometimes without a frame story as such.

Another format is to have a host who describes various characters and characteristics of the show to introduce various clips from past episodes. For example, a special one-hour clip show episode of ''[[All in the Family]]'' featured actor [[Henry Fonda]] discussing the main characters on the show followed by relevant clips from previous episodes; a similar two-part clip show appeared on ''[[Three's Company]]'', hosted by [[Lucille Ball]]. This format was parodied in a clip show for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ("[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]"), in which fictional actor [[Troy McClure]]&amp;mdash;a recurring ''Simpsons'' character&amp;mdash;introduced the clips.

A third variation, used in a two-part clip show episode of ''[[Cheers]]'' featured the entire cast of the show, including former cast members, sitting on a stage while being interviewed by talk host [[John McLaughlin (host)|John McLaughlin]] about their characters on the show, with clips of previous episodes mixed in. A similar clip episode of ''[[Barney Miller]]'' aired after the death of cast member [[Jack Soo]], with flashbacks introduced by the rest of the cast highlighting Soo's character [[Detective Sergeant]] Nick Yamana.

''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'' had a flashback episode 2 episodes in to the series. The two main leads reminisce on the previous episode and other adventures they went on. The episode was highly praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=98, Clerks: The Animated Series |url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/98.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2017-04-18 |date=2009-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119005244/http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/98.html |archivedate=2009-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' episode "The Ember Island Players", the show's main characters watch a play about themselves based upon the events of the series thus far. Although the episode contains no actual footage from previous episodes, the actors recount many scenes from the series and show all the significant plot events. "The Ember Island Players" was the last episode before the four-part series finale.

The [[NBC]] sitcom [[Community (TV series)|''Community'']] used the clip show format with the episode "[[Paradigms of Human Memory]]", but rather than using clips from previous episodes, the cut-away scenes in that episode were all newly shot. In some cases the clips were set in events of previous episodes, and in other cases the clips showed events that had never before occurred on the show, such as visiting an Old West ghost town, taking over for a glee club killed in a bus crash or going on a fishing trip. The creator of ''Community'', [[Dan Harmon]], used the same format in another one of his shows, ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', where all the clips were completely new and related to the episode, 'Total Rickall', in some way.

In [[anime]], a common type of episode is the '''Recap episode''', which presents clips from previous episodes in a manner to remind viewers of the story so far and help newer viewers catch up on the plot and details.

==Rationale==
While clip shows do reduce production costs, they were originally employed in an era when there were far fewer program outlets and it was less likely that episodes from previous seasons would be aired again. Clip shows typically received strong [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], and it was expected for any successful comedy series to feature clip shows regularly in its later years. However, the episodes were subject to some ridicule due to their forced or "corny" framing devices (such as a family sitting peacefully around a fireplace) and the frequently awkward transitions between the frame story and the clips (such as characters staring into space while the screen blurs to represent "remembering").{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Daytime [[soap operas]] frequently present clip shows as a way to commemorate a show's milestone anniversary or the death of a long-running character. Many fans take advantage of the shows in order to see vintage clips of a particular soap opera. One example was an episode of ''[[As the World Turns]]'' in which seven of the longest running characters were stranded in a forest and remembered some of their best moments, all in honor of ''AtWT''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 50th anniversary.

Another common rationale for a clip show is the lack of a new show to air, due to failure to meet production schedules. For example, the computer-animated series ''[[Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles]]'' used clip shows four times for this purpose, interrupting in-progress story arcs. Similarly, the ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' season 3 episode "The Straight Poop" helped to fill out a production schedule that was rife with delays: in 15 weeks since that season began, only 8 episodes of the "weekly" series had been broadcast. ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'' resorted to producing ''five'' clip shows (using material from only 25 episodes) over the course of its first two seasons.

Other times budgetary considerations force clip shows. At the end of its second season, ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' had one more episode to shoot. However, [[Paramount Television|Paramount]] cut that show's budget to make up for an episode earlier in the season that had gone over budget—and, similarly, over schedule, leaving only three days for [[principal photography]]. Because the season had gotten off to a slow start due to a [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|writers' strike]], the producers had no scripts set aside for future use as they normally would have.&lt;ref name="ST:TNG 365"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Block|first1=Paula M.|last2=Erdmann|first2=Terry J.|last3=Moore|first3=Ronald D.|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation 365|date=2012|publisher=Abrams|isbn=9781613124000|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCbTA9wMmEAC&amp;pg=PT330|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was "[[Shades of Gray (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Shades of Gray]]", in which the "clips" were the induced dreams of a comatose [[William T. Riker]]. The episode is widely considered among the worst of any ''[[Star Trek]]'' series.&lt;ref name="ST:TNG companion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nemecek|first1=Larry|title=The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion: Revised Edition|date=2003|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=9780743476577|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ah1k_EsaOHsC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clip shows today tend to offset such criticism by trying to make the frame tale surrounding the clips compelling, or by presenting clip shows without any framing device. A show might also diffuse the awkwardness by indulging in [[self-parody]], explicitly acknowledging or intentionally over-playing the device. Many series have included parody clip shows using "clips" from episodes which never happened.  The ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[City on the Edge of Forever (South Park)|City on the Edge of Forever]]" shows scenes from previous episodes, but the details are always wrong, and in the end, everyone gets ice cream.  As another example, ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'' ran a clip show as its second episode, even though there was only one prior episode from which to pull material.  The aforementioned ''Moonlighting'' clip episode, in typical fashion for the show, used a framing story that broke the [[fourth wall]] to determine if the characters themselves were the source of the show's notorious production delays, and ended with the characters promising a "new episode next week!".

The clip show has been employed more seriously as a means to bring viewers up to date on highly serialized dramas, such as on ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' and [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|the reimagined ''Battlestar Galactica'']]. Many [[anime]] dramas used similar techniques, particularly when a series ran for more episodes in one season than could be reasonably rerun (such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'' running for 49 episodes, which were originally aired weekly).

Sometimes clip shows air before or during a [[series finale]] as a way for audiences to reminisce about their favorite moments. Some examples of shows that have used clip shows in this sense are: ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Frasier]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''/''[[Stargate Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Cheers]]''.

Clip shows are also a way to compile the best episodes or sketches from a series to air in a single, concise package when rerunning a whole episode or series is implausible. The annual Scottish New Year special ''[[Scotch and Wry]]'' was condensed into four feature film-length episodes for home video release. ''[[Carson's Comedy Classics]]'' compiled memorable sketches from the first 20 seasons of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' for airing in syndication. Surviving content from [[Bozo the Clown]] and other Chicago children's television programs was incorporated into ''[[Bozo, Gar and Ray: WGN TV Classics]]'', an annual holiday special.

Pictured is an interior display area of the [[National Gallery of Canada]].]]
'''Cultural policy''' is the government [[public policy|actions, laws and programs]] that regulate, protect, encourage and financially (or otherwise) support activities related to [[the arts]] and creative sectors, such as [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[literature]], and [[filmmaking]], among others and [[culture]], which may involve activities related to language, heritage and diversity. The idea of cultural policy was developed at UNESCO in the 1960s.  Generally, this involves governments setting in place processes, legal classifications, regulations, legislation and institutions (e.g., [[Art museum|galleries]], [[museum]]s, [[library|libraries]], [[opera house]]s, etc.) which promote and facilitate [[cultural diversity]] and creative expressions in a range of art forms and creative activities. Cultural policies vary from one country to another, but generally they aim to improve the [[accessibility]] of arts and creative activities to citizens and promote the [[artistic]], [[music]]al, [[ethnic]], [[sociolinguistic]], [[literary]] and other expressions of all people in a country. In some countries, especially since the 1970s, there is an emphasis on supporting the culture of [[indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] peoples and marginalized communities and ensuring that cultural industries (e.g., filmmaking or TV production) are representative of a country's diverse [[cultural heritage]] and ethnic and linguistic demographics. 

Cultural policy can be done at a nation-state level, at a sub-national  level (e.g., U.S. states or Canadian provinces), at a regional level or at a municipal level (e.g., a city government creating a museum or arts centre). Examples of cultural policy-making at the nation-state level could include anything from funding [[music education]] or theatre programs at little to no cost, to hosting corporate-sponsored art exhibitions in a government museum, to establishing legal codes (such as the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]]’s [[501(c)(3)]] tax designation for [[not-for-profit]] enterprises) and creating political institutions (such as the various [[minister of culture|ministries of culture]] and departments of culture and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in the United States), arts granting councils, and cultural institutions such as galleries and museums. Similar significant organisations in the United Kingdom include the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), and Arts Council England.

Throughout much of the twentieth century, many of the activities that compose cultural policy in the 2010s were governed under the title of "[[arts policy]]". Arts policy includes direct funding to artists, creators and art institutions and indirect funding to artists and arts institutions through the tax system (e.g., by making donations to arts charities tax deductible). However, as [[Kevin V. Mulcahy|Kevin Mulcahy]] has observed, "cultural policy encompasses a much broader array of activities than were addressed under arts policy. Whereas arts policy was effectively limited to addressing aesthetic concerns (e.g., funding art galleries and opera houses), the significance of the transformation to cultural policy can be observed in its demonstrable emphases on [[cultural identity]], [[valorization]] of [[Indigenous people|indigineity]] [Indigenous people's culture] and analyses of historical dynamics (such as [[hegemony]] and [[colonialism]])."&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 2006. "What is Cultural Policy?"&lt;/ref&gt; A general trend in Western industrialized nations is a shift, since the 1970s and 1980s, away from solely supporting a small number of relatively elite, professionalized art forms and institutions (e.g., [[Classical music]], painting, sculpture, art galleries) to also supporting amateur and community cultural and creative activities (e.g., [[community theatre]]) and cultural  forms which were not considered part of the [[Western canon]] by previous generations (e.g., [[traditional music]] such as [[blues]], [[World music]], and so on).

==History==
Prior to the twentieth century, the arts were typically supported by the patronage of the church, aristocrats such as kings and queens, and wealthy merchants. During the nineteenth century, artists increased their use of the private marketplace to earn revenue. For example, the composer [[Beethoven]] put on public concerts for which admission was charged. During the twentieth century, governments began to take over some of the arts patronage roles. Governments' first efforts to support culture were typically the establishment of archives, museums and libraries. Over the twentieth century, governments established a range of other institutions, such as arts councils and departments of culture. The first departments of culture typically supported the major arts that are part of the [[Western canon]], such as painting and sculpture, and the major performing arts (Classical music and theatre).
===Arts policy===
[[File:Choreographed Opera Performance (Carmen by Bizet).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Due to [[opera]] productions' huge stage sets, use of many costumed singers and the requirement for an [[Pit orchestra|orchestra]], opera is one of the most expensive arts to produce. As a result, most opera companies in the 21st century require government funding to operate.]]
In the twentieth century, Western governments in the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many European nations developed arts policy measures to promote, support and protect the arts, artists and arts institutions. These governments' arts policy initiatives generally had two aims: supporting excellence in the arts and broadening access to the arts by citizens. &lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. ''The Economics of Cultural Policy''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 59-63 &lt;/ref&gt; An example of an arts policy initiative that supports excellence would be a government grant program which provides funding to the highest-achieving artists in the country. A concrete example would be a literary prize of $100,000 for the best fiction authors from the country, as selected by a panel of top experts. An example of an arts policy initiative that aims at increasing access to the arts would be a music in the schools program funded by the government. A concrete example would be a program which funded an [[orchestra]] or [[jazz quartet]] and paid them to play free concerts in elementary schools. This would enable children from lower- and middle-income families to hear live music. 

The two goals, supporting excellence and broadening access, are often [[trade-off]]s, as any increase in emphasis on one policy objective typically has an adverse effect on the other goal.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. ''The Economics of Cultural Policy''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 59-63 &lt;/ref&gt; To give an example, if a hypothetical country has a $12 million per year grant program for [[orchestra]]s in the country, if the government focuses on the goal of supporting musical excellence, it may decide to provide $4 million per year to the three top orchestras in the country, as determined by a panel of independent professional [[music critic]]s, conductors and music professors. This decision would strongly support the goal of enhancing excellence, as funding would only go to the top musical groups. However, this approach would only enable citizens in three cities to have access to professional orchestras.

On the other hand, if the government was focusing on broadening access to symphony concerts, it might direct the independent panel to pick 12 orchestras in the country, with the stipulation that only one orchestra per city be selected. By proving $1 million per year to 12 orchestras in 12 cities, this would enable citizens from 12 cities in the country to see live orchestra shows. However, by funding 12 orchestras, this would mean that funding would go to ensembles that do not meet the highest standards of excellence. Thus, excellence and broadening access are often trade-offs.

==Theoretical approaches==
[[File:The Railway Museum 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A railway museum in Japan displays antique locomotives.]]
Cultural policy, while a small part of the budgets of even the most generous of governments, governs a sector of immense complexity.  It entails “a large, heterogeneous set of individuals and organizations engaged in the creation, production, presentation, distribution, and preservation of and education about aesthetic heritage, and entertainment activities, products and artifacts”.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 2002. “Arts and Culture.” in &lt;u&gt;The State of Nonprofit America&lt;/u&gt;. ed. Lester M. Salamon. Washington D.C.: Brookings University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A cultural policy necessarily encompasses a broad array of activities and typically involves public support for:
* Heritage, battlefield and historic preservation sites
* Zoos, botanical gardens, arboretums, aquariums, parks
* Libraries and museums (fine arts, scientific, historical)
* [[Visual arts]] (film, painting, sculpture, pottery, architecture)
* [[Performing arts]] (symphonic, chamber and choral music; jazz, hip-hop and folk music; ballet, ballroom and modern dance; opera and musical theatre; circus performances, rodeos and marching bands)&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida, Yukihiko,　''Jane Barlow and Witaly Osins, ballet teachers who worked in postwar Japan, and their students'', Pan-Asian Journal of Sports &amp; Physical Education, Vol.3(Sep), 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Public humanities]] programs ([[public broadcasting]], [[creative writing]], [[poetry]])

Some governments may place policy areas from this list in other ministries or departments. For example, national parks may be assigned to an environment department, or public humanities may be delegated to an education department.  

Since culture is a [[public good]] (i.e., contributes a public value to society for which it is hard to exclude non-payers, as all of society benefits from arts and culture) and something that is generally viewed as a [[merit good]], governments have pursued programs to promote greater accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;d'Angelo, Mario and Vesperini, Paul. 1999. Cultural Policies in Europe: Method and Practice of Evaluation, Council of Europe Publishing, Strasbourg&lt;/ref&gt; In this way of thinking, significant aesthetic works such as paintings and sculptures should be made broadly available to the public. In other words, “high culture” should not be the exclusive preserve of a particular social class or of a metropolitan location. Rather, the benefits of the highest reaches of cultural excellence should be made in an egalitarian manner; national cultural treasures should be accessible without regard to the impediments of class circumstances, educational attainment or place of habitation. A democratic state cannot be seen as simply indulging the aesthetic preferences of a few, however enlightened, or of overtly infusing art with political values. Consequently, a democratic cultural policy must articulate its purposes in ways that demonstrate how the public interest is being served. These purposes have often been expressed as involving either the creation of [[cultural democracy]] or the [[democratization of culture]].

The objective of cultural democratization is the aesthetic enlightenment, enhanced dignity, and educational development of the general citizenry. “Dissemination was the key concept with the aim of establishing equal opportunity for all citizens to participate in publicly organized and financed cultural activities”.&lt;ref&gt;Duelund, Peter. 2001. “Cultural Policy in Denmark.” ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 31: 34-57.&lt;/ref&gt; To further this goal, performances and exhibitions are low cost; public art education promotes equality of aesthetic opportunity; national institutions tour and perform in work places, retirement homes and housing complexes.

As indicated earlier, the “democratization of culture” is a top-down approach that promulgates certain forms of cultural programming that are deemed to be a public good. Clearly, such an objective is open to criticism for what is termed cultural [[elitism]]; that is, the assumption that some aesthetic expressions are inherently superior - at least as determined by a cognoscenti concerned with the acquisition of [[cultural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1984. &lt;u&gt;Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste&lt;/u&gt;. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; “The problem with this policy [is] that, fundamentally, it intend[s] to create larger audiences for performances whose content [is] based on the experience of society’s privileged groups. In sum, it has… taken for granted that the cultural needs of all society’s members [are] alike”.&lt;ref&gt;Langsted, Jorn, ed. 1990. &lt;u&gt;Strategies: Studies in Modern Cultural Policy&lt;/u&gt;. Aarhus University Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of cultural democracy, on the other hand, is to provide for a more participatory (or populist) approach in the definition and provision of cultural opportunities.

The coupling of the concept of democratization of culture to cultural democracy has a pragmatic as well as a philosophical component. [[Cultural patronage]] in democratic governments is markedly different from patronage by wealthy individuals or corporations. Private or politically paramount patrons are responsible only to themselves and are free to indulge in their tastes and preferences. Democratic governments, on the other hand, are responsible to the electorate and are held accountable for their policy decisions.

The two objectives just discussed - dissemination of high culture and participation in a broader range of cultural activities - evoke a related debate about the content of public culture: “[[elitist]]” or “[[populism|populist]].” 
===Elitism===
Proponents of the elitist position argue that cultural policy should emphasize aesthetic quality as the determining criterion for public subvention. This view is typically supported by the major cultural organizations, creative artists in the traditionally defined field of the fine arts, cultural critics, and the well-educated, well-to-do audiences for these art forms. [[Ronald Dworkin]] terms this the “lofty approach,” which “insists that art and culture must reach a certain degree of sophistication, richness, and excellence in order for human nature to flourish, and that the state must provide this excellence if the people will not or cannot provide it for themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Ronald. 1985. “Can a Liberal State Support Art?” in &lt;u&gt;A Matter of Principle&lt;/u&gt;. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 221-233.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the elitist position generally focus on supporting the creation, preservation and performance of works of the [[Western canon]], a group of artworks that are viewed as the best artistic and cultural products of Western society.

===Populism===
By contrast, the populist position advocates defining culture broadly and inclusively and making this culture broadly available.  The populist approach emphasizes a less traditional and more pluralist notion of artistic merit and consciously seeks to create a policy of cultural diversity. With a focus on personal enhancement, the populist’s position posits very limited boundaries between amateur and professional arts activities. Indeed, the goal is to provide opportunities for those outside the professional mainstream. To give an example, whereas an elite approach advocates support for professional musicians, particularly those from [[Classical music]], a populist approach would advocate support for amateur, community singers and musicians.

“Proponents of populism are frequently advocates of minority arts, [[folk arts]], ethnic arts, or [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] activities” as Kevin V. Mulcahy said.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 1982. “Controversies in Arts Policymaking.” in &lt;u&gt;Public Policy and the Arts&lt;/u&gt;. eds. Kevin V. Mulcahy and C. Richard Swaim. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural “elitists,” on the other hand, argue in support of excellence over amateurism and favor an emphasis on aesthetic discipline over “culture as everything.” There are “two key tensions for national cultural policy between the goals of excellence versus access, and between government roles as facilitator versus architect”.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, Jennifer; McAllister, Libby; and Davis, Glyn. 2003. “Paradoxes and Contradictions in Government Approaches to Contemporary Cultural Policy: An Australian Perspective.” ''The International Journal of Cultural Policy''. 9: 17-34.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Kevin V. Mulcahy argued that in effect, elitism is cultural democracy as populism is to the democratization of culture. Unfortunately, there has been a tendency to see these positions as mutually exclusive, rather than complementary. “Elitists” are denounced as “high brow snobs” advocating an esoteric culture which focuses on [[art music]] and the types of art seen in museums and galleries; populists are dismissed as “pandering philistines” promoting a trivialized and commercialized culture, as they endorse the value of [[popular music]] and [[folk art]]. However, these mutual stereotypes belie complementariness between two bookends of an artistically autonomous and politically accountable cultural policy. There is a synthesis that can be termed a “latitudinarian approach” to public culture; that is, one that is aesthetically inclusive and broadly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin V. Mulcahy|Mulcahy, Kevin V.]] 1995b. “The NEA and the Reauthorization Process: Congress and Arts Policy Issues.” in Mulcahy and Wyszomirski, &lt;u&gt;America’s Commitment to Culture&lt;/u&gt;. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 1995c. “The Public Interest and Arts Policy.” in Mulcahy and Wyszomirski, &lt;u&gt;America’s Commitment to Culture&lt;/u&gt;. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewpoints==
Such a public-cultural policy would remain faithful to the highest standards of excellence from a broad range of aesthetic expressions while providing the widest possible access to people from different geographic locales, socio-economic strata, and educational background, as Dr. Mulcahy said.&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 1991. “The Public Interest in Public Culture.” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 21: 5-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In conceiving of public policy as an opportunity to provide alternatives not readily available in the marketplace, public cultural agencies would be better positioned to complement the efforts of the private sector rather than duplicate their activities.  Similarly, cultural agencies can promote [[community development]] by supporting artistic heritages that are at a competitive disadvantage in a cultural world that is increasingly profit-driven. In sum, excellence should be viewed as the achievements of greatness from a horizontal, rather than a vertical, perspective and a cultural policy as supporting the totality of these varieties of excellence.

These attitudes about a public cultural responsibility stand in marked contrast to much of the rest of the world, where culture is a question of historic patrimony, or the national identities of peoples, whether in independent states or regions within more powerful states. Inevitably, sensitive issues are involved in any discussion of culture as a public policy. However, given the demands in a democratic system that public policies show a return to the taxpayer, cultural policy has frequently argued for support on the basis of utility. It can be argued that there is a parity between the state’s responsibility for its citi’ social-economic-physical needs and their access to culture and opportunities for artistic self-expression. However, the aesthetic dimension of public policy has never been widely perceived as intuitively obvious or politically imperative. Accordingly, the cultural sector has often argued its case from the secondary, ancillary benefits that result from public support for programs that are seemingly only aesthetic in nature. Cultural policy is not typically justified solely on the grounds that it is a good-in-itself, but rather that it yields other good results.

The future of cultural policy would seem to predict an increasingly inexorable demand that the arts “carry their own weight” rather than rely on a public subsidy to pursue “art for art’s sake”.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 1995a. “Federal Cultural Support: Toward a New Paradigm?” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society''. 25: 69-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin V. Mulcahy dubbed this “cultural [[Darwinism]]” is most pronounced in the United States where public subsidy is limited and publicly supported aesthetic activities are expected to demonstrate a direct public benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 2003. “The State Arts Agency: An Overview of Cultural Federalism in the United States.” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 32: 67-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-American cultural institutions are less constrained by the need to maintain diversified revenue streams that demand high levels of earned income and individual and corporate donations to compensate for limited government appropriations.

On the other hand, cultural institutions everywhere are increasingly market-driven in their need for supplementary funds and as a justification for continued public support. The American model of an essentially [[privatization|privatized]] culture is increasingly attractive to governments seeking to curtail their cultural subsidies. In a system of [[mixed funding]], public culture can nurture the arts groups and cultural activities that contribute to individual self-worth and community definition even if counting for less in the economic bottom-line. At root, a cultural policy is about creating public spheres that are not dependent upon [[profit motive]]s nor validated by commercial values. As political democracy is dependent upon the existence of civil society and socio-economic pluralism, cultural policy stands as an essential public commitment in realizing these fundamental preconditions.

One of the available and yet underappreciated tools in cultural policy at the national level is the reduction of VAT rates for cultural goods and services. Economic theory can be used to explain how reduced fiscal rates are expected to decrease prices and increase quantities of consumed cultural goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiecki, Karol J. and Trilce Navarette 2015. “[https://ideas.repec.org/p/cue/wpaper/awp-02-2015.html Fiscal and Economic Aspects of Book Consumption in the European Union].” ACEI Working Paper 02-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Fiscal policy can be an important part of cultural policy, in particular the VAT rate discounts on cultural consumption, yet it receives less attention than deserved.

==Scope==
At the international level [[UNESCO]] is in charge of cultural policy. Contact information for ministries of culture and national arts councils in 160 countries is available from the website of the [[International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies]] (IFACCA). On a local scale, subnational (e.g., state or provincial governments), city and local governments offer citizens and local authorities the opportunity to develop arts and culture with the Agenda 21 for Culture.

==Research==
Cultural policy research is a field of academic inquiry that grew out of [[cultural studies]] in the 1990s. It grew out of the idea that cultural studies should not only be critical, but also try to be useful.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Bennett, ''Culture, A reformer's Science'', SAGE, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, there are many departments of Cultural Policy Studies around the world.

'''''Encyclopedia of Hinduism''''', 1st ed., 2012, is a comprehensive, multi-volume, English language encyclopedia of [[Hinduism]], comprising ''{{IAST|Sanātana Dharma}}'', a [[Sanskrit]] phrase, meaning "the eternal [[dharma|law]]", or the "eternal way", that is used to refer to Hinduism, [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/Hinduism-is-an-intellectual-system-not-religion/Article1-899317.aspx|title=Hinduism is an intellectual system, not religion|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423060143/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/Hinduism-is-an-intellectual-system-not-religion/Article1-899317.aspx|archivedate=23 April 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a 7,184 page, 11-volume publication with full-color illustrations of temples, places, thinkers, rituals and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rupapublications.com/client/Book/Encyclopedia-of-Hinduism.aspx|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism Ed. Dr. Kapil Kapoor|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Rupa &amp; Co.]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' is an inspiration and dream project of Swami [[Chidanand Saraswati]], President of [[Parmarth Niketan]] and India Heritage Research Foundation. Under preparation for 25 years, it has been edited by Dr. [[Kapil Kapoor]] with contribution from over 2000 scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The Sunday Tribune - Books | url =http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120219/spectrum/book1.htm | accessdate = 5 March 2013| publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopaedia provides conceptual perspective and a general understanding of the different facets of Hinduism. It does not confine itself to religion alone, and has in it entries on art, history, language, literature, philosophy, polity, sciences, and women's studies. The editorial introduction records:

:"This encyclopaedia has been prepared to give a fairly comprehensive idea of an ancient way of life, a culture that has roots going back thousands of years and has been called ‘Hinduism’ in the last two hundred years of English discourse. It is a book of knowledge about facts, theories, systems, practices, institutions, beliefs, texts, thinkers and values of, what in fact is, a continuity of one of the two living knowledge cultures of the world, the Vedic (Semitic being the other). Hindu society has been a ‘knowledge society’  in its proper sense for at least 5000 years: the word ‘Veda’ itself means ‘knowledge'."

On 3–4 April 2010, a preview and blessings ceremony for the ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' was held at Parmarth Niketan, attended by [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]], M.M. Swami Gurusharananand, Swami Avdheshanand Giri, [[Ramesh Oza|Sant Shri Rameshbhai Oza]], [[Ramdev|Swami Ramdev]], [[Morari Bapu|Sant Shri Morari Bapu]] and other religious leaders as well as top political leaders, including [[L. K. Advani|Shri L.K. Advani]] and then-Chief Minister of Uttarakhand [[Ramesh Pokhriyal|Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank]], and IHRF board members and trustees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parmarth.com/updates/april2010.pdf April 2010 Special Newsletter] Parmarth Niketan&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Edition of the ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' was launched at the University of South Carolina on 26 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sc.edu/news/newsarticle.php?nid=6353#.VA7HJ2O6-Yg "USC to launch ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' Aug. 26"] University of South Carolina News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/hindi/multimedia/2013/08/130827_encyclopedia_hinduism_gal_sb.shtml 25 बरसों में संजोया हिन्दू धर्म का विश्वकोश] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigstory.ap.org/article/25-years-making-hindu-encyclopedia-complete 25 Years in Making, Hindu Encyclopedia Complete] Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' was presented to the President of India [[Pranab Mukherjee|Shri Pranab Mukherjee]] on 23 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=0 President of India receives a copy of ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism''] Press Information Bureau, Government of India, President's Secretariat, Press Release 23-06-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inception ==
The idea was conceived by Swami [[Chidanand Saraswati]], president of [[Parmarth Niketan]] Ashram, at a Hindu-Jain Temple in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1987. Subsequently, in November of the same year, the India Heritage Research Foundation was formed to execute the idea of preparing an authoritative, comprehensive and up-to-date ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =A Landmark Publication - Shri L. K. Advani | url =http://blog.lkadvani.in/blog-in-english/a-landmark-publication | accessdate = 5 March 2013| publisher=[[L. K. Advani]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. K. L. Seshagiri Rao, Professor Emeritus in Religious Studies at University of Virginia was appointed the Chief Editor.

== Development == 
Over the next five years, Swami Chidanand Saraswati and Dr. K. L. Seshagiri Rao assembled an international team of scholars. In 1998, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], Prime Minister of India at the time, spoke effusively in praise of the project:

:"Your undertaking is rightly called the 'Project of the Third Millennium.’ This is a monumental undertaking.  It is indeed a [[Jnana]] [[Yajna]].  Hence, all those who have offered their time, talent and scholarship as ahuti for the success of this [[Yajna]] deserve our heartiest applause and felicitations."

In early 2006, Dr. [[Kapil Kapoor]], Professor of English and Concurrent Professor of Sanskrit Studies who had retired as rector for [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]], Delhi the previous year, was appointed chief editor of the project.

== Foreword ==
The first volume of the encyclopedia contains a 44-page foreword by Dr. [[Karan Singh]]. In the opening paragraph, he writes:

:"Hinduism calls itself the Sanatana Dharma, the eternal faith, because it is based not upon the teachings of a single preceptor but on the collective wisdom and inspiration of great seers and sages from the very dawn of Indian civilization."

The closing comments of Dr. Singh's forward begin with the following note:

:"The long awaited publication of a massive eleven-volume ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' is a major publishing event. Many years of scholarship, organization and devotion have gone into the preparation of what will be a landmark in the history of Hindu research."

== Reviews == 
Indrajit Hazra, writing for ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', said its "entries are crisp, provide background and foreground, and come with a bibliography." The review goes on to add:

:"The production is excellent, as is the quality of images that are scattered across the volumes. With entries that include the ''Dhammapada'' (the main text of Theravada Buddhism), the 'Chipko movement' (the organised environmental movement to resist the destruction of forests in India'), as well as the 'Saura Mandala' (solar system), clearly, this is an encyclopedia that doesn't define 'Hinduism' in any narrow, proselytising way."

Hazra concludes his review by calling the encyclopedia "a startlingly good treasure trunk for anyone interested in the history of ideas to dip into." Former Home Minister of India [[L.K. Advani]] called the work "a landmark publication."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7695">'''Ethnic media''' is media fashioned with a particular [[ethnic minority]] group or ethnic minority community in mind.

== Definition ==
Academic Yu Shi tenders an operational definition for ethnic media: “Ethnic media are often regarded as media ''by and for'' ethnics in a host country with content in ethnic languages."&lt;ref&gt;Shi, Yu. (2009, p. 599). Re-evaluating the 'alternative' role of ethnic media in the US: the case of Chinese-language press and working-class women readers. Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Shi also adds, ethnic media “can be published by big ethnic media groups and by small organic ethnic communities”, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Shi, Yu. (2010). Audio Interview.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioner Inga Buchbinder of New America Media adds, “Our organization defines it most as a publication, whether that’s news, television, radio, online, print, magazine--any sort of publication that caters to a specific ethnic community. And it could be in-language…or it could be bilingual that reaches a very specific community.”&lt;ref&gt;Buchbinder, Inga. (2010). Audio Interview.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to news, television, radio, online, print, and magazine outlets that qualify as ethnic media, academic John D.H. Downing adds musical culture and forms of religious expression to the ethnic media mix. Downing finds, “these may, along with language and dialect, act as a media force somewhere between shock absorption and psychic validation in the often fraught atmosphere between the ethnic majority and ethnic minorities.”&lt;ref&gt;Downing, John. (2001, p. 82). Radical Media: Rebellious communication and social movements. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Downing finds that ethnic media tends to circulate, “within at least three different sectors, namely, indigenous nations and communities, recent migrants…and settled subordinate ethnic groups.”&lt;ref&gt;Downing, John. (2001, p. 81). Radical Media: Rebellious communication and social movements. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethnic media as alternative media ==

Analogous to the debate as to ''what'' qualifying factors constitute [[alternative media]], the domain of ''what'' qualifying factors that classify a respective ethnic media outlet as an alternative media outlet is also, at play.

Thus, ethnic media is not by definitional default alternative media.

Again, the work of academics and grassroots practitioners, such as John D.H. Downing, Yu Shi, Clemencia Rodriguez, and Inga Buchbinder of New America Media provide definitional assistance for this complex and overdetermined zone. Discernment of whether or not a respective ethnic media outlet qualifies as an alternative media outlet is dependent upon the outstanding contextual information, and should be assessed on a case by case evaluation.

Yu Shi’s work puts forth a seven-pronged test for evaluating the “alternative media role” of ethnic media in the United States: “reference has to be made to their (1) individual place of origin, (2) historical evolution, (3) production process, (4) distribution pattern, (5) ownership, (6) self-identity (non-profit or for-profit; alternative or commercial; or in between), and (7) connection to power groups in local and transnational settings.”&lt;ref&gt;Shi, Yu. (2009, p. 600). Re-evaluating the 'alternative' role of ethnic media in the US: the case of Chinese-language press and working-class women readers. Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frontalis, pars medialis) and the outer brow raiser muscle (M. frontalis, pars lateralis) as defined by the [[Facial Action Coding System]]. An eyebrow flash is subdivided into three time intervals: the '''onset''' (the time during which the eyebrows raise to their maximal position), the '''apex''' (the time during which the eyebrows are in their maximal position), and the '''offset''' (the time during which the eyebrows lower to their original state).

==Cross-cultural studies==
A study conducted in 1987 recorded approximately 67 hours of unstaged social interactions conducted by 255 individuals from three locations: [[Western New Guinea]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and Upper [[Orinoco]].&lt;ref name="crossculture" /&gt; The study found significant differences in the age and sex of senders and receivers among the populations studied; for instance, Eipo men from Western New Guinea were more likely to be senders, while Trobriand men from Papua New Guinea were more likely to be receivers. Across all three cultures, a lowering of the eyelids or a head movement often coincided with the beginning of an eyebrow flash. Additionally, people from all three cultures exhibited longer-duration eyebrow flashes at the openings of conversations than during conversations.

'''Fanagalo''' is a [[pidgin]] (simplified language) based primarily on [[Zulu language|Zulu]], with English and a small [[Afrikaans]] input. It is used as a [[lingua franca]], mainly in the gold, diamond, coal and copper mining industries in South Africa and to a lesser extent in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Namibia]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. Although it is used as a second language only, the number of speakers was estimated as "several hundred thousand" in 1975.   Once the British left, English became the lingua franca enabling different tribes in the same country to communicate with each other, and Fanagalo use declined.

Fanagalo is the only [[Zulu language|Zulu]]-based pidgin language, and is a rare example of a pidgin based on an indigenous language rather than on the language of a colonising or trading power.

The variety in [[Zimbabwe]] ([[Rhodesia]]) is known as '''Chilapalapa''' and is influenced by [[Shona language|Shona]], while the variety in [[Zambia]] ([[Northern Rhodesia]]), called '''Cikabanga'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greatnorthroad.org/boma/Image:Chikabanga_p01.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; (pronounced, and sometimes spelt, Chikabanga), is influenced by [[Bemba language|Bemba]].

==Etymology==
The name "Fanagalo" comes from strung-together [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] forms fana-ga-lo meaning "like + of + that" and has the meaning "do it like this", reflecting its use as a language of instruction.

Other spellings of the name are ''Fanakalo'' and ''Fanekolo''. It is also known as ''Isikula, Lololo'' or ''Isilololo, Piki'' or ''Isipiki'', and ''Silunguboi''. 

In the Nguni tongues, the [[prefix]] ''Mu-'' or ''Ma-'' implies the singular, while ''Bu-'' or ''Ba-'' signifies the plural – hence ''Muntu'' = a man; ''Bantu'' = men, particularly when applied to tribes, e.g. ''Ma-tabele''.  Similarly, the prefix ''Chi-'' or ''Si-'' indicates the language spoke by that tribe.  e.g. men of the ''Lozi'' tribe are called ''Ba-rotse'', and they speak ''Si-lozi''; Bembas speak Chiwemba; Tswanas live in Botswana, or as it used to be called, Bechuanaland.

Chi-lapa-lapa thus is the "language" derived from ''lapa'' = "there", with repetition for emphasis.

==History and usage==
Fanagalo is one of a number of [[African languages|African]] [[pidgin]] languages that developed during the colonial period to promote ease of communication. {{Harvcoltxt|Adendorff|2002}} suggests that it developed in the nineteenth century in [[KwaZulu-Natal Province]] as a way for English colonists to communicate with their servants and was also used as a lingua franca between English and Dutch/Afrikaans speaking colonists.

Fanagalo was used extensively in gold and diamond mines because the South African mining industry employed workers on fixed contracts from across southern and central Africa: including [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]], [[Botswana]], [[Malawi]] and [[Mozambique]]. With workers originating from a range of countries and having a vast range of different mother tongues, Fanagalo provided a simple way to communicate and is still used as a training and operating medium.  Fifteen hours instruction was considered sufficient for an initiate to become reasonably fluent.  See [[Witwatersrand Native Labour Association]].

Adendorff describes two variants of the language, '''Mine Fanagalo''' and '''Garden Fanagalo'''. The latter name refers to its use with servants in households. It was previously known as '''Kitchen Kaffir'''. (The term "[[kaffir (racial term)|kaffir]]" tended, in Southern Africa, to be used as a derogatory term for black people, and is now considered extremely offensive. It is derived from the Arab word Kafir, meaning unbeliever.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.arabic-for-nerds.com/2017/02/11/what-is-a-kafir/&lt;/ref&gt;)

In the mid-20th century in South Africa there were Government efforts to promote and standardise Fanagalo as a universal second language, under the name of "Basic Bantu".

In contrast, mining companies in the early 21st century have attempted to phase out Fanagalo in favour of the pre-existing, local languages. Ravyse (2018) discusses Fanagalo's apparent resistance to opposing official policy, in spite of its ongoing stigma as a language for the illiterate. Fanagalo has become intertwined with the culture of the mining industry, and its continuation seems to hinge on the ongoing favour of its speaking community, rather than industry policy. 

Mining aside, Adendorff also suggests that Fanagalo has unfavourable and negative connotations for many South Africans. However, he raises the point that Fanagalo is sometimes used between white South Africans, particularly expatriates, as a signal of South African origin and a way of conveying solidarity in an informal manner. That role has of late largely been taken over by Afrikaans; even among English speaking South African expatriates.

In the latter half of the 20th century, holiday makers from the Rhodesias often used to go on holiday to Lourenço Marques in Mozambique (now Maputo), where many people speak Portuguese – but most also spoke a form of Fanagalo.

All three languages are currently experiencing a revival in their popularity as a lingua franca, now freed from connotations of "colonialism" and valued for their intrinsic usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grocotts.co.za/node/27774&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rhodesia]]n comedian [[Wrex Tarr]] was famous for routines that make extensive use of Chilapalapa.

==Language features and variants==
Mine Fanagalo in South Africa and Zimbabwe is based mostly on [[Zulu language|Zulu]] vocabulary (about 70%), with English (about 25%) and some words from Afrikaans (5%). It does not have the range of Zulu inflections, and it tends to follow English word order. 

Adendorff describes Mine Fanagalo and Garden Fanagalo as being basically the same pidgin. He suggests that Garden Fanagalo should be seen as lying towards the English end of a continuum, and Mine Fanagalo closer to the Zulu end.

Several key features differentiate Fanagalo from the Nguni languages (such as Zulu and Xhosa). ''Lo'' functions as both an article and a demonstrative, while only a demonstrative in Zulu. ''Lapha'' is used to mean "here", also meaning "there" when the first syllable is stressed, and is also used as a general preposition for location. (It works for anything such as "on", or "near", etc.) Zulu, on the other hand, only uses ''lapha''to mean "here". Additionally, Fanagalo only uses free pronouns: ''mina'', ''tina'', ''wena'', ''ena'', meaning "I, we, you, he/she/it/they". Zulu only uses pronouns for emphasis, relying instead on verb agreement markers, much like Spanish. 

The past tense of verbs is marked by the suffix ''-ile'' (''hamba "I go, go!", ''hambile'' "I went"), and the future with the modal ''azi'' (''azi hamba'' "will go").''

Here are two examples (all letters are pronounced):-

''Koki Lobin''&lt;br /&gt;
Cock Robin

''Zonke nyoni lapa moyo ena kala, ena kala''&lt;br /&gt;
All birds of air, they cried, they cried&lt;br /&gt;
''Ena izwile ena file lo nyoni Koki Lobin''&lt;br /&gt;
They heard the death the bird Cock Robin&lt;br /&gt;
''Ena izwile, ena file, ena izwile ena file Cocky Lobin.''

''Kubani ena bulalile Koki Lobin?''&lt;br /&gt;
Who they killed Cock Robin&lt;br /&gt;
''Mina kruma lo Sparrow''&lt;br /&gt;
Me, said the sparrow&lt;br /&gt;
''Na lo picannin bow and arrow kamina''&lt;br /&gt;
With the little bow &amp; arrow of mine&lt;br /&gt;
''Mina bulalile Koki Lobin.''&lt;br /&gt;
I killed Cock Robin

''TANDAZO''&lt;br /&gt;
(The Lord's Prayer)

''Baba ga tina, Wena kona pezulu,''&lt;br /&gt;
Father of ours, You are above&lt;br /&gt;
'' Tina bonga lo Gama ga wena; ''&lt;br /&gt;
We thank (for) the name of you&lt;br /&gt;
''Tina vuma lo mteto ga wena Lapa mhlaba, fana na pezulu.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Niga tina namuhla lo zinkwa yena izwasisa;''&lt;br /&gt;
Give us today etc., etc...  &lt;br /&gt;
''Futi, yekelela masono gatina,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Loskati tina yekelela masono ga lomunye.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Hayi letisa tina lapa lo cala; Kodwa, sindisa tina ku lo bubi,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Ndaba Wena kona lo-mteto, lo mandla, na lo dumela, Zonkeskat. Amen.''

[[Category:Nostalgia]]
'''Good old days''' is a [[cliché]] in [[popular culture]]. It is used to reference a time considered by the speaker to be better than the current era. It is a form of [[nostalgia]] which can reflect [[homesickness]] or [[Longing (emotion)|yearning]] for long-gone moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/nostalgic|title=Nostalgic|website= www.vocabulary.com |archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=September 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1726, John Henley used this phrase in his book ''The Primitive Liturgy'' "to all honest Admirers of the good old Days of their best and wisest Fore-fathers, this first Part of the Primitive Liturgy Is most humbly dedicated".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945379031|title=Primitive liturgy : for the use of the oratory. part 1. being a form of morning and evening.|last=Multiple.|first=Contributors,|date=2010|publisher=Gale Ecco, Print Editions|isbn=9781170253939|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=945379031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1727, [[Daniel Defoe]] wrote in ''The Complete English Tradesman'' "In the good old days of Trade, which our Fore-fathers plodded on in."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete English Tradesman|last=Defoe|first=Daniel|publisher=BiblioLife|year=2008|isbn=0554343096|location=Charleston, South Carolina|pages=156-157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this part of his book, Defoe talks about how in 'the good old days' tradesman had were better off then in Defoe's time.

{{for|the American rock band|Grateful Dead}}
'''Grateful dead'''  (or '''grateful ghost''') is a [[Folklore|folktale]] present in many cultures throughout the world. The most common story involves a traveler who encounters a corpse of someone who never received a proper [[burial]], typically stemming from an unpaid debt.&lt;ref name="encybrit"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9037771/grateful-dead#23476.hook|title=Grateful dead|accessdate=2007-12-14|year=2007|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cscmu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/gdead/faq/name.html|title=Dead FAQ: How did they get the name?|accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traveler then either pays off the dead person's debt or pays for burial. The traveler is later rewarded or has their life saved by a person or animal who is actually the soul of the dead person; the grateful dead is a form of the [[donor (fairy tale)|donor]].

The "grateful dead" story is [[Aarne–Thompson]]–Uther type 505.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0505.html|title=The Grateful Dead:  folktales of Aarne–Thompson–Uther type 505|author=D.L. Ashliman|accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ancient Egyptian text explains the [[Golden Rule|principle of reciprocity]] in which the deceased calls for a blessing on the person who remembers his name and helps him into a happy afterlife:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But if there be a man, any one whomsoever, who beholdeth this writing and causeth my soul and my name to become established among those who are blessed, let it be done for him likewise after his final arriving (at the end of life's voyage) in recompense for what was done by him for me, Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;"The Burden of Isis, Being the Laments of Isis and Nephthys", James Teackle Dennis, Dutton &amp; Co, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One variant is the [[Book of Tobit]].&lt;ref name="hibbard74"&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'' p74. New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[chivalric romance]] ''[[Amadas]]'' has the title knight pay his last coins for such a burial.&lt;ref name="hibbard74"/&gt;  It appears in various fairy tales, such as the Italian ''[[Fair Brow]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 725 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Swedish ''[[The Bird 'Grip']]'' and [[Hans Christian Andersen|H.

{{lead rewrite|date=July 2018}}
An '''IETF language tag''' is an abbreviated [[language code]] (for example, ''en'' for English, ''pt-BR'' for Brazilian Portuguese, or ''nan-Hant-TW'' for Min Nan Chinese as spoken in Taiwan using traditional Han characters) defined by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) in the ''[[Best Current Practice|BCP]] 47'' document series, which is currently composed of normative RFC 5646 (referencing the related RFC 5645) and RFC 4647, along with the normative content of the ''[[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] Language Subtag Registry''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/|title=Language subtag lookup app:|last=|first=|date=|work=r12a.github.io|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-tag-extensions-registry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iana.org/protocols/|title=IANA — Protocol Registries|work=iana.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Components of language tags are drawn from [[ISO 639]], [[ISO 15924]], [[ISO 3166-1]], and [[UN M.49]].

These language tags are used in a number of modern computing standards, including those from the IETF related to the Internet protocols such as [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.3.1|title=RFC 7231 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content|work=ietf.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; those from the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] such as [[HTML]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#h-8.1|title=Language information and text direction|work=w3.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[XML]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#sec-lang-tag|title=Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)|work=w3.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11iTXt|title=Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition)|work=w3.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those from other private standardization bodies such as [[SGML]] or [[Unicode]] (in some of its standard annexes), or from national or regional standard bodies like [[ANSI]] or [[Ecma International|Ecma]] (for example in some of their standards related to computing languages, or bibliographic references and documents classification used in institutional libraries).

== History ==
IETF language tags were first defined in RFC 1766, edited by [[Harald Tveit Alvestrand]], published in March 1995. The tags used ISO 639 two-letter language codes and ISO 3166 two-letter country codes, and allowed registration of whole tags that included variant or script subtags of three to eight letters.

In January 2001 this was updated by RFC 3066, which added the use of ISO 639-2 three-letter codes, permitted subtags with digits, and adopted the concept of language ranges from HTTP/1.1 to help with matching of language tags.

The next revision of the specification came in September 2006 with the publication of RFC 4646 (the main part of the specification), edited by Addison Philips and [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]] and &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4647&lt;/nowiki&gt; (which deals with matching behaviour).  &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4646&lt;/nowiki&gt; introduced a more structured format for language tags, added the use of ISO 15924 four-letter script codes and UN M.49 three-digit geographical region codes, and replaced the old registry of tags with a new registry of subtags. The small number of previously defined tags that did not conform to the new structure were grandfathered in order to maintain compatibility with &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 3066&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

The current version of the specification, RFC 5646, was published in September 2009. The main purpose of this revision was to incorporate three-letter codes from ISO 639-3 and 639-5 into the Language Subtag Registry, in order to increase the interoperability between ISO 639 and BCP 47.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ltru-charter.html Language Tag Registry Update charter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210235400/http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ltru-charter.html |date=2007-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syntax of language tags ==
Each language tag is composed of one or more "subtags" separated by hyphens (-). Each subtag is composed of basic Latin letters or digits only.

With the exceptions of private-use language tags beginning with an ''x-'' prefix and grandfathered language tags (including those starting with an ''i-'' prefix and those previously registered in the old Language Tag Registry), subtags occur in the following order:
* A single ''primary language subtag'' based on a two-letter language code from [[ISO 639-1]] (2002) or a three-letter code from [[ISO 639-2]] (1998), [[ISO 639-3]] (2007) or [[ISO 639-5]] (2008), or registered through the BCP 47 process and composed of five to eight letters;
* Up to three optional ''extended language subtags'' composed of three letters each, separated by hyphens; (There is currently no extended language subtag registered in the Language Subtag Registry without an equivalent and preferred primary language subtag. This component of language tags is preserved for backwards compatibility and to allow for future parts of ISO 639.)
* An optional ''script subtag'', based on a four-letter script code from [[ISO 15924]] (usually written in [[Letter_case#Headings_and_publication_titles|Title Case]]);
* An optional ''region subtag'' based on a two-letter country code from [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] (usually written in upper case), or a three-digit code from [[UN M.49]] for geographical regions;
* Optional ''variant subtags'', separated by hyphens, each composed of five to eight letters, or of four characters starting with a digit; (Variant subtags are registered with IANA and not associated with any external standard.)
* Optional ''extension subtags'', separated by hyphens, each composed of a single character, with the exception of the letter ''x'', and a hyphen followed by one or more subtags of two to eight characters each, separated by hyphens;
* An optional ''private-use subtag'', composed of the letter ''x'' and a hyphen followed by subtags of one to eight characters each, separated by hyphens.

Subtags are not [[case-sensitive]], but the specification recommends using the same case as in the Language Subtag Registry, where region subtags are [[UPPERCASE]], script subtags are [[titlecase|Title Case]], and all other subtags are [[lowercase]]. This capitalization follows the recommendations of the underlying ISO standards.

Optional script and region subtags are preferred to be omitted when they add no distinguishing information to a language tag.  For example, ''es'' is preferred over ''es-Latn'', as Spanish is fully expected to be written in the Latin script; ''ja'' is preferred over ''ja-JP'', as Japanese ''as used in Japan'' does not differ markedly from Japanese as used elsewhere.

Not all linguistic regions can be represented with a valid region subtag: the subnational regional dialects of a primary language are registered as variant subtags.  For example, the ''valencia'' variant subtag for the [[Valencian]] dialect of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is registered in the Language Subtag Registry with the prefix ''ca''.  As this dialect is spoken almost exclusively in Spain, the region subtag ''ES'' can normally be omitted.

IETF language tags have been used as [[locale (computer software)|locale]] identifiers in many applications.  It may be necessary for these applications to establish their own strategy for defining, encoding and matching locales if the strategy described in &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4647&lt;/nowiki&gt; is not adequate.

The use, interpretation and matching of IETF language tags is currently defined in &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 5646&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4647&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  The Language Subtag Registry lists all currently valid public subtags.  Private-use subtags are not included in the Registry as they are implementation-dependent and subject to private agreements between third parties using them.  These private agreements are out of scope of BCP 47.

== Relation to other standards ==
Although some types of subtags are derived from [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] or [[United Nations|UN]] core standards, they do not follow these standards absolutely, as this could lead to the meaning of language tags changing over time. In particular, a subtag derived from a code assigned by [[ISO 639]], [[ISO 15924]], [[ISO 3166]], or [[UN M.49]] remains a valid (though deprecated) subtag even if the code is withdrawn from the corresponding core standard. If the standard later assigns a new meaning to the withdrawn code, the corresponding subtag will still retain its old meaning.

This stability was introduced in RFC 4646.

=== ISO 639-3 and ISO 639-1 ===
RFC 4646 defined the concept of an "extended language subtag" (sometimes referred to as ''extlang''), although no such subtags were registered at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

RFC 5645 and RFC 5646 added primary language subtags corresponding to [[ISO 639-3]] codes for all languages that did not already exist in the Registry. In addition, codes for languages encompassed by certain macrolanguages were registered as extended language subtags. Sign languages were also registered as extlangs, with the prefix ''sgn''. These languages may be represented either with the subtag for the encompassed language alone (''cmn'' for Mandarin) or with a language-extlang combination (''zh-cmn''). The first option is preferred for most purposes. The second option is called "extlang form" and is new in RFC 5646.

Whole tags that were registered prior to RFC 4646 and are now classified as "grandfathered" or "redundant" (depending on whether they fit the new syntax) are deprecated in favor of the corresponding ISO 639-3–based language subtag, if one exists. To list a few examples, ''nan'' is preferred over ''zh-min-nan'' for [[Min Nan]] Chinese; ''hak'' is preferred over ''i-hak'' and ''zh-hakka'' for [[Hakka Chinese]]; and ''ase'' is preferred over ''sgn-US'' for [[American Sign Language]].

=== ISO 639-5 and ISO 639-2 ===
[[ISO 639-5]] defines language collections with alpha-3 codes in a different way than they were initially encoded in ISO 639-2 (including one code already present in ISO 639-1). Specifically, the language collections are now all defined in ISO 639-5 as inclusive, rather than some of them being defined exclusively. This means that language collections have a broader scope than before, in some cases where they could encompass languages that were already encoded separately within ISO 639-2.

For example, the ISO 639-2 code ''afa'' was previously associated with the name "Afro-Asiatic (Other)", excluding languages such as Arabic that already had their own code. In ISO 639-5, this collection is named "Afro-Asiatic languages" and includes all such languages. ISO 639-2 changed the exclusive names in 2009 to match the inclusive ISO 639-5 names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_changes.php|title=ISO 639-2 Language Code List - Codes for the representation of names of languages (Library of Congress)|work=loc.gov|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid breaking implementations that may still depend on the older (exclusive) definition of these collections, ISO 639-5 defines a grouping type attribute for all collections that were already encoded in ISO 639-2 (such grouping type is not defined for the new collections added only in ISO 639-5).

BCP 47 defines a "Scope" property to identify subtags for language collections. However, it does not define any given collection as inclusive or exclusive, and does not use the ISO 639-5 grouping type attribute, although the description fields in the Language Subtag Registry for these subtags match the ISO 639-5 (inclusive) names. As a consequence, BCP 47 language tags that include a primary language subtag for a collection may be ambiguous as to whether the collection is intended to be inclusive or exclusive.

ISO 639-5 does not define precisely which languages are members of these collections; only the hierarchical classification of collections is defined, using the inclusive definition of these collections. Because of this, RFC 5646 does not recommend the use of subtags for language collections for most applications, although they are still preferred over subtags whose meaning is even less specific, such as "Multiple languages" and "Undetermined".

In contrast, the classification of individual languages within their macrolanguage is standardized, in both ISO 639-3 and the Language Subtag Registry.

=== ISO 15924, ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode ===
Script subtags were first added to the Language Subtag Registry when RFC 4646 was published, from the list of codes defined in [[ISO 15924]]. They are encoded in the language tag after primary and extended language subtags, but before other types of subtag, including region and variant subtags.

Some primary language subtags are defined with a property named "Suppress-Script" which indicates the cases where a single script can usually be assumed by default for the language, even if it can be written with another script. When this is the case, it is preferable to omit the script subtag, to improve the likelihood of successful matching. A different script subtag can still be appended to make the distinction when necessary. For example, ''yi'' is preferred over ''yi-Hebr'' in most contexts, because the Hebrew script subtag is assumed for the [[Yiddish]] language.

As another example, ''zh-Hans-SG'' may be considered equivalent to ''zh-Hans'', because the region code is probably not significant; the written form of Chinese used in Singapore uses the same simplified Chinese characters as in other countries where Chinese is written. However, the script subtag is maintained because it is significant.

Note that ISO 15924 includes some codes for script variants (for example, ''Hans'' and ''Hant'' for simplified and traditional forms of Chinese characters) that are unified within [[Unicode]] and [[ISO/IEC 10646]]. These script variants are most often encoded for bibliographic purposes, but are not always significant from a linguistic point of view (for example, ''Latf'' and ''Latg'' script codes for the Fraktur and Gaelic variants of the Latin script, which are mostly encoded with regular Latin letters in Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646). They may occasionally be useful in language tags to expose orthographic or semantic differences, with different analysis of letters, diacritics, and digraphs/trigraphs as default grapheme clusters, or differences in letter casing rules.

=== ISO 3166-1 and UN M.49 ===
{{Further|Country code top-level domain#Historical ccTLDs}}

Two-letter region subtags are based on codes assigned, or "exceptionally reserved", in [[ISO 3166-1]]. If the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency were to reassign a code that had previously been assigned to a different country, the existing BCP 47 subtag corresponding to that code would retain its meaning, and a new region subtag based on [[UN M.49]] would be registered for the new country. UN M.49 is also the source for numeric region subtags for geographical regions, such as &lt;code&gt;005&lt;/code&gt; for South America.

Region subtags are used to specify the variety of a language "as used in" a particular region. They are appropriate when the variety is regional in nature, and can be captured adequately by identifying the countries involved, as when distinguishing [[British English]] (''en-GB'') from [[American English]] (''en-US''). When the difference is one of script or script variety, as for [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified]] versus [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]] Chinese characters, it should be expressed with a script subtag instead of a region subtag; in this example, ''zh-Hans'' and ''zh-Hant'' should be used instead of ''zh-CN'' and ''zh-HK''.

When a distinct language subtag exists for a language that could be considered a regional variety, it is often preferable to use the more specific subtag instead of a language-region combination. For example, ''ar-DZ'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] as used in [[Algeria]]) may be better expressed as ''arq'' for [[Algerian Arabic|Algerian Spoken Arabic]].

== Extensions ==
''Extension subtags'' (not to be confused with ''extended language subtags'') allow additional information to be attached to a language tag that does not necessarily serve to identify a language. One use for extensions is to encode locale information, such as calendar and currency.

Extension subtags are composed of multiple hyphen-separated character strings, starting with a single character (other than ''x''), called a ''singleton''. Each extension is described in its own [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] [[Request for Comments|RFC]], which identifies a Registration Authority to manage the data for that extension. [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] is responsible for allocating singletons.

Two extensions have been assigned as of January 2014.

=== Extension T (Transformed Content) ===
Extension T allows a language tag to include information on how the tagged data was transliterated, transcribed, or otherwise transformed. For example, the tag ''en-t-jp'' could be used for content in English that was translated from the original Japanese. Additional substrings could indicate that the translation was done mechanically, or in accordance with a published standard.

Extension T is described in RFC 6497, published in February 2012. The Registration Authority is the [[Unicode Consortium]].

=== Extension U (Unicode Locale) ===
Extension U allows a wide variety of locale attributes found in the [[Common Locale Data Repository]] (CLDR) to be embedded in language tags. These attributes include calendar and time zone data, collation order, currency, number system, and keyboard identification. Tags containing a ''u-'' extension are more likely to be used to identify locale data sets than for purely linguistic content.

Some examples include:
* ''ar-u-nu-latn'' represents Arabic-language content using [[Arabic numerals|Basic Latin digits]] (0 through 9) instead of [[Eastern Arabic numerals|Arabic-script digits]] (٠ through ٩).
* ''he-IL-u-ca-hebrew-tz-jeruslm'' represents Hebrew as spoken in Israel, using the traditional [[Hebrew calendar]], and in the "Asia/Jerusalem" time zone as identified in the [[tz database]].

Extension U is described in RFC 6067, published in December 2010. The Registration Authority is the [[Unicode Consortium]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2329">'''Integrated human studies''' is an emerging educational field that equips people with [[knowledge]] and competencies across a range of disciplines to enable them to address the challenges facing [[Human|human beings]] this century. It differs from other [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] educational initiatives in that its [[curriculum]] is purpose designed rather than simply an [[Amalgamation (fiction)|amalgamation]] of existing disciplines.

[[Kyoto University]] in Japan has offered a formal course in Integrated Human Studies since 1992 when it reorganized its College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and renamed it the Faculty of Integrated Human Studies. This was subsequently (in 2003) integrated with the Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies to create the new Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soujin/index_e.php Kyoto University] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Western Australia]] established the Center for Integrated Human Studies in early 2008. This center brings together the [[science]]s, [[social science]]s, [[Arts and Humanities in Higher Education|arts and humanities]] to focus on the nature and future of humankind. Its fundamental concern is to promote human well-being at an individual, local and global level within a sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihs.uwa.edu.au Integrated Human Studies, University of Western Australia] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Integration of disciplinary fields has arisen as a response to the “increasing [[Specialization of knowledge|specialization]] of [university] courses to meet the demands of [[Technological change|technological progress]], [[economic growth]] and [[Vocational education|vocational training]]”&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Neville. [http://u08.cgpublisher.com/proposals/237/index_html Abstract for World Universities Forum] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the development of ever narrower fields of study at tertiary level. Proponents of integrated human studies believe that a broader, interdisciplinary approach is needed to enable future [[Decision-making|decision-makers]] to grasp the complexities of the issues facing humankind in the [[21st century]] and craft workable solutions.

'''Itutu''', which literally translates as "[[Cool (aesthetic)|cool]]" from the [[Yoruba language]], has been used by the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and more recently by [[African studies|Africanist]] art historians to describe the aesthetic that characterizes much Yoruba and some African-American art.  An "Itutu" aesthetic includes the appearance of a calm, collected face that is found in much [[Yoruba traditional art|Yoruba sculpture]].  It has been suggested by [[Robert Farris Thompson]] of Yale University that Itutu is the origin of the American idea of the "cool".  His 1973 article "An Aesthetic of the Cool" traces the idea of "Itutu" from the Yoruba to several other African civilizations and finally to the Americas, where the descendents of Africans perpetuated the importance of being "cool".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Robert Farris|title=An Aesthetic of the Cool|journal=African Arts|date=1 January 1973|volume=7|issue=1|pages=41–91|doi=10.2307/3334749|jstor=3334749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9859">The '''Little Emperor Syndrome''' (or '''Little Emperor Effect''') was an aspect/view of [[People's Republic of China|Mainland China]]'s [[one-child policy]] where children of modern upper class and wealthier Chinese families gain seemingly excessive amounts of attention from their parents and grandparents. Combined with increased spending power due to China's growing economic strength within the family unit and parents' general desire for their child to experience the benefits they themselves were denied, the phenomenon is generally considered to be problematic. The British journalist  [[Andrew Marshall (Asia journalist)|Andrew Marshall]] even argues that it is shaping modern Chinese society in unexpected ways&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;Marshall, Andrew. "Little emperors." The Times (London, England) 29 Nov. 1997: 44.&lt;/ref&gt; that may culminate into a future "behavioral time-bomb".&lt;ref name="Branson"&gt;Branson, Louise. "China's brat pack; Generation of only-children." Sunday Times (London, England) 19 June 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little Emperors were primarily an urban phenomenon. The one-child policy generally only applied to urban communities and, given the value of labor, one child families are not prevalent within rural communities. Economic development has not had as large an impact outside of urban centers.

== Dynamics ==

===Socio-economic implications===
Modern China's [[Economic history of China (1949–present)|economic growth]] has tremendously elevated the annual per capita income of urban areas as women have become increasingly represented in the workforce, frequently resulting in families with two sources of income.&lt;ref name="cutler"&gt;Cutler, Blayne. "China's little emperors." American Demographics Mar. 1988: 58.&lt;/ref&gt; This greatly improved purchasing power coupled with excessive pampering of only children is the cause of increased spending on children.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} From toys to clothes, parents shower their child in material goods and give in to every demand; it is common for children to be the "best-dressed members of their families."&lt;ref name="cutler"/&gt;

Recently, it has become common for most of a family's income to be spent on the child.&lt;ref name="Shao"&gt;Shao, Paul Herbig, and Alan T. "Marketing implications of China's 'little emperors..'" Review of Business 16.1: 16(5).&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has become considerable enough to be noticed on a global scale: marketing groups attribute a near doubling of platinum Jewellery sales in China to "China's 'spoiled brat' generation."&lt;ref name="gooding1"&gt;Gooding, Kenneth. "Producers benefit from the 'spoiled brat' effect." The Financial Times 22 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parental expectations ===
Little Emperors also bear the burden of heavy expectations. Parents who feel they lost their chance in the [[Cultural Revolution]] ("compensation syndrome"&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt;) put immense pressure on these children to succeed and compete academically.&lt;ref name="Shao"/&gt; From an early age parents push their only child to educational extremes as they cater to their whims; "though many of these precocious kids can recite the English alphabet or read newspapers in traditional Chinese characters by the time they're 10, their parents often still perform basic tasks for them: fixing their hair, tying their shoes, wiping their bottoms."&lt;ref name="Reese"&gt;Reese, Lori. "Children's Palace: China Copes With the One-Child Policy, 1980 A Generation of Little Emperors." Time International 27 Sept. 1999: 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Boarding school, private English lessons, music lessons and an additional range of extracurricular activities are the normal fare.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt;

=== Household structure ===
One factor frequently associated with the Little Emperor effect is the "four-two-one" family structure, which refers to the collapse of the traditionally large [[Chinese family]] into four grandparents and two parents doting on one child.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; Beyond the obvious further funneling of resources towards the whims and potential of the only child, this four-two-one reconfiguration of the familial structure has distinct ramifications for Chinese society. The Little Emperors of the [[one-child policy]] have warped the traditional family beyond recognition; "in the past, the power in a household devolved from the father," who ruled over a multitude of offspring.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt;

Now the household structures itself entirely around the one child. This shift from earlier structures that supported the culture of [[filial piety]] has caused much concern; "traditionally, a great number of children, particularly sons, was seen as proof of the family's standing and it guaranteed the continuity of ancestor-worshipping customs."&lt;ref name="Branson"/&gt; The most salient issue stems from the worry about who will look after the elderly. Aside from a potentially radical shift in cultural norms concerning the treatment of the elderly, this new family structure poses a purely [[Demographics of the People's Republic of China|demographic problem]]: "the composition of the [[Dependant|dependent]] population is shifting away from children toward elderly population."&lt;ref name="hussain1"&gt;Hussain, Athar. "Demographic transition in China and its implications." World Development 30.10: 1823(12).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and psychology===
Many Chinese families use traditional [[Confucianism|Confucian]] values to teach their only child. Confucianism considers [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]] (love and social responsibility) the core [[emotion]] that inspires other moral concepts in personal [[motivation]]. The child often receives too much love and has been highly mentally and physically restricted to devote themselves to a heavy load of schoolwork, considering that the economic future of the family depends on their success. Such a situation can directly lead to the overindulgence of the child thus reversing traditional Confucian values of Ren (仁) and  [[filial piety]] (xiao 孝). There is also evidence that many young Chinese feel heavily burdened&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xljk.sdnu.edu.cn/Item/Show.asp?m=1&amp;d=360 Psychological problems in the post 90s generation] (Chinese; 90后易出现的心理问题) - Psychology Center of Shandong Normal University&lt;/ref&gt; and a huge sense of responsibility toward their parents, understanding that their success can have crucial consequences for their family.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa L. Fong. ''Only Hope: Coming of Age Under China's One-Child Policy''. Stanford University Press, 2004, 256 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on specific family conditions and a child's outlook, this burden can lead to a diligent lifestyle by youngsters or to a more rebellious attitude to traditional codes or to not being able to cope with such pressure nor to develop self-discipline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=117 Chinese Singletons - Basic ‘Spoiled’ Related Vocabulary], [http://thinkingchinese.com Thinking Chinese], September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of immense pressure to excel and extreme pampering is reported to have resulted in a stunting of social and emotional growth.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt; The perceived maladjustment of the Little Emperors is an exaggerated subject within the media; "the government has [tried] to cope with the Little Emperor problem through frequent cautionary stories in the press."&lt;ref name="Branson"/&gt; These stories depict children hanging themselves after being denied sweets and cases of [[matricide]] in retribution for a scolding or late dinner.&lt;ref name="Marshall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Branson"/&gt; The discussion of Little Emperors has saturated public discussion concerning the [[one-child policy]] in Chinese and international media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/one-child-policy-chinas-army-of-little-emperors-8446713.html|title=One-child policy: China's army of little emperors|date=2013-01-10|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[psychology|Psychological studies]] do not support this view or, at best, offered mixed results. Results from earlier studies are inconsistent with some more recent studies that suggest there are no reliable differences between only children and those with siblings.&lt;ref name="wan"&gt;Wan, et al. "Comparison of personality traits of only and sibling school children in Beijing." ''Journal of Genetic Psychology'' 155.4: 377(12).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shen"&gt;Shen, "Moral values of only and sibling children in the mainland China." ''[[The Journal of Psychology]]'' 133.1: 115(11).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a survey published in 2013&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6116/131.summary Mara Hvistendahl, "Making a Selfish Generation by Fiat."] Science, 11 January 2013: 131.&lt;/ref&gt; on 431 Beijing adults finds that those who had grown up after the introduction of the one-child policy were lacking "entrepreneurial drive and the willingness to take risks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-1-153993-Chinas-One-Child-policy-creates-risk-averse-adults "China’s One Child policy creates ‘risk-averse’ adults."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112142628/http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-1-153993-Chinas-One-Child-policy-creates-risk-averse-adults |date=12 January 2013 }} ''The International News'', 12 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This even had a significant impact on career choices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-10/china-s-one-child-policy-yields-adults-fearing-risk.html "China’s One-Child Policy Yields Adults Fearing Risk."] Bloomberg News, 10 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macaronic language''' refers to text using a mixture of [[language]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/macaronic|title=Macaronic|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022203122/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/macaronic|archivedate=22 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly [[bilingual pun]]s or situations in which the languages are otherwise used in the same context (rather than simply discrete segments of a text being in different languages). The term can also denote [[hybrid word]]s, which are effectively "internally macaronic". A rough equivalent in spoken language is [[code-switching]], a term in [[linguistics]] referring to using more than one language or dialect within the same conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2012/04/12.html |title=Definition of Macaronic |publisher=dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=12 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419181212/http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2012/04/12.html |archivedate=19 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macaronic Latin''' in particular is a jumbled [[jargon]] made up of [[vernacular]] words given [[Latin language|Latin]] endings, or for Latin words mixed with the vernacular in a [[pastiche]] (compare [[dog Latin]]).

The word ''[[wikt:Macaronic|macaronic]]'' comes from the [[New Latin]] ''macaronicus'' which is from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''maccarone'' ("dumpling", regarded as coarse peasant fare).  The term can have derogatory overtones, and is usually reserved for works where the mixing of languages has a humorous or [[satire|satirical]] intent or effect.  It is a matter of debate whether the term can be applied to mixed-language literature of a more serious nature and purpose.

==History==

===Mixed Latin-vernacular lyrics in Medieval Europe===
Texts that mixed [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[vernacular language]] apparently arose throughout Europe at the end of the [[Middle Ages]]—a time when Latin was still the working language of scholars, clerics and university students, but was losing ground to vernacular among poets, [[minstrel]]s and storytellers.

An early example is from 1130, in the [[Gospel book]] of [[Munsterbilzen Abbey]].  The following sentence mixes late [[Old Dutch]] and Latin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Tesi samanunga was edele unde scona
et omnium virtutum pleniter plena
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translated: ''This community was noble and pure, and completely full of all virtues.''

The ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' (collected c.1230) contains several poems mixing Latin with Medieval German or French.  Another well-known example is the first stanza of the famous [[Carol (music)|carol]] ''[[In Dulci Jubilo]]'', whose original version (written around 1328) had Latin mixed with German, with a hint of [[Greek language|Greek]].  While some of those early works had a clear humorous intent, many use the language mix for lyrical effect.

Another early example is in the [[Middle English language|Middle English]] recitals ''[[Wakefield Mystery Plays|The Towneley Plays]]'' (c.1460).  In ''[[The Talents (play)|The Talents]]'' (play 24), [[Pontius Pilate]] delivers a rhyming speech in mixed English and Latin.

A number of English political poems in the 14th century alternated (Middle) English and Latin lines, such as in MS Digby 196:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The taxe hath tened [ruined] vs alle,
      Probat hoc mors tot validorum
  The Kyng þerof had small
      fuit in manibus cupidorum.
  yt had ful hard hansell,
      dans causam fine dolorum;
  vengeaunce nedes most fall,
      propter peccata malorum
  ''(etc)''&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several [[Anthem]]s also contain both Latin and English. In the case of 'Nolo mortem pecatoris' by [[Thomas Morley]], the Latin is used as a refrain:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Nolo mortem peccatoris; Haec sunt verba Salvatoris.
Father I am thine only Son, sent down from heav’n mankind to save.
Father, all things fulfilled and done according to thy will, I have.
Father, my will now all is this: Nolo mortem peccatoris.
Father, behold my painful smart, taken for man on ev’ry side;
Ev'n from my birth to death most tart, no kind of pain I have denied,
but suffered all, and all for this: Nolo mortem peccatoris.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translated: "'I do not wish the death of the wicked'; These are the words of the Saviour." An allusion to John 3:17 and 2 Peter 3:9.

===Latin–Italian macaronic verse===
The term ''macaronic'' is believed to have originated in [[Padua]] in the late 15th century, apparently from ''maccarona'', a kind of pasta or [[dumpling]] eaten by peasants at that time.  (That is also the presumed origin of  ''[[maccheroni]]''.)&lt;ref name="linphil"&gt;{{cite web |author=Fran Hamilton |url=http://porticobooks.com/edu/archive/issue55.htm |title=LinguaPhile online magazine, September 2007 |publisher=Porticobooks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210181651/http://porticobooks.com/edu/archive/issue55.htm |archivedate=10 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its association with the genre comes from the ''[[Macaronea]]'', a comical poem by [[Tifi Odasi]] in mixed Latin and Italian, published in 1488 or 1489.  Another example of the genre is ''[[Tosontea]]'' by [[Corrado of Padua]], which was published at about the same time as Tifi's ''Macaronea''.

Tifi and his contemporaries clearly intended to [[satire|satirize]] the broken Latin used by many doctors, scholars and bureaucrats of their time.  While this "macaronic Latin" (''macaronica verba'') could be due to ignorance or carelessness, it could also be the result of its speakers trying to make themselves understood by the vulgar folk without resorting to their speech.&lt;ref name="macver"&gt;{{cite web |author=Giorgio Bernardi Perini |title=Macaronica Verba. Il divenire di una trasgressione linguistica nel seno dell'Umanesimo |url=http://www.fondazionecanussio.org/atti2000/bernardi.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=fondazionecanussio.org |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217184031/http://www.fondazionecanussio.org/atti2000/bernardi.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important and unusual example of mixed-language text is the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' of [[Francesco Colonna]] (1499), which was basically written using Italian syntax and morphology, but using a made-up vocabulary based on roots from Latin, [[Greek (language)|Greek]], and occasionally others.  However, while the ''Hypnerotomachia'' is contemporary with Tifi's ''Macaronea'', its mixed language is not used for plain humor, but rather as an aesthetic device to underscore the fantastic but refined nature of the book.

Tifi's ''Macaronea'' was a popular success, and the writing of [[humour|humorous]] texts in macaronic Latin became a fad in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in Italian, but also in many other European languages. An important Italian example was ''[[Baldo (Teofilo Folengo book)|Baldo]]'' by [[Teofilo Folengo]], who described his own verses as "a gross, rude, and rustic mixture of flour, cheese, and butter".&lt;ref name="folenmac"&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, Oxford University Press (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caten"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06124a.htm |title=Teofilo Folengo in The Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1909-09-01 |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022034217/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06124a.htm |archivedate=22 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other mixed-language lyrics===
Macaronic verse is especially common in cultures with widespread [[bilingualism]] or [[language contact]], such as Ireland before the middle of the nineteenth century.  Macaronic traditional songs such as ''[[Siúil A Rúin]]'' are quite common in Ireland.  In Scotland, macaronic songs have been popular among [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] immigrants to [[Glasgow]], using English and [[Scottish Gaelic]] as a device to express the alien nature of the anglophone environment.  An example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/learning/primary/tunein/mixer/lyrics.shtml?lyrics=3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425195304/http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/learning/primary/tunein/mixer/lyrics.shtml?lyrics=3 |archivedate=25 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I came down to Glasgow first,&lt;br /&gt;

I was like a man adrift,&lt;br /&gt;

Folk and popular music of the [[Andes]] frequently alternates between Spanish and the given [[South American]] language of its region of origin.

Some [[Persian poetry|Classical Persian poems]] were written with alternating [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]] verses or hemistichs, most famously by [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sadi-sirazi|title=SAʿDI – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|date=|website=www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117020202/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sadi-sirazi|archivedate=17 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hafez Shirazi|Hafez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hafez-iii|title=HAFEZ   iii.

Macaronic verse was also common in [[medieval]] [[India]], where the influence of the Muslim rulers led to poems being written in alternating indigenous [[Hindi]] and the [[Persian language]].  This style was used by the famous poet [[Amir Khusro]] and played a major role in the rise of the [[Urdu]] or [[Hindustani language]].

The [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] song "Caress Me Down" alternates between English and Spanish lyrics, at some points between verses, at others between lines within a verse, and occasionally between phrases within a line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/caress-me-down-lyrics-sublime.html|title=Sublime - Caress Me Down Lyrics - MetroLyrics|author=|date=|website=www.metrolyrics.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426200541/http://www.metrolyrics.com/caress-me-down-lyrics-sublime.html|archivedate=26 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unintentional macaronic language===
{{main|Homophonic translation}}

Occasionally language is unintentionally macaronic. One particularly famed piece of schoolyard Greek in France is [[Xenophon]]'s line "they did not take the city; but in fact they had no hope of taking it" ({{lang|grc|οὐκ ἔλαβον πόλιν· άλλα γὰρ ἐλπὶς ἔφη κακά}}, ''ouk élabon pólin; álla gàr elpìs éphē kaká''). [[Mondegreen|Read]] [[Pronunciation of Ancient Greek in teaching#France|in the French manner]], this becomes "Où qu'est la bonne Pauline? A la gare. Elle pisse et fait caca." ("Where is Pauline the maid? At the [railway] station. She's pissing and taking a shit.")&lt;ref&gt;Arbre d'Or eBooks.

Genette, Gérard &amp;&amp;nbsp;al. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbYzNp94C9oC&amp;pg=PA41 ''Palimpsests'', {{nowrap|p. 41}}].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[English literature]], the untranslated line makes an appearance in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;FinnegansWiki. "[http://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Ouk_elabon_polin Ouk elabon polin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711003628/http://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/Ouk_elabon_polin |date=11 July 2011 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern macaronic literature==

===Prose===
Macaronic text is still used by modern Italian authors, e.g. by [[Carlo Emilio Gadda]] and [[Beppe Fenoglio]].  Other examples are provided by the character Salvatore in [[Umberto Eco]]'s  ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', and the peasant hero of his ''[[Baudolino]]''.  [[Dario Fo]]'s ''[[Mistero Buffo]]'' ("''Comic Mystery Play''") features [[grammelot]] sketches using language with macaronic elements.

The 2001 novel ''[[The Last Samurai (novel)|The Last Samurai]]'' by [[Helen DeWitt]]&lt;ref name="lastsam"&gt;DeWitt, Helen. ''The Last Samurai'' (Chatto and Windus, 2000: {{ISBN|0-7011-6956-7}}; Vintage, 2001: {{ISBN|0-09-928462-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; includes portions of Japanese, [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]], and [[Inuktitut]], although the reader is not expected to understand the passages that are not in English.

Macaronic games are used by the literary group [[Oulipo]] in the form of interlinguistic [[homophonic transformation]]: replacing
a known phrase with homophones from another language.  The archetypal example is by [[François Le Lionnais]], who transformed [[John Keats]]' "A thing of beauty is a joy forever" into "Un singe de beauté est un jouet pour l'hiver": 'A monkey of beauty is a toy for the winter'.&lt;ref name="genette"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the book ''[[Mots d'Heures]]''.

Macaronisms figure prominently in ''[[The Trilogy]]'' by the [[Poland|Polish]] novelist [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], and are one of the major compositional principles for James Joyce's novel ''Finnegans Wake''.

===Poetry===
Two well-known examples of non-humorous macaronic verse are [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Maid of Athens, ere we part (George Byron)|Maid of Athens, ere we part]]'' (1810, in English with a [[Greek language|Greek]] refrain);&lt;ref name="maidat"&gt;{{cite web |first=George |last=Byron |url=http://readytogoebooks.com/MOA-P43.htm |title=Maid of Athens |publisher=readytogoebooks.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070133/http://readytogoebooks.com/MOA-P43.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Lucas de Pearsall|Pearsall]]'s translation of the carol ''In Dulci Jubilo'' (1837, in mixed English and Latin verse).

An example of modern humorous macaronic verse is the anonymous English/Latin poem ''[[Carmen Possum]]'' ("''The Opossum's Song''"), which is sometimes used as a teaching and motivational aid in elementary Latin language classes.  Other similar examples are ''[[The Motor Bus]]'' by [[A. D. Godley]], and the anonymous ''[[Up I arose (poem)|Up I arose in verno tempore]]''.

Recent examples are the ''mużajki'' or 'mosaics' (2007) of [[Malta|Maltese]] poet [[Antoine Cassar]]&lt;ref name="mosaics"&gt;Grech, Marija.

''Contemporary Poetry Review'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Brian P. Cleary]]'s "What Can I C'est?" makes use of macaronic verse, as do other poems in his book "Rainbow Soup: Adventures in Poetry":

&lt;blockquote&gt;My auntie Michelle is big in the BON&lt;br /&gt;
(As well as the hip and the thigh).&lt;br /&gt;
And when she exhales, OUI haul out our sails&lt;br /&gt;
And ride on the wind of VERSAILLES.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A whole body of comic verse exists created by John O'Mill, pseudonym of [[John O'Mill|Johan van der Meulen]], a teacher of English at the Rijks HBS (State Grammar School), [[Breda]], the [[Netherlands]].  These are in a mixture of English and Dutch, often playing on common mistakes made when translating from the latter to the former.

===Theatre===
The finale of act 1 of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[Savoy Opera]] [[Iolanthe]] has several instances of humorous macaronic verse. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stagebeauty.net/plays/th-iola1.html|title=W.S.Gilbert - Iolanthe, ACT I|author=|date=|website=www.stagebeauty.net|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425195304/http://www.stagebeauty.net/plays/th-iola1.html|archivedate=25 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, the three Lords mix Italian and Latin phrases into their discussion of Iolanthe's age:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Lord Mountararat:''' This gentleman is seen, / With a maid of seventeen, / A-taking of his ''dolce far niente''...&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lord Chancellor:''' Recollect yourself, I pray, / And be careful what you say- / As the ancient Romans said, ''festina lente''...&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lord Tolloller:''' I have often had a use / For a thorough-bred excuse / Of a sudden (which is English for ''repente'')...&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lord Mountararat:''' Now, listen, pray to me, / For this paradox will be / Carried, nobody at all ''contradicente''...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then, the chorus of peers sing macaronic verse as they attempt to resist the fairies' powers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our lordly style you shall not quench with base ''canaille''! (That word is French.)&lt;br /&gt; 	 
Distinction ebbs before a herd of vulgar ''plebs''! (A Latin word.)&lt;br /&gt;
Twould fill with joy and madness stark the ''oι πoλλoί''! (A Greek remark.)&lt;br /&gt; 	 
One Latin word, one Greek remark, and one that's French.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Film===
'Macaronisms' are frequently used in films, especially comedies.  In [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] comedy ''[[The Great Dictator]]'', the title character  speaks English mixed with a parody of German (e.g. "Cheese-und-cracken").  This was also used by Benzino Napaloni, the parody character of [[Benito Mussolini]], using Italian foods (such as [[salami]] and [[ravioli]]) as insults.

Other movies featuring macaronic language are the Italian historical comedies ''[[L'armata Brancaleone]]'' and ''[[Brancaleone alle crociate]]'' (d. [[Mario Monicelli]]), which mix modern and medieval Italian as well as Latin (sometimes in rhyme, and sometimes with regional connotations, such as the [[Italo-Normans]] using words from modern [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]).

===Song===

Macaronic language appearing in popular songs include [[Dean Martin]]'s "[[That's Amore]]" (Italian and English), the [[Beatles]]’ "[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]" (French and English), [[The Clash]]’s "[[Spanish Bombs]]" and [[José Feliciano]]’s "[[Feliz Navidad (song)|Feliz Navidad]]" (Spanish and English), the [[Talking Heads]] "[[Psycho Killer]]" (French and English), and [[The Weeknd]]'s [[Echoes of Silence|Montreal]] (French and English).

'''Media stylistics''' or '''mediated stylistics''' is a branch of [[Linguistics#Functional approaches|functional]] [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] that studies human communication in [[mass media]]. It can be considered a branch of [[media linguistics]]; that is, how media [[speech]] depends on the [[content (media)|content]], aims of communicators and the medium.

Media stylistics as a research approach is widely known in [[Eastern Europe]] and especially in [[Russia]], through the work of A. Vasileva, M. Kozhina, V. Kostomarov, L. Maydanova, I. Lysakova, K. Rogova, G. Solganik and others.

==Main problems==
Modern media stylistics in Russia develops mainly as stylistics of media text. The main particular problems of media stylistics are:
* the correlation between linguistic and extralinguistic organization of media texts;
* the role of the author's voice (G. Solganik, L. Kayda, L. Maydanova, N. Tsvetova, T. Shmeleva), their social (I. Lysakova) and genre (L. Duskaeva; I. Myasnikov; L. Maydanova, S. Kalganova, V. Konkov) typology;
* regularities of speech discovery of media texts as interaction of semantic positions (L. Duskaeva, T. Chernyshova), phatic (N. Kornilova, E. Chepkina, T. Chernyshova), polemic (L. Duskaeva, M. Kormilitsyna) and even hostile (E. Kakorina, V. Salimovsky, A. Skovorodnikov);
* sphere of concepts represented in media texts (E. Abramova, E. Malysheva, O. Orlova), their architectonics and composition (N. Bolotnova, L. Kayda, V. Konkov, N. Kuzmina);
* several expressive characteristics (T. Krasnova, M. Kormilitsyna) or their system (G. Bobrovskaya, G. Kopnina, A. Skovorodnikov; M. Kormilitsyna);
* idiostyle in a speech media environment (N. Bolotnova, M. Kormilitsyna O. Sirotinina), its textual (T. Matveeva) and functional semantics and stylistics (L. Duskaeva, T. Permyakova), intentional stylistics (L. Duskaeva, N. Tsvetova) and intentional (N. Klushina) categories - all those speech properties of texts which promote its effectiveness.

Along with stylistics of socio-political texts (V. Konkov, V. Salimovsky, G. Solganik, N. Klushina), the stylistics of journalistic leisure-texts develops (L. Duskaeva, N. Klushina, V. Konkov, E. Kara-Murza, T. Redkina, N. Tsvetova). The intentional-stylistic approach to the study of these texts develops extensively (V. Barbashov, L. Duskaeva, N. Kornilova, K.Prokhorova, N. Tsvetova) as well as stylistic approach to lingvo-etic problems (N. Bessarabova, T. Surikova, V. Suzdaltseva). As separate lines of media stylistics can be considered semiotic lingvostylistics of advertising texts (E. Kara-Murza), expert media stylistics (A. Baranov, E. Kara-Murza, M. Gorbanevsky, T. Chernyshova), stylistics of online media texts (E. Kakorina, T. Karpova).&lt;ref&gt;Duskaeva L. Media Stylistics: The New Concept or New Phenomenon // [[Russian Journal of Communication]]. 2011. № 4.

'''Mimesis''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|m|iː|s|ɪ|s|,_|m|ə|-|,_|m|aɪ|-|,_|-|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|μίμησις}} ''mīmēsis'', from μιμεῖσθαι ''mīmeisthai'', "to imitate", from [[Wikt:μῖμος|μῖμος]] ''mimos'', "imitator, actor") is a [[Literary criticism|critical]] and philosophical term that carries a wide range of meanings, which include [[imitation]], [[representation (arts)|representation]], [[mimicry]], ''imitatio'', receptivity, nonsensuous similarity, the act of resembling, the act of expression, and the [[impression management|presentation of the self]].&lt;ref&gt;Gebauer and Wulf (1992, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greece]], mimesis was an idea that governed the creation of works of art, in particular, with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, [[truth]], and the good. [[Plato]] contrasted mimesis, or [[imitation]], with [[diegesis]], or narrative. After Plato, the meaning of mimesis eventually shifted toward a specifically literary function in ancient Greek society, and its use has changed and been reinterpreted many times since.

One of the best-known modern studies of mimesis, understood as a form of [[realism (literature)|realism]] in literature, is [[Erich Auerbach]]'s ''[[Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature]]'', which opens with a famous comparison between the way the world is represented in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the way it appears in the ''Bible''. From these two seminal Western texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of representation that spans the entire history of Western literature, including the Modernist novels being written at the time Auerbach began his study. In [[art history]], "mimesis", "realism" and "naturalism" are used, often interchangeably, as terms for the accurate, even "illusionistic", [[Realism (arts)#Illusionistic realism|representation of the visual appearance of things]].

Mimesis has been theorised by thinkers as diverse as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Philip Sidney]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Gabriel Tarde]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Erich Auerbach]], [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[René Girard]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Michael Taussig]], [[Merlin Donald]], and [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Classical definitions==

===Plato===
Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw in mimesis the [[representation (arts)|representation]] of [[nature]], including human nature, as reflected in the dramas of the period. Plato wrote about mimesis in both ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'' and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (Books&amp;nbsp;II, III, and X). In ''Ion'', he states that poetry is the art of divine madness, or inspiration. Because the poet is subject to this divine madness, instead of possessing "art" or "knowledge" – ''[[techne]]'' – of the subject (532c), the poet does not speak truth (as characterized by Plato's [[Theory of forms|account of the Forms]]). As Plato has it, truth is only the concern of the philosopher. As culture in those days did not consist in the solitary reading of books, but in the listening to performances, the recitals of orators (and poets), or the acting out by classical actors of tragedy, Plato maintained in his critique that theatre was not sufficient in conveying the truth (540c). He was concerned that actors or orators were thus able to persuade an audience by rhetoric rather than by telling the truth (535b).

In Book&amp;nbsp;II of ''The Republic'', Plato describes [[Socrates]]' dialogue with his pupils. Socrates warns we should not seriously regard poetry as being capable of attaining the truth and that we who listen to poetry should be on our guard against its seductions, since the poet has no place in our idea of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing this in Book&amp;nbsp;X, Plato told of Socrates' metaphor of the three beds: one bed exists as an idea made by God (the [[Platonic ideal|Platonic ideal, or form]]); one is made by the [[carpenter]], in imitation of God's idea; one is made by the artist in imitation of the carpenter's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 596–599.&lt;/ref&gt;

So the artist's bed is twice removed from the truth. Those who copy only touch on a small part of things as they really are, where a bed may appear differently from various points of view, looked at obliquely or directly, or differently again in a mirror. So painters or poets, though they may paint or describe a carpenter, or any other maker of things, know nothing of the carpenter's (the craftsman's) art,&lt;ref name=Republic&gt;{{cite book | last = Plato | title = Book X | work = The Republic | url =  http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though the better painters or poets they are, the more faithfully their works of art will resemble the reality of the carpenter making a bed, nonetheless the imitators will still not attain the truth (of God's creation).&lt;ref name=Republic /&gt;

The poets, beginning with Homer, far from improving and educating humanity, do not possess the knowledge of craftsmen and are mere imitators who copy again and again images of virtue and rhapsodise about them, but never reach the truth in the way the superior philosophers do.

===Aristotle===
Similar to Plato's writings about mimesis, Aristotle also defined mimesis as the perfection, and imitation of nature. Art is not only imitation but also the use of mathematical ideas and symmetry in the search for the perfect, the timeless, and contrasting being with becoming. Nature is full of change, decay, and cycles, but art can also search for what is everlasting and the first causes of natural phenomena. Aristotle wrote about the idea of [[four causes]] in nature. The first, the [[formal cause]], is like a blueprint, or an immortal idea. The second cause is the material cause, or what a thing is made out of. The third cause is the efficient cause, that is, the process and the agent by which the thing is made. The fourth, the final cause, is the good, or the purpose and end of a thing, known as ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]''.

Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' is often referred to as the counterpart to this Platonic conception of poetry. ''Poetics'' is his treatise on the subject of mimesis. Aristotle was not against literature as such; he stated that human beings are mimetic beings, feeling an urge to create texts (art) that reflect and represent reality.

Aristotle considered it important that there be a certain distance between the work of art on the one hand and life on the other; we draw knowledge and consolation from tragedies only because they do not happen to us. Without this distance, tragedy could not give rise to [[catharsis]]. However, it is equally important that the text causes the audience to identify with the characters and the events in the text, and unless this identification occurs, it does not touch us as an audience. Aristotle holds that it is through "simulated representation", mimesis, that we respond to the acting on the stage which is conveying to us what the characters feel, so that we may [[empathy|empathise]] with them in this way through the mimetic form of dramatic roleplay. It is the task of the dramatist to produce the tragic enactment in order to accomplish this empathy by means of what is taking place on stage.

In short, catharsis can only be achieved if we see something that is both recognisable and distant. Aristotle argued that literature is more interesting as a means of learning than history, because history deals with specific facts that have happened, and which are contingent, whereas literature, although sometimes based on history, deals with events that could have taken place or ought to have taken place.

Aristotle thought of drama as being "an imitation of an action" and of [[tragedy]] as "falling from a higher to a lower [[Estates of the realm|estate]]" and so being removed to a less ideal situation in more ''tragic'' circumstances than before. He posited the [[fictional character|characters]] in tragedy as being better than the average human being, and those of comedy as being worse.

Michael Davis, a translator and commentator of Aristotle writes:
{{cquote|At first glance, mimesis seems to be a stylizing of reality in which the ordinary features of our world are brought into focus by a certain exaggeration, the relationship of the imitation to the object it imitates being something like the relationship of dancing to walking. Imitation always involves selecting something from the continuum of experience, thus giving boundaries to what really has no beginning or end. ''Mimêsis'' involves a framing of reality that announces that what is contained within the frame is not simply real. Thus the more "real" the imitation the more fraudulent it becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (1993, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Contrast to diegesis====
It was also Plato and Aristotle who contrasted mimesis with [[diegesis]] (Greek διήγησις). Mimesis ''shows'', rather than ''tells'', by means of directly represented action that is enacted. Diegesis, however, is the ''telling'' of the [[narrative|story]] by a narrator; the author narrates action indirectly and describes what is in the characters' minds and emotions. The narrator may speak as a particular character or may be the "invisible narrator" or even the "all-knowing narrator" who speaks from above in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

In Book&amp;nbsp;III of his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;373 BCE), [[Plato]] examines the style of poetry (the term includes comedy, [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]]):&lt;ref&gt;An [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt etext of Plato's ''Republic''] is available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/150 Project Gutenberg]. The most relevant section is the following: "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come? / Certainly, he replied. / And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? / [...] / And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? / Of course. / Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? / Very true. / Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration." (Plato, Republic, Book&amp;nbsp;III.)&lt;/ref&gt; All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (diegesis) and imitation or representation (mimesis). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the [[dithyramb]] is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in [[epic poetry]]. When reporting or narrating, "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else"; when imitating, the poet produces an "assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt ''Republic''], Book&amp;nbsp;III.&lt;/ref&gt; In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;See also Pfister (1977, 2–3) and Elam: "classical narrative is always oriented towards an explicit ''there and then'', towards an imaginary 'elsewhere' set in the past and which has to be evoked for the reader through predication and description. Dramatic worlds, on the other hand, are presented to the spectator as 'hypothetically actual' constructs, since they are 'seen' in progress 'here and now' without narratorial mediation. [...] This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in [[Aristotle]]'s differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Mimesis in contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''mimesis'' (direct imitation)" (1980, 110–1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle argues that kinds of poetry (the term includes drama, flute music, and [[lyre]] music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'', according to their ''objects'', and according to their ''mode'' or ''manner'' (section&amp;nbsp;I); "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality, as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section&amp;nbsp;III).

Though they conceive of mimesis in quite different ways, its relation with diegesis is identical in Plato's and Aristotle's formulations.

In [[ludology]], mimesis is sometimes used to refer to the self-consistency of a represented world, and the availability of in-game rationalisations for elements of the gameplay. In this context, mimesis has an associated grade: highly self-consistent worlds that provide explanations for their puzzles and game mechanics are said to display a higher degree of mimesis. This usage can be traced back to the essay "Crimes Against Mimesis".&lt;ref name=crimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |title=Crimes Against Mimesis |accessdate=2006-12-17 |last=Giner-Sorolla |first=Roger |date=April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619081931/http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |archivedate=19 June 2005}} This is a reformatted version of a set of articles originally posted to Usenet:

'''Dionysian imitatio''' is the influential [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Greek author [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the 1st century BCE, which conceived it as technique of [[rhetoric]]: emulating, adaptating, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of ''mimesis'' formulated by [[Aristotle]]'s in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors".&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==Samuel Taylor Coleridge==
Mimesis, or imitation, as he referred to it, was a crucial concept for [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s theory of the [[imagination]]. Coleridge begins his thoughts on imitation and poetry from Plato, Aristotle, and [[Philip Sidney]], adopting their concept of imitation of nature instead of other writers. His middling{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} departure from the earlier thinkers lies in his arguing that art does not reveal a unity of essence through its ability to achieve sameness with nature. Coleridge claims:
{{quote|[T]he composition of a poem is among the imitative arts; and that imitation, as opposed to copying, consists either in the interfusion of the SAME throughout the radically DIFFERENT, or the different throughout a base radically the same.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, S.T. (1983) ''Biographia Literaria.'' v.1 eds. James Engell and W. Jackson Bate. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 72. {{ISBN|0-691-09874-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here, Coleridge opposes imitation to copying, the latter referring to [[William Wordsworth]]'s notion that poetry should duplicate nature by capturing actual speech. Coleridge instead argues that the unity of essence is revealed precisely through different materialities and media. Imitation, therefore, reveals the sameness of processes in nature.

==Luce Irigaray==
The Belgian feminist [[Luce Irigaray]] used the term to describe a form of resistance where women imperfectly imitate stereotypes about themselves so as to show up these stereotypes and undermine them.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.iep.utm.edu/i/irigaray.htm#SH4a].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Taussig==
{{Further|Cultural appropriation|Appropriation (sociology)}}
In ''Mimesis and Alterity'' (1993), the [[anthropologist]] [[Michael Taussig]] examines the way that people from one culture adopt another's nature and culture (the process of mimesis) at the same time as distancing themselves from it (the process of [[alterity]]). He describes how a legendary tribe, the "white Indians", or [[Kuna (people)|Cuna]], have adopted in various representations figures and images reminiscent of the white people they encountered in the past (without acknowledging doing so).

Taussig, however, criticises anthropology for reducing yet another culture, that of the Cuna, for having been so impressed by the exotic technologies of the whites that they raised them to the status of gods. To Taussig this [[reductionism]] is suspect, and he argues this from both sides in his ''Mimesis and Alterity'' to see values in the [[anthropologist]]s' perspective while simultaneously defending the independence of a lived culture from the perspective of anthropological reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, 1993:47, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==René Girard==
In ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'' (1978), [[René Girard#Mimetic desire|René Girard]] posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world," but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: "rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Girard|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|publisher=Stanford University Press|date=1987|pages=7, 26, 307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4521">{{about|the use of the moral in storytelling||morality}}
{{for|the township in Indiana|Moral Township, Shelby County, Indiana}}

A '''moral''' (from [[Latin]] ''morālis'') is a [[message]] that is conveyed or a lesson to be learned from a [[narrative|story]] or [[wikt:event|event]]. The moral may be left to the hearer, reader, or viewer to determine for themselves, or may be explicitly encapsulated in a [[aphorism|maxim]]. A moral is a lesson in a story or in real life.

==Finding morals==
As an example of an explicit maxim, at the end of [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's fable]] of [[the Tortoise and the Hare]], in which the plodding and determined tortoise won a race against the much-faster yet extremely arrogant hare, the stated moral is "slow and steady wins the race". However, other morals can often be taken from the story itself; for instance, that arrogance or overconfidence in one's abilities may lead to failure or the loss of an event, race, or contest.

The use of [[stock character]]s is a means of conveying the moral of the story by eliminating complexity of personality and depicting the issues arising in the interplay between the characters, enables the writer to generate a clear message. With more rounded characters, such as those typically found in [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Play (theatre)|plays]], the moral may be more nuanced but no less present, and the writer may point it out in other ways (see, for example, the [[Prologue]] to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'').

==Arts==
Throughout the history of recorded literature, the majority of fictional writing has served not only to entertain but also to instruct, inform or improve their audiences or readership. In [[Ancient Greek theatre|classical drama]], for example, the role of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] was to comment on the proceedings and draw out a message for the audience to take away with them; while the [[Charles_Dickens#Novels|novels of Charles Dickens]] are a vehicle for morals regarding the social and economic system of [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] Britain.

Morals have typically been more obvious in [[children's literature]], sometimes even being introduced with the phrase: "The moral of the story is …". Such explicit techniques have grown increasingly out of fashion in modern storytelling, and are now usually only included for [[irony|ironic]] purposes.

Some examples are: "Better to be safe than sorry" ([[precautionary principle]]), "The evil deserves no aid", "Be friends with whom you don't like", "Don't judge people by the way they look", "Slow and steady wins the race", "Once started down the dark path, forever will it hold your destiny", and "Your overconfidence is your weakness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aesop's Fables: Online Collection - Selected Fables|url=http://www.aesopfables.com/aesopsel.html|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aesop's Fables]] are the most famous of stories with strong moral conclusions.

== In moral tales ==
Morals were one of the main purposes of literature during 1780–1830, especially in [[children's literature]]. Part of the reason for this was the writings of [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in the 18th century, which brought attention to children as an audience for literature. Following in their line of thought, [[Thomas Day]] (1748–1789) wrote ''[[Sandford and Merton]]'', elevating the outstanding morals of one young boy above the rapscallion nature of another. [[Maria Edgeworth]] (1776–1849) was another prominent author of moral tales, writing about how a wise adult can educate a child; one of her more famous stories is "[[The Purple Jar]]". During this time, the theme of "a young heroine or hero gaining wisdom and maturity was taken up by many other writers" (p.&amp;nbsp;93).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Children's Literature|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195146565|pages=93–96|author=Dennis Butts|authorlink=Moral Tales|editor=Jack Zipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of children to derive moral lessons from stories and visual media develops around the age of 9 or 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/01/08/375878511/and-the-moral-of-the-story-is-kids-dont-always-understand-the-moral|title=And The Moral Of The Story Is ...

'''Museum education''' is a specialized field devoted to developing and strengthening  the education role of non-formal education spaces and institutions such as museums. Its main objective is to engage visitors in learning experiences to enhance their curiosity and interest on their objects and collections. [[File:Dallas Museum of Art 06.jpg|thumb|Educational exhibition on "Materials &amp; Meanings" at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]].]]

In a seminal report called ''Excellence and Equity''&lt;ref name="aam1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=Excellence and Equity|year=1992|publisher=American Association of Museums|isbn=978-0-931201-14-1|url=http://iweb.aam-us.org/Purchase/ProductDetail.aspx?Product_code=I277}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1992 by the American Association of Museums (now the [http://aam-us.org/about-us American Alliance of Museums]), the educational role of museums was identified as the core to museums' service to the public. According to the report, "...the public dimensions of museums leads them to perform the public service of education—a term that in its broadest sense includes exploration, study, observation, critical thinking, contemplation and dialogue". As museum education has developed as a field of study and interest in its own right, efforts have been made to record its history and to establish a research agenda to strengthen its position as a discipline in the wider work of museums.

== History ==

=== Non-formal education ===

In his first report as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Education and Culture during [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration, in 1968, [[Philip H. Coombs]] emphasized the increment of the educative needs of the world’s population after World War II. In it, he mentions the diversity of non-formal education activities that constitute, or should constitute an important complement to formal education to the total educational efforts of any country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pastor Homs, Ma. Inmaculada (2001). «La necesidad de planificación y evaluación educativas en la educación no formal. Algunas propuestas». ''Educació i Cultura'': 14, 87-89.&lt;/ref&gt; To Coombs, non-formal education had the potential to satisfy the learning demands of both, individuals and collectivities, because unlike formal and traditional education, which is rigid with its contents and programs, it is flexible and, when planning and designing educational activities, it takes into consideration local variations of culture, economy and society, which counteracts the tendency of developing countries to just imitate education models of developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;Pastor Homs, Ma. Inmaculada (2011 [2004]). «1». ''Pedagogía museística. Nuevas perspectivas y tendencias actuales''. Ariel. p. 15. {{ISBN|978-84-344-6974-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a work written by Coombs in conjunction with M. Ahmed, non-formal education is defined as "...any organized educational activity outside the established formal system—whether operating separately or as an important feature of some broader activity—that is intended to serve identifiable learning clienteles and learning objective".&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, Phillips H. and H. Ahmed. ''New Paths To Learning: For Rural Children and Youth'' (en inglés). New York, N.Y.: International Council for Educational Development Publications. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, Coombs and Ahmed add the idea that non-formal education is any systematic educative activity, organized outside from the official framework to facilitate educative experiences for all people, regardless of age, genre, nationality, social, economic or health situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout his career, Coombs encouraged and impulsed the professional development of people responsible of non-formal education, which will be determining to the development and professionalization of the educative areas in institutions devoted to non-formal education.

=== Beginnings in art museums of the United States ===

At the turn of the twentieth century, art museums were very new institutions to the average visitor, who was seen wandering with no clear direction through the galleries, and with no clear idea on how to appreciate and study the exhibitions. In 1906, architect J. Randolph Coolidge Jr. was appointed the temporary director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. He experimented with a guiding system in the galleries, to help visitors orient themselves throughout their walk across the exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Rika and, Elliot Kai-Kee (2011). «2». ''Teaching in the Art Museum. Interpretation as Experience''(en inglés). J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles. {{ISBN|978-1-60606-058-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in the June bulletin of the museum that same year, features one of the first uses of the term docent and the description of its functions:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It has been proposed to the Trustees to consider the permanent appointment of one or more persons of intelligence and education who could act as intermediaries between Curators and the many who would be glad to avail themselves of trained instruction in our galleries. Through these docents, as it has been proposed to call them, the heads of departments could instruct many more persons than it would be possible for them to accompany through the galleries; and illustrated lectures upon the collections prepared in the departments might be regularly given by these specially qualified aids both in the Museum and in the class rooms of neighboring schools and colleges."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-4423283/4423283_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The Educational Work of the Museum.

[[File:Map of America by Sebastian Munster.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Sebastian Münster]]'s map of the New World, first published in 1540]]
[[File:Graverat titelblad - Skoklosters slott - 93404.tif|thumb|History of the New World "Historia antipodum oder newe Welt". Matthäus Merian, 1631.]]

The '''New World''' is one of the names used for the majority of [[Earth]]'s [[Western Hemisphere]], specifically the [[Americas]] (including nearby islands such as those of the [[List of Caribbean islands|Caribbean]] and [[Bermuda]]).

The term originated in the early 16th century after [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Europeans made landfall]] in what would later be called the Americas in the [[age of discovery]], expanding the geographical horizon of [[Greco-Roman geography|classical geographers]], who had thought of the [[world]] as consisting of [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]], collectively now referred to as the [[Old World]] (a.k.a. [[Afro-Eurasia]]).

The phrase gained prominence after the publication of a pamphlet titled ''Mundus Novus'' attributed to [[Italians|Italian]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=upkyAQAAMAAJ Mundus Novus: Letter to Lorenzo Pietro Di Medici], by Amerigo Vespucci; translation by George Tyler Northrup, Princeton University Press; 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Americas were also referred to as the "fourth part of the world".&lt;ref name="M.H.Davidson 1997 p.417"&gt;M.H.Davidson (1997) ''Columbus Then and Now, a life re-examined. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press'', p. 417)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The terms "[[Old World]]" vs. "New World" are meaningful in historical context and for the purpose of distinguishing the world's major [[ecozones]], and to classify plant and animal species that originated therein.

One can speak of the "New World" in a [[history|historical]] context, e.g., when discussing the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]], the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] and other events of the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial]] period. For lack of alternatives, the term is also still useful to those discussing issues that concern the Americas and the nearby [[Island#Oceanic islands|oceanic islands]], such as [[Bermuda]] and [[Clipperton Island]], collectively.

The term "New World" is used in a [[biology|biological]] context, when one speaks of Old World ([[Palearctic ecozone|Palearctic]], [[Afrotropic ecozone|Afrotropic]]) and New World species ([[Nearctic ecozone|Nearctic]], [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropic]]). Biological [[Biological classification|taxonomists]] often attach the "New World" label to groups of species that are found exclusively in the Americas, to distinguish them from their counterparts in the "Old World" (Europe, Africa and Asia), e.g. [[New World monkey]]s, [[New World vulture]]s, [[New World warbler]]s.

The label is also often used in agriculture. Asia, Africa, and Europe share a common agricultural history stemming from the [[Neolithic Revolution]], and the same domesticated plants and animals spread through these three continents thousands of years ago, making them largely indistinct and useful to classify together as "Old World". Common Old World crops (e.g., [[barley]], [[lentil]]s, [[oats]], [[pea]]s, [[rye]], [[wheat]]), and domesticated animals (e.g., [[cattle]], [[chicken]]s, [[goat]]s, [[horse]]s, [[pig]]s, [[sheep]]) did not exist in the Americas until they were introduced by post-[[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbian contact]] in the 1490s (see "[[Columbian Exchange]]"). Conversely, many common [[crops]] were originally domesticated in the Americas before they spread worldwide after Columbian contact, and are still often referred to as "[[New World crops]]"; [[common bean]]s (''phaseolus''), [[maiz]], and [[squash (plant)|squash]] – the "[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]]" – as well as the [[avocado]], [[tomato]], and wide varieties of [[capsicum]] ([[bell pepper]], [[chili pepper]], etc.), and the [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] were originally domesticated by [[pre-Columbian]] peoples in [[Mesoamerica]], while agriculturalists in the [[Andean]] region of South America brought forth the [[cassava]], [[peanut]], [[potato]], [[quinoa]] and domesticated animals like the [[alpaca]], [[guinea pig]] and [[llama]]. Other famous New World crops include the [[cashew]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[rubber]], [[sunflower]], [[tobacco]], and [[vanilla]], and fruits like the [[guava]], [[papaya]] and [[pineapple]]. There are rare instances of overlap, e.g., the [[calabash]] (bottle-gourd), [[cotton]], and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], and the dog, are believed to have been domesticated separately in both the [[Old World|Old]] and New World, their early forms possibly brought along by [[Paleo-Indians]] from Asia during the [[last glacial period]].

In [[wine terminology]], "New World" has a different definition. "[[New World wines]]" include not only North American and South American wines, but also those from South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and all other locations outside the traditional wine-growing regions of Europe, North Africa and the Near East.&lt;ref name="Wine Folly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://winefolly.com/review/new-world-vs-old-world-wine/|title=Real Differences: New World vs Old World Wine |publisher= Wine Folly|date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of term==

[[File:Stradanus America.jpg|thumb|Allegory of the New World: [[Amerigo Vespucci]] awakens the sleeping America]] 
The term "New World" ("Mundus Novus") was first coined by the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], in a letter written to his friend and former patron [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463–1503)|Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici]] in the Spring of 1503, and published (in [[Latin]]) in 1503–04 under the title ''Mundus Novus''. Vespucci's letter contains arguably the first explicit articulation in print of the hypothesis that the lands discovered by European navigators to the west were not the edges of Asia, as asserted by [[Christopher Columbus]], but rather an entirely different continent, a "New World".&lt;ref name="M.H.Davidson 1997 p.417"/&gt;

Vespucci first approached this realization in June 1502, during a famous chance meeting between two different expeditions at the watering stop of "Bezeguiche" (the Bay of [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]) – his own outgoing expedition, on its way to chart the coast of newly discovered [[Brazil]], and the vanguard ships of the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|Second Portuguese India armada]] of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], returning home from India. Having already visited the Americas in prior years, Vespucci probably found it difficult to reconcile what he had already seen in the [[West Indies]], with what the returning sailors told him of the [[East Indies]]. Vespucci wrote a preliminary letter to Lorenzo, while anchored at Bezeguiche, which he sent back with the Portuguese fleet – at this point only expressing a certain puzzlement about his conversations.&lt;ref&gt;This preliminary letter from Bezeguiche was not published, but remained in manuscript form. It is reproduced in F.A. de Varnhagen (1865: [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 78–82]).&lt;/ref&gt; Vespucci was finally convinced when he proceeded on his mapping expedition through 1501–02, covering the huge stretch of coast of eastern Brazil. After returning from Brazil, in the Spring of 1503, Amerigo Vespucci composed the ''Mundus Novus'' letter in Lisbon to Lorenzo in Florence, with its famous opening paragraph:&lt;ref&gt;English translation of ''Mundus Novus'' as found in Markham (1894: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8wAuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 42–52])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In passed days I wrote very fully to you of my return from new countries, which have been found and explored with the ships, at the  cost and by the command of this Most Serene King of Portugal; and it is lawful to call it a new world, because none of these countries were known to our ancestors and all who hear about them they will be entirely new.  For the opinion of the ancients was, that the greater part of the world beyond the equinoctial line to the south was not land, but only sea, which they have called the Atlantic; and even if they have affirmed that any continent is there, they have given many reasons for denying it is inhabited. But this opinion is false, and entirely opposed to the  truth. My last voyage has proved it, for I have found a continent in that southern part; full of animals and more populous than our Europe, or Asia, or Africa, and even more temperate and pleasant than any other region known to us.|}}

Vespucci's letter was a publishing sensation in Europe, immediately (and repeatedly) reprinted in several other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Varnhagen, ''Amerígo Vespucci'' (1865:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 13–26]) provides side-by-side reproductions of both the 1503 Latin version ''Mundus Novus'', and the 1507 Italian re-translation "El Nuovo Mondo de Lengue Spagnole interpretato in Idioma Ro. Libro Quinto" (from ''Paesi Nuovamente retrovati''). The Latin version of ''Mundus Novus'' was reprinted many times (see Varnhagen, 1865: [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 9] for a list of early reprints).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prior usage ===

While Amerigo Vespucci is usually credited for coming up with the term "New World" (''Mundus Novus'') for the Americas in his 1503 letter, certainly giving it its popular cachet, similar terms had nonetheless been used and applied before him.

The [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Alvise Cadamosto]] had used the term "un altro mundo" ("another world") to refer to [[sub-Saharan Africa]], which he explored in 1455 and 1456 on behalf of the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;Cadamosto ''Navigationi'', c. 1470, as reprinted in Giovanni Ramusio (1554: [https://books.google.com/books?id=iZ5TZHXOnYcC&amp;pg=RA2-PA106-IA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 106]). See also M. Zamora ''Reading Columbus'', (1993: p. 121)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was merely a literary flourish, not a suggestion of a new "fourth" part of the world. Cadamosto was quite aware sub-Saharan Africa was firmly part of the African continent.

The [[Italy|Italian]]-born Spanish chronicler [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]] often shares credit with Vespucci for designating the Americas as a new world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= de Madariaga | first= Salvador | authorlink= Salvador de Madariaga | year=1952 | publisher= Editorial Hermes | location= Mexico | edition= 5th | title= Vida del muy magnífico señor Don Cristóbal Colón | page= 363 | quote= "nuevo mundo", [...] designación que Pedro Mártyr será el primero en usar | language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Martyr used the term ''Orbe Novo'' (literally, "New Globe", but often translated as "New World") in the title of his history of the discovery of the Americas as a whole, which began to appear in 1511 (cosmologically, "orbis" as used here refers to the whole hemisphere, while "mundus" refers to the land within it).&lt;ref&gt;J.Z. Smith, ''Relating Religion'', Chicago (2004: p. 268)&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Martyr had been writing and circulating private letters commenting on Columbus's discoveries since 1493 and, from the start, doubted Columbus's claims to have reached East Asia ("the Indies"), and consequently came up with alternative names to refer to them.&lt;ref&gt;E.G. Bourne ''Spain in America, 1450–580'' New York: Harper (1904: p. 30)&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few weeks after Columbus's return from his first voyage, Peter Martyr wrote letters referring to Columbus's discovered lands as the "western antipodes" ("antipodibus occiduis", letter of May 14, 1493),&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'' (Letter 130 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 72])&lt;/ref&gt; the "new hemisphere of the earth" ("novo terrarum hemisphaerio", September 13, 1493),&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'', Letter 133, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 73]&lt;/ref&gt; and in a letter dated November 1, 1493, refers to Columbus as the "discoverer of the new globe" ("Colonus ille novi orbis repertor").&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'' (Letter 138, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 76])&lt;/ref&gt; A year later (October 20, 1494), Peter Martyr again refers to the marvels of the New Globe ("Novo Orbe") and the "Western hemisphere."("ab occidente hemisphero").&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martyr ''Opus Epistolarum'', Letter 156 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 88]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Columbus]] touched the continent of South America in his 1498 [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third voyage]]. In his own 1499 letter to the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Spain, reporting the results of his third voyage, Columbus relates how the massive waters of the [[Orinoco]] delta rushing into the [[Gulf of Paria]] implied that a previously unknown continent must lie behind it.&lt;ref&gt;"if the river mentioned does not proceed from the terrestrial paradise, it comes from an immense tract of land situated in the south, of which no knowledge has been hitherto obtained" (Columbus 1499 letter on the third voyage, as reproduced in R.H. Major, ''Select Letters of Christopher Columbus'', 1870: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zFjUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 147])&lt;/ref&gt; However, bowing to the classical tripartite division of the world, Columbus discards that hypothesis and proposes instead that the South American landmass is not a "fourth" continent, but rather the [[terrestrial paradise]] of Biblical tradition, not a previously unknown "new" part of the world, but a land already "known" (but location undiscovered) by [[Christendom]].&lt;ref&gt;J.Z. Smith, ''Relating Religion'', Chicago (2004: pp. 266–67)&lt;/ref&gt; In another letter (to the nurse of Prince John, written 1500), Columbus refers to having reached a "new heavens and world" ("nuevo cielo e mundo")&lt;ref&gt;Columbus 1500 letter to the nurse (in Major, 1870: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zFjUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 154])&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had placed "another world" ("otro mundo") under the dominion of the Kings of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Columbus's 1500 letter to the nurse(Major, 1870: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zFjUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 170])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acceptance ===
The Vespucci passage above applied the "New World" label to merely the continental landmass of [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Ober ''Amerigo Vespucci'' New York: Harper (1907: pp. 239, 244)&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, most of the continent of [[North America]] was not yet discovered, and Vespucci's comments did not eliminate the possibility that the islands of the [[Antilles]] discovered earlier by [[Christopher Columbus]] might still be the eastern edges of Asia, as Columbus continued to insist down to his dying day.&lt;ref&gt;S.E. Morison ''The European Discovery of America, v.2: The southern voyages, 1492–1616''.(1974: pp. 265–66).&lt;/ref&gt; A critical step in the transition was the conference of navigators (''Junta de Navegantes'') assembled by the Spanish monarchs at [[Toro, Zamora|Toro]] in 1505, and continued at [[Burgos]] in 1508, to digest all existing information about the Indies, come to an agreement on what had really been discovered, and set out the future goals of Spanish exploration. Amerigo Vespucci attended both conferences, and seems to have had an outsized influence on them – Vespucci ended up being appointed the first ''piloto mayor'', the chief of navigation of Spain, at Burgos.&lt;ref&gt;For an account of Vespucci at Toro and Burgos,  see Navarette ''Colección de los viages y descubrimientos que hicieron por mar los españoles desde fines del siglo XV''(1829: v.iii, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ESYW_1DUELoC&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 320–23])&lt;/ref&gt; Although the proceedings of the Toro-Burgos conferences are missing, it is almost certain that Vespucci articulated his recent "New World" thesis to his fellow navigators there. It was during these conferences when Spanish officials seem to have finally accepted that the Antilles and the known stretch of Central America were definitely ''not'' the Indies they had originally sought, and Columbus had insisted they were, and set out the new goal for Spanish explorers: to find a sea passage or [[strait]] through the Americas which would permit them to sail to Asia proper.&lt;ref&gt;C.O. Sauer ''The Early Spanish Main''. Cambridge (1966: pp. 166–67)&lt;/ref&gt; In English usage the term "New World" was problematic and only accepted relatively late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sobecki|first1=Sebastian|title=New World Discovery|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|date=2015|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935338.001.0001|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935338.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199935338-e-141|accessdate=2 June 2016|doi-broken-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cartographic representation ===

[[File:Map Diego Ribero 1529.jpg|thumb|The World Map by [[Diogo Ribeiro]] (1529) labels the [[Americas]] as ''MUNDUS NOVUS''. It traces most of South America and the east coast of North America.]]
While it became generally accepted after Vespucci that Columbus's discoveries were not Asia but a "New World", the geographic relationship between the two continents was still unclear.&lt;ref name = parry&gt;J.H. Parry, ''The Discovery of the Sea'' (1974: p. 227)&lt;/ref&gt; That there must be a large ocean between Asia and the Americas was implied by the known existence of vast continuous sea along the coasts of [[East Asia]]. Given the size of the Earth as calculated by [[Eratosthenes]] this left a large space between Asia and the newly discovered lands.  

Even prior to Vespucci, several maps, e.g. the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 and the [[Canerio map]] of 1504, placed a large open ocean between China on the east side of the map, and the inchoate largely water-surrounded North American and South American discoveries on the western side of map. However, out of uncertainty, they depicted a finger of the Asian land mass stretching across the top to the eastern edge of the map, suggesting it carried over into the western hemisphere (e.g. the Cantino Planisphere denotes [[Greenland]] as "Punta d'Asia" – "edge of Asia"). Some maps, e.g. the 1506 [[Contarini–Rosselli map]] and the 1508 [[Johannes Ruysch]] map, bowing to Ptolemaic authority and Columbus's assertions, have the northern Asian landmass stretching well into the western hemisphere and merging with known North America (Labrador, Newfoundland, etc.). These maps place the island of Japan near Cuba and leave the South American continent – Vespucci's "New World" proper – detached and floating below by itself.&lt;ref name = parry/&gt; The [[Waldseemüller map]] of 1507, which accompanied the famous ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'' volume (which includes reprints of Vespucci's letters) comes closest to modernity by placing a completely open sea (with no stretching land fingers) between Asia on the eastern side and the New World (being represented two times in the same map in a different way: with and without a sea passage in the middle of what is now named Central America) on the western side – which (on what is now named South America) that same map famously labels simply "''[[Naming of America|America]]''". However, [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s map of 1516 retreats considerably from his earlier map and back to classical authority, with the Asian land mass merging into North America (which he now calls ''Terra de Cuba Asie partis''), and quietly drops the "America" label from South America, calling it merely ''[[Terra incognita|Terra Incognita]]''.&lt;ref name = parry/&gt;

The western coast of the New World – the [[Pacific Ocean]] – was only discovered in 1513 by [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]. But it would take a few more years – [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s voyage of 1519–22 – to determine that the Pacific definitely formed a single large body of water separating Asia from the Americas. It would be several more years before the Pacific Coast of North America was mapped, dispelling lingering doubts. Until the discovery of the [[Bering Strait]]s in the 17th century, there was no absolute confirmation that Asia and North America were not connected, and some European maps of the 16th century still continued to hopefully depict North America connected by a land bridge to Asia (e.g. the 1533 [[Johannes Schöner globe]]).&lt;ref name = parry/&gt;

In 1524, the term was used by [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in a record of his voyage that year along the Atlantic coast of [[North America]], land that is now part of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Verrazzano, Giovanni da (1524).[http://bc.barnard.columbia.edu/~lgordis/earlyAC/documents/verrazan.htm "The Written Record of the Voyage of 1524 of Giovanni da Verrazzano as recorded in a letter to Francis I, King of France, July 8th, 1524"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908085440/http://bc.barnard.columbia.edu/~lgordis/earlyAC/documents/verrazan.htm |date=2006-09-08 }}.

The '''opening narration''' of a story, whether [[video game]], [[book]], [[film]] or otherwise, usually gives the reader or viewer background information necessary for a full understanding of the plot. It sets the scene, creates atmosphere and introduces a character.

A '''pitch''' is a concise verbal (and sometimes visual) presentation of an idea for a [[film]] or TV series generally made by a [[screenwriter]] or [[film director]] to a [[film producer]] or [[studio executive]] in the hope of attracting [[development (film)|development]] finance to pay for the writing of  a [[screenplay]].&lt;ref name="p58"/&gt;

"Pitch" is a contraction of the phrase "[[sales pitch]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karg, Van Over, Sutherland, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; A pitch is used throughout different stages of production, such as casting and distribution, as well as to urge film producers to further fund a project.&lt;ref name="p58"&gt;Steiff, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Filmmakers who devise a pitch tend to manufacture a production package, which is handed out to each potential investor during the pitch. The package contains the basic information for the filmmaker's project, such as a plot synopsis and budgeting values.&lt;ref&gt;Karg, Van Over, Sutherland, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, filmmakers will produce an independent [[pitch trailer]] as a part of the package to help potential financiers better visualize the project and the filmmaker's vision.

Though pitches are usually made on the basis of a full [[Script (recorded media)|script]] or [[teleplay]], [[animated cartoon|animated]] productions for both film and television are often pitched on the basis of [[storyboard]]s alone. For example, the animated television show ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' was pitched from a storyboard. Co-founders of the project, [[Dan Povenmire]] and [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]], needed to convince overseas executives for [[The Walt Disney Company]] to [[greenlight]] the series, so they drew a storyboard and recorded it as a reel. They then mixed it and dubbed it over with sound effects, voices, and narrative, then sent the recording to the executives, who accepted it.&lt;ref name="OP"&gt;{{cite video|title="Original Pitch" featurette, from Volume 1: "The Fast and the Phineas"|medium=DVD|date=2008|people=Povenmire, Dan|publisher=[[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television pitches can also be devised by the network or company that produces the program.&lt;ref name="raise"/&gt; Certain networks are pitched the idea of including a character in a series in order to boost ratings. Such pitches have been used with "Oliver" in ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' and "Luke" on ''[[Growing Pains]]''.&lt;ref name="Alberti, p. 144"&gt;Alberti, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Networks also try to force their ideas on series' producers through their pitches, though their approach is business-oriented and their ideas are generally not favored by writers and viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Alberti, pp. 145&amp;ndash;147&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the crew of the animated series ''[[Rugrats]]'' was approached by [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], which pitched the idea of a ''Rugrats'' [[Hanukkah]] special. [[Paul Germain]], co-creator of the series, responded by suggesting a [[passover]] special, which he dubbed a "funny idea."&lt;ref name="raise"&gt;{{cite news|title=How raising the Rugrats children became as difficult as the real thing|author=Swartz, Mimi|date=1998-10-30|publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]''|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; After they closed production for [[A Rugrats Passover|that special]], they began considering the Hanukkah special and eventually created it in 1996 as the episode "[[A Rugrats Chanukah]]."&lt;ref name="raise"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rites of Chanukah reach many|author=Ribadeneira, Diego|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|location=[[Boston, Massachusetts]]|date=1996-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pivot language''', sometimes also called a '''bridge language''', is an [[artificial language|artificial]] or [[natural language]] used as an intermediary language for translation between many different languages – to translate between any pair of languages A and B, one translates A to the pivot language P, then from P to B. Using a pivot language avoids the [[combinatorial explosion (communication)|combinatorial explosion]] of having translators across every combination of the supported languages, as the number of combinations of language is linear (&lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;), rather than quadratic &lt;math&gt;\left(\textstyle{\binom{n}{2}}=\frac{n^2-n}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; – one need only know the language A and the pivot language P (and someone else the language B and the pivot P), rather than needing a different translator for every possible combination of A and B.

The disadvantage of a pivot language is that each step of retranslation introduces possible mistakes and ambiguities – using a pivot language involves two steps, rather than one. For example, when [[Hernán Cortés]] communicated with [[Mesoamerican]] Indians, he would speak Spanish to [[Gerónimo de Aguilar]], who would speak [[Mayan language|Mayan]] to [[Malintzin]], who would speak [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] to the locals.

== Examples ==
{{See also|Interlingual machine translation}}
[[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are often used as pivot languages.  [[Interlingua]] has been used as a pivot language in international conferences and has been proposed as a pivot language for the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Breinstrup, Thomas. "Linguaphobos? Non in le UE". [Linguaphobes? Not in the EU]. ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', 2006, Issue 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Esperanto]] was proposed as a pivot language in the [[Distributed Language Translation]] project and has been used in this way in the Majstro Tradukvortaro at the Esperanto website [http://www.majstro.com/ Majstro.com].  The [[Universal Networking Language]] is an artificial language specifically designed for use as a pivot language.

== In computing ==
{{see also|Intermediate language|Data conversion#Pivotal conversion}}
Pivot coding is also a common method of translating data for computer systems.  For example, the [[internet protocol]], [[XML]] and [[high level language]]s are pivot codings of computer data which are then often rendered into internal binary formats for particular computer systems.

[[Unicode]] was designed to be usable as a pivot coding between various major existing character encodings, though its widespread adoption as a coding in its own right has made this usage unimportant.

== In machine translation (MT) ==
Current statistical machine translation ([[Statistical machine translation|SMT]]) systems use [[parallel corpora]] for source (s) and target (t) languages to achieve their good results, but good parallel corpora are not available for all languages. A pivot language (p) enables the bridge between two languages, to which existing parallel corpora are entirely or partially not yet at hand.

Pivot translation can be problematic because of the potential lack of fidelity of the information forwarded in the use of different corpora. From the use of two bilingual corpora (s-p &amp; p-t) to set up the s-t bridge, linguistic data are inevitably lost. Rule-based machine translation ([[RBMT]]) helps the system rescue this information, so that the system does not rely entirely on statistics but also on structural linguistic information.

Three basic techniques are used to employ pivot language in MT: (1) ''triangulation'', which focuses on phrase paralleling between source and pivot (s-p) and between pivot and target (p-t); (2) ''[[Transfer-based machine translation|transfer]]'', which translates the whole sentence of the source language to a pivot language and then to the target language; and (3) ''synthesis'', which builds a corpus of its own for system training.

The '''triangulation''' method (also called ''phrase table multiplication'') calculates the probability of both translation correspondences and lexical weight in s-p and p-t, to try to induce a new s-t phrase table. The '''transfer''' method (also called ''sentence translation strategy'') simply carries a straightforward translation of s into p and then another translation of p into t without using probabilistic tests (as in triangulation). The '''synthetic''' method uses an existing corpus of s and tries to build an own synthetic corpus out of it that is used by the system to train itself. Then a bilingual s-p corpus is synthesized to enable a p-t translation.

A direct comparison between triangulation and transfer methods for SMT systems has shown that triangulation achieves much better results than transfer.

All three pivot language techniques enhance the performance of SMT systems. However, the ''synthetic'' technique  doesn't work well with RBMT, and systems' performances are lower than expected. Hybrid SMT/RBMT systems achieve better translation quality than strict-SMT systems that rely on bad parallel corpora.

The key role of RBMT systems is that they help fill the gap left in the translation process of s-p → p-t, in the sense that these parallels are included in the SMT model for s-t.

'''Plot drift''' is a phenomenon in storytelling in which the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of the story deviates from its apparent initial direction. The phenomenon can affect written works, although it is often more noticeable in performed media such as [[television]] shows or [[movie]]s. Plot drift is generally (though not always) seen as contrary to good storytelling technique.

A sign of plot drift can be the increased introduction of new characters and settings near the end of a story.{{examples|date=June 2013}}

A contrary literary technique might include the apparent introduction of plot drift, only to later reveal a connection to the rest of the story.{{examples|date=June 2013}}

'''Polyglossia''' (pronunciation: /ˌpɒlɪˈɡlɒsɪə/)is a [[noun]] that refers to the coexistence of multiple [[language]]s (or distinct varieties of the same language) in one [[society]] or area. It was first used in the 1970s in the [[Academic journal]] "[[International Migration Review]]".
Polyglossia is a useful term for describing situations where more than two distinct varieties are used for clearly distinct purposes.

The '''Post-'80''' (also the '''Post-1980''', {{zh|c=八零后|p=bālínghòu}}) is a colloquial term which refers to the generation, especially in urban cities, whose members were born between 1980 and 1989 in [[People's Republic of China|Mainland China]] after the introduction of the [[one-child policy]]. This generation, the first to grow up entirely within the reformist era, currently ranges in age from {{age|1989|12|31}} to {{age|1980|1|1}}, making up a major portion of China's [[Young adult (psychology)|young adult]] demographic.

==Etymology==
In English, this group is also sometimes called [[China]]'s [[Generation Y]] after the use of the term in the book ''China’s Generation Y'' by Michael Stanat in 2005 (though he references the dates 1981–1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homabooks.com/general/books/east_asia/china/1029.php|title=China's Generation Y|website=www.homabooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

*People born in other periods are also named in the same way in [[Mainland China]].
:The '''Post-'70''' is used to describe Chinese people born in the 1970s.
:The '''[[Post-90s|Post-'90]]''' (九零后) means people born from 1990 to 1999 in urban areas. They are usually concerted to [[brain-disabled characters]] and [[non-mainstream]] culture. This generation has similar traits to post-'80 such as being open to [[premarital sex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-sex/more-than-half-chinese-say-premarital-sex-ok-poll-idUSPEK3401020070612|title=More than half Chinese say premarital sex ok: poll|date=12 June 2007|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; but to an even greater degree. It also has a much larger male surplus population than the post-80s, who already have a significant gap between the male and female population. As birth rates rapidly fell between 1990 and 1991 following the [[Tiananmen Square massacre]] this cohort is much smaller than the post-80s generation.
:The '''Pre-'60''' (六零前) means people born before the year 1960.

It is a [[generation]] of approximately 240 million people born between 1980 and 1990, although characteristics of the after-eighty generation have also been seen in those born in the 1990s. Growing up in modern China, this generation has been characterized by its optimism for the future, newfound excitement for [[consumerism]], [[entrepreneurship]], and acceptance of its historic role in transforming modern China into an [[World economy|economic]] [[superpower]].

These people are also distinguished by their increased access to digital media such as [[computer]]s, [[MP3]] players and [[mobile phone]]s. Post-'80ers in China often experience a palpable [[generation gap]] between them and their elders; while their parents lived during the [[Mao Zedong]] era, experienced famine and [[political instability]] and lack proper [[education]] because of the policies set forth under the [[Cultural Revolution]], they live in an environment of tremendous [[economic growth]] and [[social change]], high [[technology]], and rigorous education standards. There is also a significant generation gap between them and Post-'90, who are even more thoroughly entrenched in digitality and capitalism.

A clash between tradition and modern influences is noticeable in purchasing habits, [[career]] pursuits, and daily interaction between child and elders. Furthermore, young adults have been indirectly affected by forced government shutdowns of thousands of [[Internet café|Internet bars]] each year that prevent the excessive use of [[Internet in the People's Republic of China|the Internet]]. Young people are also affected by China's large socioeconomic divide between urban and rural residents and societal problems resulting from [[modernization]].
&lt;!-- (Taken from a similar article, may need to be rephrased)
It is said that they do not feel the inferiority complex of their elders towards the western world and rather have a sense of belonging with that of modern people.  They are also generally proud of their country and their people and can be seen as nationalists.  They are also seen as very independent, driven, and intelligent internet savvy entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;Korea Times, Generation X Shakes China, Sunny Lee, August 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  --&gt;

==Future==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
The Post-'80 generation illuminates important questions not only about China's future but also those of the United States and the global economy. Several factors that may influence the generation are individualism, [[consumerism]], modernization, and [[technology]].

{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
{{Main|Little Emperor Syndrome}}
{{Wiktionary|little emperor}}
When parents over-indulge their [[only child]], who has no siblings as a result of the [[One Child Policy]], the indulged children may be referred to as "[[Little Emperor Syndrome|little emperors]]" (''xiaohuangdi'' 小皇帝). Many Chinese families have the [[4-2-1 phenomenon|4-2-1]] format: 4 grandparents, 2 parents, one child. Parents and grandparents eat less and spend less money on themselves, only so the youngster could feel physically and mentally strong, focus on one's studies and be successful later on in life.&lt;ref name="Fong"&gt;Vanessa L. Fong. Only Hope: Coming of Age Under China's One-Child Policy. [[Stanford University Press]], 2004, 256 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all Chinese families usually adopt a set of traditional [[Confuciansim|Confucian]] values when raising their only child.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Because Confucianism considers [[Ren (Confucianism)|''Ren'']] (仁; love and social responsibility) the core [[emotion]] that develops moral conceptions into genuine personal [[motivation]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}, a child who has received too much familial attention but also endured high mental and physical restrictions because the economic future of the family depends on their academic success directly leads to a situation that is often considered in academic and popular discourse as over-indulging the children, in opposition to concepts of ''Ren'' and [[filial piety]] (孝; ''xiao''). There is substantial evidence that many young Chinese feel a heavy burden&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xljk.sdnu.edu.cn/Item/Show.asp?m=1&amp;d=360 Psychological problems in the post-'90 generation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714143226/http://www.xljk.sdnu.edu.cn/Item/Show.asp?m=1&amp;d=360 |date=2015-07-14 }} (Chinese; 90后易出现的心理问题) - Psychology Center of Shandong Normal University&lt;/ref&gt; and a huge responsibility towards their parents, understanding that their performances in school or other domains can be of crucial consequences towards their family.&lt;ref name="Fong"/&gt;

Depending on the specific family conditions and children's mental healthy condition, this burden could lead to a diligent lifestyle by youngsters or to a more rebellious attitude to traditional Confucian codes or not being able to cope with such pressure nor develop self-discipline.&lt;ref name="Thinking"&gt;[http://thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=117 Chinese Singletons - Basic ‘Spoiled’ Related Vocabulary], [http://thinkingchinese.com Thinking Chinese], September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

While being nurtured by parents and relatives gives children some clear advantages and opportunities, the fact that a child doesn't have sibling who 'compete' with him or her in a younger age could also lead to some psychological difficultes as the child grows. "Lacking adapting capabilities" ({{zh|c=没有适应能力|p=méiyǒu shìyìng nénglì}}) is a description which is commonly associated with the new post-'80 generation.&lt;ref name="Thinking"/&gt; Since such children don't need to put any efforts in order to gain parents' attention or to win family resources, they develop no competitive abilities and have weak social skills once they are older and need to be self-sufficient.

Traditionally seen as a rite of passage, marriage has been linked as milestones to adulthood. Yet, the Chinese millennials are late bloomers when it comes to marriage. Although some members of the millennials are well in their 30s, statistics show they are still living their lives as bachelors or bachelorettes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} 

Having grown up in times of modern [[consumerism]] and popular media, rather than the ideals of the [[Cultural Revolution]], many single-children are inclined to spend large amounts of money on themselves and thus are a cornerstone of retail sales.&lt;ref&gt;NHK World, Japan 7 Days, Matter of Fact: "Cause for Celebration" aired February 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Families which are well-off economically sometimes allow their children to indulge in the new materialistic sphere, while poorer families often still make efforts to keep their children inside the consumers' race, allowing them to purchase new clothes, new cell-phone brands, etc{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}.
&lt;!--
Aside from consumer importance they have been observed as having a different new parenting style of their own, giving their children much more independent freedom.  One opinion for the reason is that they grew up with too much pressure to be the best and want their children to have less pressure and more happiness.&lt;ref&gt;China Daily, 'Spoiled Generation' Paves the Way for New Age Parenting, Guan Xiaomeng, July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Their campaigns include the fight for the preservation of [[Lee Tung Street]], the Star Ferry Pier and the Queen's Pier, Choi Yuen Tsuen Village, real political reform (on June 23), and a citizen-oriented [[West Kowloon Cultural District]]. Their discourse mainly develops around themes such as [[anti-colonialism]], [[sustainable development]], and democracy.

==Post-'80 in Canada==

According to the Canadian Census, among the population that was never married, there was a large increase in the proportions for those in their 20s and 30s in 2011 in comparison to 1981. For young adults aged 25 to 29, the proportion who were never married increased from 26.0% of the population in 1981 to close to 73.1% in 2011. Even among individuals in their early 30s, the proportion of men who were never married increased from 15.0% in 1981 to 54.0% in 2011. For women, the increase was from 10.5% in 1981 to 43.4% in 2011.

'''Psychological thriller''' is a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] narrative which emphasizes the unstable or delusional psychological states of its characters. In terms of context and convention, it is a [[Genre#Subgenre|subgenre]] of the broader ranging thriller narrative structure,&lt;ref name = DictionaryDotCom&gt;Dictionary.com, definition, [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/psychological+thriller psychological thriller (definition)], Accessed November 3, 2013, "...a suspenseful movie or book emphasizing the psychology of its characters rather than the plot; this subgenre of thriller movie or book – Example: In a psychological thriller, the characters are exposed to danger on a mental level rather than a physical one....",&lt;/ref&gt; with similarities to [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] and [[detective fiction]] in the sense of sometimes having a "dissolving sense of reality". It is often told through the viewpoint of psychologically stressed characters, revealing their distorted mental perceptions and focusing on the complex and often tortured relationships between obsessive and pathological characters.&lt;ref name = Blackwell&gt;Christopher Pittard, Blackwell Reference, [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405182904_chunk_g978140518290418_ss1-14 Psychological Thrillers], Accessed November 3, 2013, "...characteristics of the genre as “a dissolving sense of reality; reticence in moral pronouncements; obsessive, pathological characters; the narrative privileging of complex, tortured relationships” ( Munt 1994)..."&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological thrillers often incorporate elements of [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], [[Drama (film and television)|drama]], [[action film|action]], and [[paranoia]]. Not to be confused with [[psychological horror]], which involves more terror than [[wikt:psychosomatic|psychosomatic]] themes.

==Definition==
Peter Hutchings states varied films have been labeled psychological thrillers, but it usually refers to "narratives with domesticated settings in which action is suppressed and where thrills are provided instead via investigations of the psychologies of the principal characters."&lt;ref name=hutchings&gt;{{cite book|title=The A to Z of Horror|last=Hutchings|first=Peter|page=253|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|year=2009|isbn=9780810870505|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_5DPHOVG7YC&amp;pg=PA253}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinguishing characteristic of a psychological thriller is it emphasizes the mental states of its characters: their perceptions, thoughts, distortions, and general struggle to grasp reality.&lt;ref name=packer&gt;{{cite book|title=Movies and the Modern Psyche | last=Packer | first=Sharon | publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2007|isbn=9780275993597|pages=87–90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CX4goUP_yh0C&amp;pg=PA87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to director [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]], psychological thrillers focus on story, character development, choice, and moral conflict; fear and anxiety drive the psychological tension in unpredictable ways. Madden stated their lack of spectacle and strong emphasis on character led to their decline in Hollywood popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/9032326/John-Madden-on-psychological-thrillers.html|title=John Madden on Psychological Thrillers|last=Bowie-Sell|first=Daisy|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=2012-01-23|accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological thrillers are suspenseful by exploiting uncertainty over characters' motives, honesty, and how they see the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Erin|last=Whitney|date=2012-11-15|work=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]|url=http://www.backstage.com/interview/gretchen-mol-returns-stage-modern-thriller-good-mother/|title=Gretchen Mol Returns to the Stage in 'The Good Mother'|accessdate=2013-08-21|quote="element of a psychological thriller because ... suspenseful feeling of who did what, who's being honest ... about perception..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films can also cause discomfort in audiences by privileging them with information they wish to share with the characters; guilty characters may suffer similar distress by virtue of their knowledge.&lt;ref name="packer" /&gt;

However, [[James N. Frey]] defines psychological thrillers as a style, rather than a subgenre; Frey states good thrillers focus on the psychology of their antagonists and build suspense slowly through ambiguity.&lt;ref name="frey"&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Write a Damn Good Thriller|last=Frey|first=James N.|authorlink=James N. Frey|pages=15–19|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] | year=2010 | isbn=9781429913638|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=POPvQNgZYIQC&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators and/or film distributors or publishers who seek to distance themselves from the negative connotations of horror often categorize their work as a psychological thriller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/story/six-things-that-still-drive-me-psycho|title=Six Things that Still Drive Me Psycho|last=Barton|first=Steve|work=[[DreadCentral]]|date=2008-05-27|accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same situation can occur when critics label a work to be a psychological thriller in order to elevate its perceived literary value.&lt;ref name="frey" /&gt;

==Literary devices and techniques==
* [[Plot twist]] – Films such as ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and ''[[The Skeleton Key]]'' have advertised the fact that they contain plot twists and asked audiences to refrain from revealing spoilers. Psychological thrillers with poorly received plot twists, such as ''[[The Village (2004 film)|The Village]]'', have suffered in the box office.&lt;ref name=twist&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-08-11-skeleton-key-main_x.htm|title=This Shocking Twist Is ... Secret|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2005-08-11|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Unreliable narrator]] – [[Andrew Taylor (author)|Andrew Taylor]] identifies the unreliable narrator as a common literary device used in psychological thrillers and traces it back to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s influence on the genre. Criminal insanity may be explored as a theme.&lt;ref name=dna&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7833135.stm|title=The DNA of detection|last=Taylor|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Taylor (author)|work=[[BBC]]|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[MacGuffin]] – Alfred Hitchcock pioneered the concept of the MacGuffin, a goal or item that helps to move the plot. The MacGuffin is frequently only vaguely defined, and it can be used to increase [[suspense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/971272-196/the-week-in-preview-i-am-a.html|title=The Week in Preview: "I am a typed director.

==Themes==
Many psychological thrillers have emerged over the past years, all in various media (film, literature, radio, etc.). Despite these very different forms of representation, general trends have appeared throughout the narratives. Some of these consistent themes include:&lt;ref name=packer/&gt;

* [[Death]]
* [[Existence]]/[[Intention|Purpose]]
* [[Identity (philosophy)|Identity]]
* [[Mind]]
* [[Perception]]
* [[Reality]]

In psychological thrillers, characters often have to battle an inner struggle. Amnesia is a common [[plot device]] used to explore these questions. Character may be threatened with death, be forced to deal with the deaths of others, or fake their own deaths.&lt;ref name=packer/&gt; Psychological thrillers can be complex, and reviewers may recommend a second or third viewing to "decipher its secrets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Stephen | last=Holden | date=2011-04-14 | work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/movies/the-double-hour-italian-thriller-review.html|title=Romance or Film Noir? Both, and a Thriller|accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common elements may include [[stock character]]s, such as a [[Hardboiled|hardboiled detective]] and [[serial killer]], involved in a [[cat and mouse]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/07/31/your_psychological_thriller/ | title=Your Psychological Thriller | last=Wright | first=Chris|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=2011-07-31|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sensation novel]]s, examples of early psychological thrillers, were considered to be socially irresponsible due to their themes of sex and violence. These novels, among others, were inspired by the exploits of real-life detective [[Jack Whicher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview29|title=The Prince of Sleuths|last=Summerscale|first=Kate|authorlink=Kate Summerscale|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2008-04-04|accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water, especially floods, is frequently used to represent the unconscious mind, such as in ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' and ''[[In Dreams (film)|In Dreams]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Movies and the Mind|last=Indick|first=William|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] | year=2004 | isbn=9780786480920 | page=70 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kU8B-6Bvb94C&amp;pg=PA70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological thrillers may not always be concerned with plausibility. Peter Hutchings defines the [[giallo]], an Italian subgenre of psychological thrillers, as violent murder mysteries that focus on style and spectacle over rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The A to Z of Horror Cinema|last=Hutchings|first=Peter|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|year=2009|isbn=9780810870505|pages=141–143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_5DPHOVG7YC&amp;pg=PA141}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter B. Flint of ''[[The New York Times]]'', detractors of Alfred Hitchcock accused him of "relying on slick tricks, illogical story lines and wild coincidences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0813.html | title=Alfred Hitchcock Dies; A Master of Suspense|last=Flint|first=Peter B.|work=[[The New York Times]] | date=1980-04-30 | accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Punch.jpg|thumb|1867 edition of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', a ground-breaking [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] magazine of popular humour, including a great deal of satire of the contemporary, social, and political scene.]] {{Literature}}{{Performing arts}}
'''Satire''' is a [[genre]] of [[literature]], and sometimes [[graphic arts|graphic]] and [[performing art]]s, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement.{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}} Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive [[social criticism]], using [[wit]] to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.

A feature of satire is strong [[irony]] or [[sarcasm]]—"in satire, irony is militant"{{Refn | {{Citation | author-link = Northrop Frye | first = Northrop | last = Frye | title = quote}}{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}} (literary critic).}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anatomy of Criticism|last=Frye|first=Northrup|publisher=Princeton UP|year=1957|isbn=0-691-06004-5|location=Princeton|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but [[parody]], [[burlesque (literary)|burlesque]], [[exaggeration]],&lt;ref name="Claridge2010p257"/&gt; juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and [[double entendre]] are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. This "militant" irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist wishes to attack.

Satire is nowadays found in many artistic forms of expression, including [[internet meme]]s, literature, plays, commentary, television shows, and media such as lyrics.

==Etymology and roots ==

The word satire comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''satur'' and the subsequent phrase ''[[wikt:satura#Latin|lanx satura]].'' ''Satur'' meant "full" but the juxtaposition with ''lanx'' shifted the meaning to "miscellany or medley": the expression ''lanx satura'' literally means "a full dish of various kinds of fruits".&lt;ref name="Kharpertian"&gt;{{Citation | first = Theodore D | last = Kharpertian | contribution = Thomas Pynchon and Postmodern American Satire | pages = 25–7 | editor-last = Kharpertian | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=um0h0arlUdoC | title = A hand to turn the time: the Menippean satires of Thomas Pynchon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''satura'' as used by [[Quintilian]], however, was used to denote only Roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed [[hexameter]] form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as ''satire''.&lt;ref name="Kharpertian" /&gt;{{Sfn | Branham | 1997 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=XrNEns3_yd0C&amp;pg=PR24 xxiv]}} Quintilian famously said that ''satura,'' that is a satire in hexameter verses, was a literary genre of wholly Roman origin (''satura tota nostra est''). He was aware of and commented on Greek satire, but at the time did not label it as such, although today the origin of satire is considered to be [[Aristophanes' Old Comedy]]. The first critic to use the term "satire" in the modern broader sense was [[Apuleius]].&lt;ref name="Kharpertian"/&gt;

To Quintilian, the satire was a strict literary form, but the term soon escaped from the original narrow definition. Robert Elliott writes:
{{quote | As soon as a noun enters the domain of metaphor, as one modern scholar has pointed out, it clamours for extension; and satura (which had had no verbal, adverbial, or adjectival forms) was immediately broadened by appropriation from the Greek word for “satyr” (satyros) and its derivatives. The odd result is that the English “satire” comes from the Latin satura; but "satirize", "satiric", etc., are of Greek origin. By about the 4th century AD the writer of satires came to be known as satyricus; St. Jerome, for example, was called by one of his enemies 'a satirist in prose' ('satyricus scriptor in prosa').  Subsequent orthographic modifications obscured the Latin origin of the word satire: satura becomes satyra, and in England, by the 16th century, it was written 'satyre.'{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}}}}

The word ''satire'' derives from ''satura'', and its origin was not influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure of the ''[[satyr]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The [[Renaissance]] confusion of the two origins encouraged a satire more aggressive than that of its Roman forebearers | first = BL | last = Ullman | title = Satura and Satire | journal = Classical Philology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | year = 1913 | jstor = 262450 | doi = 10.1086/359771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, philologist [[Isaac Casaubon]] was the first to dispute the etymology of satire from satyr, contrary to the belief up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Szabari (2009) ''Less Rightly Said: Scandals and Readers in Sixteenth-Century France'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=3-QJLqEwvb0C&amp;pg=PA2 p.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humour==
{{rquote|right|The rules of satire are such that it must do more than make you laugh. No matter how amusing it is, it doesn't count unless you find yourself wincing a little even as you chuckle.&lt;ref name="galaxy196806"&gt;{{Cite magazine

[[Laughter]] is not an essential component of satire;{{Sfn | Corum | 2002 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikGt9gkXv74C&amp;pg=PA175 175]}} in fact there are types of satire that are not meant to be "funny" at all. Conversely, not all humour, even on such topics as politics, religion or art is necessarily "satirical", even when it uses the satirical tools of irony, parody, and [[burlesque]].

Even light-hearted satire has a serious "after-taste": the organizers of the [[Ig Nobel Prize]] describe this as "first make people laugh, and then make them think".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://improbable.com/ig/ | title = Improbable | contribution = Ig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and psychological functions==
Satire and [[irony]] in some cases have been regarded as the most effective source to understand a society, the oldest form of [[social study]].&lt;ref name="Rosenberg1960p155"/&gt; They provide the keenest insights into a group's [[Collective unconscious|collective psyche]], reveal its deepest values and tastes, and the society's structures of power.&lt;ref name="Deloria69p146"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash1970p203"/&gt; Some authors have regarded satire as superior to non-comic and non-artistic disciplines like history or [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Rosenberg1960p155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Babcock1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coppola"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Jo | last = Coppola | title = Comedy on Television | publisher = Commonweal | date = 12 December 1958 | page = 288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a prominent example from [[ancient Greece]], philosopher [[Plato]], when asked by a friend for a book to understand Athenian society, referred him to the plays of [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref name="Willi2003p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrenberg1962p39"/&gt;

Historically, satire has satisfied the popular [[need]] to [[debunk]] and [[Ridiculous|ridicule]] the leading figures in politics, economy, religion and other prominent realms of [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt; Satire confronts [[public discourse]] and the [[collective imaginary]], playing as a public opinion counterweight to power (be it political, economic, religious, symbolic, or otherwise), by challenging leaders and authorities. For instance, it forces administrations to clarify, amend or establish their policies. Satire's job is to expose problems and contradictions, and it's not obligated to solve them.&lt;ref name="WieseForbes2010p.xv"/&gt; [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] set in the history of satire a prominent example of a satirist role as confronting public discourse.&lt;ref name="Knight2004p254"/&gt;

For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions.&lt;ref name="Test1991p9licencequote"/&gt; The satiric impulse, and its ritualized expressions, carry out the function of resolving social tension.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; Institutions like the [[ritual clown]]s, by giving expression to the [[antisocial tendencies]], represent a [[safety valve]] which re-establishes equilibrium and health in the [[collective imaginary]], which are jeopardized by the [[Social repression|repressive aspects of society]].&lt;ref name="Cazeneuve1957p244"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durand1984p106"/&gt;

The state of [[political satire]] in a given society reflects the tolerance or intolerance that characterizes it,&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt; and the state of [[civil liberties]] and [[human rights]]. Under [[totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] any criticism of a political system, and especially satire, is suppressed. A typical example is the [[Soviet Union]] where the [[dissidents]], such as [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]] were under strong pressure from the government. While satire of everyday life in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] was allowed, the most prominent satirist being [[Arkady Raikin]], political satire existed in the form of [[anecdote]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://samlib.ru/j/jacko_w_a/anecdotes.shtml | last = Yatsko | first = V | title = Russian folk funny stories}}&lt;/ref&gt; that made fun of Soviet political leaders, especially [[Brezhnev]], famous for his narrow-mindedness and love for awards and decorations.

==Classifications==
Satire is a diverse genre which is complex to classify and define, with a wide range of satiric "modes".&lt;ref&gt;Corum (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikGt9gkXv74C&amp;pg=PA163 p.163]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Worcester (1968) [https://books.google.com/books?id=foUbAQAAIAAJ ''The Art of Satire''] p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horatian, Juvenalian, Menippean===
[[File:Satire (Orazio) - pag. 12.JPG|thumb|upright|&lt;center&gt;"Le satire e l'epistole di Q. Orazio Flacco", printed in 1814.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Satirical literature can commonly be categorized as either Horatian, Juvenalian, or [[Menippean satire|Menippean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Müller|first=Rolf Arnold|title=Komik und Satire|year=1973|publisher=Juris-Verlag|location=Zürich|isbn=978-3-260-03570-8 | language = German |page= 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Horatian====
Horatian satire, named for the Roman satirist [[Horace]] (65–8 BCE), playfully criticizes some social vice through gentle, mild, and light-hearted humour. Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) wrote Satires to gently ridicule the dominant opinions and "philosophical beliefs of ancient Rome and Greece" (Rankin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-horatian-satire.htm|title=What Is Horatian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than writing in harsh or accusing tones, he addressed issues with humor and clever mockery. Horatian satire follows this same pattern of "gently [ridiculing] the absurdities and follies of human beings" (Drury).&lt;ref name=nku.edu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nku.edu/~rkdrury/422/satire_terms.html|title=Satire Terms|work=nku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;It directs wit, exaggeration, and self-deprecating humour toward what it identifies as folly, rather than evil. Horatian satire's sympathetic tone is common in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|  authorlink = Raja Sharma | first = Raja | last = Sharma | title = [["Comedy" in New Light-Literary Studies]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A Horatian satirist's goal is to heal the situation with smiles, rather than by anger. Horatian satire is a gentle reminder to take life less seriously and evokes a wry smile.&lt;ref name=nku.edu/&gt; A Horatian satirist makes fun of general human folly rather than engaging in specific or personal attacks. Shamekia Thomas suggests, "In a work using Horatian satire, readers often laugh at the characters in the story who are the subject of mockery as well as themselves and society for behaving in those ways." [[Alexander Pope]] has been established as an author whose satire "heals with morals what it hurts with wit" (Green).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/honors/Programs-Minors/honors-and-the-schools/houston-teachers-institute/curriculum-units/pdfs/2008/comedy/green-08-comedy.pdf|title=The Golden Age of Satire: Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift|author=Patricia, Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Pope—and Horatian satire—attempt to teach.

====Juvenalian====
{{See also|Satires of Juvenal}}
Juvenalian satire, named for the writings of the Roman satirist [[Juvenal]] (late first century – early second century AD), is more contemptuous and abrasive than the Horatian. Juvenal disagreed with the opinions of the public figures and institutions of the Republic and actively attacked them through his literature. "He utilized the satirical tools of exaggeration and parody to make his targets appear monstrous and incompetent" (Podzemny).&lt;ref name="wisegeek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-juvenalian-satire.htm|title=What Is Juvenalian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenal satire follows this same pattern of abrasively ridiculing societal structures. Juvenal also, unlike Horace, attacked public officials and governmental organizations through his satires, regarding their opinions as not just wrong, but evil.

Following in this tradition, Juvenalian satire addresses perceived social evil through scorn, outrage, and savage ridicule. This form is often pessimistic, characterized by the use of irony, sarcasm, moral indignation and personal invective, with less emphasis on humor. Strongly polarized political satire can often be classified as Juvenalian.&lt;br /&gt;A Juvenal satirist's goal is generally to provoke some sort of political or societal change because he sees his opponent or object as evil or harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.literarydevices.com/satire/|title=Satire Examples and Definition|work=Literary Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Juvenal satirist mocks "societal structure, power, and civilization" (Thomas)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/satire-in-literature-definition-types-examples.html|title=Satire in Literature: Definition, Types &amp; Examples|work=Education Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; by exaggerating the words or position of his opponent in order to jeopardize their opponent's reputation and/or power. [[Jonathan Swift]] has been established as an author who "borrowed heavily from Juvenal's techniques in [his critique] of contemporary English society" (Podzemny).&lt;ref name="wisegeek.com" /&gt;

===Satire versus teasing===
In the [[history of theatre]] there has always been a conflict between engagement and disengagement on [[politics]] and relevant issue, between satire and [[grotesque]] on one side, and [[jest]] with [[teasing]] on the other.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p9"/&gt; [[Max Eastman]] defined the [[spectrum]] of satire in terms of "degrees of biting", as ranging from satire proper at the hot-end, and "kidding" at the violet-end; Eastman adopted the term kidding to denote what is just satirical in form, but is not really firing at the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Max Eastman | first = Max | last = Eastman | year = 1936 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Tyd5wwn8acwC&amp;pg=PA236 | title = Enjoyment of Laughter | chapter = IV. Degrees of Biting | pages = 236–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] satirical playwright [[Dario Fo]] pointed out the difference between satire and teasing (''sfottò'').&lt;ref name="Lorch1997p128"&gt;{{Citation | author1-link = Dario Fo | first1 = Dario | last1 = Fo | first2 = Jennifer | last2 = Lorch | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u12fXi_HDO4C&amp;pg=PA128 | title = Dario Fo | page = 128 | quote = In other writings Fo makes an important distinction between ''sfottò'' and satire.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teasing is the [[reactionary]] side of the [[comic]]; it limits itself to a shallow [[parody]] of physical appearance. The side-effect of teasing is that it humanizes and draws sympathy for the powerful individual towards which it is directed. Satire instead uses the comic to go against power and its oppressions, has a [[subversive]] character, and a [[moral]] dimension which draws judgement against its targets.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fo1990pn" /&gt;{{Refn | name = "Arroyop303" | {{Citation | first1 = José Luís Blas | last1 = Arroyo | first2 = Mónica Velando | last2 = Casanova | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CxZ_zH44PVkC&amp;pg=PA303 | title = Discurso y sociedad: contribuciones al estudio de la lengua en... | volume = 1 | pages = 303–4}} }}&lt;ref name = "Morson1988p114"&gt;{{Citation | last = Morson | first = Gary Saul | year = 1988 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PpLiINhO83MC&amp;pg=PA114 | title = Boundaries of Genre | page = 114 | quote = second, that parodies can be, as Bakhtin observes, "shallow" as well as "deep" (''Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics'', 160), which is to say, directed at superficial as well as fundamental faults of the original. [...] the distinction between shallow and deep [...] [is] helpful in understanding the complex ways in which parodies are used. For instance, shallow parody is sometimes used to pay an author an indirect compliment. The opposite of damning with faint praise, this parody with faint criticism may be designed to show that no more fundamental criticism ''could'' be made.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fo formulated an [[Operational definition|operational]] criterion to tell real satire from ''sfottò'', saying that real satire arouses an outraged and violent reaction, and that the more they try to stop you, the better is the job you are doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Daniele Luttazzi | first = Daniele | last = Luttazzi | year = 2005 | url = http://news.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node/147 | archivedate = December 25, 2005 | place = [[Italy|IT]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051225171452/http://news.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node%2F147 | title = Matrix | quote = Dario Fo disse a Satyricon: —La satira vera si vede dalla reazione che suscita. | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fo contends that, historically, people in positions of power have welcomed and encouraged good-humoured buffoonery, while modern day people in positions of power have tried to censor, ostracize and repress satire.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2"/&gt;

Teasing (''sfottò'') is an ancient form of simple [[buffoonery]], a form of comedy without satire's subversive edge. Teasing includes light and affectionate parody, good-humoured mockery, simple one-dimensional poking fun, and benign spoofs. Teasing typically consists of an [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impersonation]] of someone monkeying around with his exterior attributes, [[tic]]s, physical blemishes, voice and mannerisms, quirks, way of dressing and walking, and/or the phrases he typically repeats. By contrast, teasing never touches on the core issue, never makes a serious criticism judging the target with [[irony]]; it never harms the target's conduct, [[ideology]] and position of power; it never undermines the perception of his morality and cultural dimension.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2"/&gt;{{Refn | name="Arroyop303"}} ''Sfottò'' directed towards a powerful individual makes him appear more human and draws sympathy towards him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Daniele Luttazzi | first = Daniele | last = Luttazzi | language = Italian | url = http://www.nazioneindiana.com/2003/10/28/state-a-casa-a-fare-i-compiti-2/ | title = State a casa a fare i compiti | format = interview | editor1-first = Federica | editor1-last = Fracassi | editor2-first = Jacopo | editor2-last = Guerriero | journal = Nazione Indiana |date=October 2003 | quote = Lo sfottò è reazionario.

===Classifications by topics===
Types of satire can also be classified according to the topics it deals with. From the earliest times, at least since the plays of [[Aristophanes]], the primary topics of literary satire have been [[politics]], [[religion]] and [[sex]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark73p20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark80p45"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferdie Addis (2012) ''Qual è il tuo "tallone da killer"?'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=kKysGIQV4SgC&amp;pg=PT20 p.20]&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly because these are the most pressing problems that affect anybody living in a society, and partly because these topics are usually [[taboo]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p33"/&gt; Among these, politics in the broader sense is considered the pre-eminent topic of satire.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p33"/&gt; Satire which targets the [[clergy]] is a type of [[political satire]], while [[religious satire]] is that which targets [[religious belief]]s.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p39"/&gt; Satire on sex may overlap with [[blue comedy]], [[off-color humor]] and [[dick joke]]s.

[[Scatology]] has a long literary association with satire,&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anspaugh94"/&gt; as it is a classical mode of the [[grotesque]], the [[grotesque body]] and the satiric grotesque.&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andries2000p10"/&gt; [[Shit]] plays a fundamental role in satire because it symbolizes [[death]], the turd being "the ultimate dead object".&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anspaugh94"/&gt; The satirical comparison of individuals or institutions with human [[excrement]], exposes their "inherent inertness, corruption and dead-likeness".&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein1993p20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duprat1982p178"/&gt; The [[ritual clown]]s of [[clown societies]], like among the [[Pueblo Indians]], have ceremonies with [[Coprophagia|filth-eating]].&lt;ref name="Parsons34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyers96"/&gt; In other cultures, [[sin-eating]] is an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] rite in which the sin-eater (also called filth-eater),&lt;ref&gt;Donald Alexander Mackenzie (1923) ''Myths of Pre-Columbian America'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=6chKHROa1icC&amp;pg=PA229 p.229]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Marnham (2000) ''Dreaming with His Eyes Open: A Life of Diego Rivera'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=pcddElQo9JkC&amp;pg=PA297 p.297]&lt;/ref&gt; by ingesting the food provided, takes "upon himself the sins of the departed".&lt;ref name="Davidson 1993p85"/&gt; Satire about death overlaps with [[black humor]] and [[gallows humor]].

Another classification by topics is the distinction between political satire, religious satire and satire of manners.&lt;ref name="Bloom1979"/&gt; Political satire is sometimes called topical satire, satire of manners is sometimes called satire of everyday life, and religious satire is sometimes called philosophical satire. [[Comedy of manners]], sometimes also called satire of manners, criticizes mode of life of common people; political satire aims at behavior, manners of politicians, and vices of political systems. Historically, comedy of manners, which first appeared in British theater in 1620, has uncritically accepted the social code of the upper classes.&lt;ref name="Nicoll1951p179"/&gt; Comedy in general accepts the rules of the social game, while satire subverts them.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p189"/&gt;

Another analysis of satire is the spectrum of his possible [[Tone (literature)|tone]]s: [[wit]], [[ridicule]], [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynicism]], the [[sardonic]] and [[invective]].&lt;ref name="Pollard1970p66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1946p32"/&gt;

===Classifications by medium===
Satire is found not only in written literary forms. In [[preliterate culture]]s it manifests itself in [[ritual clown|ritual]] and folk forms, as well as in [[trickster]] tales and [[oral poetry]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt;

It appears also in graphic arts, music, sculpture, dance, [[cartoon strip]]s, and [[graffiti]]. Examples are [[Dada]] sculptures, [[Pop Art]] works, music of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and [[Erik Satie]], [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[rock music]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; In modern [[media culture]], [[stand-up comedy]] is an enclave in which satire can be introduced into [[mass media]], challenging [[mainstream]] discourse.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; [[Roast (comedy)|Comedy roast]]s, mock festivals, and stand-up comedians in nightclubs and concerts are the modern forms of ancient satiric rituals.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt;

One of the earliest examples of what we might call satire, [[The Satire of the Trades]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = M | last = Lichtheim | title = Ancient Egyptian Literature | volume = I | year = 1973 | pages = 184–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in Egyptian writing from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. The text's apparent readers are students, tired of studying. It argues that their lot as scribes is not only useful, but far superior to that of the ordinary man. Scholars such as Helck&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = W | last = Helck | title = Die Lehre des DwA-xtjj | publisher = Wiesbaden | year = 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; think that the context was meant to be serious.

The [[Papyrus Anastasi I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Alan H | last = Gardiner | title = Egyptian Hieratic Texts | series= I: Literary Texts of the New Kingdom | volume = I | place = Leipzig | year = 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; (late 2nd millennium BC) contains a satirical letter which first praises the virtues of its recipient, but then mocks the reader's meagre knowledge and achievements.

===Ancient Greece===
The Greeks had no word for what later would be called "satire", although the terms cynicism and parody were used. Modern critics call the [[Greek comedy|Greek playwright]] [[Aristophanes]] one of the best known early satirists: his plays are known for their critical political and [[societal commentary]],&lt;ref name="Sutton, D. F. 1993 p.56"&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutton | first = DF | title = Ancient Comedy: The War of the Generations | place = New York | year = 1993 | page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly for the [[political satire]] by which he criticized the powerful [[Cleon]] (as in ''[[The Knights]]''). He is also notable for the persecution he underwent.&lt;ref name="Sutton, D. F. 1993 p.56" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/aristophanes003.html | chapter = Political and social satires of Aristophanes | editor-first = Alfred | editor-last = Bates | title = The Drama, Its History, Literature and Influence on Civilization | volume = 2 | place = London | publisher = Historical Publishing | year = 1906 | pages = 55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JE | last = Atkinson | jstor = 639144 | title = Curbing the Comedians: Cleon versus Aristophanes and Syracosius' Decree | journal = The Classical Quarterly | series = New | volume = 42 | number = 1 | year = 1992 | pages = 56–64 | doi=10.1017/s0009838800042580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0714-06.htm | title = Aristophanes: the Michael Moore of his Day | first = John Louis | last = Anderson | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061019054115/http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0714-06.htm | archivedate = October 19, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes' plays turned upon images of filth and disease.{{Sfn | Wilson | 2002 | p = 17}} His bawdy style was adopted by Greek dramatist-comedian [[Menander]]. His early play ''Drunkenness'' contains an attack on the politician [[Callimedon]].

The oldest form of satire still in use is the [[Menippean satire]] by [[Menippus|Menippus of Gadara]]. His own writings are lost. Examples from his admirers and imitators mix seriousness and mockery in dialogues and present parodies before a background of [[wikt:diatribe|diatribe]]. As in the case of Aristophanes plays, menippean satire turned upon images of filth and disease.{{Sfn | Wilson | 2002 | p = 17}}

===Roman world===
The first Roman to discuss satire critically was [[Quintilian]], who invented the term to describe the writings of [[Gaius Lucilius]]. The two most prominent and influential ancient Roman satirists are [[Horace]] and [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]], who wrote during the early days of the [[Roman Empire]]. Other important satirists in ancient [[Latin]] are Gaius Lucilius and [[Persius]]. ''Satire'' in their work is much wider than in the modern sense of the word, including fantastic and highly coloured humorous writing with little or no real mocking intent. When Horace criticized [[Augustus]], he used [[veil]]ed ironic terms. In contrast, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] reports that the 6th-century-BC poet [[Hipponax]] wrote ''satirae'' that were so cruel that the offended hanged themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cuddon | title = Dictionary of Literary Terms | place = Oxford | year = 1998 | contribution = Satire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century AD, [[Lucian]] wrote ''[[True History]]'', a book satirizing the clearly unrealistic travelogues/adventures written by [[Ctesias]], [[Iambulus]], and [[Homer]]. He states that he was surprised they expected people to believe their lies, and stating that he, like they, has no actual knowledge or experience, but shall now tell lies as if he did. He goes on to describe a far more obviously extreme and unrealistic tale, involving interplanetary exploration, war among alien life forms, and life inside a 200 mile long whale back in the terrestrial ocean, all intended to make obvious the fallacies of books like ''[[Indica (Ctesias)|Indica]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]''.

===Medieval Islamic world===
{{main|Arabic literature#Satire and comedy|Persian satire|l1=Arabic satire}}
Medieval [[Arabic poetry]] included the satiric genre ''hija''. Satire was introduced into [[Arabic literature|Arabic prose literature]] by the [[Afro-Arab]] author [[Al-Jahiz]] in the 9th century. While dealing with serious topics in what are now known as [[anthropology]], [[Sociology in medieval Islam|sociology]] and [[Psychology in medieval Islam|psychology]], he introduced a satirical approach, "based on the premise that, however serious the subject under review, it could be made more interesting and thus achieve greater effect, if only one leavened the lump of solemnity by the insertion of a few amusing anecdotes or by the throwing out of some witty or paradoxical observations. He was well aware that, in treating of new themes in his prose works, he would have to employ a vocabulary of a nature more familiar in ''hija'', satirical poetry."{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| p = 32}} For example, in one of his [[Zoology|zoological]] works, he satirized the preference for longer [[human penis size]], writing: "If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the [[mule]] would belong to the (honorable tribe of) [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]". Another satirical story based on this preference was an ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale called "Ali with the Large Member".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia | first1 = Ulrich | last1 = Marzolph | first2 = Richard | last2 = van Leeuwen| first3 = Hassan | last3 = Wassouf | publisher = ABC-CLIO| year = 2004 | isbn= 1-57607-204-5|pages=97–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, the writer [[Tha'alibi]] recorded satirical poetry written by the Arabic poets As-Salami and Abu Dulaf, with As-Salami praising Abu Dulaf's [[Polymath|wide breadth of knowledge]] and then mocking his ability in all these subjects, and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing As-Salami in return.{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| pp = 77–8}} An example of Arabic political satire included another 10th-century poet Jarir satirizing Farazdaq as "a transgressor of the [[Sharia]]" and later Arabic poets in turn using the term "Farazdaq-like" as a form of political satire.{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| p = 70}}

The terms "[[comedy]]" and "satire" became synonymous after [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] and writers, such as Abu Bischr, his pupil [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''hija'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the "art of reprehension", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troubled beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term "comedy" thus gained a new semantic meaning in [[Medieval literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain |first=Edwin J |last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|pages=1–11|doi=10.2307/470561| jstor=470561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ubayd Zakani]] introduced satire in [[Persian literature]] during the 14th century. His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses, often political or bawdy, and often cited in debates involving [[homosexual]] practices. He wrote the ''Resaleh-ye Delgosha'', as well as ''Akhlaq al-Ashraf'' ("Ethics of the Aristocracy") and the famous humorous fable ''Masnavi Mush-O-Gorbeh'' (Mouse and Cat), which was a political satire. His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written, in league with the other great works of [[Persian literature]]. Between 1905 and 1911, [[Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi]] and other Iranian writers wrote notable satires.

===Medieval Europe===
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], examples of satire were the songs by [[Goliard]]s or [[Clerici vagantes|vagant]]s now best known as an anthology called [[Carmina Burana]] and made famous as texts of a composition by the 20th-century composer [[Carl Orff]]. Satirical poetry is believed to have been popular, although little has survived. With the advent of the [[High Middle Ages]] and the birth of modern [[vernacular literature]] in the 12th century, it began to be used again, most notably by [[Chaucer]]. The disrespectful manner was considered "unchristian" and ignored, except for the '''moral satire''', which mocked misbehaviour in Christian terms. Examples are ''[[Livre des Manières]]'' by {{ill|Étienne de Fougères|fr}} (~1178), and some of Chaucer's ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. Sometimes [[Epic poetry|epic poetry (epos)]] was mocked, and even feudal society, but there was hardly a general interest in the genre.

===Early modern western satire===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Parable of the Blind Leading the Blind - WGA3511.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s 1568 satirical painting ''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]''.]]
Direct [[social commentary]] via satire returned with a vengeance in the 16th century, when farcical texts such as the works of [[François Rabelais]] tackled more serious issues (and incurred the wrath of the crown as a result).

Two major satirists of [[Europe]] in the [[Renaissance]] were [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] and [[François Rabelais]]. Other examples of Renaissance satire include ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'', ''[[Reynard the Fox]]'', [[Sebastian Brant]]'s ''[[Ship of Fools|Narrenschiff]]'' (1494), [[Erasmus]]'s ''[[Moriae Encomium]]'' (1509), [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516), and ''[[Carajicomedia]]'' (1519).'''

The [[Elizabethan]] (i.e. 16th-century English) writers thought of satire as related to the notoriously rude, coarse and sharp satyr play. Elizabethan "satire" (typically in pamphlet form) therefore contains more straightforward abuse than subtle irony. The French [[Huguenot]] [[Isaac Casaubon]] pointed out in 1605 that satire in the Roman fashion was something altogether more civilised. Casaubon discovered and published Quintilian's writing and presented the original meaning of the term (satira, not satyr), and the sense of wittiness (reflecting the "dishfull of fruits") became more important again. Seventeenth-century English satire once again aimed at the "amendment of vices" ([[Dryden]]).

In the 1590s a new wave of verse satire broke with the publication of [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Hall]]'s ''Virgidemiarum'', six books of verse satires targeting everything from literary fads to corrupt noblemen. Although [[John Donne|Donne]] had already circulated satires in manuscript, Hall's was the first real attempt in English at verse satire on the Juvenalian model.{{Sfn | Hall | 1969 | ps =: ‘Hall's ''Virgidemiae'' was a new departure in that the true Juvenalian mode of satire was being attempted for the first time, and successfully, in English.’}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=October 2012}} The success of his work combined with a national mood of disillusion in the last years of Elizabeth's reign triggered an avalanche of satire—much of it less conscious of classical models than Hall's — until the fashion was brought to an abrupt stop by censorship.{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, the censors of the press, issued Orders to the Stationers' Company on June 1 and 4, 1599, prohibiting the further printing of satires—the so-called 'Bishop's Ban'.{{Sfn | Davenport | 1969}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=October 2012}}}}

===Age of Enlightenment===
[[File:A Welch wedding. Satire c.1780.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|'A Welch wedding' Satirical Cartoon c.1780]]
The [[Age of Enlightenment]], an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th centuries advocating rationality, produced a great revival of satire in Britain. This was fuelled by the rise of partisan politics, with the formalisation of the [[Tory]] and [[British Whig Party|Whig]] parties—and also, in 1714, by the formation of the [[Scriblerus Club]], which included [[Alexander Pope]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[John Gay]], [[John Arbuthnot]], [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], [[Thomas Parnell]], and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]]. This club included several of the notable satirists of early-18th-century Britain. They focused their attention on Martinus Scriblerus, "an invented learned fool... whose work they attributed all that was tedious, narrow-minded, and pedantic in contemporary scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century | volume = 3 | page = 435}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their hands astute and biting satire of institutions and individuals became a popular weapon. The turn to the 18th century was characterized by a switch from Horatian, soft, pseudo-satire, to biting "juvenal" satire.&lt;ref name="Weinbrot2007p136"&gt;Weinbrot, Howard D. (2007) ''Eighteenth-Century Satire: Essays on Text and Context from Dryden to Peter...'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHADZOHbJ2QC&amp;pg=PA136 p.136]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Swift]] was one of the greatest of Anglo-Irish satirists, and one of the first to practise modern journalistic satire. For instance, In his ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' Swift suggests that Irish peasants be encouraged to sell their own children as food for the rich, as a solution to the "problem" of poverty. His purpose is of course to attack indifference to the plight of the desperately poor. In his book ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' he writes about the flaws in human society in general and English society in particular. [[John Dryden]] wrote an influential essay entitled "A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/drydendiscourse2.html | editor-first = Jack | editor-last = Lynch | publisher = Rutgers | last = Dryden | first = John | title = Discourse | number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that helped fix the definition of satire in the literary world. His satirical ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'' was written in response to a rivalry with [[Thomas Shadwell]] and eventually inspired [[Alexander Pope]] to write his satirical ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''. Other satirical works by Pope include the ''[[Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot]]''.

[[Alexander Pope]] (b. May 21, 1688) was a satirist known for his Horatian satirist style and translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''. Famous throughout and after the [[Long eighteenth century|long 18th century]], Pope died in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/alexander-pope-9444371#synopsis|title=Biography of Alexander Pope § Synopsis|work=Biography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope, in his ''The Rape of the Lock'', is delicately chiding society in a sly but polished voice by holding up a mirror to the follies and vanities of the upper class. Pope does not actively attack the self-important pomp of the British aristocracy, but rather presents it in such a way that gives the reader a new perspective from which to easily view the actions in the story as foolish and ridiculous. A mockery of the upper class, more delicate and lyrical than brutal, Pope nonetheless is able to effectively illuminate the moral degradation of society to the public. ''The Rape of the Lock'' assimilates the masterful qualities of a heroic epic, such as the ''Iliad'', which Pope was translating at the time of writing ''The Rape of the Lock''. However, Pope applied these qualities satirically to a seemingly petty egotistical elitist quarrel to prove his point wryly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/545/satire-in-18th-century-british-society-alexander-popes-the-rape-of-the-lock-and-jonathan-swifts-a-modest-proposal|title=Satire in 18th Century British Society: Alexander Pope's ''The Rape of the Lock'' and Jonathan Swift's ''A Modest Proposal''|year=2011|journal=Student Pulse|volume=3|issue=06|author=Jonathan J. Szwec}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Defoe]] pursued a more journalistic type of satire, being famous for his ''[[The True-Born Englishman]]'' which mocks [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] patriotism, and ''[[The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters]]''—advocating [[religious toleration]] by means of an ironical exaggeration of the highly intolerant attitudes of his time.

The pictorial satire of [[William Hogarth]] is a precursor to the development of [[political cartoons]] in 18th-century England.&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwzWAAAAMAAJ|title=The Political Cartoon|author=Charles Press|year=1981|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medium developed under the direction of its greatest exponent, [[James Gillray]] from London.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; With his satirical works calling the king (George III), prime ministers and generals (especially Napoleon) to account, Gillray's wit and keen sense of the ridiculous made him the pre-eminent [[cartoonist]] of the era.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Satire, sewers and statesmen: why James Gillray was king of the cartoon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/21/satire-sewers-and-statesmen-james-gillray-king-of-cartoon|agency=The Guardian|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ebenezer Cooke (poet)|Ebenezer Cooke]] (1665–1732), author of "The Sot-Weed Factor" (1708), was among the first American colonialists to write literary satire. [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–1790) and others followed, using satire to shape an emerging nation's culture through its sense of the ridiculous.

===Satire in Victorian England===
[[File:DV257 no.19 The donkey race.png|thumb|A Victorian satirical sketch depicting a gentleman's donkey race in 1852]]
Several satiric papers competed for the public's attention in the [[Victorian era]] (1837–1901) and [[Edwardian]] period, such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' (1841) and ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' (1861).

Perhaps the most enduring examples of Victorian satire, however, are to be found in the [[Savoy Opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. In fact, in ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', a jester is given lines that paint a very neat picture of the method and purpose of the satirist, and might almost be taken as a statement of Gilbert's own intent:
:''"I can set a braggart quailing with a quip,
:''The upstart I can wither with a whim;
:''He may wear a merry laugh upon his lip,
:''But his laughter has an echo that is grim!"

Novelists such as [[Charles Dickens]] (1812-1870) often used passages of satiric writing in their treatment of social issues.

Continuing the tradition of Swiftian journalistic satire, [[Sidney Godolphin Osborne]] (1808-1889) was the most prominent writer of scathing "Letters to the Editor" of the [[London Times]]. Famous in his day, he is now all but forgotten. His maternal grandfather [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland]] was considered to be a possible candidate for the authorship of the [[Junius]] letters. If this were true, we can read Osborne as following in his grandfather's satiric "Letters to the Editor" path. Osborne's satire was so bitter and biting that at one point he received a public censure from [[Parliament]]'s then Home Secretary Sir [[James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose|James Graham]]. Osborne wrote mostly in the Juvenalian mode over a wide range of topics mostly centered on British government's and landlords' mistreatment of poor farm workers and field laborers. He bitterly opposed the [[New Poor Laws]] and was passionate on the subject of Great Britain's botched response to the [[Irish Famine]] and its mistreatment of soldiers during the [[Crimean War]].

Later in the nineteenth century, in the United States, [[Mark Twain]] (1835–1910) grew to become American's greatest satirist: his novel ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884) is set in the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] South, where the moral values Twain wishes to promote are completely turned on their heads. His hero, Huck, is a rather simple but goodhearted lad who is ashamed of the "sinful temptation" that leads him to help a runaway [[Slavery|slave]]. In fact his conscience, warped by the distorted moral world he has grown up in, often bothers him most when he is at his best. He is prepared to do good, believing it to be wrong.

Twain's younger contemporary [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1842–1913) gained notoriety as a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], pessimist and black humorist with his dark, bitterly ironic stories, many set during the [[American Civil War]], which satirized the limitations of human perception and reason. Bierce's most famous work of satire is probably ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'' (1906), in which the definitions mock cant, [[hypocrisy]] and [[Appeal to tradition|received wisdom]].

===20th-century satire===
[[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] is considered the first major European satirist since [[Jonathan Swift]].&lt;ref name="Knight2004p254"&gt;Knight, Charles A. (2004) ''Literature of Satire'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=SOfVePSFctgC&amp;pg=PA254 p.254]&lt;/ref&gt; In 20th-century literature, satire was used by English authors such as [[Aldous Huxley]] (1930s) and [[George Orwell]] (1940s), which under the inspiration of [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Zamyatin]]'s Russian 1921 novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', made serious and even frightening commentaries on the dangers of the sweeping social changes taking place throughout Europe. Many social critics of this same time in the United States, such as [[Dorothy Parker]] and [[H. L. Mencken]], used satire as their main weapon, and Mencken in particular is noted for having said that "one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand [[syllogism]]s" in the persuasion of the public to accept a criticism. Novelist [[Sinclair Lewis]] was known for his satirical stories such as ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' (1920), ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'' (1922), ''[[Elmer Gantry]]'' (1927; dedicated by Lewis to H. L. Menchen), and ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' (1935), and his books often explored and satirized contemporary American values. The film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940) by [[Charlie Chaplin]] is itself a parody of [[Adolf Hitler]]; Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="ChaplinLager"&gt;Chaplin (1964) ''My Autobiography'', p.392, quotation: {{quotation|Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator'', I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dictator charlie6.jpg|thumb|Benzino Napaloni and [[Adenoid Hynkel]] in ''The Great Dictator'' (1940). Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="ChaplinLager"/&gt;]]
In the United States 1950s, satire was introduced into American [[stand-up comedy]] most prominently by [[Lenny Bruce]] and [[Mort Sahl]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; As they challenged the [[taboo]]s and [[conventional wisdom]] of the time, were ostracized by the mass media establishment as ''[[sick comedian]]s''. In the same period, [[Paul Krassner]]'s magazine ''[[The Realist]]'' began publication, to become immensely popular during the 1960s and early 1970s among people in the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]; it had articles and cartoons that were savage, biting satires of politicians such as [[Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Cold War]] and the [[War on Drugs]]. This baton was also carried by the original [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] magazine, edited by [[Doug Kenney]] and [[Henry Beard]] and featuring blistering satire written by [[Michael O'Donoghue]], [[P.J. O'Rourke]], and [[Tony Hendra]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/01/funny-pages-how-the-national-lampoon-made-american-humor.html&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent satiric stand-up comedian [[George Carlin]] acknowledged the influence ''The Realist'' had in his 1970s conversion to a satiric comedian.&lt;ref name="Sullivan2010p94"&gt;Sullivan, James (2010) ''Seven Dirty Words: The Life and Crimes of George Carlin'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=y3dzVQ5wX9UC&amp;pg=PA94 p.94]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Carlin]] (2002) ''[http://paulkrassner.com/carlinintro.htm Introduction]'' to ''Murder At the Conspiracy Convention''&lt;/ref&gt;

A more humorous brand of satire enjoyed a renaissance in the UK in the early 1960s with the [[satire boom]], led by such luminaries as [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], and [[Dudley Moore]], whose stage show ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' was a hit not only in Britain, but also in the United States. Other significant influences in 1960s British satire include [[David Frost]], [[Eleanor Bron]] and the [[television program]] ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jun/14/david-frost-satire-documentary "David Frost's Q&amp;A on how to be a satirist"]. ''The Guardian'' (London). Retrieved February 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Heller]]'s most famous work, ''[[Catch-22]]'' (1961), satirizes bureaucracy and the military, and is frequently cited as one of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1868619.stm |title=What is Catch-22?

===Contemporary satire===
Contemporary popular usage of the term "satire" is often very imprecise. While satire often uses [[caricature]] and [[parody]], by no means all uses of these or other humorous devices are satiric. Refer to the careful definition of satire that heads this article.

Satire is used on many UK television programmes, particularly popular panel shows and quiz shows such as ''[[Mock the Week]]'' (2005) and ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' (1990–ongoing). It is found on radio quiz shows such as ''[[The News Quiz]]'' (1977–ongoing) and ''[[The Now Show]]'' (1998–ongoing). One of the most watched UK television shows of the 1980s and early 1990s, the puppet show ''[[Spitting Image]]'' was a satire of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]], politics, entertainment, sport and [[British culture]] of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Van Norris (2014). British Television Animation 1997–2010: Drawing Comic Tradition". p. 153. Palgrave Macmillan,&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spitting Image#Evolution|Court Flunkey]] from ''Spitting Image'' is a caricature of [[James Gillray]], intended as a homage to the father of political cartooning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/gillray_james.htm|title=James Gillray|author=|date=|website=lambiek.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125110250/https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/gillray_james.htm|archivedate=25 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by [[DMA Design]] in 1997, satire features prominently in the British video game series ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GTA 5: a Great British export|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/10316267/GTA-5-a-Great-British-export.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The television program ''[[South Park]]'' (1997–ongoing) relies almost exclusively on satire to address issues in American culture, with episodes addressing [[The Passion of the Jew|anti-Semitism]], [[Go God Go|militant atheism]], [[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride|homophobia]], [[Rainforest Shmainforest|environmentalism]], [[Gnomes (South Park)|corporate culture]], [[The Death Camp of Tolerance|political correctness]] and [[Red Hot Catholic Love|anti-Catholicism]], among many other issues.

Australian [[Chris Lilley (comedian)|Chris Lilley]] produces comedy art in the style of mockumentaries (''[[We Can Be Heroes: Finding The Australian of the Year|We Can Be Heroes]]'', ''[[Summer Heights High]]'', ''[[Angry Boys]]'') and his work is often described as complex social satire.

[[File:Stephen Colbert by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Stephen Colbert]] satirically impersonated an opinionated and self-righteous television commentator on his [[Comedy Central]] program in the U.S.]]
[[Stephen Colbert]]'s television program, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' (2005–14), is instructive in the methods of contemporary American satire. [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Colbert's character]] is an opinionated and self-righteous commentator who, in his TV interviews, interrupts people, points and wags his finger at them, and "unwittingly" uses a number of logical fallacies. In doing so, he demonstrates the principle of modern American political satire: the ridicule of the actions of politicians and other public figures by taking all their statements and purported beliefs to their furthest (supposedly) logical conclusion, thus revealing their perceived hypocrisy or absurdity.

The American sketch comedy television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' is also known for its satirical impressions and parodies of prominent persons and politicians, among some of the most notable, their parodies of U.S. political figures [[Saturday Night Live parodies of Hillary Clinton|Hillary Clinton]]&lt;ref name=TVGuide1&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/news/snl-hillary-clinton-saturday-night-live-kate-mckinnon-amy-poehler/ Liz Raftery – "Who Did the Best Hillary Clinton Impression on SNL?", ''TV Guide'', April 30, 2015. (Video)] Retrieved 2015-08-15&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Saturday Night Live parodies of Sarah Palin|Sarah Palin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2009/09/you-betcha-tina-fey-wins-emmy-as-sarah-palin-on-snl-entertainment-news-2468097.html|title=You betcha—Tina Fey wins Emmy as Sarah Palin on 'SNL'|date=2009-09-13|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other political satire includes various political causes in the past, including the relatively successful [[Polish Beer-Lovers' Party]] and the joke political candidates Molly the Dog&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.mollythedog2008.com/ | title = Molly the Dog | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122053639/http://mollythedog2008.com/ | archivedate = January 22, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brian Miner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.brianminer2008.com/ | title = Brian Miner | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, a popular modern satirist is Sir [[Terry Pratchett]], author of the internationally best-selling ''[[Discworld]]'' book series. One of the most well-known and controversial British satirists is [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], co-writer and director of ''[[Four Lions]]''.

In Canada, satire has become an important part of the comedy scene. [[Stephen Leacock]] was one of the best known early Canadian satirists, and in the early 20th century, he achieved fame by targeting the attitudes of small town life. In more recent years, Canada has had several prominent satirical television series and radio shows. Some, including ''[[CODCO]]'', ''[[The Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', ''[[This Is That]]'', and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' deal directly with current news stories and political figures, while others, like ''[[History Bites]]'' present contemporary social satire in the context of events and figures in history. The Canadian organization ''[[Canada News Network]]'' provides commentary on contemporary news events that are primarily Canadian in nature. Canadian songwriter [[Nancy White (singer-songwriter)|Nancy White]] uses music as the vehicle for her satire, and her comic folk songs are regularly played on [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]].

Cartoonists often use satire as well as straight humour. [[Al Capp]]'s satirical [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' was censored in September 1947. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centred on Capp's portrayal of the US Senate. Said Edward Leech of Scripps-Howard, "We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html |title=Tain't Funny – ''Time'' |publisher=Time.com |date=September 29, 1947 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' was likewise censored in 1952 over his overt satire of [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator Joe McCarthy]], caricatured in his comic strip as "Simple J. Malarky". [[Garry Trudeau]], whose [[comic strip]] ''[[Doonesbury]]'' focuses on satire of the political system, and provides a trademark cynical view on national events. Trudeau exemplifies humour mixed with criticism. For example, the character [[Mark Slackmeyer]] lamented that because he was not legally married to his partner, he was deprived of the "exquisite agony" of experiencing a nasty and painful divorce like heterosexuals. This, of course, satirized the claim that gay unions would denigrate the sanctity of heterosexual marriage.

Like some literary predecessors, many recent television satires contain strong elements of parody and [[caricature]]; for instance, the popular animated series ''The Simpsons'' and ''South Park'' both parody modern family and social life by taking their assumptions to the extreme; both have led to the creation of similar series. As well as the purely humorous effect of this sort of thing, they often strongly criticise various phenomena in politics, economic life, religion and many other aspects of society, and thus qualify as satirical. Due to their animated nature, these shows can easily use images of public figures and generally have greater freedom to do so than conventional shows using live actors.

[[News satire]] is also a very popular form of contemporary satire, appearing in as wide an array of formats as the news media itself: print (e.g. ''[[The Onion]]'', ''[[Canada News Network]]'', ''[[Private Eye]]''), "Not Your Homepage,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notyourhomepage.com/|title=Not Your Homepage – Check Your Morals At The Door, Come See the Internet Lore!|work=notyourhomepage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; radio (e.g. ''[[On the Hour]]''), television (e.g. ''[[The Day Today]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', ''[[Brass Eye]]'') and the web (e.g. [[Mindry.in]], The Fruit Dish, [[Scunt News]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scunt.co.uk/ |title=FRONT PAGE – Satirical News, Review, Comment &amp; Analysis |publisher=Scunt.co.uk |accessdate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130421054837/http://www.scunt.co.uk/ |archivedate=April 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faking News]], [[El Koshary Today]], The Giant Napkin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegiantnapkin.com/ |title=The Giant Napkin |publisher=Thegiantnapkin.com |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconfirmed Sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unconfirmedsources.com/ |title=Unconfirmedsources.com |publisher=Unconfirmedsources.com |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The ''Onion''{{'}}s website). Other satires are on the [[list of satirists and satires]]. Another internet-driven form of satire is to lampoon bad internet performers. An example of this is the [[Internet meme]] character [[Miranda Sings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ng | first = David | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/05/miranda-sings-colleen-ballinger-jim-caruso-cast-party-jersey-boys-daniel-reichard.html | title = YouTube sensation Miranda seduces Broadway | journal = Los Angeles Times | date = May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/04/PKGE19REP8.DTL | title = This Week | journal = San Francisco Chronicle | date = October 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Wikinews]]'', Sean Mills, President of ''[[The Onion]]'', said angry letters about their news parody always carried the same message. "It's whatever affects that person", said Mills. "So it's like, 'I love it when you make a joke about murder or rape, but if you talk about cancer, well my brother has cancer and that's not funny to me.' Or someone else can say, 'Cancer's ''hilarious'', but don't talk about rape because my cousin got raped.' Those are rather extreme examples, but if it affects somebody personally, they tend to be more sensitive about it."&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[n:The Onion: An interview with 'America's Finest News Source'|An interview with The Onion]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zhou Libo (comedian)|Zhou Libo]], a comedian from [[Shanghai]], is the most popular satirist in China. His humour has interested middle-class people and has sold out shows ever since his rise to fame.

==Techniques==
Literary satire is usually written out of earlier satiric works, [[Reprise#In literature|reprising]] previous conventions, commonplaces, stance, situations and tones of voice.&lt;ref name="Griffin1994p136"&gt;Griffin, Dustin H. (1994) ''Satire: A Critical Reintroduction'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=MLM2edymLtUC&amp;pg=PA136 p.136]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exaggeration]] is one of the most common satirical techniques.&lt;ref name="Claridge2010p257"&gt;Claridge, Claudia (2010) ''Hyperbole in English: A Corpus-based Study of Exaggeration'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=aegq_QdX6h8C&amp;pg=PA257 p.257]&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily [[Diminution (satire)|diminution]] is also a satirical technique.

==Legal status==
For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions.&lt;ref name="Test1991p9licencequote"/&gt; In Germany&lt;ref name="Geisler2005p73"/&gt; and Italy&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; satire is protected by the constitution.

Since satire belongs to the realm of [[art]] and artistic expression, it benefits from broader lawfulness limits than mere [[freedom of information]] of journalistic kind.&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; In some countries a specific "right to satire" is recognized and its limits go beyond the "right to report" of journalism and even the "right to criticize".&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; Satire benefits not only of the protection to [[freedom of speech]], but also to that to [[culture]], and that to scientific and artistic production.&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt;

=== Australia ===
{{Main|The Juice Media#Controversy}}
In September 2017 [[The Juice Media]] received an e-mail from the Australian National Symbols Officer requesting that the use of a satirical logo, called the "Coat of Harms" based on the [[Coat of arms of Australia|Australian Coat of Arms]], no longer be used as they had received complaints from the members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/thejuicemedia/status/906104236789841920/photo/1|title=theJuice on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coincidentally 5 days later a Bill was proposed to [[Parliament of Australia|Australian parliament]] to amend the [[Criminal law of Australia|Criminal Code Act 1995]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; If successfully passed those found to be in breach of the new amendment can face 2–5 years imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22legislation/billsdgs/5767580%22|title=ParlInfo - Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2018, the Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017 was before the [[Australian Senate]] with the [[Reading (legislature)|third reading]] moved 10 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973#|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship and criticism==
Descriptions of satire's biting effect on its target include 'venomous', 'cutting', 'stinging',&lt;ref name="Kinservik2002p21"&gt;Kinservik, Matthew J. (2002) ''Disciplining Satire: The Censorship of Satiric Comedy on the Eighteenth...'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=haUcp4-01DMC&amp;pg=PA21 p.21]&lt;/ref&gt; vitriol. Because satire often combines anger and humor, as well as the fact that it addresses and calls into question many controversial issues, it can be profoundly disturbing.

===Typical arguments===
Because it is essentially ironic or sarcastic, satire is often misunderstood. A typical misunderstanding is to confuse the satirist with his [[persona]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p10"/&gt;

====Bad taste====
Common uncomprehending responses to satire include revulsion (accusations of [[Taste (sociology)|poor taste]], or that "it's just not funny" for instance) and the idea that the satirist actually does support the ideas, policies, or people he is attacking. For instance, at the time of its publication, many people misunderstood Swift's purpose in ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', assuming it to be a serious recommendation of economically motivated cannibalism.

====Targeting the victim====
Some critics of [[Mark Twain]] see [[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (novel)|''Huckleberry Finn'']] as [[racist]] and offensive, missing the point that its author clearly intended it to be satire (racism being in fact only one of a number of Mark Twain's known concerns attacked in ''Huckleberry Finn'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Leonard | first1 = James S | first2 = Thomas A | last2 = Tenney | first3 = Thadious M | last3 = Davis | title = Satire or Evasion?: Black Perspectives on Huckleberry Finn | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] |date=December 1992 | page = 224 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=fdrBtpSSCisC&amp;pg=RA1-PA116&amp;lpg=RA1-PA116&amp;dq=hemingway+%22huckleberry+finn%22+%22green+hills%22 | isbn = 978-0-8223-1174-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Shelley Fisher | last = Fishin | title = Lighting out for the Territory: Reflections on Mark Twain and American Culture | place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same misconception was suffered by the main character of the 1960s British television comedy satire ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]''. The character of [[Alf Garnett]] (played by [[Warren Mitchell]]) was created to poke fun at the kind of narrow-minded, racist, [[little Englander]] that Garnett represented. Instead, his character became a sort of [[anti-hero]] to people who actually agreed with his views. (The same situation occurred with [[Archie Bunker]] in American TV show ''[[All in the Family]]'', a character derived directly from Garnett.)

The Australian satirical television comedy show ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'' has suffered repeated attacks based on various perceived interpretations of the "target" of its attacks. The "Make a Realistic Wish Foundation" sketch (June 2009), which attacked in classical satiric fashion the heartlessness of people who are reluctant to donate to [[Charitable organization|charities]], was widely interpreted as an attack on the [[Make a Wish Foundation]], or even the terminally ill children helped by that organisation. [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the time [[Kevin Rudd]] stated that The Chaser team "should hang their heads in shame". He went on to say that "I didn't see that but it's been described to me. ...But having a go at kids with a terminal illness is really beyond the pale, absolutely beyond the pale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/04/2589532.htm |title='Hang your heads' Rudd tells Chaser boys | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television station management suspended the show for two weeks and reduced the third season to eight episodes.

====Romantic prejudice====
The romantic prejudice against satire is the belief spread by the [[Romanticism|romantic movement]] that satire is something unworthy of serious attention; this prejudice has held considerable influence to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutherland | first = James | year = 1958 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 | title = English Satire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such prejudice extends to humour and everything that arouses laughter, which are often underestimated as frivolous and unworthy of serious study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Rod A | last = Martin | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ieAcp2Z_zkIC&amp;pg=PA27 | title = The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach | pages = 27–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, humor is generally neglected as a topic of anthropological research and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Apte | first = Mahadev L | year = 1985 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4fuAAAAAMAAJ | title = Humor and laughter: an anthropological approach | chapter = Introduction | page = 23 | quote = The general neglect of humor as a topic of anthropological research is reflected in teaching practice. Most introductory textbooks do not even list humor as a significant characteristic of cultural systems together with kinship, social roles, behavioral patterns, religion, language, economic transactions, political institutions, values, and material culture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of opposition toward notable satires===
[[File:Emergency Twitter Was Down.jpg|thumb|right|Satire on [[internet culture]]]]
Because satire criticises in an ironic, essentially indirect way, it frequently escapes [[censorship]] in a way more direct criticism might not. Periodically, however, it runs into serious opposition, and people in power who perceive themselves as attacked attempt to censor it or prosecute its practitioners. In a classic example, [[Aristophanes]] was persecuted by the [[demagogue]] [[Cleon]].

====1599 book ban====
In 1599, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]] and the [[Bishop of London]] [[Richard Bancroft]], whose offices had the function of licensing books for publication in [[England]], issued a decree banning verse satire. The decree, now known as the [[Bishops' Ban of 1599]], ordered the burning of certain volumes of satire by [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]], and others; it also required histories and plays to be specially approved by a member of the Queen's [[Privy Council]], and it prohibited the future printing of satire in verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = A Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers of London, 1554–1640 | volume = III | editor-first = Edward | editor-last = Arber | place = London | year = 1875–94 | page = 677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motives for the ban are obscure, particularly since some of the books banned had been licensed by the same authorities less than a year earlier. Various scholars have argued that the target was obscenity, libel, or sedition. It seems likely that lingering anxiety about the [[Martin Marprelate]] controversy, in which the bishops themselves had employed satirists, played a role; both [[Thomas Nashe]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]], two of the key figures in that controversy, suffered a complete ban on all their works. In the event, though, the ban was little enforced, even by the licensing authority itself.

====21st-century polemics====
In 2005, the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] caused global protests by offended Muslims and violent attacks with many [[wikt:fatality|fatalities]] in the [[Near East]]. It was not the first case of [[Muslim]] protests against criticism in the form of satire, but the Western world was surprised by the hostility of the reaction: Any country's flag in which a newspaper chose to publish the parodies was being burnt in a Near East country, then embassies were attacked, killing 139 people in mainly four countries; politicians throughout Europe agreed that satire was an aspect of the [[freedom of speech]], and therefore to be a protected means of dialogue. Iran threatened to start an [[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition]], which was immediately responded to by Jews with an [[Israeli Anti-Semitic Cartoons Contest]].

In 2006 British comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] released ''[[Borat|Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'', a "[[mockumentary]]" that satirized everyone, from high society to frat boys. The film was criticized by many. Although Baron Cohen is Jewish, some complained that it was [[antisemitism|antisemitic]], and the government of [[Kazakhstan]] boycotted the film. The film itself had been a reaction to a longer quarrel between the government and the comedian.

In 2008, popular South African cartoonist and satirist [[Jonathan Shapiro]] (who is published under the pen name Zapiro) came under fire for depicting then-president of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] [[Jacob Zuma]] in the act of undressing in preparation for the implied rape of 'Lady Justice' which is held down by Zuma loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-12-18-zuma-claims-r7m-over-zapiro-cartoon| work = Mail and Guardian | date = December 18, 2008 | location = [[South Africa|ZA]] | title= Zuma claims R7m over Zapiro cartoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon was drawn in response to Zuma's efforts to duck corruption charges, and the controversy was heightened by the fact that Zuma was himself acquitted of [[Jacob Zuma rape trial|rape]] in May 2006. In February 2009, the [[SABC|South African Broadcasting Corporation]], viewed by some opposition parties as the mouthpiece of the governing ANC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=248529&amp;area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/ | work = Mail and Guardian | format = interview | title = Democratic Alliance spokesperson Helen Zille| accessdate = August 2005 | location = ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt; shelved a satirical TV show created by Shapiro,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=308632 |work=Dispatch |location=ZA |title=ZNews: Zapiro's puppet show |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326004224/http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=308632 |archivedate=March 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in May 2009 the broadcaster pulled a documentary about political satire (featuring Shapiro among others) for the second time, hours before scheduled broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-05-26-sabc-pulls-zapiro-doccie-again| work = Mail and Guardian | date = September 26, 2009 | location = ZA | title=SABC pulls Zapiro doccie, again}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apartheid South Africa]] also had a long history of censorship.

On April 29, 2015, the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) requested [[Kent Police]] investigate the [[BBC]], claiming that comments made about Party leader [[Nigel Farage]] by a panelist on the comedy show ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'' might hinder his chances of success in the general election (which would take place a week later), and claimed the BBC breached the Representation of the People Act.&lt;ref name="UKIP"/&gt; Kent Police rebuffed the request to open an investigation, and the BBC released a statement, "Britain has a proud tradition of satire, and everyone knows that the contributors on ''Have I Got News for You'' regularly make jokes at the expense of politicians of all parties."&lt;ref name="UKIP"&gt;[http://www.itv.com/news/2015-04-29/ukip-asks-police-to-investigate-the-bbc-over-have-i-got-news-for-you/ "Ukip asks police to investigate the BBC over Have I Got News for You"].

While an American envoy to France, [[Benjamin Franklin]] anonymously published a letter in 1784 suggesting that [[Paris]]ians economise on candles by arising earlier to use morning sunlight.&lt;ref name='Franklin'&gt;{{cite journal|author-link = Benjamin Franklin | first = Benjamin | last = Franklin |title=Aux auteurs du Journal|journal=[[Journal de Paris]]|date=April 26, 1784|issue= 117|language = French}}  Wrote [[anonymously]].

*In the 1920s, an English [[cartoonist]] imagined a laughable thing for the time: a hotel for cars. He drew a [[multi-story car park]].&lt;ref name="LuttazziProphetic" /&gt;
*The second episode of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', which debuted in 1969, featured a ''[[Sketch comedy|skit]]'' entitled "[[The Mouse Problem]]" (meant to satirize contemporary media exposés on homosexuality), which depicted a cultural phenomenon eerily similar to modern [[furry fandom]] (which did not become widespread until the 1980s, over a decade after the skit was first aired).
* The comedy film ''[[Americathon]]'', released in 1979 and set in the United States of 1998, predicted a number of trends and events that would eventually unfold in the near future, including an American debt crisis, Chinese [[capitalism]], the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], [[terrorism]] aimed at the civilian population, a presidential sex scandal, and the popularity of [[reality shows]].
*In January 2001, a satirical news article in ''[[The Onion]]'', entitled "Our Long National Nightmare of Peace and Prosperity Is Finally Over"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784 |title=Bush: 'Our Long National Nightmare of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over' | publisher= The Onion |accessdate= June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; had newly elected President George Bush vowing to "develop new and expensive weapons technologies" and to "engage in at least one Gulf War-level armed conflict in the next four years". Furthermore, he would "bring back economic stagnation by implementing substantial tax cuts, which would lead to a recession". This prophesied the [[Iraq War]] and to the [[Bush tax cuts]].
*In 1975, the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' included an ad for a triple blade razor called the Triple-Trac; in 2001, [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] introduced the Mach3. In 2004, ''[[The Onion]]'' satirized [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] and Gillette's marketing of ever-increasingly multi-blade razors with a mock article proclaiming Gillette will now introduce a five-blade razor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/33930 |title=Fuck Everything, We're Doing Five Blades |publisher=The Onion |accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Gillette released the [[Gillette Fusion]], a five-blade razor.
*After the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]] in 2015, ''[[The Onion]]'' ran an article with the headline "U.S. Soothes Upset Netanyahu With Shipment Of Ballistic Missiles". Sure enough, reports broke the next day of the Obama administration offering military upgrades to Israel in the wake of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.666977 |title=Where Satire Meets Truth: Did The Onion Just Predict a Real Israeli Headline? |publisher=Haaretz |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In July 2016, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' released the most recent in a string of satirical references to a potential ''[[Donald Trump]]'' presidency. Other media sources, including the popular film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' have also made similar satirical references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/simpsons-predicted-president-trump-back-to-the-future |title=Back to the future: how the Simpsons and others predicted President Trump |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satire rose the daunting question of what role public opinion would play in government. (...) satirists criticized government activities, exposed ambiguities, and forced administrators to clarify or establish policies. Not surprisingly, heated public controversy surrounded satiric commentary, resulting in an outright ban on political satire in 1835 (...) Government officials cracked down on their humorous public criticism that challenged state authority through both its form and content. Satire had been a political resource in France for a long time, but the anxious political context of the July Monarchy had unlocked its political power.
Satire also taught lessons in democracy. It fit into the July Monarchy's tense political context as a voice in favor of public political debate. Satiric expression took place in the public sphere and spoke from a position of public opinion-that is, from a position of the nation’s expressing a political voice and making claims on its government representatives and leadership. Beyond mere entertainment, satire's humor appealed to and exercised public opinion, drawing audiences into new practices of representative government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Comic balloons 4 types 1x4.svg|thumb|The four most common speech balloons, top to bottom: speech, whisper, thought, scream.]]

'''Speech balloons''' (also '''speech bubbles''', '''dialogue balloons''' or '''word balloons''') are a graphic convention used most commonly in [[comic book]]s, [[comic]]s and [[cartoon]]s to allow words (and much less often, pictures) to be understood as representing the speech or thoughts of a given character in the comic. There is often a formal distinction between the balloon that indicates thoughts and the one that indicates words spoken aloud: the balloon that conveys thoughts is often referred to as a '''thought bubble'''.

==History==
[[Image:Strigel 1506-detail.jpg|thumb|Before the 20th century,{{specify}} speech was depicted using bands, flags, scrolls, or sheets of paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bugpowder.com/andy/e.speechballoons.evolution.html Evolution of speech balloons].

[[Image:Ograbme.jpg|thumb|In this 1807 political cartoon opposing [[Embargo Act of 1807|Jefferson's Embargo]], the form and function of speech balloons is already similar to their modern use.]]
One of the earliest antecedents to the modern speech bubble were the "[[speech scroll]]s", wispy lines that connected first person speech to the mouths of the speakers in [[Mesoamerican]] art between 600 and 900 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper| author=Hull, Kerry Michael| title=Verbal Art and Performance in Ch’orti’ and Maya Hieroglyphic Writing| year=2003| url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2003/hullkm039/hullkm039.pdf| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012021647/http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2003/hullkm039/hullkm039.pdf| archivedate=2006-10-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western graphic art, labels that reveal what a pictured figure is saying have appeared since at least the 13th century. These were in common European use by the early 16th century. Word balloons (also known as "banderoles") began appearing in 18th-century printed broadsides, and political cartoons from the [[American Revolution]] (including some published by [[Benjamin Franklin]]) often used them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/tserve/eighteen/ekeyinfo/erelrev.htm|title=Religion and the American Revolution, Divining America, TeacherServe®, National Humanities Center|work=rtp.nc.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA04/wood/ykid/illustrated.htm The Yellow Kid on paper and stage, Contemporary illustrations]''. Retrieved October 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They later fell out of fashion, but by 1904 had regained their popularity, although they were still considered novel enough to require explanation.&lt;ref name=ArtOfCaricature&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofcaricature00wrig#page/134/mode/2up/ The Art of Caricature], p. 134, by Grant Wright; published September 1904, by Baker &amp; Taylor Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of the [[comics]] industry in the 20th century, the appearance of speech balloons has become increasingly standardized, though the formal conventions that have evolved in different cultures (USA as opposed to Japan, for example), can be quite distinct.

[[Richard F. Outcault]]'s [[Yellow Kid]] is generally credited as the first American comic strip character. His words initially appeared on his yellow shirt, but word balloons very much like those in use today were added almost immediately, as early as 1896. By the start of the 20th century, word balloons were ubiquitous, and since that time only a very few American comic strips and comic books have relied on captions, notably [[Hal Foster]]'s ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' and the early [[Tarzan (comics)|''Tarzan'' comic strip]] in the 1930s. In Europe, where [[text comics]] were more common, speech balloons slowly caught on with well known examples like [[Alain Saint-Ogan]]'s ''[[Zig et Puce]]'' (1925), [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' (1929)  and [[Rob-Vel]]'s ''[[Spirou (comics)|Spirou]]'' (1938).

==Popular forms==

===Speech bubbles===
The most common is the speech bubble. It comes in two forms for two circumstances: an in-panel character and an off-panel character. An in-panel character (one who is fully or mostly visible in the panel of the strip of comic that the reader is viewing) uses a bubble with a pointer, called a tail, directed towards the speaker.

When one character has multiple balloons within a panel, often only the balloon nearest to the speaker's head has a tail, and the others are connected to it in sequence by narrow bands. This style is often used in [[Mad Magazine]], due to its "[[call-and-response]]" dialogue-based humor.

An off-panel character (the comic book equivalent of being "off screen") has several options, some of them rather unconventional. The first is a standard speech bubble with a tail pointing toward the speaker's position. The second option, which originated in [[manga]], has the tail pointing ''into'' the bubble, instead of out. (This tail is still pointing towards the speaker.) The third option replaces the tail with a sort of bottleneck that connects with the side of the panel. It can be seen in the works of [[Marjane Satrapi]] (author of ''[[Persepolis (graphic novel)|Persepolis]]'').

In American &lt;!--- Is the description American necessary? Isn't this technique also used in manga, etc? ---&gt; comics, a bubble without a tail means that the speaker is not merely outside the reader's field of view but invisible to the [[point of view (literature)|viewpoint character]], often as an unspecified member of a crowd.

Characters distant (in space or time) from the scene of the panel can still speak, in squared bubbles without a tail; this usage, equivalent to [[voice-over]] in film, is not uncommon in American comics for dramatic contrast.  In contrast to captions, the corners of such balloons never coincide with those of the panel; for further distinction they often have a double outline, a different background color, or [[quotation mark]]s.

===Thought bubbles===
Thought bubbles come in two forms: the chain thought bubble and the "fuzzy" bubble.

The chain thought bubble is the almost universal symbol for thinking in cartoons. It consists of a large, [[cloud]]-like bubble containing the text of the thought, with a chain of increasingly smaller circular bubbles leading to the character. Some artists use an elliptical bubble instead of a cloud-shaped one.

Often animal characters like [[Snoopy]] and [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] "talk" using thought bubbles.  Thought bubbles may also be used in circumstances when a character is gagged or otherwise unable to speak.

Another, less conventional thought bubble has emerged: the "fuzzy" thought bubble. Used in manga (by such artists as [[Ken Akamatsu]]), the fuzzy bubble is roughly circular in shape (generally), but the edge of the bubble is not a line but a collection of spikes close to each other, creating the impression of fuzziness. Fuzzy thought bubbles do not use tails, and are placed near the character who is thinking. This has the advantage of reflecting the TV equivalent effect: something said with an echo.

Writers and artists can refuse to use thought bubbles, expressing the action through spoken dialogue and drawing; they are sometimes seen as an inefficient method of expressing thought because they are attached directly to the head of the thinker, unlike methods such as caption boxes, which can be used both as an expression of thought and narration while existing in an entirely different panel from the character thinking. However, they are restricted to the current viewpoint character. An example is [[Alan Moore]] and [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|David Lloyd]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', wherein during one chapter, a monologue expressed in captions serves not only to express the thoughts of a character but also the mood, status and actions of three others.

===Other forms===
The shape of a speech balloon can be used to convey further information. Common ones include the following:
*''Scream bubbles'' indicate a character is screaming or shouting, usually with a jagged outline or a thicker line which can be colored.  Their lettering is usually larger or bolder than normal.
*''Broadcast bubbles'' (also known as ''radio bubbles'') may have a jagged tail like the conventional drawing of a lightning flash and either a squared-off or jagged outline. Letters are sometimes italicised without also being bold. Broadcast bubbles indicate that the speaker is communicating through an electronic device, such as a radio or television, or is robotic.
*''Whisper bubbles'' are usually drawn with a dashed (dotted) outline, smaller font or gray lettering to indicate the tone is softer, as most speech is printed in black. &lt;BR&gt;Another form, sometimes encountered in manga, looks like an occidental thought bubble.
*''Icicle bubbles'' have jagged "icicles" on the lower edge, representing "cold" hostility.  
*''Monster bubbles'' have blood or slime dripping from them.
*''Colored bubbles'' can be used to convey the emotion that goes with the speech, such as red for anger or green for envy. This style is seldom used in modern comics. Alternatively (especially in online-published comics), colours can be used to provide an additional cue about who is speaking. Main characters often have individual thematic colours, and their speech bubbles are frequently tinted with their colour; especially in situations when there are no characters visible for speech bubbles to point to.

==Captions==
Captions are generally used for [[narration]] purposes, such as showing location and time, or conveying editorial commentary. They are generally rectangular and positioned near the edge of the panel. Often they are also colored to indicate the difference between themselves and the word balloons used by the characters, which are almost always white. Increasingly in modern comics, captions are frequently used to convey an internal monologue or typical speech.&lt;ref name=Piekos&gt;Piekos, Nate. [http://www.blambot.com/articles_grammar.shtml "Comic Book Grammar &amp; Tradition" (Updated 2015)], Blambot website. Accessed Jan. 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist-specific variations==
[[Image:YellowKid.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Yellow Kid]]'s words appear on his shirt]]

Some characters and strips use highly unconventional methods of communication. Perhaps the most notable is the [[Yellow Kid]], an early [[United States|American]] [[comic strip]]. His (but not the other characters') words would appear on his large, smock-like shirt. A short-run [[Shirt Tales#TV series|American animated TV series of the early 1980s]] used this same concept, but with changing phrases on the "T-shirts" worn by the animal-based characters, depending on the characters' thoughts. 

Also noteworthy are the many variations on the form created by [[Dave Sim]] for his comic ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark]]''. Depending on the shape, size, and position of the bubble, as well as the texture and shape of the letters within it, Sim could convey large amounts of information about the speaker. This included separate bubbles for different states of mind (drunkenness, etc.), for echoes, and a special class of bubbles for one single floating apparition.

An early pioneer in experimenting with many different types of speech balloons and lettering for different types of speech was [[Walt Kelly]], in his ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' strip. Deacon Mushrat speaks in [[blackletter]], P.T. Bridgeport speaks in circus posters, Sarcophagus MacAbre speaks in condolence cards, "Mr. Pig" (a take on [[Nikita Khrushchev]]) speaks in [[faux Cyrillic]], etc.

In the famous French comic series ''[[Asterix]]'', [[René Goscinny|Goscinny]] and [[Albert Uderzo|Uderzo]] use bubbles without tails to indicate a distant or unseen speaker. They have also experimented with using different types of lettering for characters of different nationalities to indicate they speak a different language that Asterix may not understand; Goths speak in [[blackletter]], Greeks in angular lettering (though always understood by the Gaulish main characters, so it is more of an accent than a language), Norse with "Nørdic åccents", Egyptians in faux [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] (depictive illustrations and rebuses), etc. Another experiment with speech bubbles was exclusive to one book, ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''. The agent in question is a vile manipulator who creates discord in a group of people with a single innocent-sounding comment. His victims start quarreling and ultimately fighting each other while speaking in green-colored speech bubbles.

Font variation is a common tactic in comics. ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' series, written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Letterer|lettered]] by [[Todd Klein]], features many characters whose speech bubbles are written with a font that is exclusive to them. For examples, the main character, the gloomy [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]], speaks in wavy-edged bubbles, completely black, with similarly wavy white lettering. His sister, the scatterbrained and whimsical [[Delirium (DC Comics)|Delirium]] speaks in bubbles in a many-colored explosive background with uneven lettering, and the irreverent raven [[Characters of The Sandman#Matthew|Matthew]] speaks in a shaky angular kind of bubble with scratchy lettering. Other characters, such as John Dee, have special shapes of bubbles for their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/07/comics-you-should-own-sandman/|title= Comics You Should Own – ''Sandman''|first= Greg|last= Burgas|date= January 7, 2013|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140410022316/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/07/comics-you-should-own-sandman/|archivedate= April 10, 2014|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'''s recurring ''[[Monroe (comic strip)|Monroe]]'' comic strip, certain words are written larger or in unusual fonts for emphasis.

In [[manga]], there is a tendency to include the speech necessary for the storyline in balloons, while small scribbles outside the balloons add side comments, often used for irony or to show that they're said in a much smaller voice.  [[Characters of Negima (16-31)#Satsuki Yotsuba|Satsuki Yotsuba]] in the manga series [[Negima]] is notable because she speaks almost ''entirely'' in side scribble.

==Graphic symbols==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Speech bubbles are used not only to include a character's words, but also emotions, voice inflections and unspecified language.

===Punctuation marks===
One of the universal emblems of the art of comics is the use of a single punctuation mark to depict a character's emotions, much more efficiently than any possible sentence. A speech bubble with a single big [[question mark]] (?) (often drawn by hand, not counted as part of the lettering) denotes confusion or ignorance. An [[exclamation mark]] (!) indicates surprise or terror. This device is broadly used in the European comic tradition, the Belgian artist [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series being a good example. Sometimes, the punctuation marks stand alone above the character's head, with no bubble needed.

In [[manga]], the [[ellipsis]] (i.e. three dots) is also used to express silence in a much more significant way than the mere absence of bubbles. This is specially seen when a character is supposed to say something, to indicate a stunned silence or when a sarcastic comment is expected by the reader. The ellipsis, along with the big drop of sweat on the character's temple—usually depicting shame, confusion, or embarrassment caused by other people's actions—is one of the [[Japan]]ese graphic symbols that have taken root in comics all around the world, although they are still rare in Western tradition.  Japanese even has a sound effect for "deafening silence", {{nihongo|''shiin''|シーン|}}.

===Foreign languages===
In many comic books, words that would be foreign to the narration but are displayed in translation for the reader are surrounded by [[Brackets|angle brackets]] or chevrons {{angbr|like this}}.

[[Gilbert Hernandez]]'s series about [[Love and Rockets (comics)|Palomar]] is written in English, but supposed to take place mainly in a [[Hispanic]] country. Thus, what's supposed to be representations of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speech is written without brackets, but occasional actual English speech is written within brackets, to indicate that it is unintelligible to the main [[Hispanophone]] characters in the series.

Some comics will have the actual foreign language in the speech balloon, with the translation as a footnote; this is done with Latin aphorisms in ''Asterix''.

Another convention is to put the foreign speech in a distinctive lettering style; for example, [[Asterix and the Goths|''Asterix''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Goths]] speak in [[blackletter]].

Since the Japanese language uses [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|two writing directionalities]] (vertical, which is the traditional direction; and horizontal, as most other languages), manga has a convention of representing translated foreign speech as horizontal text.

===The big Z===
It is a convention in [[United States|American]] comics that the sound of a snore is represented as a series of Z's, dating back at least to [[Rudolph Dirks]]' early 20th-century strip ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Cecil. [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/42997/why-does-z-stand-for-snoring-and-how-do-other/ "The Straight Dope: Why Does Z Stand for Snoring? And how do other languages represent the sound?,"] ''Washington City Paper'' (July 27, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has even been reduced to a single letter Z, so that a speech bubble with this letter standing all alone (again, drawn by hand rather than a font type) means the character is sleeping in most humorous comics. This can be seen, for instance, in [[Charles Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strips.

Originally, the resemblance between the 'z' sound and that of a snore seemed exclusive to the [[English language]], but the spread of American comics has made it a frequent feature in other countries.  An exception to this is in Japanese manga, where the usual symbol for sleep is a large bubble coming out of the character's nose.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Megan. [https://www.wired.com/2015/05/using-emoji-wrong/ "WE’RE ALL USING THESE EMOJI WRONG,"] ''Wired'' (05.21.15).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawings within the speech bubble===
Singing characters usually have [[musical note]]s drawn into their word balloons. [[Archie Comics]]' [[Melody Valentine]], a character in their ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (comic)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' comic, has musical notes drawn into her word balloons at all times, to convey that she speaks in a sing-song voice.

The above-mentioned Albert Uderzo in the ''Asterix'' series decorates speech bubbles with beautiful flowers depicting an extremely soft, sweet voice (usually  preceding a violent outburst by the same character).

A stormy cloud with a rough lightning sticking out of it, either in a bubble or just floating above the character's head as a modified 'cloudy' thought bubble, depicts anger, not always verbally expressed.

[[Light bulbs]] are sometimes used when the character comes up with an idea or solution to a problem.

In the Western world, it is common to replace profanity with a string of nonsense symbols (&amp;%$@*$#), sometimes called [[The Lexicon of Comicana|grawlixes]]. In comics that are usually addressed to children or teenagers, bad language is [[censorship|censored]] by replacing it with more or less elaborate drawings and expressionistic symbols. For example, instead of calling someone a swine, a pig is drawn in the speech bubble.

One example is the [[Spain|Spanish]] ''[[Mortadelo]]'' series, created by [[Francisco Ibáñez Talavera|Francisco Ibáñez]]. Although not specifically addressed to children, ''Mortadelo'' was born during [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[dictatorship]], when censorship was the order of the day and the slightest attempt of rough language was prohibited. When Ibáñez's characters are angry, donkey heads, lightning, lavatories, billy goats and even faux Japanese characters are often seen in their bubbles.

When ''Mortadelo'' was portrayed on film by Spanish director [[Javier Fesser]] in 2003, one of the critiques made to his otherwise successful adaptation was the character's use of words that never appeared in the comics. Fesser claimed: "When you see a bubble speech containing a lightning falling on a pig, what do you imagine the character's saying?"

In order for comic strip and graphic novel dialogue to make sense, it has to be read in order. Thus, conventions have evolved in the order in which the communication bubbles are read. The individual bubbles are read in the order of the language. For example, in [[English language|English]], the bubbles are read from left to right in a panel, while in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], it is the other way around. Sometimes the bubbles are "stacked", with two characters having multiple bubbles, one above the other. Such stacks are read from the top down. Poor use of speech balloons can unintentionally make the proper reading order ambiguous, confusing the reader.

==Lettering==
Traditionally, a cartoonist or occupational [[letterer]] would draw in all the individual letters in the balloons and sound effects by hand.  A modern alternative, used by most comics today and universal in English-translated manga, is to letter with computer programs.  The [[font]]s used usually emulate the style of hand-lettering.

Traditionally, most mainstream comic books are lettered entirely in [[upper-case]], with a few exceptions:
* Name particles such as ''de'' and ''von'', and the "c" in a [[surname]] of Scottish or Irish origin starting with ''Mc''
* To indicate a frightened or quiet manner of speech
* An interjection such as "er", "um", etc.

When hand-lettering, upper-case lettering saves time and effort because it requires drawing only three guidelines, while mixed-case lettering requires five.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley, Drew. [http://multiversitycomics.com/columns/looking-at-lettering-caps-vs-mixed-case/ "Looking at Lettering: CAPS vs Mixed Case,"] ''Multiversity Comics'' (April 22, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few comics, uppercase and lowercase are used as in ordinary writing.  Since the mid-1980s, [[mixed case]] lettering has gradually become more widely used in mainstream books. Some comics, such as ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comics)|Pearls Before Swine]]'', also use lowercase speech to mark a distinctive accent (in this case, the male crocodiles’ accented speech, opposed to all other characters who use standard uppercase speech).

From 2002–2004, [[Marvel Comics]] experimented with mixed-case lettering in all its books.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt; Most mainstream titles have since returned to traditional all upper-case lettering.

In many comics, although the lettering is entirely in capital letters, [[serif]] versions of "I" are used exclusively where a capital I would appear in normal print text, and a [[sanserif]] (i.e., a simple vertical line) is used in all other places. This reduces confusion with the number one, and also serves to indicate when the personal pronoun "I" is meant. This lettering convention can be seen in computer fonts such as [[Blambot]]'s "DigitalStrip.ttf" and "AnimeAce.ttf" fonts, which make no other distinction between lower- and uppercase letters.

==Substance of balloons==
In several occasions, comics artists have used balloons (or similar narrative devices) as if they have true substance, usually for humorous [[meta-]]like purposes. In ''[[Peanuts]]'', for example, the notes played by [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]] occasionally take substance and are used in various ways, including Christmas decorations or perches for birds. Sometimes balloons can be influenced by the strip's environment: in the Italian strip ''[[Sturmtruppen]]'' they freeze and crack when the temperature is very low, or an [[Archie (comics)|Archie]] comic strip where two men from Alaska remarked on how cold it was, by saying the speech balloons froze as they said them, and the words had to be thawed out to be heard.

In the Flemish ''[[Suske en Wiske]]'' series, on one occasion a thought bubble full of mathematical formulas is cut open with scissors and its contents emptied in a bag, to be saved for later (in a manner not unlike the [[pensieve]] in the [[Harry Potter]] series). In the same series, speech balloons are occasionally even held and blown up to function as actual balloons or the words of the speech bubble are occasionally shown coming out the side of the speech bubble, to signify that the speaker is moving so fast that their words can't keep up with them, i.e. at [[supersonic]] speed.

In the novel ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]'', the last words of a murdered Toon (cartoon character) are found under his body in the form of a speech balloon.

==Computer-generated speech balloons==
Many digital artists generate speech balloons with [[List of vector graphics editors|general-purpose illustration software]].  Products like [[Comic Book Creator]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Comic Life]] for [[Mac OS X]] and Windows target the non-professional end of the market.

A '''standard language''' or '''standard variety''' is either as a language [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] used by a population for public purposes, or a variety that has undergone standardization.{{sfn|Finegan|2007|p=14}}
Typically, varieties that become standardized are the local [[dialect]]s spoken in the centers of [[commerce]] and [[government]], where a need arises for a variety that will serve more than local needs.
Standardization typically involves a fixed orthography, codification in authoritative grammars and dictionaries and public acceptance of these standards.
A standard [[written language]] is sometimes termed by the [[German language|German]] word ''Schriftsprache''.

A [[pluricentric language]] has multiple interacting standard varieties.{{sfn|Stewart|1968|p=534}}{{sfn|Kloss|1967|p=31}}{{sfn|Clyne|1992|p=1}}
Examples include [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]],  [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].{{sfn|Clyne|1992|pp=1–3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Madelain |editor1-first=Anne |title=Au sud de l'Est |series=vol. 3 |publisher=Non Lieu |pages=71–78 |language=French |chapter=La langue croate, serbe, bosniaque et monténégrine |trans-chapter=Croatian, Serbian, Bosniakian, and Montenegrin |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |deadurl=no |location=Paris |year=2007 |isbn=978-2-35270-036-4 |oclc=182916790 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5WqGAx?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |accessdate=8 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Monocentric languages, such as [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], have only one standardized version.{{sfn|Clyne|1992|p=3}}

== Standardization ==

A standard variety is developed from a group of related varieties.
This may be done by elevating a single variety, such as the local variety of a center of government or culture.
Alternatively, a new variety may be defined as a selection of features from existing varieties.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
A fixed orthography is typically created for writing the variety.
It may be codified in normative [[dictionaries]] and [[linguistic description|grammar]]s, or by an agreed collection of exemplary texts.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
Whether these dictionaries and grammars are created by private individuals (like ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'') or by state institutions, they become standard if they are treated as authorities for correcting language.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=276}}
A fixed written form and subsequent codification make the standard variety more stable than purely spoken varieties, and provide a base for further development or ''[[ausbau]]''.{{sfn|Ammon|2004|p=275}}
This variety becomes the norm for writing, is used in broadcasting and for official purposes, and is the form taught to non-native learners.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}

Through this process, the standard variety acquires [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] and a greater functional importance than local varieties.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}
Those varieties are said to be dependent on, or [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|heteronomous]] with respect to, the standard variety, because speakers read and write the standard, refer to it as an authority is such matters as specialist vocabulary, and any standardizing changes in their speech are towards that standard.{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=9}}
In some cases, such as [[Standard English]], this process may take place over an extended period without government intervention.
In others it may be deliberately directed by official institutions, such as the [[Académie française]] or [[Royal Spanish Academy|Real Academia Española]], and can proceed much more quickly.{{sfn|Trudgill|2006|p=119}}

Language standardization is often linked to the formation, or attempted formation, of [[nation states]], as language is seen as the vehicle of a shared culture.{{sfn|Inoue|2006|p=122}}
Different national standards derived from a [[dialect continuum]] may be regarded as different languages, even if they are [[mutually intelligible]].{{sfn|Stewart|1968}}{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=11}}
The [[North Germanic language|Scandinavian languages]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], are often cited as examples.{{sfn|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|pp=3–4}}

In other cases governments or neighbouring populations may seek to deny a standard independent status.{{sfn|Inoue|2006|pp=123–124}}
In response, developers of a standard may base it on more divergent varieties.
Thus after [[Norway]] became independent at the start of the 20th century, the [[Bokmål]] standard based on the speech of [[Oslo]] was felt to be too similar to [[Danish language|Danish]] by [[Ivar Aasen]], who developed a rival [[Nynorsk]] standard based on western varieties.
Similarly, when a standard was developed in the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Yugoslav republic of Macedonia]] from local varieties within a continuum with [[Serbia]] to the north and [[Bulgaria]] to the east, it was deliberately based on varieties from the west of the republic that were most different from standard [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].
Now known as [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], it is the national standard of the independent [[Republic of Macedonia]], but viewed by Bulgarians as a dialect of Bulgarian.{{sfn|Trudgill|1992|pp=173–174}}

==Examples==
{{see also|List of language regulators}}

===Chinese===
[[Chinese language|Chinese]] consists of hundreds of [[varieties of Chinese|local varieties]], many of which are not mutually intelligible, usually classified into seven to ten major groups, including [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Min Chinese|Min]].
Before the 20th century, most Chinese spoke only their local variety.
For two millennia, formal writing had been done in [[Literary Chinese]] (or Classical Chinese), a style modelled on the [[Chinese classics|classics]] and far removed from any contemporary speech.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=108–109, 245}}
As a practical measure, officials of the late imperial dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|common language based on Mandarin varieties]], known as ''Guānhuà'' (literally "speech of officials").{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=133, 136}}

In the early 20th century, many Chinese intellectuals argued that the country needed a standardized language.
By the 1920s, Literary Chinese had been replaced as the written standard by [[written vernacular Chinese]], which was based on Mandarin dialects.{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=133–134}}
In the 1930s, [[Standard Chinese]] was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the [[Beijing dialect]], but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties and its syntax based on the written vernacular.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=135}}
It is the official spoken language of the [[People's Republic of China]] (where it is called ''Pǔtōnghuà''  "common speech") and of the [[Republic of China]] governing Taiwan (as ''Guóyǔ'' "national language"), and one of the official languages of [[Singapore]] (as ''Huáyǔ'' "Chinese language").{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=136–137}}
Standard Chinese now dominates public life, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=247}}

===Dutch===
Dutch is a [[Pluricentric language|monocentric language]], with all speakers using the same [[standardization|standard form]] (authorized by the [[Dutch Language Union]]) based on a [[Dutch orthography]] employing the [[Latin alphabet]] when writing. A process of standardisation of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] started in the [[Middle Ages]], especially under the influence of the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] Ducal Court in Dijon ([[Brussels]] after 1477). Till then every region spoke a different [[Middle Dutch]] dialect. The dialects of the [[County of Flanders]] and the [[Duchy of Brabant]] were the most influential around this time. The process of standardisation became much stronger at the start of the 16th century, mainly based on the urban dialect of [[Antwerp]]. In 1585 Antwerp [[Fall of Antwerp (1584–1585)|fell]] to the Spanish army: many from the [[Southern Netherlands]] fled to the [[Dutch Republic|Northern Netherlands]] (that [[Act of Abjuration|declared itself independent]] from Spain), especially to the [[County of Holland|province of Holland]], where they influenced the urban dialects. In 1637, a further important step was made towards a unified language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/dutch-full-historical-junk/ | title=Dutch &amp; Other Languages|publisher=Ccjk.com|accessdate=2015-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Statenvertaling]], the first major Bible translation into Dutch, was created that people from all over the new republic could understand. It used elements from various dialects but was predominantly based on the urban dialects of Holland of post 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taal.phileon.nl/brabants.php |title=Taal in Nederland .:. Brabants |publisher=Taal.phileon.nl |accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English===
In [[British English]] the standard, known as [[Standard English]] (SE), is historically based on the language of the medieval English [[court of Chancery]].{{sfn|Smith|1996}} The late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the establishment of this standard as the norm of "polite" society, that is to say of the [[upper class]]es.{{sfn|Blake|1996}} The spoken standard has come to be seen as a mark of good education and social prestige.{{sfn|Baugh|Cable|2002}} Although often associated with the [[Received Pronunciation|RP accent]], SE can be spoken with any accent, such as [[General American]], [[General Australian]], etc.{{sfn|Smith|1996}}

===Greek===
The standard form of [[Modern Greek]] is based on the [[Varieties of Modern Greek#Spoken dialects|Southern dialects]]; these dialects are spoken mainly in the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Ionian Islands]], [[Attica]], [[Crete]] and the [[Cyclades]].&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks, Geoffrey (1997): ''Greek: A history of the language and its speakers.'' London: Longman. Ch.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindi-Urdu===
Two standardised [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of the [[Hindustani language]] have legal status India: [[Standard Hindi]] (one of 23 co-official national languages) and [[Urdu]] ([[Pakistan]]’s official tongue), resultantly, Hindustani often called “Hindi-Urdu".&lt;ref name=Blum&gt;{{cite book|last=Blum |first=Daniel|year=2002 |language=German |title=Sprache und Politik : Sprachpolitik und Sprachnationalismus in der Republik Indien und dem sozialistischen Jugoslawien (1945-1991) |trans-title=Language and Policy: Language Policy and Linguistic Nationalism in the Republic of India and the Socialist Yugoslavia (1945-1991) |series=Beiträge zur Südasienforschung ; vol. 192 |location=Würzburg | publisher=Ergon | page=200 |isbn=3-89913-253-X |oclc=51961066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish===
{{main article|An Caighdeán Oifigiúil}}
''[[An Caighdeán Oifigiúil]]'' ("The Official Standard"), often shortened to ''An Caighdeán'', is official standard of the [[Irish language]]. It is taught in most schools in Ireland, though with strong influences from local dialects. It was first published by the translators in [[Dáil Éireann]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="blas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas/education/beginnersblas/dictionaries.shtml | title=Beginners' Blas | accessdate=18 March 2011 | date=June 2005 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caighdeán Athbhreithnithe don Ghaeilge|url=http://www.gaelport.com/nuacht/Caighdean-athbhreithnithe-don-Ghaeilge/|accessdate=2012-08-02|newspaper=Gaelport.com|date=2012-08-02|author=Niamh Ní Shúilleabháin|language=Irish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first major revision of the Caighdeán Oifigiúil is available, both online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Caighdeán Oifigiúil—Caighdeán Athbhreithnithe|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/michelle/Final-Version.pdf|publisher=Seirbhís Thithe an Oireachtais|accessdate=2012-08-02|language=Irish|format=PDF|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foilseacháin Rialtais / Government Publications—Don tSeachtain dar críoch 25 Iúil 2012 / For the week ended 25 July 2012|url=http://www.opw.ie/en/media/wl25072012.pdf|publisher=Rialtas na hÉireann|accessdate=2012-08-02|page=2|language=Irish, English|format=PDF|date=27 July 2012|quote=M67B Gramadach na Gaeilge 9781406425766 390 10.00}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the changes to be found in the revised version are, for example, various attempts to bring the recommendations of the Caighdeán closer to the spoken dialect of Gaeltacht speakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Caighdeán Oifigiúil—Caighdeán Athbhreithnithe|publisher=Seirbhís Thithe an Oireachtais|page=7|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/Oireachtas_book(211211).pdf|editor=Vivian Uíbh Eachach|language=Irish|date=January 2012|quote=Rinneadh iarracht ar leith san athbhreithniú seo foirmeacha agus leaganacha atá ar fáil go tréan sa chaint sna mórchanúintí a áireamh sa Chaighdeán Oifigiúil Athbhreithnithe sa tslí is go mbraithfeadh an gnáthchainteoir mórchanúna go bhfuil na príomhghnéithe den chanúint sin aitheanta sa Chaighdeán Oifigiúil agus, mar sin, gur gaire don ghnáthchaint an Caighdeán Oifigiúil anois ná mar a bhíodh.}}&lt;/ref&gt; including allowing further use of the nominative case where the genitive would historically have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Caighdeán Oifigiúil—Caighdeán Athbhreithnithe|date=January 2012|publisher=Seirbhís Thithe an Oireachtais|page=7|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/Oireachtas_book(211211).pdf|editor=Vivian Uíbh Eachach|accessdate=2012-08-02|language=Irish|format=PDF|quote=Triaileadh, mar shampla, aitheantas a thabhairt don leathnú atá ag teacht ar úsáid fhoirm an ainmnigh in ionad an ghinidigh sa chaint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian===
Standard [[Italian language|Italian]] is derived from the [[Tuscan dialect]], specifically from its [[Florentine dialect|Florentine variety]] &amp;mdash; the Florentine influence upon early [[Italian literature]] established that dialect as base for the standard language of Italy. In particular, Italian became the language of culture for all the people of Italy, thanks to the prestige of the masterpieces of [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Francesco Petrarca]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Francesco Guicciardini]]. It would later become the official language of all the [[Historical states of Italy|Italian states]], and after the [[Italian unification]] it became the [[national language]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/ling450ch/reports/Italian2.html A Brief History of the Italian Language by Cory Crawford]. linguistics.byu.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[Italian language|Standard Italian]]'s lexicon has been deeply influenced by almost all [[Languages of Italy|regional languages of Italy]] while its [[received pronunciation]] (known as ''Pronuncia Fiorentina Emendata'', Amended Florentine Pronunciation) is based on the [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] of [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] ([[Rome|Roman dialect]]); these are the reasons why Standard Italian differs significantly from the [[Tuscan dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/pronuncia_(Enciclopedia_dell'Italiano)/ La pronuncia italiana (Italian)]. treccani.it&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin===
[[Classical Latin]] was the literary standard dialect of Latin spoken by higher socioeconomic classes, as opposed to the [[Vulgar Latin]] which is the generic term of the colloquial [[sociolect]]s of Latin spoken across the [[Roman Empire]] by uneducated and less-educated classes. The Latin brought by Roman soldiers to [[Gaul]], [[Hispania|Iberia]], or [[Dacia]] was not identical to the Latin of [[Cicero]], and differed from it in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;L. R. Palmer The Latin Language (repr. Univ. Oklahoma 1988, {{ISBN|0-8061-2136-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese===

In Brazil, actors and journalists usually adopt an unofficial, but de facto, spoken standard [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], originally derived from the middle-class dialect of [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]], but that now encompasses educated urban pronunciations from the different speech communities in the southeast. In that standard, {{angbr|s}} represents the phoneme {{IPA|/s/}} when it appears at the end of a syllable (whereas in Rio de Janeiro this represents {{IPA|/ʃ/}}) the [[rhotic consonant]] spelled {{angbr|r}} is pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} in the same situation (whereas in [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]] this is usually an [[alveolar flap]] or [[alveolar trill|trill]]). European and African dialects have differing realizations of {{IPA|/ʁ/}} than Brazilian dialects, with the former using {{IPA|[ʁ]}} and {{IPA|[r]}} and the latter using {{IPA|[x]}}, {{IPA|[h]}}, or {{IPA|[χ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mateus, Maria Helena &amp; d'Andrade, Ernesto (2000) ''The Phonology of Portuguese'' {{ISBN|0-19-823581-X}} [http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823581-X.pdf (Excerpt from Google Books)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628065105/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823581-X.pdf |date=2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbo-Croatian===

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Traveler's diarrhea''' ('''TD''') is a stomach and intestinal infection. TD is defined as the passage of unformed [[human feces|stool]] (one or more by some definitions, three or more by others) while traveling.&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; It may be accompanied by abdominal cramps, nausea, fever, and bloating.&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; Occasionally [[bloody diarrhea]] may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Feldman| first1= Mark| title= Sleisenger and Fordtran's Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, Management| date= 2015| publisher= Elsevier Health Sciences| isbn= 9781455749898| page= 1924| edition= 10th| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4CMJBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1924| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160310133204/https://books.google.com/books?id=4CMJBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1924| archivedate= 2016-03-10| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most travelers recover within four days with little or no treatment.&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; About 10% of people may have symptoms for a week.&lt;ref name=AFP2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leder|first1=K|title=Advising travellers about management of travellers' diarrhoea.|journal=Australian family physician|date=2015|volume=44|issue=1–2|pages=34–37|pmid=25688957|url=http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2015/januaryfebruary/advising-travellers-about-management-of-travellers%E2%80%99-diarrhoea/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112200909/http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2015/januaryfebruary/advising-travellers-about-management-of-travellers%E2%80%99-diarrhoea|archivedate=2017-01-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
[[Bacteria]] are responsible for more than half of cases.&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; The bacteria [[Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli|enterotoxigenic ''Escherichia coli'']] (ETEC) are typically the most common except in [[Southeast Asia]], where ''[[Campylobacter]]'' is more prominent.&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; About 10% to 20% of cases are due to [[norovirus]].&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; [[Protozoa]] such as ''[[Giardia]]'' may cause longer term disease.&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; The risk is greatest in the first two weeks of travel and among young adults.&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt; People affected are more often from the [[developed world]].&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The onset of TD usually occurs within the first week of travel, but may occur at any time while traveling, and even after returning home, depending on the incubation period of the infectious agent. Bacterial TD typically begins abruptly, but ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' may incubate for seven days, and ''[[Giardia]]'' for 14 days or more, before symptoms develop.  Typically, a traveler experiences four to five loose or watery bowel movements each day. Other commonly associated symptoms are abdominal cramping, bloating, fever, and [[malaise]].  Appetite may decrease significantly.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt;  Though unpleasant, most cases of TD are mild, and resolve in a few days without medical intervention.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safewateronline.com/travelers_d.htm|title=Travelers' diarrhea|publisher=safewateronline.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606032848/http://www.safewateronline.com/travelers_d.htm |archivedate = 6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood or [[mucus]] in the diarrhea, significant abdominal pain, or high fever suggests a more serious cause, such as [[cholera]], characterized by a rapid onset of weakness and torrents of watery diarrhea with flecks of mucus (described as "rice water" stools).  Medical care should be sought in such cases; dehydration is a serious consequence of cholera, and may trigger serious [[sequela]]e—including, in rare instances, death—as rapidly as 24 hours after onset if not addressed promptly.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt;

[[Pathogen|Infectious agent]]s are the primary cause of travelers' diarrhea. [[Enterobacteriaceae|Bacterial enteropathogens]] cause about 80% of cases.  [[Viruses]] and [[protozoans]] account for most of the rest.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD"/&gt;

The most common causative agent isolated in countries surveyed has been [[Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli|enterotoxigenic ''Escherichia coli'']] (ETEC).&lt;ref name="CDC_TD"/&gt; Enteroaggregative ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' is increasingly recognized.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt; ''[[Shigella]]'' [[spp.]] and ''[[Salmonella]]'' spp. are other common bacterial pathogens.  ''[[Campylobacter]]'', ''[[Yersinia]]'', ''[[Aeromonas]]'', and ''[[Plesiomonas]]'' spp. are less frequently found.  Mechanisms of action vary: some bacteria release [[toxin]]s which bind to the intestinal wall and cause diarrhea; others damage the intestines themselves by their direct presence.

While viruses are associated with less than 20% of adult cases of traveler's diarrhea, they may be responsible for nearly 70% of cases in infants and children. Diarrhea due to viral agents is unaffected by antibiotic therapy, but is usually self-limited.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt;  Protozoans such as ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' and ''[[Cyclospora cayetanensis]]'' can also cause diarrhea. Pathogens commonly implicated in travelers' diarrhea appear in the table in this section.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ortega |first1=Ynés R. |last2=Sanchez |first2=Roxana |title=Update on ''Cyclospora cayetanensis'', a Food-Borne and Waterborne Parasite |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=218–234 |doi=10.1128/CMR.00026-09 |pmc=2806662 |pmid=20065331 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subtype of traveler's diarrhea afflicting hikers and campers, sometimes known as [[wilderness diarrhea]], may have a somewhat different frequency of distribution of pathogens.&lt;ref name="Zell1992" /&gt;

===Risk factors===
The primary source of infection is ingestion of [[fecal]]ly contaminated food or water. Attack rates are similar for men and women.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt;

The most important determinant of risk is the traveler's destination. High-risk destinations include [[developing country|developing countries]] in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt; Among backpackers, additional risk factors include drinking untreated surface water and failure to maintain personal hygiene practices and clean cookware.&lt;ref name="pmid16805145"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hargreaves JS |title=Laboratory evaluation of the 3-bowl system used for washing-up eating utensils in the field |journal=Wilderness Environ Med |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=94–102 |year=2006 |pmid=16805145 |doi= 10.1580/PR17-05.1|url=http://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032(06)70296-4/fulltext |location=Diarrhea is a common illness of wilderness travelers, occurring in about one third of expedition participants and participants on wilderness recreation courses. The incidence of diarrhea may be as high as 74% on adventure trips. …Wilderness diarrhea is not caused solely by waterborne pathogens, … poor hygiene, with fecal-oral transmission, is also a contributing factor |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campsites often have very primitive (if any) sanitation facilities, making them potentially as dangerous as any developing country.

Although traveler's diarrhea usually resolves within three to five days (mean duration: 3.6 days), in about 20% of cases, the illness is severe enough to require bedrest, and in 10%, the illness duration exceeds one week.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt;  For those prone to serious infections, such as  [[bacillary dysentery]], [[amoebic dysentery]], and [[cholera]], TD can occasionally be life-threatening.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt;  Others at higher-than-average risk include young adults, [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressed]] persons, persons with [[inflammatory bowel disease]] or [[diabetes]], and those taking [[H2 antagonist|H2 blockers]] or [[antacids]].&lt;ref name="CDC_TD"/&gt;

===Immunity===
Travelers often get diarrhea from eating and drinking foods and beverages that have no adverse effects on local residents. This is due to [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] that develops with constant, repeated exposure to pathogenic organisms. The extent and duration of exposure necessary to acquire immunity has not been determined; it may vary with each individual organism. A study among expatriates in Nepal suggests that immunity may take up to seven years to develop—presumably in adults who avoid deliberate pathogen exposure.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Shlim, [http://www.ciwec-clinic.com/diar/index.html#9 Understanding Diarrhea in Travelers. A Guide to the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of the World's Most Common Travel-Related Illness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524201811/http://www.ciwec-clinic.com/diar/index.html |date=2008-05-24 }}. [[CIWEC Clinic Travel Medicine Center]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, immunity acquired by American students while living in Mexico disappeared, in one study, as quickly as eight weeks after cessation of exposure.&lt;ref name="ostrosky"&gt;Luis Ostrosky-Zeichner, Charles D. Ericsson,

==Prevention==

===Sanitation===
Recommendations include avoidance of questionable foods and drinks, on the assumption that TD is fundamentally a [[sanitation]] failure, leading to bacterial contamination of drinking water and food.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt; While the effectiveness of this strategy has been questioned, given that travelers have little or no control over sanitation in hotels and restaurants, and little evidence supports the contention that food vigilance reduces the risk of contracting TD,&lt;ref name="CID-CHL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shlim|first1=DR|title=Looking for evidence that personal hygiene precautions prevent traveler's diarrhea.|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=1 December 2005|volume=41 Suppl 8|pages=S531-5|pmid=16267714|doi=10.1086/432947}}&lt;/ref&gt; guidelines continue to recommend basic, common-sense precautions when making food and beverage choices:&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt;

* Maintain good hygiene and use only [[safe water]] for drinking and brushing teeth.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt;
* Safe beverages include bottled water, bottled [[carbonated]] beverages, and water boiled or appropriately treated by the traveler (as described below).&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt; Caution should be exercised with tea, coffee, and other hot beverages that may be only heated, not boiled.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt;
* In restaurants, insist that bottled water be unsealed in your presence; reports of locals filling empty bottles with untreated tap water and reselling them as purified water have surfaced.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt; When in doubt, a bottled carbonated beverage is the safest choice, since it is difficult to simulate carbonation when refilling a used bottle.
* Avoid ice, which may not have been made with safe water.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt;
* Avoid green salads, because the lettuce and other uncooked ingredients are unlikely to have been washed with safe water.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt;
* Avoid eating raw fruits and vegetables unless cleaned and peeled personally.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt;

If handled properly, thoroughly cooked fresh and packaged foods are usually safe.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD" /&gt; Raw or undercooked meat and seafood should be avoided. [[Pasteurization|Unpasteurized]] milk, dairy products, mayonnaise, and pastry icing are associated with increased risk for TD, as are foods and beverages purchased from street vendors and other establishments where unhygienic conditions may be present.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt;

===Water===
Although safe bottled water is now widely available in most remote destinations, travelers can treat their own water if necessary, or as an extra precaution.&lt;ref name=SWOL-TD/&gt; 
Techniques include boiling, filtering, chemical treatment, and ultraviolet light; boiling is by far the most effective of these methods.&lt;ref&gt;https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/the-pre-travel-consultation/water-disinfection-for-travelers&lt;/ref&gt; Boiling rapidly kills all active bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Prolonged boiling is usually unnecessary; most microorganisms are killed within seconds at water temperature above 55–70&amp;nbsp;°C (130–160&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods: Requisite Scientific Parameters for Establishing the Equivalence of Alternative Methods of Pasteurization, USDA, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/dining/bending-the-rules-on-bacteria-and-food-safety.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908185621/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/dining/bending-the-rules-on-bacteria-and-food-safety.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=2017-09-08 |df= }}.

Chemical treatment with halogens—chlorine bleach, tincture of iodine, or commercial tablets—have low-to-moderate effectiveness against protozoa such as ''Giardia'', but work well against bacteria and viruses. 
UV light is effective against both viruses and cellular organisms, but only works in clear water, and it is ineffective unless manufacturer's instructions are carefully followed for maximum water depth/distance from UV source, and for dose/exposure time. Other claimed advantages include short treatment time, elimination of the need for boiling, no taste alteration, and decreased long-term cost compared with bottled water.  The effectiveness of UV devices is reduced when water is muddy or turbid; as UV is a type of light, any suspended particles create shadows that hide microorganisms from UV exposure.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultraviolet Light Disinfection in the Use of Individual Water Purification Devices''.

===Medications===
[[Bismuth subsalicylate]] four times daily reduces rates of traveler's diarrhea.&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Du2009/&gt; Though many travelers find a four-times-per-day regimen inconvenient, lower doses have not been shown to be effective.&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Du2009/&gt; Potential side effects include black tongue, black stools, nausea, constipation, and [[tinnitus|ringing in the ears]]. Bismuth subsalicylate should not be taken by those with [[aspirin]] allergy, kidney disease, or [[gout]], nor concurrently with certain antibiotics such as the [[quinolones]], and should not be taken continuously for more than three weeks.{{mcn|date=June 2017}}  Some countries do not recommend it due to the risk of rare but serious side effects.&lt;ref name=Du2009/&gt;

A [[colostrum#Hyperimmune colostrum|hyperimmune bovine colostrum]] to be taken by mouth is marketed in Australia for prevention of ETEC-induced TD.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt; --&gt; As yet, no studies show efficacy under actual travel conditions.&lt;ref name=AFP2015/&gt;

Though effective, antibiotics are not recommended for prevention of TD in most situations because of the risk of allergy or adverse reactions to the antibiotics, and because intake of preventive antibiotics may decrease effectiveness of such drugs should a serious infection develop subsequently. Antibiotics can also cause [[vaginal yeast infections]], or overgrowth of the bacterium ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'', leading to [[pseudomembranous colitis]] and its associated severe, unrelenting diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;Travelers' Diarrhea. [http://www.travdoc.com/articles/28.html The Travel Doctor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201035514/http://www.travdoc.com/articles/28.html |date=2011-02-01 }} Retrieved March 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotic may be warranted in special situations where benefits outweigh the above risks, such as immunocompromised travelers, chronic intestinal disorders, prior history of repeated disabling bouts of TD, or scenarios in which the onset of diarrhea might prove particularly troublesome. Options for prophylactic treatment include the quinolone antibiotics (such as [[ciprofloxacin]]), [[azithromycin]], and [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]], though the latter has proved less effective in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Adachi J, et al.

===Probiotics===
One 2007 review found that [[probiotics]] may be safe and effective for prevention of TD, while another review found no benefit.&lt;ref name=Gid2016/&gt; A 2009 review confirmed that more study is needed, as the evidence to date is mixed.&lt;ref name=Du2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DuPont|first1=HL|last2=Ericsson|first2=CD|last3=Farthing|first3=MJ|last4=Gorbach|first4=S|last5=Pickering|first5=LK|last6=Rombo|first6=L|last7=Steffen|first7=R|last8=Weinke|first8=T|title=Expert review of the evidence base for prevention of travelers' diarrhea.|journal=Journal of travel medicine|date=2009|volume=16|issue=3|pages=149–60|pmid=19538575|doi=10.1111/j.1708-8305.2008.00299.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Most cases of TD are mild and resolve in a few days without treatment, but severe or protracted cases may result in significant fluid loss and dangerous [[electrolyte disturbance|electrolytic imbalance]]. Dehydration due to diarrhea can also alter the effectiveness of medicinal and contraceptive drugs. Adequate fluid intake ([[oral rehydration therapy]]) is therefore a high priority. Commercial rehydration drinks&lt;ref&gt;Rehydration drinks.

===Antibiotics===
If diarrhea becomes severe (typically defined as three or more loose stools in an eight-hour period), especially if associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, or blood in stools, medical treatment should be sought. Such patients may benefit from antimicrobial therapy.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD"/&gt;  A 2000 literature review found that antibiotic treatment shortens the duration and severity of TD; most reported side effects were minor, or resolved on stopping the antibiotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Bruyn G, Hahn S, Borwick A | year = 2000 | title = Antibiotic treatment for travellers' diarrhoea | url = | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 3 | page = CD002242 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antimotility agents===
Antimotility drugs such as [[loperamide]] and [[diphenoxylate]] reduce the symptoms of diarrhea by slowing transit time in the gut.  They may be taken to slow the frequency of stools, but not enough to stop bowel movements completely, which delays expulsion of the causative organisms from the intestines.&lt;ref name="CDC_TD"/&gt; They should be avoided in patients with fever, bloody diarrhea, and possible inflammatory diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/gastroenterology/acute-diarrhea/Default.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030320/http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/gastroenterology/acute-diarrhea/Default.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse reactions may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hives or rash, and loss of appetite.&lt;ref&gt;Diphenoxylate package insert.

==Society and culture==
''Montezuma's revenge'' (var. ''Moctezuma's revenge'') is a colloquial term for traveler's diarrhea contracted in Mexico. The name refers to [[Moctezuma II]] (1466–1520), the [[Tlatoani]] (ruler) of the [[Aztec]] civilization who was [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|overthrown]] by the Spanish conquistador [[Hernán Cortés]] in the early 16th century, thereby bringing large portions of what is now Mexico and Central America under the rule of the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish crown]].

===Wilderness diarrhea===
{{Main article|Wilderness acquired diarrhea}}
[[Wilderness acquired diarrhea|Wilderness diarrhea]], also called wilderness-acquired diarrhea (WAD) or backcountry diarrhea, refers to diarrhea among backpackers, hikers, campers and other outdoor recreationalists in wilderness or backcountry situations, either at home or abroad.&lt;ref name="Zell1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zell SC |title=Epidemiology of Wilderness-acquired Diarrhea: Implications for Prevention and Treatment |journal=J Wilderness Med |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=241–9 |year=1992 |url=http://www.wemjournal.org/article/S0953-9859(92)71235-2/pdf |doi=10.1580/0953-9859-3.3.241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is caused by the same fecal microorganisms as other forms of traveler's diarrhea, usually bacterial or viral.  Since wilderness campsites seldom provide access to sanitation facilities, the infection risk is similar to that of any developing country.&lt;ref name="pmid16805145"/&gt;  Water treatment, good hygiene, and dish washing have all been shown to reduce the incidence of WAD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boulware|first1=DR|title=Medical risks of wilderness hiking|journal=American Journal of Medicine|date=2003|issue=March|pmid=12681456|volume=114|pages=288–93|doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(02)01494-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McIntosh|first1=SE|title=Medical Incidents and Evacuations on Wilderness Expeditions|journal=Wilderness and Environmental Medicine|date=2007|issue=Winter|pmid=18076301|doi=10.1580/07-WEME-OR-093R1.1|volume=18|pages=298–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tripartite language''', also called an '''ergative–accusative language''', is one that treats the agent of a [[transitive verb]], the patient of a transitive verb, and the single argument of an [[intransitive verb]] each in different ways.  This contrasts with [[nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] and [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] languages. If the language has [[morphological case]], the arguments are marked in this way:

* the ''agent'' of a transitive verb takes the [[ergative case]]
* the ''object'' of a transitive verb takes the [[accusative case]]
* the single argument of an intransitive verb takes the [[intransitive case]]

==Examples==
In this [[Nez Perce language|Nez Perce]] intransitive sentence, the intransitive argument has no suffix and the verb carries the third person agreement prefix ''hi-'':
:{|
|- 
| Hi-páayn-a || háama 
|-
| {{sc|3nom}}-arrive-{{sc|asp}} || man.{{sc|intr}} 
|-
|colspan=2|"The man arrived." &lt;ref name=Rude1986&gt;Rude, Noel. 1986. Topicality, transitivity, and the direct object in Nez Perce. ''International Journal of American Linguistics'' 52:124-153.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}}
|}
In a transitive sentence with two third person arguments, the agent is marked with ''-n(i)m'', the patient with ''-ne'', and the verb with the third person on third person transitive agreement marker ''pée-'':
:{|
|-
| Háama-nm || pée-'wi-ye || wewúkiye-ne
|-
| man-{{sc|erg}} || {{sc|3tr}}-shoot-{{sc|asp}} || elk-{{sc|acc}}
|-
|colspan=3|"The man shot the elk."&lt;ref name=Rude1986/&gt;{{rp|126}}
|}

The [[Ainu language|Ainu language of northern Japan]] also shows tripartite marking in its pronominal prefixes, with the first person ''Ku='' being the ergative form, ''=an'' being the intransitive form and ''=en='' being the accusative form. Ainu also shows the [[passive voice]] formation typical of nominative-accusative languages and the [[antipassive]] of ergative-absolutive languages. Like Nez Percé, the use of both the passive and antipassive is a trait of a tripartite language.

Tripartite languages are rare. Besides Native American Nez Perce, they include the Vakh dialects of the [[Khanty language]], [[Wangkumara language|Wangkumara]], [[Semelai language|Semelai]], and, in its singular pronouns, [[Kala Lagaw Ya language|Kalaw Lagaw Ya]]. [[Yazghulami language|Yazghulami]] is tripartite, but only in the past tense.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. M. W. Dixon|Dixon, R.M.W.]] (1994). ''Ergativity''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[constructed language]]s, especially [[engineered language]]s, use a tripartite case system or tripartite adposition system, notably the fictional [[Na'vi language]] featured in the 2009 movie [[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]].

'''Verbal language in dreams''' is the speech—most commonly in the form of a dialogue between the dreamer him/herself and other dream characters—which forms part of the overall (mostly imagistic) dream scenario. Historically, there have been abundant references to verbal language in dreams going back millennia.  Early in the twentieth century German [[psychiatrist]] [[Emil Kraepelin]] presented a large corpus of dream speech, almost all from his own dreams and virtually all deviant, without any pretense that this was representative of dream speech in general. The first systematic elicitation of verbal language in dreams from a large subject pool under methodological protocols was presented beginning in the early 1980s, along with detailed analyses as well as theoretical consideration of the implications for various dream models, from the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] approach to more recent theories.

==Dream language in history==
Traditionally, dreams have been defined predominantly in imagistic terms.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the German psychologist K.A. Scherner in his book ''Das Leben des  Traumes'' (1861, cited by Freud 1900/1953 ''The Interpretation of Dreams,'' in James Strachey ed. and trans. ''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud,'' vols 4-5, Hogarth Press, p. 84) states that the dreaming imagination is "without the power of conceptual speech [and therefore] obliged to paint what it says pictorially"; Funk and Wagnall's Standard Dictionary of the English Language of 1895 defined "to dream" as "to have a train of images or fantasies pass through the mind in sleep"; a recent edition of the ''Oxford Dictionary of Current English'' defines dream as a "vision, series of pictures or events presented to the sleeping person."&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent dream theories of the modern era from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychoanalytic model (1900) to the present have similarly placed emphasis of the visual aspects of dreams. Yet, even the earliest of written sources, such as the [[Hebrew Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 28: 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Odyssey]]&lt;ref&gt;Book 6&lt;/ref&gt; make clear that dreams need not be "[[silent movies]]"; they may be "[[talking pictures|talkies]]" incorporating a "sound track" abounding in verbal dialogues or monologues.&lt;ref&gt;Verbal language in dreams is distinct from the phenomenon of [[sleeptalking]], that is, actual articulation out loud during sleep. As reported from a series of experiments by Alan Arkin (''Sleeptalking: Psychology and Psychophysiology''; Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc., 1981), most sleeptalking occurs not during [[REM-sleep]] (the neurological periods of sleep most associated with vivid dreaming) but during non-REM sleep. Even of those sleeptalking episodes which do occur during REM sleep, only about half show any obviously discernible relation with the dream reports elicited from the subject when awakened immediately following the sleeptalking.&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey by Heynick of several books containing over 300 dreams, both genuine reports and dreams incorporated into works of fiction, showed that some three-quarters contained verbal dialogue or explicit reference to speech in the dream.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), p.26&lt;/ref&gt; As a specimen of a dream with dialogue as part of a famous work of fiction, Heynick cites the dream of Charles Swann, the main character in [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]'s ''[[Swann's Way]]'' (1913; italics added):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The painter remarked to Swann [the dreamer] ''that Napoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately after Odette. "They had obviously arranged it between them,"'' he added; ''"they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff, but they wouldn't say good-bye together, it might have looked odd. She is his mistress."'' The strange young man burst into tears. Swann endeavored to console him. ''"After all, she is quite right,"'' he said to the young man, drying his eyes for him and taking off his fez to make him feel more at ease. ''"I've advised her to do that myself a dozen times. Why be so distressed? He was obviously the man to understand her."''&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), p.26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1906 Kraepelin, a pioneer of the somatic approach to psychiatry and of the methodical classification of psychiatric disorders, published a 105-page monograph ''Über Sprachstörungen im Traume'' (On Speech Disorders in Dreams).&lt;ref&gt;Emil Kraepelin 1906 ''Über Sprachstörungen im Traume''; Engelmann Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; As the title suggests, Kraepelin's declared aim was to analyze only deviant specimens of speech from dreams. Specimens reflecting correct speech processes were excluded from his study. To this end, Kraepelin assembled in the course of twenty years 286 specimens, the vast majority drawn from his own dreams, with no pretense to nonselectivity. He apparently drew in large measure from [[hypnagogia|hypnagogic]] and occasionally [[hypnopompic]] dreamlets (experienced when falling asleep and waking up), which differ [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomologically]] from full-fledged dreams and are characterized by different neurological indices as well.

Kraepelin meticulously classified his collection of dreams according to the nature of the deviances from correct normal speech in wakefulness.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; Three-fifths of his specimens were grouped as disorders of word selection, including large numbers of neologisms (non-existing words, typically formed by combinations of existing words or their components); just over one-fifth as disorders of discourse (actaphasia, usually involving the incorrect choice of language dependency relations; and agrammatism, the faulty construction of complex sentences); and just under one fifth as disorders of thought. Although it was well known at the time that the speech of normal people in wakefulness is often fraught with errors,&lt;ref&gt;In 1895 Rudolf Meringer and [[Karl Mayer]] published ''Versprechen und Verlesen, eine psychologische-linguistische Studie'' (Slips of Speech and Reading, a Psychological-Linguistic Study) containing and analyzing over 8000 specimens of linguistic errors from normal people in waking life; this study is mentioned in Kraepelin's monograph.&lt;/ref&gt; Kraepelin prized his corpus of deviant dream speech for the profound nature of many of the errors they contained, different from the common slips of the tongue made by mentally healthy people in everyday life. He likened various specimens of his dream speech corpus to the speech in waking life of patients with dementia praecox (schizophrenia), speech confusion, and aphasia. Kraeplin saw his dream experiences as affording him (a normal person) first-hand insight into these pathological processes. He further speculated on neurological concomitants involving the activities and interaction of areas of the brain—the [[cerebral cortex]], [[Wernicke's area|Wernicke's coil]], [[Broca's area|Broca's coil]]—which are different from in normal wakefulness. Although several of Kraepelin's dream speech specimens are amenable to interpretation for their latent sexual significance,&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;  he had no interest in the psychoanalytic approach and made no reference to his contemporary Freud in any of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Kraepelin's full 1906 monograph is published in English translation in Heynick (1993), which also includes English translations of three relevant shorter pieces by Kraepelin's contemporaries Ernst Meumann, Friederich Hacker, and [[Alfred Hoche]]. In the mid-1980s a cache of Kraepelin's notations was discovered in Munich which showed that for two decades after the publication of his 1906 monograph he had continued to record specimens of his dream speech, an additional 391 in toto. These, too, were included in Heynick (1993), presented for the first time in their original German as well as in English translation along with Kraepelin's notes and an analysis and categorization by the author. Verbal material presented in print in dreams and read by the dreamer, a phenomen treated by Meumann and mentioned by Freud (1900) and Kraepelin (1906), is considered in Heynick (1993), pp. 52-62 and in Frank Heynick 1985 "Verbal behavior in dreams; neurobiological implications for LSP reading?," in A.K. Pugh &amp; J.M. Ulijn (eds.) ''Reading for Professional Purposes: Studies and Practices in Native and Foreign Languages''. Heinemann, pp.321-341.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1980s, therefore, no indices or standards existed that were representative of the verbal language component of the dreams of a large general population. But beginning in 1983, Heynick reported in a series of publications the results of two experiments designed to evaluate, first, the linguistic competence and, subsequently, the pragmatic competence of the dreamer in the dreaming state, using large subject pools drawn from the general population (in this case in the [[Netherlands]]) and following careful protocols designed to avoid selectivity and maximize accuracy of recall.

==Linguistic performance==
The term "linguistic performance," central to this experiment, derives from the transformational-generative (TG) revolution in linguistics in the second half of the twentieth century and the concomitant emergence of the field of formal psycholinguistics. The TG model of language generation assumes an ideal "linguistic competence" on the part of the speaker, theoretically enabling him or her to generate all the infinite number of well-formed sentences in the native language while generating none of the ill-formed sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 212-14&lt;/ref&gt; That in actual use, i.e., linguistic performance, the speaker is limited in, among other things, the complexity or elaboration of the sentences he or she can generate, and often produces utterances which are ill-formed, is due to the limitations of the various auxiliary psychological mechanisms at the speaker's disposal, such as limited short-term memory, perceptual limitations, and defective feedback, as well as to factors such as deliberate changes in structure in mid-sentence, and unconscious interference of the Freudian type.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Victoria A. Fromkin, ed., 1980 ''Errors in Linguistic Performance: Slips of the Tongue, Ear, Pen, and Hand'', Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the above has traditionally applied to the native speaker in the waking state. The experiment explored the linguistic performance of the native speaker in the dreaming state.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.223-45; Frank Heynick 1991 "Linguistic and literary creativity in dreams: a psychoanalytic and experimental approach," in J. Gackenbach (ed.) ''Dream Images'', pp.79-86, Baywood.&lt;/ref&gt;

78 Dutch subjects sleeping at home recorded on special forms following precise protocol instructions a total of 566 Dutch utterances directly recalled and transcribed from 566 dreams which had been in progress prior to alarm clock awakening in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 223-28&lt;/ref&gt; (For just over 80 percent of all awakenings, there was either no dream in progress at the time of awakening or no verbal material to be reported from the dream.) The subjects reported (as part of the questionnaire form) that 60 percent of the utterances were said by him or herself in the dream scenario; 40 percent by someone else, usually addressed to the dreamer.
 
Word-count analysis showed the utterances in the corpus to have a wide range of length, with a  mean utterance length of 7.5 words and a mean sentence length of 6.5 words. The declarative sentences in the corpus were analyzed for complexity (sentential elaboration) using in particular the number of subordinate clauses per unit as an index. The corpus when classed into three groups according to the education level of the subject-dreamers showed that those with most education had the highest sentential elaboration; those with the least, the lowest; with those with intermediate education scoring in between. (There were no standards available for absolute comparison with the sentential elaboration in spoken Dutch in waking life by the three education-level groups in the general population; however, the relative degree of sentential elaboration of the dream corpus of the three education-level groups accorded with the relative indices for written Dutch by the three educational-level groups, which were available for comparison.)&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.239-241&lt;/ref&gt;

72 of the 566 utterances were marked by their respective subjects (in response to one of the questions on the form) as deviating from wakeful usage, although analysis of the same specimens by two academic linguists deemed the large majority of those marked utterances to be fully acceptable Dutch. Fewer than 5 percent of all utterances clearly deviated from correct wakeful speech. These included semantic anomalies, faulty lexical substitutions, neologisms (word-blends), non-existent proper names, language mixing, and (in two instances) syntactic errors.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.225-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pragmatic competence==
The subjects in the above experiment were not asked to report the full dream scenario during which the utterances were made. Excluded, therefore, from the analysis was any consideration of "pragmatic competence," the "knowledge of condition and manner or appropriate use [of his or her linguistic ability] in conformity with various purposes,"&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky 1980 ''Rules and Representations''; Basil Blackwell p.224; Chomsky, the founder of TG linguistics viewed pragmatic competence as outside the scope of TG&lt;/ref&gt; which forms part of the broader field of language psychology (rather than formal psycholinguistics).
 
Dream utterances ''plus'' their dream scenario contexts were gathered in a second experiment,&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.254-259; Frank Heynick 1986 "The dream-scripter and the Freudian ego: pragmatic competence and superordinate and subordinate cognitive systems in sleep," ''Journal of Mind and Behavior'', 7 (2/3), pp.169-201&lt;/ref&gt; again following carefully defined protocols, this time using the telephone elicitation technique. (Volunteer subjects were awakened on random nights at random hours, on average no more than once a week.) 77 dream reports from 33 subjects were tape-recorded and transcribed. These contained 92 dream speech utterances elicited verbatim from the subjects immediately after provoked awakening (to minimize deterioration in memory recall) plus an additional 113 utterances (81 in direct verbatim form, 32 in indirect form) contained in the subsequent telling of the entire dream. 40 percent of the utterances were said by the dreamer; 60 percent by someone else in the dream scenario, usually addressed to the dreamer (a reversal of the proportions in the linguistic performance experiment).

Five scorers, working independently but achieving a high degree of interscorer reliability, rated the appropriateness of each of the 205 dreams utterances to their situational context in the dream. Averaged out (and rounded off), 67% of the utterances were deemed to be "entirely suitable to the narrative"; 20% "not entirely suitable"; 7% "largely unsuitable"; and 4% "entirely unsuitable."&lt;ref&gt;There can be no access by an outside observer to the utterances said or heard by the dreamer in the dream. As with all aspects of the dream, including the visual, the experimenter can base his or her findings only on the report given by the dreamer in the waking state. While discussing the obvious problem that subjects may inadvertently be correcting deviances when reporting their dream utterances even immediately after awakening, Heynick (1993), pp.232-234, points out that, unlike the visual and other aspects of dreams, verbal language in dreams has the advantage of easily being reported in the same modality (words) in which it was experienced and of being especially quantifiable.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, in the following dream all lines of dialogue were deemed by all scorers (in the first instance, by four or the five scorers) to be fully suitable to the narrative:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was sitting in the garden and reading old magazines. [...] My son [...] took a little girlfriend along, also about five, and she started looking through the magazines. And they were getting wet, since she had such a cold that her nose ran. And I said ''that she, your little girlfriend, should rinse her nose with the lotah'', that's a jug used in yoga [instead of a handkerchief]. I use it myself, too. So I let her do it, but because she was so small, it didn't go right, and she started to cry. And then she walked home. So I said to my little boy, ''"I'll go to her mother and tell her what happened, otherwise she'll think 'what a strange lady.'"'' [...] Then that girl came out again, and my son had already told her mother that I had tried to help her get rid of her cold with the lotah. I simply knew that he had said that, but I didn't hear him say that literally. Then I said to that girl ''"In the future, when you catch a cold, you should go to the doctor and have him write out a prescription for medicine."&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), p.258; as per the protocol, the last utterance ("In the future ... [etc.].") was elicited immediately after awakening; subsequently, the rest of the dream, including the other utterances, was elicited&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In general, the dreamer as (to continue the film metaphor) "script-writer" appears to have at his or her command not just a "story grammar" capable of generating a reasonably, though not always, coherent  overall scenario, but also the linguistic pragmatic competence to generate verbal dialogue which is usually, though again not always, appropriate to that scenario.

==Theoretical implications for dream models==
The abundance of verbal language in dreams—typically in the form of dialogue between the dreamer and other characters in the dream scenario—which generally shows a syntactic and lexical well-formedness comparable to speech in the waking state, and which in addition is, far more often than not, appropriate to the dream context, has, in Heynick's theoretical analysis, profound consequences for overall dream theories, past and present.

===Psychoanalytic model===
Freud's psychoanalytic model of the mind and, in particular, his theory of dream generation and its function posit the existence of two global modes of mental functioning. The primary process, characterized by such mechanisms as condensations, displacements, and reversals (and the absence of any sense of negation) is theoretically characteristic of the infantile mode of thinking. It is superseded in the course of ontogeny by the development of the conscious part of the mind, which in the older child and adult is governed by the secondary process, adhering to the rules of grammar and logic. The verbal language which the developing child acquires is for Freud by definition a secondary process. The primary process in psychoanalytic theory is however not banished from the mind, but is contained in the unconscious, where  it continues to characterize the mode of functioning of that part of the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 12-21&lt;/ref&gt;

The unconscious with its primary process mode—along with its repressed ideational content from early childhood, such as the Oedipus complex—provides, in Freud's theory, the driving force and initial input to dreams. Freud attributed the generation of a more or less coherent dream narrative to the process of "secondary revision," which might (he vacillated on this issue) be "a contribution on the part of waking thought to the construction of dreams" rather than part of the "dream work" proper. The dream-like features which one experiences in dreams, such as condensations, displacements (symbolism), and reversals, are the manifestations of the primary-process input to the dream generation process.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Heynick 1981 "Linguistic aspects of  Freud's dream model," ''International Review of Psycho-Analysis'', 8 (3), pp.299-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the dreams of Freud's own and those of his patients, which he provides in ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' and elsewhere, typically abound in verbal dialogue, which is always syntactically well-formed, often complex (containing subordinate clauses) and usually, though not always, semantically well-formed and appropriate to the context of the dream.

As an example, Heynick cites, among others, the "dream of Irma's injection, which Freud himself considered to be of central importance to the development of his dream theory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I said to Irma: ''"If you still get pains, it's really your own fault."'' She replied: ''"If you only knew what pains I've got in my throat and stomach and abdomen—it's choking me."'' [...] I at once ''called in'' Dr. M. [who] looked quite different from usual; he was very pale, he walked with a limp and his chin was clean shaven. [...] My friend Leopold was [...] saying, ''"She has a dull area down on the left."'' He also indicated that a portion of the skin of the left shoulder was infiltrated. (I noticed this, just as he did, in spite of her dress.) [...] M. said: ''"There's no doubt it's an infection, but no matter, dysentery will supervene and the toxin will be eliminated."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud 1900/1953 op cit., p.107)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Virtually all the deep personal significance which Freud in his analysis attributed to his Irma dream would be lost without the verbal dialogue. Yet the utterances are fully grammatical; they contain properly embedded and conjoined clauses, two conditional phrases, a future tense, and two instances of negation. All words are proper German (in the original). Semantically most of the dialogue appears appropriate to the overall scenario, except the last which is medically absurd.&lt;ref&gt;While the dialogue in all the dreams Freud presents are syntactically well formed and show a range of syntactic complexity, there are occasional instance of "primary process" interference on the lexical level, as in the case of the neologism (word blend) in the utterance ''"That's the breakfast-ship!"'' in his dream of the castle by the sea. These Freud analyzed, in the same manner as he did slips of the tongue in wakefulness in his ''Psychopathology of Everyday Life'' (1901) for their latent unconscious meanings. Heynick (1993), pp. 19-21, 47&lt;/ref&gt;

====Replay hypothesis====
Freud was apparently confronted with the enigma of how the generation of speech, a secondary process par excellence, could be functioning at such a apparently high level of adequacy during dreaming, the input and motive power of which involves a theoretically primary process. Freud attempted to resolve this problem by introducing his "replay hypothesis" (as Heynick terms it), according to which the dialogue in dreams is merely a repeating, in the same or similar words, of speech actually said or heard by the dreamer recently in waking life, usually on the day before the dream, only slightly modified (if at all) by the above-mentioned process of "secondary revision." This theoretical regression to an infantile mimicking of speech thus denied to the dreaming process proper any substantial language functioning or (in modern terms) linguistic competence.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 28-31; Frank Heynick 1985 "Dream dialogue and retrogression: neurobiological origins of Freud's 'replay hypothesis,'" ''Journal of the History of  the Behavioral Sciences'', 21 (4), pp.321-341.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a view to testing the validity of Freud's replay hypothesis, the subject-dreamers in the above-mentioned experiment on linguistic competence were asked with regard to each of their dream speech specimens whether they could recall having said the utterance prior to the dream in waking life in the same or similar words. The subjects deemed that to have been the case on the day before the dream for 8% of the utterances and for the week before the dream (including the day before the dream) for 14% of the utterances. Such low figures appear to invalidate Freud's replay hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 235-36&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neo-Freudian revisionism====
Although no neo-Freudians treat the phenomenon of dream speech per se, proposed revisions to the psychoanalytic model of the mind by theorists such as Gill, Holt and Noy,{{who|date=October 2012}} beginning in the late 1960s, variously included the redefining of the place of speech generation (in wakefulness, but this would also apply to speech during dreaming) whereby it would no longer necessarily be classified as a strictly secondary process.&lt;ref&gt;Merton M. Gill 1967 "The primary process," in Robert R, Holt, ed., ''Motives and Thoughts: Psychoanalytic Essays in Honor of David Rapaport''; International Universities Press, pp.260-298; Robert R. Holt 1967 "The development of the primary process: a structural view," ''Psychological Issues'', 5, p.345; Pinchas Noy  1969 "A revision of the psychoanalytic theory of the primary process," ''International Journal of Psycho-Analysis'' 50, pp. 155-178; Pinchas Noy 1979 "The psychoanalytic theory of cognitive development," ''Psychoanalytic Study of the Child'' 34, pp. 169-216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such revisions would, Heynick points out, potentially make the phenomenon of verbal language in dreams less anomalous in the psychoanalytic scheme, and without the need to resort, as Freud did, to the replay hypothesis as an "ad hoc" expedient.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp.259-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern models of dream generation===

====Activation-synthesis hypothesis====
The [[activation-synthesis hypothesis]] of dream generation first proposed by [[Harvard University]] [[psychiatrist]]s [[Allan Hobson|John Allan Hobson]] and [[Robert McCarley]] in the late 1970s drew upon the discovery earlier in the decade of the ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) impulses which during the nightly REM periods (the physiological stage of sleep which is most associated with the phenomenological experience of vivid dreaming) are fired off from the brain stem and travel to the visual areas of the cortex.&lt;ref&gt;J. Allan Hobson &amp; Robert McCarley  1977 "The brain as dream-state generator: an activation-synthesis hypothesis," ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' 134, pp. 1335-48&lt;/ref&gt;

In the visual area of the cortex, according to the model, the impulses call up largely at random a series of images (=activation). The dreamer's sleeping consciousness automatically tries to integrate these images into a more or less coherent story, while, for example, linking them with fragments of memory from the past (=synthesis). (Similar mechanisms involving the PGO impulses have been incorporated into other dream models, namely [[Francis Crick]] and Graeme Mitchison's [[reverse learning]] theory and Michael Jouvet's endogenous learning hypothesis.)&lt;ref&gt;Francis Crick &amp; Graeme Mitchison 1983 "The function of sleep," ''Nature'' 304, pp.111-114; Michel Jouvet 1999 ''The Paradox of Sleep: The Story of Dreaming'', MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The activation-synthesis hypothesis, although based on neurological data more advanced than was ever available to Freud, is reminiscent of Freud's psychoanalytic model in that the initial input to the process is primitive and chaotic, onto which some order in imposed by a cognitively more advanced process. But as for the psychological interpretation of dreams the authors of the activation-synthesis hypothesis are outspokenly anti-Freudian, in that in their model the initial input to the dreaming process (the PGO-impulses) are devoid of any depth-psychology significance, Oedipal or whatever. (If the dream acquires any significance relating to the dreamer's personality. history, and present circumstances, this occurs in the manner in which the more or less randomly evoked images are integrated into a story during the synthesis stage, analogous to what a subject may "see" in the random ink-blots of a Rorschach test.)&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 265-66&lt;/ref&gt;

Be this as it may, the activation-synthesis hypothesis with its overwhelming emphasis on visual areas of the cortex is silent as to how the extensive verbal language may be generated and integrated into the dream scenario. Heynick cites as ironic a specimen dream which Hobson presents as exemplary of production by the activation-synthesis model:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am in Willianstown, Massachusetts, talking to a colleague, Van, who is wearing a white shirt (he usually wears blue) open at the neck (he is normally necktied, and even collar-clipped) and khakis (he usually sports flannels). Casual. Van says, as if by the way, ''that he attended the committee meeting that has yesterday considered my candidacy for an invited lecture series.'' (I know from his tone that he is going to deliver bad news.) The committee has decided against it because ''"They don't feel that psychoanalysis should be confronted with laboratory data."
I allowed at how bad this idea was. ''"It's the wrong reason,"'' I said. ''"And their timing is off, because Adolf Grünbaum is just about to publish his important new book in which he insists that that is precisely what psychoanalysis must do."'' Van ignores this statement, appearing never to have heard of A.G.
[...]
We go out a door (which is on the corner of the building) to behold the beautiful Williams campus. A red-brick wall extends down a green lawn to the classic white Puritan buildings.
Van says, ''"They chose Mary"'' (or seems to say that) ''"reflecting their priorities to attract a speaker who might help them with their fund-raising efforts."'' ''"That's why you have such beautiful buildings," I note, "and why there is nothing in them."''&lt;ref&gt;J. Allan Hobson 1988 ''The Dreaming Brain'', Basic Books, pp.232-33; in Heynick (1993), pp. 266-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobson presents this specimen as an example of how dreams can sometimes reflect personal concerns—in this case relating to his academic squabbles with his colleagues due to his anti-psychoanalytic stance within the psychiatric profession. As Heynick points out, the personal significance in this dream is in fact derived almost exclusively from the verbal dialogue, without which the dream would lose all its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 266-268&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychoneirics model====
The psychoneirics (from Greek; psycho = mind + oneiros = dream) model of dream generation, formulated by Foulkes from the late 1970s onwards, is cited&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 275-77&lt;/ref&gt;  as an exemplary model (though not necessarily the only possible type of model) of how the generation of verbal language can be incorporated into the generation of the overall dream scenario. Patterned on the psycholinguistic model of speech production (in wakefulness), the psychoneirics model is basically non-neurological. It views dream generation in humans as, like speech in humans, a skillful cognitive act, in fact possibly drawing upon the selfsame cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;David Foulkes  1982 "A cognitive-psychological model of REM dream production," ''Sleep'' 5, pp. 169-187; David Foulkes 1985 ''Dreaming: A Cognitive-Psychological Approach'', Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The input to the dreaming process involves (not unlike the activation-synthesis hypothesis of dreaming) the diffuse activation of memory elements. Psychoneirics focuses on the midrange dream generation processes (regardless of whether or not the dream happens to include verbal dialogue) as involving "schematic selection" and "element activation," analogous to the syntactic frame (sentence structure) selection and word selection of psycholinguistic models. (The dream-like features of dreams, such as condensations (composite images) and anomalous narrative shifts, are seen as residual flux of the dream production mechanism, which is otherwise doing a reasonably good job of developing the initial input into a coherent narrative.) Under this theoretical assumption that the human dream-generation ability and speech-generation ability (in wakefulness) derive from similar cognitive capacities, the psychoneirics model can claim to seamlessly account for the generation of verbal dialogue within dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Foulkes is highly sceptical of the concept that dreams may contain useful information or serve as an adjunct in psychotherapy. Heynick points out that the components and mechanisms of the psychoneiric model, although quite different from the psychoanalytic, are nevertheless not necessarily incompatible with Freudian views on the value of dreams. Frank Heynick 1987, "Review of David Foulkes' ''Dreaming: A Cognitive-Psychological Approach''," ''International Review of Psycho-Analysis'', 14 (2), pp.279-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for psycholinguistics and language psychology==
The data presented in the above experiments is considered as having implications not just for the evaluation of the various existing models of dream generation, but also for models of speech generation in general, that is in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 280-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreaming is a state of consciousness different from the normal wakeful state. With regard to actions within the dream, dreaming consciousness is presumably characterized by a diminished capacity for deliberate intention on the part of the dreamer (including intention of what to say or, as scriptwriter, what to have other characters say) and a diminished attention to, or diminished ability to receive and monitor feedback from, the actions (including speech acts) as they are being carried out in the dream.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick (1993), pp. 216-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristics of dialogue in dreams indicate that despite the presumed diminished intention, attention and feedback on the part of the dreamer as speaker-listener and scriptwriter, the utterances generated, far more often than not, are semantically and syntactically well-formed and appropriate to the overall scenario. The implication is that the human capacity for language in general (that is, in everyday wakefulness) can largely rely on processes which, once they are triggered when the conditions match those required for their operation, can generate verbal utterances automatically, outside of awareness and without the need for intervention by the speaker except at points where some critical choice is made.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick's analysis of dream speech makes little reference to the neurological concomitants of the psycholinguistic processes operating in the dream state and how their functioning may differ neurologically from wakefulness. Mention is made of the reports by some researchers of a shift of dominant cortical activity in REM sleep to the minor ("right") hemisphere, involved in imagistic and creative thought, and away from the major ("left") hemisphere, known to be responsible for verbal and logical thinking—a shift which, if it indeed occurs, would predict a diminished linguistic capacity in dreaming. Heynick points sooner to the concepts in the Unified Model of sentence generation (Gary Dell &amp; Peter Reich 1980 "Towards a unified model of slips of the tongue," in V.A. Fromkin, ed., ''Errors In Linguistic Performance: Slips of the Tongue, Ear, Pen, and Hand'', Academic Press) and posits that the quasi-neurological "spreading activation" which in wakefulness allows for largely automated sentence generation, with occasional errors due to "leakage," is functioning on a more or less comparable level during dreaming in REM sleep; but that under the peculiar neurological circumstances of the hypnagogic state (when falling asleep) an excessive leakage in the system may tend to produce highly deviant verbal language of the kind Kraepelin reported in his 1906 monograph (Heynick 1993, pp. 228-231)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vernacular orientation''' refers to the status that a language is afforded by one of its [[mother-tongue]] speakers (Tiessen, 2003).  This status is exhibited through the [[sociolinguistic]] behaviours of a mother-tongue speaker.  A speaker who exhibits positive [[vernacular]] orientation is one who exhibits a preferred status for their mother tongue in such things as patterns of language use, language attitudes, [[social network]]s and even levels of [[language proficiency]].  Likewise, a speaker who exhibits negative vernacular orientation is one who exhibits a preferred status for a language other than their mother tongue in these areas of sociolinguistic behaviour.

An example of research into vernacular orientation as expressed in a community can be found at [http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/linguistics/theses/2003Tiessen.PDF].  This is a study on vernacular orientation in the [[Talysh people|Talysh]] community of the city of [[Sumgayit]] in the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] for the purpose of gaining a greater understanding of its causes.  Vernacular orientation is described in three areas of sociolinguistic behaviour: patterns of vernacular language use, vernacular language proficiency and frequency of vernacular-speaking individuals in social networks. Data was collected through personal interviews. The questionnaires for these interviews were developed using a qualitative-relational research approach. The description of vernacular orientation takes the form of a criteria-based typology of which an analysis of influential factors is ultimately made. This analysis of influential factors demonstrates the interaction between vernacular orientation as described in the typology and the contextual elements of the family, socio-economic dynamics and individual attitudes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12675">'''Welfare culture''' refers to the behavioral consequences of providing poverty relief (i.e., [[welfare]]) to low-income individuals. Welfare is considered a type of [[social protection]], which may come in the form of remittances, such as 'welfare checks', or subsidized services, such as free/reduced [[healthcare]], affordable housing, and more.  Pierson (2006) has acknowledged that, like [[poverty]], welfare creates behavioral ramifications, and that studies differ regarding whether welfare empowers individuals or breeds dependence on government aid. Pierson also acknowledges that the evidence of the behavioral effects of welfare varies across countries (such as [[Norway]], [[France]], [[Denmark]], and [[Germany]]), because different countries implement different systems of welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Pierson|title=Beyond the Welfare State?: The New Political Economy of Welfare|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press|year=2006|pages=75, 78, 88, 111–12, 168, &amp; 193|isbn=9780745635200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the debate over the impact of welfare traces back as far as the [[New Deal]], but it later became a more mainstream political controversy with the birth of modern welfare under President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]]. The term "welfare culture," however, was not coined until 1986, by [[Lawrence Mead]].

===Welfare in the United States===
[[Image:Welfare Benefits Payments Graph.gif|thumb|right|280px|Decline in welfare benefits since 1962. (in 2006 dollars) &lt;ref&gt;[http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/indicators08/apa.shtml#ftanf2 2008 Indicators of Welfare Dependence] Figure TANF 2.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Welfare may be used to refer to any government-based aid used to promote the well-being of its citizens. In recent decades, however, welfare has been restricted to refer to the [[Temporary Assistance to Needy Families]] program (TANF), which provides monthly stipends for indigent families that meet a specific array of criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Maria Cancian |author2=Robert H. Haveman |author3=Daniel R. Meyer |author4=Barbara Wolfe |date=December 2002 |title=Before and After TANF: the Economic Well-Being of Women Leaving Welfare |url=https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/177126/b-a-tanf.pdf |journal=Social Service Review |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=603–41 |doi=10.1086/342997 |jstor=342997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "welfare culture" uses the more broad interpretation of welfare, all government social programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence M. Mead|title=The New Paternalism: Supervisory Approaches to Poverty|location=Washington D.C.|publisher=The Brookings Institution|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars like David Ellwood and [[Lawrence Summers]] (1985) believe that the debate over welfare culture could be more accurate if each specific welfare program were examined individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David T. Ellwood |author2=Lawrence H. Summers|title=Poverty in America: is Welfare the Answer or the Problem|journal=NBER Working Paper Series 1771|year=1985|doi=10.3386/w1711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific programs include [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], Medicaid, [[unemployment benefits]], and [[disability benefits]].

===Evolution of the debate in the United States===
Kent R. Weaver argues that most scholars cite the [[Social Security Act]] of 1935 as the origin of the [[American welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kent R. Weaver|title=Ending Welfare as We Know It|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=The Brookings Institution|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; That reform enacted a wide expanse of services for the poor and financially stressed, including unemployment benefits, [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] (later replaced in by the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program under the [[Clinton administration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Lieberman|title=Shifting the Color Line: Race and the American Welfare State|location=Boston|publisher=Harvard UP|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;), retirement income stipends, subsidized housing, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;"Social Security Act of 1935. United States Statutes at Large.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as June Axinn and Mark J. Stern (2007) estimate that the Social Security Act of 1935 and the newly institutionalized programs accompanying the New Deal increased the capacity to find employment, avoid starvation, and secure some form of affordable housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=June Axinn|author2=Mark J. Stern|title=Social Welfare: A History of the American Response to Need|location=White Plains, NY|publisher=Longman Publishers|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, economist Robert Cohen (1973) estimated that the New Deal sparked a reduction in unemployment from 20% to 15% by the end of the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robert M. Cohen |title=Labor Force and Unemployment in the 1920's and 1930's: A Re-Examination Based on Postwar Experience |journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics |volume=55 |issue=1 |year=1973 |pages=46–55 |doi=10.2307/1927993 |jstor=1927993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Stanley Feldman and John Zaller (1992) cite a number of economists and political historians who opposed government-based aid, because such critics credit the economic stimulus during World War II as the true solution to the unemployment and poverty of the [[Great Depression]]. During the war, American industries began to produce military weapons, food, and other material needs for the troops. The new economic incentive, in addition to a net export and an influx in gold, reduced interest rates, increased investments, and sparked job growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stanley Feldman |author2=John Zaller |date=February 1992 |title=The Political Culture of Ambivalence: Ideological Responses to the Welfare State |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~dguber/POLS234/articles/feldman_zaller.pdf |journal=American Journal of Political Science |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=268–307 |doi=10.2307/2111433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christine Romber (1992) and various other economic historians began to criticize the New Deal as the cause for unnecessary and unjustified reliance on government programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Christina D. Romer|title=What Ended the Great Depression|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=52|issue=4|year=1992|pages=757–784|url=http://eml.berkeley.edu/~cromer/What%20Ended%20the%20Great%20Depression.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Jerold Rusk (2008), a political scientist, recognizes a consensus among economic, history, and political scholars, which acknowledges that the effects of the New Deal are difficult to separate from the effects of [[World War II]], which prevents any legitimate conclusion from being drawn on the debate.&lt;ref&gt;Jerold Rusk. Interview (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s, President Johnson began his [[War on Poverty]] by introducing many new elements to welfare, including Medicare, Medicaid, increases in subsidized public housing, and more.  David Frum (2002) believed such increases in government programs were counterproductive and found positive correlations between government aid and those who could not stay above the poverty line without such aid. Frum concluded that welfare bred dependence on the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Frum|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|location=New York|publisher=Basic Books|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During the Johnson administration, a sociologist, Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], published a study on the impacts of welfare on behavior during the 1960s. His report, ''[[The Negro Family: The Case for National Action]]'' (1965), is commonly referred to as the "Moynihan Report."

The Moynihan Report advocates for increased welfare for poor black families but that welfare does not empower the destitute to find solutions to their financial troubles. Moynihan stated, "The breakdown of the negro family has led to a startling increase in welfare dependency." Welfare, although helpful, was a reactive measure failing to address the true roots of poverty. Moynihan concluded that more proactive means to empower black families include the promotion of vocational training and a value in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=The Negro Family: The Case for National Action|year=1965|publisher=Office of Policy Planning and Research, United States Department of Labor|location=Washington D.C.|url=http://liberalarts.utexas.edu/coretexts/_files/resources/texts/1965%20Moynihan%20Report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's precedent for increasing welfare benefits hit its pinnacle in the late 1970s under President [[Jimmy Carter]]  when Temporary Assistance to Needy Family (TANF) recipients were receiving $238 a month, adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Average Monthly AFDC/T ANF Benefit per Recipient in Constant 2006 Dollars|year=2006|publisher=Department of Health and Human Resources|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/indicators08/apa.shtml#ftanf2|accessdate=November 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Census Bureau, a strong correlation with poverty reduction is noted, suggesting a link between welfare and empowerment. Poverty dropped from 23% of the population to 12% during the Johnson years. Poverty did not see an increase again until 1982 with 15% of Americans facing poverty, two years after welfare programs experienced serious cuts under President [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Number in Poverty and Poverty Rate: 1959 to 2008|year=2009|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the findings are not without their criticisms. According to the [[US Census Bureau]], poverty had already begun to decrease before Johnson passed the [[Equal Opportunity Act]]. Additionally, unemployment reached some of its lowest rates in history under President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] near the end of the 1950s. Before Eisenhower left office, unemployment was estimated to be less than 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=United States – Unemployment Rate (1890–2009)|year=2010|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, [[Lawrence Mead]] introduced a series of studies on welfare culture. Mead compared changes in income levels and welfare benefits across urban dwellers from the 1960s through the 1980s. Mead's studies suggest that over half of all welfare recipients will not need to stay on welfare for more than 10 years, but only 12% will be off welfare in less than 3 years. Mead concludes that welfare has demonstrated some proven effects for helping impoverished families meet their basic needs and find employment, thus acting as a tool for empowerment. However, Mead acknowledges that the welfare system can do better. Mead believes welfare culture could breed empowerment more effectively if mandatory participation in education/job training programs were required for welfare recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence M.

==Evidence of behavioral effects==
Anthropologist [[Oscar Lewis]] studied the behavioral effects of poverty on indigent Mexicans. He introduced the concept of the "[[culture of poverty]]" and 70 personality traits that he saw in the mentality of the impoverished, including helplessness, disdain for the government, lack of confidence, hopelessness, and a sense of futility that accompanies the search for employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eu43S2aVOMQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Oscar Lewis, Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty|location=New York|publisher=Basic Books|year=1959|isbn=9780465097050}}&lt;/ref&gt;
