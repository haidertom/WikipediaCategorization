'''Antonie Philips van Leeuwenhoek'''{{#tag:ref|The spelling of van Leeuwenhoek's name is exceptionally varied.

Raised in [[Delft]], [[Dutch Republic]], van Leeuwenhoek worked as a [[draper]] in his youth and founded his own shop in 1654. He became well recognized in municipal politics and developed an interest in lensmaking. In the 1670s, he started to explore [[microbial life]]  with his microscope.{{#tag:ref|Note that the existence of [[microscopic organism]]s (microbes, microorganisms) was predicted or hypothesized many centuries before they were first observed by van Leeuwenhoek.|group="note"}} This was one of the notable achievements of the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s–1720s).

Using single-lensed microscopes of his own design, van Leeuwenhoek was the first to experiment with [[microbes]], which he originally referred to as ''[[animalcules]]'' (from Latin ''animalculum'' = "tiny animal"). Through his experiments, he was the first to relatively determine their size. Most of the "animalcules" are now referred to as [[unicellular organism]]s, although he observed multicellular organisms in pond water. He was also the first to document [[microscopic scale|microscopic observations]] of [[muscle]] fibers, [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]], [[red blood cell]]s, [[crystal]]s in [[gouty tophus|gouty tophi]], and [[blood]] flow in [[capillary|capillaries]]. Although van Leeuwenhoek did not write any books, his discoveries came to light through correspondence with the [[Royal Society]], which published his letters.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Antony van Leeuwenhoek and his "Little animals"; being some account of the father of protozoology and bacteriology and his multifarious discoveries in these disciplines; (1932) (19122164704).jpg|thumb|van Leeuwenhoek's birth house in Delft, in the Netherlands, in 1926 before it was demolished]]

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was born in [[Delft]], [[Dutch Republic]], on 24 October 1632. On 4 November, he was baptized as ''Thonis''. His father, Philips Antonisz van Leeuwenhoek, was a basket maker who died when Antonie was only five years old. His mother, Margaretha (Bel van den Berch), came from a well-to-do brewer's family. She remarried Jacob Jansz Molijn, a painter. Antonie had four older sisters: Margriet, Geertruyt, Neeltje, and Catharina.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was around ten years old his step-father died. He attended school in [[Warmond]] for a short time before being sent to live in [[Benthuizen]] with his uncle, an attorney. &lt;!--and town clerk. Benthuizen was not a town, but a village. --&gt; At the age of 16 he became a bookkeeper's apprentice at a linen-draper's shop in Amsterdam,&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; which was owned by the Scot [[William Davidson of Curriehill|William Davidson]]. Van Leeuwenhoek left there after six years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lensonleeuwenhoek.net/biography.htm The curious observer. Events of the first half of van Leeuwenhoek's life]. Lens on Leeuwenhoek (1 September 2009). Retrieved 20 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huerta, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Leeuwenhoek married Barbara de Mey in July 1654, with whom he fathered one surviving daughter, Maria (four other children died in infancy). That same year he returned to Delft, where he would live and study for the rest of his life. He opened a draper's shop, which he ran throughout the 1650s. His wife died in 1666, and in 1671, Van Leeuwenhoek remarried to Cornelia Swalmius with whom he had no children.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 27–31.&lt;/ref&gt; His status in Delft had grown throughout the years. In 1660 he received a lucrative job as [[chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] for the assembly chamber of the Delft [[schepen|sheriffs]] in the [[City Hall (Delft)|city hall]], a position which he would hold for almost 40 years. In 1669 he was appointed as a [[land surveyor]] by the court of [[Holland]]; at some time he combined it with another municipal job, being the official "wine-gauger" of Delft and in charge of the city wine imports and taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 33–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The Geographer.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of man with scroll and compass, standing by sunlit window|''[[The Geographer]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]]]]

Van Leeuwenhoek was a contemporary of another famous Delft citizen, the painter [[Johannes Vermeer]], who was baptized just four days earlier. It has been suggested that he is the man portrayed in two Vermeer paintings of the late 1660s, ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' and ''[[The Geographer]]'', but others argue that there appears to be little physical similarity. Because they were both relatively important men in a city with only 24,000 inhabitants, it is likely that they were at least acquaintances; Van Leeuwenhoek acted as the [[executor]] of Vermeer's will after the painter died in 1675.&lt;ref&gt;Van Berkel, K. (24 February 1996). ''Vermeer, Van Leeuwenhoek en De Astronoom''. Vrij Nederland (Dutch magazine), p. 62–67.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|In ''[[A Short History of Nearly Everything]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;236) [[Bill Bryson]] alludes to rumors that Vermeer's mastery of light and perspective came from use of a [[camera obscura]] produced by Van Leeuwenhoek. This is one of the examples of the controversial [[Hockney–Falco thesis]], which claims that some of the [[Old Master]]s used optical aids to produce their masterpieces.|group="note"}}

==Microscopic study==
{{See also|Microscopic discovery of microorganisms}}
While running his draper shop, van Leeuwenhoek wanted to see the quality of the thread better than what was possible using the magnifying lenses of the time. He developed an interest in lensmaking, although few records exist of his early activity. Van Leeuwenhoek's interest in microscopes and a familiarity with glass processing led to one of the most significant, and simultaneously well-hidden, technical insights in the history of science.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

By placing the middle of a small rod of soda lime glass in a hot flame, van Leeuwenhoek could pull the hot section apart to create two long whiskers of glass. Then, by reinserting the end of one whisker into the flame, he could create a very small, high-quality glass sphere. These spheres became the lenses of his microscopes, with the smallest spheres providing the highest magnifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history-of-the-microscope.org/anton-van-leeuwenhoek-microscope-history.php|title=Anton van Leeuwenhoek – History of the compound microscope|last=|first=|date=|website=www.history-of-the-microscope.org|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition by the Royal Society===
After developing his method for creating powerful lenses and applying them to the study of the microscopic world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://atena.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=13349171&amp;search_terms=DTL184|title=Observationes microscopicae Antonii Lewenhoeck, circa particulas liquorum globosa et animalia|last=|first=|work=Acta Eruditorum|publisher=|year=1682|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;, van Leeuwenhoek introduced his work to his friend, the prominent Dutch physician [[Reinier de Graaf]]. When the [[Royal Society]] in London published the groundbreaking work of an Italian lensmaker in their journal ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', de Graaf wrote to the editor of the journal, [[Henry Oldenburg]], with a ringing endorsement of van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes which, he claimed, "far surpass those which we have hitherto seen". In response, in 1673 the society published a letter from van Leeuwenhoek that included his microscopic observations on mold, bees, and lice.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 37–41.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antoni van Leeuwenhoek letters to the Royal Society 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Page in a handwritten manuscript volume|A 1677 letter from van Leeuwenhoek to Oldenburg, with the latter's English translation behind, the full correspondence remains in the [[Royal Society]] Library]]

Van Leeuwenhoek's work fully captured the attention of the Royal Society, and he began corresponding regularly with the society regarding his observations. At first he had been reluctant to publicize his findings, regarding himself as a businessman with little scientific, artistic, or writing background, but de Graaf urged him to be more confident in his work.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time van Leeuwenhoek died in 1723, he had written some 190 letters to the Royal Society, detailing his findings in a wide variety of fields, centered on his work in microscopy. He only wrote letters in his own colloquial Dutch; he never published a proper scientific paper in Latin. He strongly preferred to work alone, distrusting the sincerity of those who offered their assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The letters were translated into Latin or English by Henry Oldenburg, who had learned Dutch for this very purpose. Despite the initial success of van Leeuwenhoek's relationship with the Royal Society, soon relations became severely strained. In 1676, his credibility was questioned when he sent the Royal Society a copy of his first observations of microscopic single-celled organisms. Previously, the existence of single-celled organisms was entirely unknown. Thus, even with his established reputation with the Royal Society as a reliable observer, his observations of microscopic life were initially met with some skepticism.&lt;ref name="NickLane_RS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/370/1666/20140344 |authorlink=Nick Lane |last=Lane |first=Nick |title=The Unseen World: Reflections on Leeuwenhoek (1677) 'Concerning Little Animal' |publisher=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 2015 Apr 19; 370(1666) |date=6 Mar 2015 |accessdate=16 Jan 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, in the face of van Leeuwenhoek's insistence, the Royal Society arranged for Alexander Petrie, minister to the English Reformed Church in Delft; Benedict Haan, at that time Lutheran minister at Delft; and Henrik Cordes, then Lutheran minister at the Hague, accompanied by [[Sir Robert Gordon, 3rd Baronet|Sir Robert Gordon]] and four others, to determine whether it was in fact van Leeuwenhoek's ability to observe and reason clearly, or perhaps, the Royal Society's theories of life that might require reform. Finally in 1677,&lt;ref&gt;Schierbeek, A.: "The Disbelief of the Royal Society." Measuring the Invisible World. London and New York: Abelard-Schuman, 1959. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; van Leeuwenhoek's observations were fully acknowledged by the Royal Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recall.archive.org/stream/antonyvanleeuwen00dobe/antonyvanleeuwen00dobe_djvu.txt Full text of "Antony van Leeuwenhoek and his "Little animals"; being some account of the father of protozoology and bacteriology and his multifarious discoveries in these disciplines;"].

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was elected to the Royal Society in February 1680 on the nomination of [[William Croone]], a then-prominent physician.{{#tag:ref|He was also nominated as a "corresponding member" of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1699, but there is no evidence that the nomination was accepted, nor that he was ever aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} Van Leeuwenhoek was "taken aback" by the nomination, which he considered a high honor, although he did not attend the induction ceremony in London, nor did he ever attend a Royal Society meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 46–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific fame===
By the end of the seventeenth century, van Leeuwenhoek had a virtual monopoly on microscopic study and discovery. His contemporary [[Robert Hooke]], an early microscope pioneer, bemoaned that the field had come to rest entirely on one man's shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; He was visited over the years by many notable individuals, such as the Russian Tsar [[Peter the Great]]. To the disappointment of his guests, van Leeuwenhoek refused to reveal the cutting-edge microscopes he relied on for his discoveries, instead showing visitors a collection of average-quality lenses.&lt;ref&gt;Dobell, pp. 54–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

An experienced businessman, van Leeuwenhoek believed that if his simple method for creating the critically important lens was revealed, the scientific community of his time would likely disregard or even forget his role in microscopy. He therefore allowed others to believe that he was laboriously spending most of his nights and free time grinding increasingly tiny lenses to use in microscopes, even though this belief conflicted both with his construction of hundreds of microscopes and his habit of building a new microscope whenever he chanced upon an interesting specimen that he wanted to preserve. He made about 200 microscopes with a different magnification.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Van Leeuwenhoek was visited by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[William III of England|William III of Orange]] and his wife, [[Mary II of England]], and the burgemeester (mayor) [[Joan Huydecoper II|Johan Huydecoper]] of Amsterdam, the latter being very interested in collecting and growing plants for the [[Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam]], and all gazed at the ''tiny creatures''. In 1698, van Leeuwenhoek was invited to visit the Tsar [[Peter the Great]] on his boat. On this occasion van Leeuwenhoek presented the Tsar an "eel-viewer", so Peter could study blood circulation whenever he wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Bill |last1=Mesler |first2=H.

==Techniques and discoveries==
[[File:Van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes by Henry Baker.jpg|thumb|alt=Schematic drawings|van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes by [[Henry Baker (naturalist)|Henry Baker]]]]

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek made more than 500 optical lenses. He also created at least 25 single-lens microscopes, of differing types, of which only nine have survived. These microscopes were made of silver or copper frames, holding hand-made lenses. Those that have survived are capable of magnification up to 275 times. It is suspected that van Leeuwenhoek possessed some microscopes that could magnify up to 500 times. Although he has been widely regarded as a dilettante or amateur, his scientific research was of remarkably high quality.&lt;ref name="BrianJFord_1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brian J. Ford|date=1992 |title=From Dilettante to Diligent Experimenter: a Reappraisal of Leeuwenhoek as microscopist and investigator |journal=Biology History |volume= 5 |issue=3 |url= http://www.brianjford.com/a-avl01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single-lens microscopes of van Leeuwenhoek were relatively small devices, the largest being about 5&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Anderson |first1=Douglas|title=Tiny Microscopes |url= http://lensonleeuwenhoek.net/content/tiny-microscopes |website=Lens on Leeuwenhoek |accessdate=3 March 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095106/http://lensonleeuwenhoek.net/content/tiny-microscopes |archivedate= 2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lens on Leeuwenhoek: [http://lensonleeuwenhoek.net/microscopes.htm How he made his tiny microscopes]. Lensonleeuwenhoek.net. Retrieved 15 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They are used by placing the lens very close in front of the eye, while looking in the direction of the sun. The other side of the microscope had a pin, where the sample was attached in order to stay close to the lens. There were also three screws to move the pin and the sample along three axes: one axis to change the focus, and the two other axes to navigate through the sample.

Van Leeuwenhoek maintained throughout his life that there are aspects of microscope construction "''which I only keep for myself''", in particular his most critical secret of how he made the lenses. For many years no-one was able to reconstruct van Leeuwenhoek's design techniques, however, in 1957, C.L.

Van Leeuwenhoek's main discoveries are:
* [[infusoria]] ([[protist]]s in modern [[zoology|zoological]] classification), in 1674
* [[bacteria]], (e.g., large [[Selenomonad]]s from the human mouth), in 1683 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Douglas |date= |title=Wrote Letter 39 of 1683-09-17 (AB 76) to Francis Aston |url=http://lensonleeuwenhoek.net/content/wrote-letter-39-1683-09-17-ab-76-francis-aston |work=Lens on Leeuwenhoek |location= |access-date=26 September 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820153516/http://lensonleeuwenhoek.net/content/wrote-letter-39-1683-09-17-ab-76-francis-aston |archivedate=20 August 2016 |quote= |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The "Lens on Leeuwenhoek" site, which is exhaustively researched and annotated, prints this letter in the original Dutch and in English translation, with the date 17 September 1683.

In 1687, van Leeuwenhoek reported his research on the [[coffee bean]]. He roasted the bean, cut it into slices and saw a spongy interior. The bean was pressed, and an oil appeared. He boiled the coffee with rain water twice and set it aside.&lt;ref&gt;9 May 1687, Missive 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Nicolaas Hartsoeker]], van Leeuwenhoek was interested in dried [[cochineal]], trying to find out if the [[dye]] came from a [[berry]] or an [[insect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Antoni van Leeuwenhoek |author2=Samuel Hoole |title=The Select Works of Antony van Leeuwenhoek, Containing His Microscopical Discoveries in Many of the Works of Nature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfIKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA213 |date=1800 |publisher=G.

==Legacy and recognition==
[[File:Memorial Antonie van Leeuwenhoek.jpg|thumb|Memorial of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in Oude Kerk (Delft)]]
[[File:Graf Leeuwenhoek.jpg|thumb|alt=Gravestone with Dutch inscription|Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is buried in the [[Oude Kerk (Delft)|Oude Kerk]] in [[Delft]].]]
[[File:E coli at 10000x, original.jpg|thumb|A cluster of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' [[bacteria]] magnified 10,000 times. In the early modern period, Leeuwenhoek's discovery and study of the [[microscopic scale|microscopic world]], like the Dutch discovery and mapping of largely unknown lands and skies, is considered one of the most notable achievements of the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s–1720s).]]

By the end of his life, van Leeuwenhoek had written approximately 560 letters to the Royal Society and other scientific institutions concerning his observations and discoveries. Even during the last weeks of his life, van Leeuwenhoek continued to send letters full of observations to London. The last few contained a precise description of his own illness. He suffered from a rare disease, an uncontrolled movement of the [[midriff]], which now is named ''[[van Leeuwenhoek's disease]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Life and work of Antoni van Leeuwenhoek of Delft in Holland; 1632–1723 (1980) Published by the Municipal Archives Delft, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He died at the age of 90, on 26 August 1723, and was buried four days later in the [[Oude Kerk (Delft)|Oude Kerk]] in Delft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Antoni |last=van Leeuwenhoek |title=On the circulation of the blood: Latin text of his 65th letter to the Royal Society, Sept. 7th, 1688 |year=1962 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill Hes &amp; De Graaf]] |page=28 |isbn=9789060040980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the British microscopist [[Brian J. Ford]] found that van Leeuwenhoek's original specimens had survived in the collections of the Royal Society of London. They were found to be of high quality, and all were well preserved.&lt;ref&gt;''Biology History'' vol 5(3), December 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Microscope'' vol 43(2) pp 47–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Spektrum der Wissenschaft'' pp 68–71, June 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Ford carried out observations with a range of single-lens microscopes, adding to our knowledge of van Leeuwenhoek's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brianjford.com/wavintr.htm |title=The discovery by Brian J Ford of Leeuwenhoek's original specimens, from the dawn of microscopy in the 16th century |publisher=Brianjford.com |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ford's opinion, Leeuwenhoek remained imperfectly understood, the popular view that his work was crude and undisciplined at odds with the evidence of conscientious and painstaking observation. He constructed rational and repeatable experimental procedures and was willing to oppose received opinion, such as [[spontaneous generation]], and he changed his mind in the light of evidence.&lt;ref name="BrianJFord_1992"/&gt;''

On his importance in the history of microbiology and science in general, the British biochemist [[Nick Lane]] wrote that he was "the first even to think of looking—certainly, the first with the power to see." His experiments were ingenious and he was "a scientist of the highest calibre", attacked by people who envied him or "scorned his unschooled origins", not helped by his secrecy about his methods.&lt;ref name="NickLane_RS"/&gt;

The Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital in Amsterdam, named after van Leeuwenhoek, is specialized in [[oncology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.avl.nl/ Antoni van Leeuwenhoek] (in Dutch). Retrieved 25 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a public poll in the Netherlands to determine the greatest [[Dutch people|Dutchman]] ("[[De Grootste Nederlander]]") named van Leeuwenhoek the 4th-greatest Dutchman of all time.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

On 24 October 2016, Google commemorated the 384th anniversary of van Leeuwenhoek's birth with a [[Google Doodle|Doodle]] that depicted his discovery of "little animals" or animalcules, now known as bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/4542058/antoni-van-leeuwenhoek-google-doodle/ New Google Doodle Celebrates Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, Inventor of Microbiology], Retrieved 24 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Leeuwenhoek Medal]], [[Leeuwenhoek Lecture]], [[Leeuwenhoek (crater)]], ''[[Leeuwenhoeckia]]'', ''[[Levenhookia]]'' (a genus in the family Stylidiaceae), and ''[[Leeuwenhoekiella]]'' (an aerobic bacterial genus) are named after him.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

arXiv was made possible by the low-bandwidth [[TeX]] file format, which allowed scientific papers to be easily transmitted over the [[Internet]] and rendered [[client-side]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=O'Connell|first1=Heath|title=Physicists Thriving with Paperless Publishing |date=2000 |arxiv=physics/0007040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1990, [[Joanne Cohn]] began emailing [[physics]] preprints to colleagues as TeX files, but the number of papers being sent soon filled mailboxes to capacity. [[Paul Ginsparg]] recognized the need for central storage, and in August 1991 he created a central [[Disciplinary repository|repository]] mailbox stored at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] which could be accessed from any computer. Additional modes of access were soon added: [[FTP]] in 1991, [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] in 1992, and the [[World Wide Web]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="dddmag2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ginsparg [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/35983 "The global-village pioneers"] ''[[Physics World]]'' October 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[e-print]] was quickly adopted to describe the articles.

It began as a physics archive, called the [[LANL]] preprint archive, but soon expanded to include astronomy, mathematics, computer science, [[quantitative biology]] and, most recently, statistics. Its original domain name was &lt;tt&gt;xxx.lanl.gov&lt;/tt&gt;. Due to LANL's lack of interest in the rapidly expanding technology, in 2001 Ginsparg changed institutions to [[Cornell University]] and changed the name of the repository to &lt;tt&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now hosted principally by Cornell, with eight [[mirror website|mirrors]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=arXiv mirror sites|url=https://arxiv.org/servers.html|publisher=arXiv|accessdate=September 25, 2014| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140810055824/http://arxiv.org/help/mirrors| archivedate= August 10, 2014 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its existence was one of the precipitating factors that led to the current movement in [[scientific publishing]] known as [[open access (publishing)|open access]]. [[Mathematician]]s and scientists regularly upload their papers to arXiv.org for worldwide access&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Glanz |title=The World of Science Becomes a Global Village; Archive Opens a New Realm of Research |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/01/science/world-science-becomes-global-village-archive-opens-new-realm-research.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 1, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes for reviews before they are published in [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal|journals]]. Ginsparg was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] in 2002 for his establishment of arXiv.

The annual budget for arXiv is approximately $826,000 for 2013 to 2017, funded jointly by Cornell University Library, the [[Simons Foundation]] (in both gift and challenge grant forms) and annual fee income from member institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://confluence.cornell.edu/download/attachments/127116484/arXiv+Business+Model.pdf |format=PDF |title=CORNELL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY ARXIV FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS FOR 2013-2017 |date=March 28, 2012 |website=Confluence.cornell.edu |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model arose in 2010, when Cornell sought to broaden the financial funding of the project by asking institutions to make annual voluntary contributions based on the amount of download usage by each institution. Each member institution pledges a five-year funding commitment to support arXiv. Based on institutional usage ranking, the annual fees are set in four tiers from $1,000 to $4,400. Cornell's goal is to raise at least $504,000 per year through membership fees generated by approximately 220 institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://confluence.cornell.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=340900096|title=arXiv Member Institutions (2018) - arXiv public wiki - Dashboard|website=confluence.cornell.edu|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Cornell University Library took overall administrative and financial responsibility for arXiv's operation and development.  Ginsparg was quoted in the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' as saying it "was supposed to be a three-hour tour, not a life sentence".&lt;ref name="CHE 2011"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-first-free-research-sharing-site-arxiv-turns-20/32778 | title=The First Free Research-Sharing Site, arXiv, Turns 20 With an Uncertain Future | work=Chronicle of Higher Education | date=August 10, 2011 | accessdate=August 12, 2011 | author=Fischman, Joah}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Ginsparg remains on the &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/help/scientific_ad_board arXiv Scientific Advisory Board] and on the [https://arxiv.org/new/physics.html arXiv Physics Advisory Committee]&lt;/span&gt;.

== Moderation process and endorsement ==
Although arXiv is not [[peer review]]ed, a collection of moderators for each area review the [[Electronic submission|submissions]]; they may recategorize any that are deemed off-topic,&lt;ref name="mckinney"&gt;{{citation|last=McKinney|first=Michelle|title=arXiv.org|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=25|issue=7|year=2011|pages=35–36|doi=10.1108/09504121111168622}}&lt;/ref&gt; or reject submissions that are not scientific papers. The lists of moderators for many sections of arXiv are publicly available,&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/corr/subjectclasses Computing Research Repository Subject Areas and Moderators]; [http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/categories/math Mathematics categories];
[https://arxiv.org/new/stat.html Statistics archive]; [https://arxiv.org/new/q-bio.html Quantitative Biology archive]; [https://arxiv.org/new/physics.html Physics archive]&lt;/ref&gt; but moderators for most of the physics sections remain unlisted.

Additionally, an "endorsement" system was introduced in 2004 as part of an effort to ensure content is relevant and of interest to current research in the specified disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=As we may read|last=Ginsparg|first=Paul|year=2006|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=26|issue=38|pages=9606–9608|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3161-06.2006|pmid=16988030}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the system, for categories that use it, an author must be endorsed by an established arXiv author before being allowed to submit papers to those categories. Endorsers are not asked to review the paper for errors, but to check whether the paper is appropriate for the intended subject area.&lt;ref name="mckinney" /&gt; New authors from recognized academic institutions generally receive automatic endorsement, which in practice means that they do not need to deal with the endorsement system at all.  However, the endorsement system has attracted criticism for allegedly restricting scientific inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|date=July 2005|volume=44|issue=7|pages=691–692|title=Preface to the Proceedings of Quantum Structures 2002|first1=Richard|last1=Greechie|first2=Sylvia|last2=Pulmannova|first3=Karl|last3=Svozil|doi=10.1007/s10773-005-7053-z|quote=The new endorsement system may contribute to an effective barrier, a digital divide|bibcode = 2005IJTP...44..691G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of the [[e-print]]s are also submitted to [[scientific journal|journals]] for publication, but some work, including some very influential papers, remain purely as e-prints and are never published in a peer-reviewed journal.  A well-known example of the latter is an outline of a proof of [[Thurston's geometrization conjecture]], including the [[Poincaré conjecture]] as a particular case, uploaded by [[Grigori Perelman]] in November 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications|eprint = math.DG/0211159|date=November 11, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perelman appears content to forgo the traditional peer-reviewed journal process, stating: "If anybody is interested in my way of solving the problem, it's all there {{bracket|on the arXiv}}{{spnd}}let them go and read about it".&lt;ref&gt;Nadejda Lobastova and Michael Hirst, [http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/maths-genius-living-in-poverty/2006/08/20/1156012411120.html "Maths genius living in poverty"], Sydney Morning Herald, August 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this non-traditional method of publication, other mathematicians recognized this work by offering the [[Fields Medal]] and [[Millennium Prize Problems|Clay Mathematics Millennium Prizes]] to Perelman, both of which he refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/01/AR2010070106247.html|title=Russian mathematician wins $1 million prize, but he appears to be happy with $0|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 2, 2010|first=Marc|last=Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Submission formats ==

Papers can be submitted in any of several formats, including [[LaTeX]], and [[PDF]] printed from a [[word processor]] other than TeX or LaTeX. The [[Electronic submission|submission]] is rejected by the arXiv software if generating the final PDF file fails, if any image file is too large, or if the total size of the submission is too large.  arXiv now allows one to store and modify an incomplete submission, and only finalize the submission when ready. The time stamp on the article is set when the submission is finalized.

== Access ==
The standard access route is through the arXiv.org website or one of several mirrors. Several other interfaces and access routes have also been created by other un-associated organisations. These include the [[University of California, Davis]]'s ''front'', a [[web portal]] that offers additional search functions and a more self-explanatory interface for arXiv.org, and is referred to by some mathematicians as (the) Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/ |title=Front for the arXiv |publisher=Front.math.ucdavis.edu |date=September 10, 2007 |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar function used to be offered by eprintweb.org, launched in September 2006 by the [[Institute of Physics]], and was switched off on June 30, 2014. Carnegie Mellon provides Table&lt;sup&gt;arXiv&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/eager/arxiv/ |title=Table&lt;sup&gt;arXiv&lt;/sup&gt;  |accessdate=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a search engine for tables extracted from arXiv publications.  [[Google Scholar]] and [[Live Search Academic]] (now defunct) can also be used to search for items in arXiv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Stevens (andy.stevens@iop.org) |url=http://eprintweb.org |title=eprintweb |publisher=eprintweb |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full text and author search engine for arXiv is provided by [[Scientillion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.scientillion.com/service/about |title=eprintweb |publisher=eprintweb |accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, researchers can select sub-fields and receive daily e-mailings or [[RSS feed]]s of all submissions in them.

== Copyright status of files ==
Files on arXiv can have a number of different copyright statuses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/help/license |title=arXiv License Information |publisher=Arxiv.org |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Some are [[public domain]], in which case they will have a statement saying so.
#Some are available under either the [[Creative Commons]] 3.0 [[Creative Commons licenses|Attribution-ShareAlike license]] or the Creative Commons 3.0 [[Creative Commons licenses|Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license]].
#Some are copyright to the publisher, but the author has the right to distribute them and has given arXiv a non-exclusive irrevocable license to distribute them.
#Most are copyright to the author, and arXiv has only a non-exclusive irrevocable license to distribute them.

== Controversy ==
While arXiv does contain some dubious e-prints, such as those claiming to refute famous theorems or proving famous conjectures such as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] using only high-school mathematics, they are "surprisingly rare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The training is geared to the special conditions and environments astronauts will be confronted with during launch, in space, and during landing. All phases of the flight&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=NASA, Space Science, and Western Europe|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9781137340931.0010|work=NASA in the World|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137340931|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; must be considered during training to ensure safety to, and functionality of the astronauts, as well as to ensure a successful completion of the mission. The [[List of Apollo astronauts|Apollo astronauts]] that walked on the [[Moon]] also received training for [https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/ap-geotrips.html geology fieldwork] on the [[Lunar surface]].

== Purpose of training ==

=== Launch and landing ===

The effects of launching and landing has various effects on astronauts, with the most significant effects that occur being [[space motion sickness]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heer|first=Martina|last2=Paloski|first2=William H.|date=2006-10-30|title=Space motion sickness: incidence, etiology, and countermeasures|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16935570|journal=Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic &amp; Clinical|volume=129|issue=1-2|pages=77–79|doi=10.1016/j.autneu.2006.07.014|issn=1566-0702|pmid=16935570}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[orthostatic intolerance]], and [[cardiovascular events]].

Space motion sickness is an event that can occur within minutes of being in changing gravity environments (i.e. from 1g on Earth prior to launch to more than 1g during launch, and then from microgravity in space to hypergravity during re-entry and again to 1g after landing). The symptoms range from drowsiness and headaches, to nausea and vomiting. There are three general categories of space motion sickness:

* Mild: One to several transient symptoms, no operational impact
* Moderate: Several symptoms of persistent nature, minimal operational impact
* Severe: Several symptoms of persistent nature, significant impact on performance

About three-fourths of astronauts experience  
space motion sickness, with effects rarely exceeding two days. There is a risk for post-flight motion sickness, however this is only significant following long-duration space missions.

Post-flight, following exposure to microgravity, the [[vestibular system]], located in the inner ear is disrupted because of the microgravity-induced unresponsiveness of the [[otolith]]s which are small calcareous concretions that sense body postures and are responsible for ensuring proper balance. In most cases, this leads to some postflight postural illusions.

Cardiovascular events represent important factors during the three phases of a space mission. They can be divided in:
* Pre-existing cardiovascular diseases: these are typically ''selected-out'' during astronaut selection, but if they are present in an astronaut they can worsen over the course of the spaceflight.
* Cardiovascular events and changes occurring during spaceflight: these are due to body fluids shift and redistribution, heart rhythm disturbances and decrease in maximal exercise capacity in the micro gravity environment. These effects can potentially lead the crew to be severely incapacitated upon return to a gravitational environment and thus unable to egress a spacecraft without assistance.
* Orthostatic intolerance leading to syncope during post-flight stand test.

=== On-orbit operations ===

{{further|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}

Astronauts are trained in preparation for the conditions of launch as well as the harsh environment of space. This training aims to prepare the crew for events falling under two broad categories: events relating to operation of the spacecraft (internal events), and events relating to the [[space environment]] (external events).

==== Internal events ====

[[File:Ozzythewise ColumbusModule 260212.jpg|thumb|right|An internal view of ESA's Columbus module training mockup, located at the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany. Astronauts must familiarize themselves with all the spacecraft components during their training.]]

During training, astronauts are familiarized with the engineering systems of the spacecraft including [[spacecraft propulsion]], [[spacecraft thermal control]], and [[life support system]]s. In addition to this, astronauts receive training in [[orbital mechanics]], scientific experimentation, [[earth observation]], and [[astronomy]]. This training is particularly important for missions when an astronaut will encounter multiple systems (for example on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS)). Training is performed in order to prepare astronauts for events that may pose a hazard to their health, the health of the crew, or the successful completion of the mission. These types of events may be: failure of a critical life support system, capsule depressurization, fire, and other life-threatening events.  In addition to the need to train for hazardous events, astronauts will also need to train to ensure the successful completion of their mission. This could be in the form of [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241286792_Preparing_for_space_-_EVA_training_at_the_European_Astronaut_Centre training for EVA], scientific experimentation, or [http://www.nastarcenter.com/aerospace-training/space/pilots-and-crew spacecraft piloting].

==== External events ====

External events refers more broadly to the ability to live and work in the extreme environment of space. This includes adaptation to microgravity (or [[weightlessness]]), isolation, confinement, and [[radiation]]. The difficulty associated with living and working in microgravity include [[spatial disorientation]], motion sickness, and [[vertigo]]. During long-duration missions, astronauts will often experience isolation and confinement. This has been known to limit performance of astronaut crews and hence training aims to prepare astronauts for such challenges.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;NASA. Long Duration Psychology. [online]. [Accessed 20 February 2012]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/long-duration/long.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term effects of radiation on crews is still largely unknown. However, it is theorized that astronauts on a trip to Mars will likely receive more than 1000x the radiation dosage of a typical person on earth.&lt;ref name ="Durante:2008"&gt;DURANTE, M and FA CUCINOTTA. 2008. Heavy Ion Carcinogenesis and Human Space Exploration. Nature Rev Cancer, 2 May, pp.465-472.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, present and future training must incorporate systems and processes for protecting astronauts against radiation.

=== Science experiments ===

Scientific experimentation has historically been an important element of human spaceflight, and is the primary focus of the International Space Station. Training on how to successfully carry out these experiments is an important part of astronaut training, as it maximizes the scientific return of the mission. Once on-orbit, communication between astronauts and scientists on the ground can be limited, and time is strictly apportioned between different mission activities. It is vital that astronauts are familiar with their assigned experiments in order to complete them in a timely manner, with as little intervention from the ground as possible.

For missions to the ISS, each astronaut is required to become proficient at one hundred or more experiments. During training, the scientists responsible for the experiments do not have direct contact with the astronauts who will be carrying them out. Instead, scientists instruct trainers who in turn prepare the astronauts for carrying out the experiment. Much of this training is done at the European Astronaut Center.

For human experiments, the scientists describe their experiments to the astronauts who then choose whether to participate on board the ISS. For these experiments, the astronauts will be tested before, during, and after the mission to establish a baseline and determine when the astronaut returned to the baseline.

== Training by region ==

=== United States ===

At NASA, following the selection phase, the so-called "AsCans" (Astronaut candidates) have to undergo up to two years of training/indoctrination period to become fully qualified astronauts. 
Initially, all AsCans must go through basic training to learn both technical and soft skills. There are 16 different technical courses in:

* Life support systems
* Orbital mechanics
* [[Payload (air and space craft)|Payload]] deployment
* Earth observations
* [[Space physiology]] and [[Space medicine|medicine]]

[[File:Nasa astronaut training at NBL.jpg|thumb|right|Astronauts train in the Neutral Buoyancy Facility at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas]]

[[File:Ozzythewise AstronautsJSC 260212.jpg|thumb|left|The Crew of STS-135 practices rendezvous and docking with the ISS in the Systems Engineering Simulator at the Johnson Space Center on June 28, 2011 in Houston, Texas.]]

AsCans initially go through Basic Training, where they are trained on [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]], and ISS systems, flight safety and operations, as well as land or water survival. Pilot AsCans will receive training on NASA's [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38 Trainer Jet]]. Furthermore, because modern space exploration is done by a consortium of different countries and is a very publicly visible area, astronauts received professional and cultural training, as well as language courses (specifically in [[Russian language|Russian]]).&lt;ref name="Seedhouse:2010"&gt;SEEDHOUSE, Erik. 2010. Prepare for Launch: The Astronaut Training Process. New York City, NY: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

Following completion of Basic Training candidates proceed to NASA's Advanced Training. AsCans are trained on life-sized models to get a feel of what they will be doing in space. This was done both through the use of the [[Shuttle Training Aircraft]] while it was still operational and is done through simulation mock-ups. The shuttle training aircraft was exclusively used by the commander and pilot astronauts for landing practices until the retirement of the Shuttle, while advanced simulation system facilities are used by all the candidates to learn how to work and successfully fulfill their tasks in the space environment. Simulators and EVA training facilities help candidates to best prepare their different mission operations. In particular, [[vacuum chamber]]s, [[parabolic flight]]s, and [[Neutral Buoyancy Simulator|neutral buoyancy facilities]] (NBF) allow candidates to get acclimated to the [[Micro-g environment|micro gravity]] environment, particularly for EVA. [[Virtual reality]] is also becoming increasingly used as a tool to immerse AsCans into the space environment.&lt;ref name="Seedhouse:2010" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="NASA:2004"&gt;NASA. 2004. Astronauts in Training. [online]. [Accessed 20 February 2012]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/F_Astronauts_in_Training.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The final phase is the Intensive Training. It starts at about three months prior to launch and serves to prepare the candidates specifically for the mission they have been assigned to. Flight-specific integrated simulations are designed to provide a dynamic testing ground for mission rules and flight procedures. The final Intensive Training joint crew/flight controller training is carried out in parallel with ''mission planning.'' This phase is where candidates will undergo mission specific operational training, as well as experience with their assigned experiments. Crew medical officer training is also included to effectively intervene with proactive and reactive actions in case of medical issues.&lt;ref name="Seedhouse:2010"/&gt;

=== Europe ===

Astronaut training in Europe is carried out by the [[European Astronaut Centre]] (EAC), headquartered in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]]. European training has three phases: Basic training, Advanced training, and Increment Specific Training.

[[File:Ozzythewise SoyuzCapsule 04032012.jpg|thumb|right|Soyuz capsule simulator located at the EAC in Cologne, Germany. ESA astronauts will simulate operations in the capsule at the EAC.]]

For all ESA selected astronauts, Basic Training begins at the EAC headquarters. This section of the training cycle has four separate training blocks that last 16 months. Astronauts will receive an orientation on the major spacefaring nations, their space agencies, and all major manned and unmanned space programs. Training in this phase also looks into applicable laws and policies of the space sector. Technical (including  engineering, [[astrodynamics]], propulsion, orbital mechanics, etc.) and scientific (including [[human physiology]], [[biology]], earth observation, and astronomy) basics are introduced, to ensure that all new astronauts have the required base level of knowledge. Training is done on ISS operations and facilities, including an introduction to all major operating systems on board the ISS that are required for its functionality as a manned space research laboratory. This phase also covers in-depth systems operations for all spacecraft that service the ISS (e.g. Soyuz, [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]], Automatic Transfer Vehicle ([[Automatic Transfer Vehicle|ATV]]), and the H-II Transfer Vehicle ([[H-II Transfer Vehicle|HTV]])), as well as ground control and launch facility training. This training phase also focuses on skills such as [[Robotics|robotic operations]], [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous and docking]], Russian language courses, human behavior and performance, and finally a [[Professional Association of Diving Instructors|PADI]] open water scuba diving course. This scuba course provides basic EVA training at ESA's NBF before moving onto the larger NASA training facility at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]].

Advanced Training includes a much more in-depth look into the ISS, including learning how to service and operate all systems. Enhanced science training is also implemented at this time to ensure all astronauts can perform science experiments on board the ISS. This phase takes around one year to complete and training is completed across the ISS partner network, no longer only at the EAC. It is only upon completion of this phase that astronauts are assignment to a spaceflight.

Increment-Specific Training starts only after an astronaut has been assigned to a flight. This phase lasts 18 months and prepares them for their role on their assigned mission. During this phase crew members as well as backup crews will train together. The crew tasks on the ISS are individually tailored, with consideration to the astronaut's particular experience and professional background. There are three different user levels for all on-board equipment (i.e. user level, operator level, and specialist level). A crew member can be a specialist on systems while also only being an operator or user on others, hence why the training program is individually tailored. Increment Specific Training also includes training to deal with off-nominal situations. Astronauts will also learn how to run the experiments that are specifically scheduled for their assigned missions.

=== Russia ===

[[Image:GCTC.jpg|thumb|right|The grounds of the Gagarin Cosmonauts Training Center]]

Training for [[cosmonaut]]s falls into three phases: General Space Training, Group Training, and Crew Training.&lt;ref name=RuSpace&gt;http://suzymchale.com/ruspace/training.html&lt;/ref&gt; General Space Training lasts about two years and consists of classes, survival training, and a final exam which determines whether a cosmonaut will be a test or research cosmonaut.  The next year is devoted to Group Training where cosmonauts specialize in the Soyuz or ISS as well as professional skills. The final phases, the Crew Training phase, lasts a year and a half and is dedicated to detailed vehicle operations procedures, ISS training, and [[English language]].

Training primarily takes place at the [[Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center]]. The center facilities have full size mockups of all major Soviet and Russian spacecraft including the ISS. As with the ISS astronauts, cosmonauts train in the USA, Germany, Japan, and [[Canada]] for specific training in the various ISS modules.

=== Japan ===

The Japanese human spaceflight program has historically focused on training astronauts for Space Shuttle missions. As such, training previously took place at NASA’s Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, and followed that of NASA astronauts and other international participants in the Space Shuttle program.

[[Image:Tsukuba Space Center-01.jpg|thumb|right|[[H-II rocket]] outside the Tsukuba Space Center where training of JAXA astronauts takes place]]

Since the development of domestic training facilities at the [[Tsukuba Space Center]], training has increasingly taken place in Japan. With Japan’s participation in the ISS, the training of Japanese astronauts follows a similar structure to that of other ISS partners. Astronauts carry out 1.5 years of Basic Training mainly at Tsukuba, followed by 1.5–2 years of Advanced Training at Tsukuba and ISS partner sites. Training for any international ISS astronauts involving the [[Kibo module]] will also be carried out at Tsukuba Space Center.&lt;ref name="JAXA:2011"&gt;JAXA. 2011. Basic Training for International Space Station Astronaut Candidates. [online]. [Accessed 25 February 2012]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;http://iss.jaxa.jp/astro/ascan/ascan01_e.html &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced Training is followed by Increment-Specific Training, which, along with any Kibo training, will be carried out at Tsukuba. EVA training for Kibo takes place in the Weightless Environment Test System (WETS). WETS is a Neutral Buoyancy Facility featuring a full-scale mock-up of the Kibo module on the ISS.&lt;ref name="JAXA:2012"&gt;JAXA. 2012. Tsukuba Space Center Overview. [online]. [Accessed 25 February 2012]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;http://www.jaxa.jp/about/centers/tksc/index_e.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Tsukuba Space Center also includes medical facilities for assessing suitability of candidates, an isolation chamber for simulating some of the mental and emotional stressors of long duration spaceflight, and a hypobaric chamber for training in hull breach or Life Support System failure scenarios resulting in a reduction or loss of air pressure.&lt;ref name="JAXA:2008"&gt;ESA. 2008. Cercasi.astronauti. [online]. [Accessed 20 February 2012]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;http://www.esa.int/esaKIDSit/SEMGY11YUFF_LifeinSpace_1.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===

Although official detail of the selection process for the [[Shenzhou program]] is not available, what is known is that candidates are chosen by the [[Chinese National Space Administration]] from the Chinese air force and must be between 25 and 30 years of age, with a minimum of 800 hours flying time, and a degree-level education. Candidates must be between 160&amp;nbsp;cm and 172&amp;nbsp;cm in height, and between 50&amp;nbsp;kg and 70&amp;nbsp;kg in weight.&lt;ref name="SinoDefense:2011"&gt;SINO DEFENSE. 2011. Chinese Astronaut Corps. [online]. [Accessed 25 February 2012]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinodefence.com/astronaut/astronaut-corps.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126222238/http://www.sinodefence.com/astronaut/astronaut-corps.asp |archivedate=2012-01-26 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For China's Shenzhou astronauts, training begins with a year-long program of education in the basics of spaceflight. During this period, candidates are also introduced to human physiology and psychology. The second phase of training, lasting nearly 3 years involves extensive training in piloting the [[Shenzhou (spacecraft)|Shenzhou vehicle]] in nominal and emergency modes. The third and final stage of training is mission specific training, and lasts approximately 10 months. During this phase of training, astronauts are trained in the high fidelity Shenzhou trainer, as well as the Neutral Buoyancy Facility located at the [[Astronaut Center of China]] (ACC), in [[Beijing]]. As well as time spent in the Neutral Buoyancy Facility (NBF), training for EVA takes place in a high vacuum, low temperature chamber that simulates the environmental conditions of space. At all stages of training, astronauts undergo physical conditioning, including time in a human centrifuge located at the ACC, and a program of micro gravity flights, carried out in Russia.&lt;ref name="Morring:2009"&gt;MORRING, F. 2009. Astronaut Training. Aviation Week and Space Technology, pp.48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===

The Indian human space flight program still awaits a formal go ahead. Once cleared the mission is expected to take two Indians in a Soyuz-type orbital vehicle into [[low earth orbit]]. The training for these astronauts should be based on the lessons learned from training India’s only [[Rakesh Sharma|Cosmonaut Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma]] (''See [[Salyut 7|Salyut-7 1984]]'') and through India’s international co-operation with NASA and Roscosmos. This would allow India to gain insights from their rich experiences in human spaceflight. There also lies a possibility that India may go proceed through its human spaceflight program individually, necessitating the Indian Space Research Organisation ([[Indian Space Research Organisation|ISRO]]) to develop its own training program. For astronaut training, India is deciding a place which is at a distance of 8 to 10 km from Kempegowda international airport. This land is under the ownership of ISRO. Astronaut training and biomedical engineering centers will be built on it. Though India’s first man mission training will take place in USA or in Russia, this place can be used for future training. Moreover, center will have chambers for radiation regulation, thermal cycling and centrifugal for the acceleration training. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/india-human-spaceflight-announcement.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Future training ==

=== Suborbital astronaut training ===

While it is likely that the first generation of non-government spaceflight astronauts will perform suborbital trajectories, currently some companies like [[Virgin Galactic]] and [[Xcor Aerospace]] are developing their own proprietary suborbital astronaut training programs, however the first official Suborbital Astronaut Training program of the 21st century was a joint effort between the two government agencies, the Ecuadorian Air Force and the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center&lt;ref name="FAE-ESAA ASA/T astronaut training:2005"&gt;Ecuadorian Air Force Official document on ASA/T program. &lt;http://www.exa.ec/bp8/FAE-ESAA.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; developed the ASA/T (Advanced Suborbital Astronaut Training) program with a duration up to 16 months, it started in 2005 and completed in 2007 focusing in command and research duties during short duration missions with suborbital trajectories up to 180 kilometers. This program had one Ecuadorian citizen graduate in 2007,&lt;ref name="FAE-ESAA ASA/T astronaut training:2007"&gt;Ecuadorian Air Force presented with ASA/T program completion brief. &lt;http://www.exa.ec/bp8/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FAE-ESAA ASA/T astronaut training:2008"&gt;Ecuadorian Air Force presented with space program brief. &lt;http://www.exa.ec/bp9/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IAF-EXA:2010"&gt;IAF EXA entry: Ecuadorian Space Agency. [online]. [Accessed October 1, 2015]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;http://www.iafastro.org/societes/ecuadorian-civilian-space-agency-exa/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; recently the [[Ecuadorian Space Agency]] has made a call&lt;ref name="EXA Call for astronaut training:2014"&gt;EXA call for astronaut candidates. [online]. [Accessed October 1, 2015]. &lt;http://www.exa.ec/bp61/index.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for a new class of ASA/T training candidates, accordingly to the EXA, they will focus on renting commercial suborbital vehicles in order to perform manned space research&lt;ref name="Ecuadorian manned space research"&gt;Ecuadorian Space Program Manned Space Research - 61th International Astronautical Congress 2010 - HUMAN SPACE ENDEAVOURS SYMPOSIUM (B3)Overview Session (Present and Near-Term Human Space Flight Programs) (1). &lt;https://www.academia.edu/771672/THE_ECUADORIAN_CIVILIAN_SPACE_PROGRAM_NEAR-FUTURE_MANNED_RESEARCH_MISSIONS_IN_A_LOW_COST_ENTRY_LEVEL_SPACE_PROGRAM&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Commercial astronaut|Commercial astronauts]]===

[[File:Ozzythewise HumanCentrifuge 04032012.jpg|thumb|right|Human centrifuge at DLR in Cologne, Germany used for human physiological tests. The high accelerations experienced during suborbital flights may necessitate testing or even training on human centrifuges to determine if participants are fit for space flight]]

Looking ahead, the emergence of commercial space tourism will necessitate new standards for flight participants that currently do not exist. These standards will be to ensure that medical screenings are done properly in order to ensure safe and successful flights. This type of medical screening will differ from space agency astronaut selection and training because the goal is not to fly the highest performing individual, but merely to ensure a safe flight for the passengers under the rigors of space travel. The main considerations for this type of travel will be:

* What type and extent of training is sufficient?
* Who will qualify space tourists as fit for travel?
* How will new regulations comply with existing medical boards?
* What selection-out criteria need to be employed to reduce dangers to space tourists?

Medical regulations for commercial space flight might mitigate commercial space company risk by selecting only those capable of passing standard medical criteria, as opposed to allowing anyone who can purchase a ticket to fly. The first generation of commercial space flight will likely be [[Suborbital flight|suborbital trajectories]] which invoke significant acceleration changes, causing cardiovascular and pulmonary issues. Because of this any future medical criteria for commercial spaceflight participants needs to focus specifically on the detrimental effects of rapidly changing gravitational levels, and which individuals will be capable of tolerating this.

[[Bioastronautics]] and [[Aeronomy|upper-atmospheric research]] have been conducted by [https://projectpossum.org/ Project PoSSUM] scientist-astronaut candidates since 2015. As of October 2018, the program has attracted members from 37 different countries and published research on mesospheric dynamics and human performance in space suits, microgravity, and post-landing environments. 

Current research on fitness training and strategies for commercial astronauts conducted by [https://www.astrowright.com/ Astrowright Spaceflight Consulting], the first commercial firm to offer dedicated fitness training for [[space tourists]], suggests that conventional fitness training is inadequate to support safe movement in [[microgravity]], and that training utilizing reduced points of stability should be emphasized.&lt;ref name="McGee B.W.:2012"&gt;MCGEE, B.W. et al. 2012. A Qualitative Assessment of Preflight Fitness Training Strategies and Methods [online]. [Accessed 29 May 2013].

=== Long-duration missions to the Moon, asteroids, or Mars ===

[[File:Astronaut during virtual reality training.jpg|thumb|left|Astronaut during virtual reality training]]

Astronauts for long term missions such as those to the [[Moon]], an [[asteroid]], or even to [[Mars]] need to carry out multiple tasks and duties, because on such missions the astronauts will need to function largely autonomously, and will need to be proficient in many different areas. For these types of missions, the training to prepare astronauts will likely include training as [[physician|doctors]], [[scientists]], engineers, [[technicians]], [[Aviator|pilots]], and [[geologists]]. In addition there will be a focus on the psychological aspects of long-duration missions where crew is largely isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kelly | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Kelly (astronaut) |  others = With Margaret Lazarus Dean | title = Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery | publisher = Alfred A. Knopf, a division of Penguin Random House | year = 2017 | page = 50 | isbn = 9781524731595 | quote = Unlike the early days of spaceflight, when piloting skill was what mattered, twenty-first-century astronauts are chosen for our ability to perform a lot of different jobs and to get along well with others, especially in stressful and cramped circumstances for long periods of time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently a six-month mission to the ISS requires up to five years of astronaut training. This level of training is to be expected and likely to be expanded upon for future space exploration missions. It may also include in-flight training aspects. It may be possible that the ISS will be used as a long-duration astronaut training facility in the future.

A powerful tool for astronaut training will be the continuing use of analog environments, including NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations ([[NEEMO|NOAA NEEMO]]), NASA's Desert Research and Technology Studies ([[Desert RATS]]), [[Envihab]] (planned), [[Flight Analog Research Unit]], Haughton-Mars Project ([[Haughton-Mars Project|HMP]]), or even the ISS (in-flight). In fact, at NEEMO a total of 15 mission astronauts (known as [[aquanauts]]) have been trained for future missions to asteroids.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz:2011"&gt;MOSKOWITZ, Clara. 2011. Astronauts Set to Become Aquanauts for Undersea 'Asteroid' Mission. [online]. [Accessed 26 February 2012]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;http://www.space.com/13007-nasa-astronauts-undersea-asteroid-mission.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The use of virtual reality will also continue to be used as a means of training astronauts in a cost effective manner, particularly for operations such as extra-vehicular activity ([[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]).
[[File:Robonaut2 onboard ISS.jpg|thumb|right|Robonaut2 onboard ISS]]
These missions are not completely independent without the presence of robots. This opens up a new avenue towards [[Human robot interaction|Human-Robot Interaction]] which has to be thoroughly understood and practised to develop a harmonious relationship between astronauts and robots. These robots would aid the astronauts from being their personal assistants to next generation of extreme environment explorers. Currently there is a robot on the ISS aiding the astronauts in their mammoth tasks with a human touch. Intercultural and human robot interaction training is the need of the hour for long duration missions.

Training also has to be evolved for [[moon landing]] to [[Manned mission to Mars]]. Factors like crew dynamics, crew size, and crew activities play a crucial role as these missions would last from 1 year to Moon to 3 years on Mars. The training required for such missions has to be versatile and easy to learn, adapt, and improvise.

A '''bathometer''' (also '''bathymeter''') is an [[Scientific instrument|instrument]] for measuring water depth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bathometer Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.nv.gov/programs/planning/dictionary/wwords-B.pdf Water Words Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously used mainly in [[Oceanography|oceanographical]] studies, but is rarely employed nowadays. The term originates from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''βαθύς'' (''bathys''), "deep" and ''μέτρον'' (''métron''), "measure".

When the [[sky]] is clear, the blue hour can be a colorful spectacle, with the [[diffuse sky radiation|indirect sunlight]] tinting the sky yellow, orange, [[Belt of Venus|red]], and [[Earth's shadow|blue]]. This effect is caused by the relative [[photon diffusion|diffusibility]] of shorter [[wavelengths]] (bluer rays) of [[visible light]] versus the longer wavelengths (redder rays).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} During the blue "hour", which typically lasts roughly 20 minutes (depending on [[latitude]]), red light passes through space while blue light is [[scattering|scattered]] in the atmosphere, and thus reaches Earth's surface.

Many artists value this period for the quality of the [[hard and soft light|soft light]]. Although the blue hour does not have an official definition, the blue color spectrum is most prominent when the Sun is between 4° and 8° below the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blue Hour – Magic Hour |url=https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/blue-hour.html |publisher=timeanddate.com |access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brainwashing''' (also known as '''mind control''', '''menticide''', '''coercive persuasion''',  '''thought control''', '''thought reform''', and '''re-education''') is the concept that the [[human mind]] can be altered or controlled by certain [[psychological]] techniques. Brainwashing is said to reduce its subject’s ability to [[think]] critically or independently,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Religion, Volume 2, Gyan Publishing House, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the introduction of new, unwanted thoughts and ideas into the subject’s mind,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary, Robert Jean Campbell, Oxford University Press, USA, 2004, page 403&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to change his or her attitudes, values, and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Psychology, Raymond J. Corsini, Psychology Press, 2002, page 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kowal, D. M. (2000). Brainwashing. In A. E. LOVE (Ed.), Encyclopedia of psychology, vol. 1 (pp. 463-464). American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/10516-173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The concept of brainwashing was originally developed in the 1950s to explain how the [[Chinese government]] appeared to make people cooperate with them. Advocates of the concept also looked at [[Nazi Germany]], at some criminal cases in the United States, and at the actions of [[Human trafficking|human traffickers]]. It was later applied by [[Margaret Singer]], [[Philip Zimbardo]] and some others in the [[anti-cult movement]] to explain conversions to some [[new religious movement]]s and other groups. This resulted in [[scientific]] and [[legal]] debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Stuart|title=Media Coverage of Unconventional Religion: Any "Good News" for Minority Faiths?|journal=Review of Religious Research|date=December 1997|volume=39|issue=2|pages=101–115|doi=10.2307/3512176|jstor=3512176}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Eileen Barker]], [[James Richardson (sociologist)|James Richardson]], and other scholars, as well as legal experts, rejecting at least the popular understanding of brainwashing.&lt;ref name="Melton"&gt;{{cite web |first=J.

Other views have been expressed by scholars including: [[Dick Anthony]], [[Robert Cialdini]], [[Stanley A. Deetz]], [[Michael J. Freeman]], [[Robert Jay Lifton]],  [[Joost Meerloo]], [[Daniel Romanovsky]], [[Kathleen Taylor (biologist)|Kathleen Taylor]], [[Louis Jolyon West]], and [[Benjamin Zablocki]]. The concept of brainwashing is sometimes involved in legal cases, especially regarding [[child custody]]; and is also a major theme in [[science fiction]] and in criticism of modern [[political]] and  [[corporate culture]].  Although the term appears in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) of the American Psychiatric Association&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/DSM-5|title=DSM-5|last=American Psychiatric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not accepted as [[scientific fact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Religious Movements: Challenge and Response|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bvem38QO9y0C|publisher = Routledge|date = 2012-12-06|isbn = 9781134636969|language = en|first = Frank|last = Usarski|page = 238|quote = ...there has been until now a lack of any convincing scientific evidence which can be applied in a generalised form to show that involvement in a New Religious Movement has any destructive consequences for the psyche of the individual concerned. ...

Thus, up to the time of writing, there has not been one single successful, legal conviction of the Scientology Church, even though this group has come to be regarded as the most dangerous of the new religious organisations. ... The fact that even long-term investigations have as yet failed to produce the desired results continues to be ignored.|editor-last = Cresswell|editor-first = Jamie|editor-last2 = Wilson|editor-first2 = Bryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese term ''xǐnăo'' (洗脑，literally "wash brain")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=worddict&amp;wdrst=0&amp;wdqb=%E6%B4%97%E8%85%A6|title=Word dictionary - 洗腦 - MDBG English to Chinese dictionary|work=mdbg.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; was originally used to describe the coercive [[persuasion]] used under the [[Maoist]] government in China, which aimed to transform "reactionary" people into "right-thinking" members of the new Chinese social system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Taylor |first= Kathleen |authorlink= Kathleen Taylor (biologist) |title= Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control |url= https://books.google.com/?id=D3tYeMLc4hQC |accessdate= 2010-07-02 |year= 2006 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-0-19-920478-6 |page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[pun]]ned on the [[Taoist]] custom of "cleansing/washing the heart/mind" (''xǐxīn''，洗心) before conducting ceremonies or entering holy places.&lt;ref&gt;'''Note:''' ''xīn'' can mean "heart", "mind" or "centre" depending on context. For example, {{lang|zh-Latn|[[:zh:心脏病|xīn zàng bìng]]}} means [[Cardiovascular disease]], but {{lang|zh-Latn|[[:zh:心理医生|xīn lǐ yī shēng]]}} means [[psychologist]], and {{lang|zh-Latn|[[:zh:市中心|shì zhōng xīn]]}} means [[Central business district]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records the earliest known English-language usage of the word "brainwashing" in an article by newspaperman [[Edward Hunter (U.S. journalist)|Edward Hunter]], in ''Miami News'', published on 24 September 1950. Hunter was an outspoken [[Anti-communism|anticommunist]] and was said to be a [[CIA]] agent working undercover as a journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marks |first=John |authorlink=John D.

It was the first printed use in any language of the term "brainwashing," Hunter, a CIA propaganda operator who worked under cover as a journalist, turned out a steady stream of books and articles on the subject.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hunter and others used the Chinese term to explain why, during the [[Korean War]] (1950-1953), some American [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) cooperated with their Chinese captors, even in a few cases defected to their side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Browning |title=Was Kidnapped Utah Teen Brainwashed? |work=[[Palm Beach Post]] |location=Palm Beach |issn=1528-5758 |date=2003-03-14 |quote=During the Korean War, captured American soldiers were subjected to prolonged interrogations and harangues by their captors, who often worked in relays and used the "good-cop, bad-cop" approach, alternating a brutal interrogator with a gentle one.

The Chinese and Koreans were making valiant attempts to convert the captives to the communist way of thought.}}&lt;/ref&gt; British radio operator [[Robert W.

The U.S. military and government laid charges of brainwashing in an effort to undermine  confessions made by POWs to war crimes, including [[Allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War|biological warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Endicott and Edward Hagerman, ''The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets From the Early Cold War'' (Indiana University Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; After Chinese radio broadcasts claimed to quote [[Frank Schwable]], Chief of Staff of the [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing|First Marine Air Wing]] admitting to participating in germ warfare, United Nations commander Gen. [[Mark W. Clark]] asserted:&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/02/24/93602632.pdf "Clark Denounces Germ War Charges", 24 February 1953], accessed 16 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Whether these statements ever passed the lips of these unfortunate men is doubtful. If they did, however, too familiar are the mind-annihilating methods of these Communists in extorting whatever words they want .... The men themselves are not to blame, and they have my deepest sympathy for having been used in this abominable way.''

Beginning in 1953, [[Robert Jay Lifton]] interviewed American servicemen who had been POWs during the [[Korean War]] as well as priests, students, and teachers who had been held in prison in China after 1951. In addition to interviews with 25 Americans and Europeans, Lifton interviewed 15 Chinese citizens who had fled after having been subjected to indoctrination in Chinese universities. (Lifton's 1961 book ''[[Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of "Brainwashing" in China]]'', was based on this research.)&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Wilkes ''Knowledge in Minds'', p. 323, Psychology Press, 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-86377-439-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Lifton found that when the  POWs returned to the United States their thinking soon returned to normal, contrary to the popular image of "brainwashing."&lt;ref name="Home_by_Ship"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Home by Ship: Reaction Patterns of American Prisoners of War Repatriated from North Korea |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |date=April 1954 |first=Robert J. |last=Lifton |volume=110 |issue=10 |pages=732–739 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/110/10/732 |accessdate=2008-03-30 |pmid=13138750 |doi=10.1176/ajp.110.10.732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, after reexamining the concept of brainwashing following the Korean War, the U.S. Army published a report entitled ''Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War'', which called brainwashing a "popular misconception".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = U.S Department of the Army | authorlink = | title = Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War. |publisher =U.S Gov't Printing Office | series = | volume = | edition =Pamphlet number 30-101 | date =15 May 1956 | location = | pages = 17 &amp; 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report states "exhaustive research of several government agencies failed to reveal even one conclusively documented case of 'brainwashing' of an American prisoner of war in Korea."&lt;ref name="CommunistInterogation51"&gt;{{Harv|Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War|1956|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[George Orwell]]'s 1949 [[dystopian]] novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' the main character is subjected to imprisonment, isolation, and torture in order to conform his thoughts and emotions to the wishes of the rulers of Orwell's fictional future [[totalitarian]] society. Orwell's vision influenced Hunter and is still reflected in the popular understanding of the concept of brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;Psychiatry and Public Affairs, Leo H. Bartemeier, Aldine Transaction, Aug 1, 2011, page 246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements'', Peter Clarke, Reader in Modern History and Fellow Peter Clarke, Routledge, Mar 1, 2004, page 76&lt;/ref&gt;  Written about the same time, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]’s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' also addressed brainwashing, although in a [[fantasy]] setting.&lt;ref&gt;The Return of Christian Humanism: Chesterton, Eliot, Tolkien, and the Romance of History, Lee Oser, University of Missouri Press, 2007, page 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.R.R.

Drout editor, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2007, page 251&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[science fiction]] stories of [[Cordwainer Smith]] (written from the 1940s until his death in 1966) depict brainwashing to remove memories of traumatic events as a normal and benign part of future medical practice.&lt;ref&gt;Gary K. Wolfe and Carol T. Williams, “The Majesty of Kindness: The Dialectic of Cordwainer Smith”, Voices for the Future: Essays on Major Science Fiction Writers, Volume 3, Thomas D. Clareson editor, Popular Press, 1983, pages 53-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s many American films were filmed that featured brainwashing of POWs, including ''[[The Rack (film)|The Rack]]'', ''[[The Bamboo Prison]]'', ''[[Toward the Unknown]]'', and ''[[The Fearmakers]]''. ''[[Forbidden Area]]'' told the story of Soviet secret agents who had been brainwashed through [[classical conditioning]] by their own government so they wouldn't reveal their identities. In 1962 ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (based on the 1959 novel by [[Richard Condon]]) "put brainwashing front and center" by featuring a plot by the Soviet government to take over the United States by use of a brainwashed presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;''Screen Enemies of the American Way: Political Paranoia About Nazis, Communists, Saboteurs, Terrorists and Body Snatching Aliens in Film and Television'', Fraser A.

Feeley, Edward L. Rubin, Cambridge University Press, 28 March 2000, page 268.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Manchurian Candidate'' the head brainwasher is Dr. Yen Lo, of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Pavlov Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Asian Diaspora and East-West Modernity, Sheng-mei Ma, Purdue University Press, 2012, page 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mind control remains an important theme in [[science fiction]]. Terry O'Brien comments: "Mind control is such a powerful image that if [[hypnotism]] did not exist, then something similar would have to have been invented: the plot device is too useful for any writer to ignore. The fear of mind control is equally as powerful an image."&lt;ref&gt;Terry O'Brien in ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders, Volume 1'', Gary Westfahl editor, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; A subgenre is ''corporate mind control'', in which a future society is run by one or more business [[corporations]] that dominate society using [[advertising]] and [[mass media]] to control the population's thoughts and feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Per Schelde, ''Androids, Humanoids, and Other Science Fiction Monsters: Science and Soul in Science Fiction Films'', NYU Press, 1 July 1994, pages 169-175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal and civil cases==
In 1974, [[Patty Hearst]], a member of the wealthy [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst family]], was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] by a left-wing group calling itself the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. After several weeks of captivity she agreed to join the group and took part in their activities.  In 1975, she was arrested and charged with bank robbery and use of a gun in committing a felony.  Her attorney, [[F. Lee Bailey]] argued in her trial  that she should not be held responsible for her actions since her treatment by her captors was the equivalent of the brainwashing of Korean War POWs. (See: [[diminished responsibility]].)  Hearst was found guilty, but her “brainwashing defense” brought the topic to renewed public attention in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Regulating Religion: Case Studies from Around the Globe, James T. Richardson, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, Dec 6, 2012, page 518&lt;/ref&gt; as did the 1969 to 1971 case of [[Charles Manson]], who was said to have brainwashed his followers to commit murder and other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''Minds on Trial: Great Cases in Law and Psychology'', by Charles Patrick Ewing, Joseph T. McCann pp. 34–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shifting the Blame: How Victimization Became a Criminal Defense, Saundra Davis Westervelt, Rutgers University Press, 1998. page 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey developed his case in conjunction with psychiatrist [[Louis Jolyon West]] and psychologist [[Margaret Singer]].  They had both studied the experiences of  Korean War POWs. In 1996 Singer published her theories in her best-selling book ''[[Cults in Our Midst]]''.&lt;ref name="refocus.org"&gt;[http://www.refocus.org/singerne.html ''Cults in Our Midst: The Continuing Fight Against Their Hidden Menace''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202034934/http://www.refocus.org/singerne.html |date=2 February 2015 }}, Margaret Thaler Singer, Jossey-Bass, publisher, April 2003, {{ISBN|0-7879-6741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "clarke"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DouBAgAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements|isbn=9781134499700|last1=Clarke|first1=Peter|last2=Clarke|first2=Reader in Modern History Fellow Peter|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/09/us/louis-j-west-74-psychiatrist-who-studied-extremes-dies.html|title=Louis J.

[[Italy]] has had controversy over the concept of ''[[plagio]]'', a crime consisting in an absolute psychological—and eventually physical—domination of a person. The effect is said to be the annihilation of the subject's [[freedom]] and [[self-determination]] and the consequent negation of his or her [[personality]]. The crime of plagio has rarely been prosecuted in Italy, and only one person was ever convicted. In 1981, an Italian court found that the concept is imprecise, lacks coherence, and is liable to arbitrary application.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Usai “Profili penali dei condizionamenti mentali, Milano, 1996 {{ISBN|88-14-06071-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the twenty-first century, the concept of brainwashing was being applied "with some success" in  [[child custody]] and [[child sexual abuse]] cases.

Conformity, compliance, persuasion, dissonance, reactance, guilt and fear arousal, modeling and identification are some of the staple social influence ingredients well studied in psychological experiments and field studies. In some combinations, they create a powerful crucible of extreme mental and behavioral [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] when synthesized with several other real-world factors, such as charismatic, authoritarian leaders, dominant ideologies, social isolation, physical debilitation, induced phobias, and extreme threats or promised rewards that are typically deceptively orchestrated, over an extended time period in settings where they are applied intensively. A body of social science evidence shows that when systematically practiced by state-sanctioned police, military or destructive cults, mind control can induce false confessions, create converts who willingly torture or kill 'invented enemies,' and engage indoctrinated members to work tirelessly, give up their money—and even their lives—for 'the cause.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he suggested that any human being is susceptible to such manipulation.&lt;ref name="Zimbardo 1997 14"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zimbardo |first=P |authorlink=Philip Zimbardo |url= http://www.csj.org/studyindex/studycult/study_zimbar.htm |page=14 |title=What messages are behind today's cults? |journal=Monitor on Psychology |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another adherent to this view, Jean-Marie Abgrall was heavily criticized by forensic psychologist Dick Anthony for employing a [[pseudo-scientific]] approach and lacking any evidence that anyone's [[worldview]] was substantially changed by these coercive methods.

People were free to leave, and leave they did. Barker’s extensive enumerations showed that among the recruits who went so far as to attend two-day retreats (claimed to beMoonie’s most effective means of "brainwashing"), fewer than 25% joined the group for more than a week and only 5% remained full-time members one year later. And, of course, most contacts dropped out before attending a retreat. Of all those who visited a Moonie centre at least once, not one in two-hundred remained in the movement two years later.

{{Main article|APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control}}
In 1983, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) asked Singer to chair a [[taskforce]] called the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC) to investigate whether brainwashing or coercive persuasion did indeed play a role in recruitment by NRMs.
&lt;ref&gt;

''Cults and [[large group awareness training]]s have generated considerable controversy because of their widespread use of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control. These techniques can compromise individual freedom, and their use has resulted in serious harm to thousands of individuals and families. This report reviews the literature on this subject, proposes a new way of conceptualizing influence techniques, explores the ethical ramifications of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control, and makes recommendations addressing the problems described in the report.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 11 May 1987, the APA's Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC report because the report "lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur", and concluded that "after much consideration, BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/APA.htm |title=Memorandum |accessdate=2008-11-18 |author=American Psychological Association Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) |date=1987-05-11 |work=CESNUR: APA Memo of 1987 with Enclosures |publisher=CESNUR Center for Studies on New Religion |quote=BSERP thanks the Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control for its service but is unable to accept the report of the Task Force.

[[Joost Meerloo]], a Dutch psychiatrist, was an early proponent of the concept of brainwashing. ("Menticide" is a [[neologism]] coined by him meaning: "killing of the mind.") Meerloo's view was influenced by his experiences during the German occupation of his country and his work with the Dutch government and the American military in the [[interrogation]] of accused [[Nazi war criminals]]. He later emigrated to the United States and taught at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Propaganda Studies, Jonathan Auerbach, Russ Castronovo, Oxford University Press, 2014, page 114&lt;/ref&gt; His best-selling 1956 book, ''The Rape of the Mind'', concludes by saying: 
:''The modern techniques of brainwashing and menticide—those perversions of psychology—can bring almost any man into submission and surrender. Many of the victims of thought control, brainwashing, and menticide that we have talked about were strong men whose minds and wills were broken and degraded. But although the totalitarians use their knowledge of the mind for vicious and unscrupulous purposes, our democratic society can and must use its knowledge to help man to grow, to guard his freedom, and to understand himself.'' &lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite web |author= [[Joost Meerloo|Meerloo, Joost]] |url=http://www.lermanet.com/scientology/mc-ch1.html |title=''The Rape of the Mind: The Psychology of Thought Control, Menticide, and Brainwashing'' |year=1956 |publisher=World Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have said that modern [[business corporation]]s practice mind control to create a work force that shares common values and culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring Leadership: Individual, Organizational, and Societal Perspectives'', Richard Bolden, Beverley Hawkins, Jonathan Gosling, Scott Taylor, Oxford University Press, 30 June 2011, page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have linked "corporate brainwashing" with [[globalization]], saying that corporations are attempting to create a worldwide [[Cultural homogenization|monocultural]] network of producers, consumers, and managers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise of the Anti-corporate Movement: Corporations and the People who Hate Them'', Evan Osborne, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Modern educational systems have also been criticized, by both the left and the right, for contributing to corporate brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;''More Money Than Brains: Why School Sucks, College is Crap, &amp; Idiots Think They're Right'', [[Laura Penny]], McClelland &amp; Stewart, 20 April 2010, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1992 book, ''Democracy in an Age of Corporate Colonization'', [[Stanley A.

In his 2000 book, ''Destroying the World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism'', Robert Lifton applied his original ideas about thought reform to [[Aum Shinrikyo]] and the [[War on Terrorism]], concluding that in this context thought reform was possible without violence or physical coercion. He also pointed out that in their efforts against terrorism Western governments were also using some mind control techniques, including [[thought-terminating cliché]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Destroying the ''World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism'', Owl Books, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2004 [[popular science]] book, ''[[Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control]]'', [[neuroscientist]] and [[physiologist]] [[Kathleen Taylor (biologist)|Kathleen Taylor]] reviewed the history of mind control theories, as well as notable incidents. She suggests that persons under its influence have more rigid [[neurological]] pathways, and that can make it more difficult to rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways.&lt;ref name="szimhart"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Szimhart | first =Joseph | title =Thoughts on thought control | journal =[[Skeptical Inquirer]] | volume =29 | issue =4 | pages =56–57 | date =July–August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers  praised her book for its clear presentation, while some criticized it for oversimplification.&lt;ref name="lefanu"&gt;{{cite news | last =Le Fanu | first =James | title =Make up your mind | work =[[The Daily Telegraph]] | publisher =Telegraph Media Group Limited | date =20 December 2004 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/12/19/botay19.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2004/12/19/bomain.html | accessdate = 2008-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hawkes"&gt;{{cite news | last =Hawkes | first =Nigel | title =Brainwashing by Kathleen Taylor | work =[[The Times]] | publisher =Times Newspapers Ltd | date =27 November 2004 | url =http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article395436.ece | accessdate = 2008-11-02 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Caterson | first =Simon | title =Hell to pay when man bites God | work =[[The Australian]] | page =4 | date =2 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Kathleen Eleanor |authorlink=Kathleen Taylor (biologist) |title=Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BIuju20yhDkC&amp;dq |accessdate=2009-07-30 |date=December 2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-280496-9 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[social sciences]] and [[life sciences]], a '''case study''' is a research method involving an up-close, in-depth, and detailed examination of a subject of study (the '''case'''), as well as its related contextual conditions.

Case studies can be produced by following a formal [[research]] method. These case studies are likely to appear in formal research venues, as journals and professional conferences, rather than popular works. The resulting body of 'case study research' has long had a prominent place in many disciplines and professions, ranging from psychology, anthropology, sociology, and political science to education, clinical science, social work, and administrative science.&lt;ref name=Mills2010&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Mills |editor1-first=Albert J. |editor2-first=Gabrielle |editor2-last=Durepos |editor3-first=Elden |editor3-last=Wiebe |title=Encyclopedia of Case Study Research |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |year=2010 |page=xxxi |isbn=978-1-4129-5670-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yin |first=Robert K. |authorlink=Robert K. Yin |title=Case Study Research: Design and Methods |url={{GBurl|OgyqBAAAQBAJ}} |edition=5th |year=2013 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=978-1-4833-2224-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5–6}}

In doing case study research, the "case" being studied may be an individual, organization, event, or action, existing in a specific time and place. For instance, clinical science has produced both well-known case studies of individuals and also case studies of clinical practices.&lt;ref name=Rolls2005&gt;{{cite book  | last = Rolls  | first = Geoffrey  | title = Classic Case Studies in Psychology  | publisher = Hodder Education |location=Abingdon, England | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corkin"&gt;{{cite book |first=Suzanne |last=Corkin |title=Permanent Present Tense: The Unforgettable Life of the Amnesic Patient, H.M. |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-4650-3159-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kessler &amp; Stafford"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Rodger |editor1-last=Kessler |editor2-first=Dale |editor2-last=Stafford |title=Collaborative Medicine Case Studies: Evidence in Practice |publisher=Springer |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-3877-6893-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when "case" is used in an abstract sense, as in a claim, a proposition, or an argument, such a case can be the subject of many research methods, not just case study research.

Another suggestion is that ''case study'' should be defined as a ''research strategy'', an empirical inquiry that investigates a phenomenon within its real-life context. Case study research can mean single and multiple case studies, can include quantitative evidence, relies on multiple sources of evidence, and benefits from the prior development of theoretical propositions. Case studies should not be confused with [[qualitative research]] and they can be based on any mix of quantitative and qualitative evidence.[[Single-subject research]] provides the statistical framework for making inferences from quantitative case-study data.&lt;ref name="Yin"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamnek&gt;{{cite book |last=Lamnek |first=Siegfried |title=Qualitative Sozialforschung: Lehrbuch |url={{GBurl|XYLISAAACAAJ}} |year=2010 |publisher=Beltz |location=Weihnhein, Basel |isbn=978-3-621-27770-9 |page=4 |lang=DE }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Case studies may involve both qualitative and quantitative research methods.

== Different types of case study research methods ==

In business research, four common case study approaches are distinguished.&lt;ref name=Ridder2017&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hans-Gerd |last=Ridder |title=The theory contribution of case study research designs |journal=Business Research |date=October 2017 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=281–305 |issn=2198-2627 |doi=10.1007/s40685-017-0045-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Welch2011&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Catherine |last1=Welch |first2=Rebecca |last2=Piekkari |first3=Emmanuella |last3=Plakoyiannaki |first4=Eriikka |last4=Paavilainen-Mäntymäki |title=Theorising from case studies: Towards a pluralist future for international business research |journal=Journal of International Business Studies |date=June 2011 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=740–762 |issn=1478-6990 |doi=10.1057/jibs.2010.55 |url=http://www.academia.edu/download/43015779/Theorising_from_Case_Studies_Towards_a_P20160224-27042-2c24kc.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.692.3967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, there is the "no theory first" type of case study design, which is closely connected to [[Kathleen M. Eisenhardt]]'s methodological work.&lt;ref name=Ridder2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eisenhardt1991&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eisenhardt |first=Kathleen M. |authorlink=Kathleen M. Eisenhardt |title=Better Stories and Better Constructs: The Case for Rigor and Comparative Logic |journal=The Academy of Management Review |volume=16 |issue=3 |year=1991 |pp=620–627 |jstor=258921 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second type of research design is about "gaps and holes", following [[Robert K. Yin]]'s guidelines and making positivist assumptions.&lt;ref name=Ridder2017/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yin"/&gt; A third design deals with a "social construction of reality", represented by the work of [[Robert E. Stake]].&lt;ref name=Ridder2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stake1995&gt;{{cite book |last=Stake |first=Robert E. |authorlink=Robert E. Stake |title=The Art of Case Study Research |url={{GBurl|ApGdBx76b9kC|pg=PR99}} |pages=99–102 |year=1995 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=978-0-8039-5767-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the reason for case study research can also be to identify "anomalies"; a representative scholar of this approach is [[Michael Burawoy]].&lt;ref name=Ridder2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burawoy2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Burawoy |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Burawoy |title=The Extended Case Method: Four Countries, Four Decades, Four Great Transformations, and One Theoretical Tradition |url={{GBurl|xCA7R-o8BMIC}} |year=2009 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-0-520-94338-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these four approaches has its areas of application, but it is important to understand their unique [[ontology|ontological]] and [[epistemology|epistomological]] assumptions. There are substantial methodological differences between these approaches.

== Case selection and structure ==

An average, or typical case, is often not the richest in information. In clarifying lines of history and causation it is more useful to select subjects that offer an interesting, unusual or particularly revealing set of circumstances. A case selection that is based on representativeness will seldom be able to produce these kinds of insights. When selecting a case for a case study, researchers will therefore use information-oriented sampling, as opposed to [[random sampling]].&lt;ref name="Flyvbjerg06"&gt;{{cite book |last=Flyvbjerg |first=Bent |chapter=Five Misunderstandings About Case-Study Research Inquiry |year=2007 |editor-last1=Seale |editor-first1=Clive |editor-last2=Silverman |editor-first2=David |editor-last3=Gobo |editor-first3=Giampietro |editor-first4=Jaber F. |editor-last4=Gubrium |title=Qualitative Research Practice: Concise Paperback Edition |journal=Qualitative Inquiry |volume=12 |issue=2 |page=390 |arxiv=1304.1186 |doi=10.1177/1077800405284363  |chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286140682 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=978-1-4129-3420-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Outlier]] cases (that is, those which are extreme, deviant or atypical) reveal more information than the potentially representative case, as seen in cases selected for more qualitative safety scientific analyses of accidents.&lt;ref name=Huang2015&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huang |first1=Huayi |year=2015 |title=Development of New Methods to Support Systemic Incident Analysis |type=Doctoral dissertation |publisher=Queen Mary University |location=London |url=https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/12866/Huang_Huayi_PhD_Final_111115.pdf }}{{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Underwood2016&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ssci.2015.08.014 |title='Accident investigation in the wild' – A small-scale, field-based evaluation of the STAMP method for accident analysis |journal=Safety Science |volume=82 |pages=129–43 |year=2016 |last1=Underwood |first1=Peter |last2=Waterson |first2=Patrick |last3=Braithwaite |first3=Graham }}&lt;/ref&gt; A case may be chosen because of the inherent interest of the case or the circumstances surrounding it. Alternatively it may be chosen because of researchers' in-depth local knowledge; where researchers have this local knowledge they are in a position to "soak and poke" as [[Richard Fenno]] put it,&lt;ref name=Fenno2014&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fenno |first=Richard F. |authorlink=Richard Fenno |title=Observation, Context, and Sequence in the Study of Politics |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=80 |pages=3–15 |year=2014 |doi=10.2307/1957081 |jstor=1957081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby to offer reasoned lines of explanation based on this rich knowledge of setting and circumstances.

Three types of cases may thus be distinguished for selection:

# Key cases
# Outlier cases
# Local knowledge cases

Whatever the frame of reference for the choice of the subject of the case study (key, outlier, local knowledge), there is a distinction to be made between the '''subject''' and the '''object''' of the case study. The subject is the "practical, historical unity" through which the theoretical focus of the study is being viewed.&lt;ref name=Wieviorka1992&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Wieviorka |year=1992 |chapter=Case studies: history or sociology? |editor1-last = Ragin | editor1-first = Charles C. | editor1-link = Charles C. Ragin | editor2-last = Becker | editor2-first = Howard Saul | editor2-link = Howard S. Becker |title=What Is a Case?: Exploring the Foundations of Social Inquiry |chapter-url={{GBurl|vSNp2jtzCbEC|p=10}} | publisher = Cambridge University Press |page=10 | isbn = 9780521421881 | access-date=2016-06-20 | date = July 31, 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The object is that theoretical focus – the analytical frame. Thus, for example, if a researcher were interested in US resistance to communist expansion as a theoretical focus, then the Korean War might be taken to be the ''subject'', the lens, the case study through which the theoretical focus, the ''object'', could be viewed and explicated.&lt;ref name=Thomas2011&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary |last=Thomas |authorlink=Gary Thomas (academic) |title=How to Do Your Case Study: A Guide for Students and Researchers |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=SAGE Publications |year=2011 }}{{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond decisions about case selection and the subject and object of the study, decisions need to be made about purpose, approach and process in the case study. [[Gary Thomas (academic)|Gary Thomas]] thus proposes a typology for the case study wherein purposes are first identified (evaluative or exploratory), then approaches are delineated (theory-testing, theory-building or illustrative), then processes are decided upon, with a principal choice being between whether the study is to be single or multiple, and choices also about whether the study is to be retrospective, snapshot or diachronic, and whether it is nested, parallel or sequential.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1077800411409884 |title=A Typology for the Case Study in Social Science Following a Review of Definition, Discourse, and Structure |journal=Qualitative Inquiry |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=511–21 |year=2011 |last=Thomas |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Thomas (academic) }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus possible to take many routes through this typology, with, for example, an exploratory, theory-building, multiple, nested study, or an evaluative, theory-testing, single, retrospective study. The typology thus offers many permutations for case-study structure.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

A closely related study in medicine is the [[case report]], which identifies a specific case as treated and/or examined by the authors as presented in a novel form. These are, to a differentiable degree, similar to the case study in that many contain reviews of the relevant literature of the topic discussed in the thorough examination of an array of cases published to fit the criterion of the report being presented. These case reports can be thought of as brief case studies with a principal discussion of the new, presented case at hand that presents a novel interest.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Marketing analysis==
Some issues are usually realised in a situation where marketing is concerned. One must, therefore, ensure that he/she can fully understand these things. In a case where the market of any organisation is in a messy state, the agency will always seek to find out some of the reasons why the scenario is that way. They will have to gather information that may help them in solving such issues. For this to be fully achieved, one must be able to carry out a market research to establish where the problem is. This, therefore, calls for the different methods which can be used in a situation where one wants to conduct a marketing research.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong et al., 2014{{full|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ways can be used to come up with the purpose of study that is most appropriate. The organisations have to choose one of the available techniques so that they can thoroughly conduct their investigations. Some of the primary methods that would be used included interviews, surveys, focus groups, observations and in some cases use field trials.&lt;ref&gt;Guesalaga et al., 2016{{full|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods mainly depended on the amount of cash the organisation is willing to spend in having this market research done and also the kind of data that is required by the group.

==Types of case studies ==

In [[public-relations]] research, three types of case studies are used:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

# Linear,
# Process-oriented,
# Grounded.

Under the more generalized category of case study exist several subdivisions, each of which is custom selected for use depending upon the goals of the investigator. These types of case study include the following:

* '''Illustrative case studies.''' These are primarily descriptive studies. They typically utilize one or two instances of an event to show the existing situation. Illustrative case studies serve primarily to make the unfamiliar familiar and to give readers a common language about the topic in question.
* '''Exploratory (or pilot) case studies.''' These are condensed case studies performed before implementing a large scale investigation. Their basic function is to help identify questions and select types of measurement prior to the main investigation. The primary pitfall of this type of study is that initial findings may seem convincing enough to be released prematurely as conclusions.
* '''Cumulative case studies.''' These serve to aggregate information from several sites collected at different times. The idea behind these studies is that the collection of past studies will allow for greater generalization without additional cost or time being expended on new, possibly repetitive studies.
* '''Critical instance case studies.''' These examine one or more sites either for the purpose of examining a situation of unique interest with little to no interest in generalization, or to call into question a highly generalized or universal assertion. This method is useful for answering cause and effect questions.

==Case studies in business==

At Harvard Law School In 1870, [[Christopher Langdell]] departed from the traditional lecture-and-notes approach to teaching contract law and began using cases pled before courts as the basis for class discussions.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, B. A. (2009). The Inception of Modern Professional Education: C. C. Langdell, 1826–1906 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2009){{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1920, this practice had become the dominant pedagogical approach used by law schools in the United States;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jackson |first1=Giles |year=2011 |title=Rethinking the case method |journal=Journal of Management Policy and Practice |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=142–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it also was adopted by Harvard Business School.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

Research in business disciplines is usually based on a [[positivist]] [[epistemology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Wai Fong |last1=Chua |date=October 1986 |title=Radical Developments in Accounting Thought |journal=The Accounting Review |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=601–32 |jstor=247360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; namely, that reality is something that is objective and can be discovered and understood by a scientific examination of empirical evidence. But organizational behavior cannot always be easily reduced to simple tests that prove something to be true or false. Reality may be an objective thing, but it is understood and interpreted by people who, in turn, act upon it, and so [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], which addresses the connection between the natural and social worlds, is a useful basis for analyzing the environment of and events within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15017410600914329 |title=Metatheory, Interdisciplinarity and Disability Research: A Critical Realist Perspective |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=278–97 |year=2006 |last1=Bhaskar |first1=Roy |last2=Danermark |first2=Berth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Case studies in management are generally used to interpret strategies or relationships, to develop sets of "best practices", or to analyze the external influences or the internal interactions of a firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klonoski |first1=Robert |year=2013 |title=The case for case studies: Deriving theory from evidence |journal=Journal of Business Case Studies |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=261–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With several notable exceptions (e.g., Janis on [[Groupthink]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.1973.tb00117.x |title=Groupthink and Group Dynamics: A Social Psychological Analysis of Defective Policy Decisions |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=19–25 |year=1973 |last1=Janis |first1=Irving L }}&lt;/ref&gt;), they are rarely used to propose new theories.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

== Generalizing from case studies ==
A critical case is defined as having strategic importance in relation to the general problem. A critical case allows the following type of generalization: "If it is valid for this case, it is valid for all (or many) cases." In its negative form, the generalization would run: "If it is not valid for this case, then it is not valid for any (or valid for only few) cases."{{fact|date=December 2017}}

The case study is effective for generalizing using the type of test that [[Karl Popper]] called [[Falsifiability|falsification]], which forms part of [[Reflexivity (social theory)|critical reflexivity]]. Falsification offers one of the most rigorous tests to which a scientific proposition can be subjected: if just one observation does not fit with the proposition it is considered not valid generally and must therefore be either revised or rejected. Popper himself used the now famous example: "All swans are white", and proposed that just one observation of a single [[black swan]] would falsify this proposition and in this way have general significance and stimulate further investigations and theory-building. The case study is well suited for identifying "black swans" because of its in-depth approach: what appears to be "white" often turns out on closer examination to be "black".{{fact|date=December 2017}}

[[Galileo Galilei]] built his rejection of [[Aristotle]]'s law of gravity on a case study selected by information-oriented sampling and not by random sampling. The rejection consisted primarily of a conceptual experiment and later on a practical one. These experiments, with the benefit of hindsight, seem self-evident. Nevertheless, Aristotle's incorrect view of gravity had dominated scientific inquiry for nearly two thousand years before it was falsified. In his experimental thinking, Galileo reasoned as follows: if two objects with the same weight are released from the same height at the same time, they will hit the ground simultaneously, having fallen at the same speed. If the two objects are then stuck together into one, this object will have double the weight and will according to the Aristotelian view therefore fall faster than the two individual objects. This conclusion seemed contradictory to Galileo. The only way to avoid the contradiction was to eliminate weight as a determinant factor for acceleration in free fall. Galileo’s experimentalism did not involve a large random sample of trials of objects falling from a wide range of randomly selected heights under varying wind conditions, and so on. Rather, it was a matter of a single experiment, that is, a case study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Five Misunderstandings About Case-Study Research |journal=Qualitative Inquiry |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=219–245 |year=2006 |last1=Flyvbjerg |first1=Bent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo’s view continued to be subjected to doubt, however, and the Aristotelian view was not finally rejected until half a century later, with the invention of the air pump. The air pump made it possible to conduct the ultimate experiment, known by every pupil, whereby a coin or a piece of lead inside a vacuum tube falls with the same speed as a feather. After this experiment, Aristotle’s view could be maintained no longer. What is especially worth noting, however, is that the matter was settled by an individual case due to the clever choice of the extremes of metal and feather. One might call it a critical case, for if Galileo’s thesis held for these materials, it could be expected to be valid for all or a large range of materials. Random and large samples were at no time part of the picture. However it was Galileo's view that was the subject of doubt as it was not reasonable enough to be the Aristotelian view. By selecting cases strategically in this manner one may arrive at case studies that allow generalization.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==History==
It is generally believed{{by whom?|date=June 2017}} that [[Frederic Le Play]] first introduced the case-study method into social science in 1829 as a handmaiden to statistics in his studies of family budgets.&lt;ref&gt;(Les Ouvriers Europeens (2nd edition, 1879){{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3707549 |jstor=3707549 |title=Le Play's Contribution to Sociology: His Method |journal=The American Catholic Sociological Review |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=97–110 |year=1947 |last1=Healy |first1=Sister Mary Edward }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other roots stem from the early 20th century, when researchers working in the disciplines of sociology, psychology, and anthropology began making case studies.{{cn|date=June 2017}}  In all these disciplines, case studies were an occasion for postulating new theories, as in the [[grounded theory | grounded-theory]] work of sociologists [[Barney Glaser]] (1930- ) and [[Anselm Strauss]] (1916-1996).&lt;ref&gt;Barney G. Glaser and Strauss, ''The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research'' (New York: Aldine, 1967). {{ISBN|978-0202302607}}{{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of case studies in testing theories or hypotheses has developed only in recent decades.{{cn|date=June 2017}} One of the areas in which case studies have been gaining popularity is education and in particular educational evaluation.&lt;ref name=Stake1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=MacDonald2006&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/0305764750050101 |title=Case‐study and the Social Philosophy of Educational Research |journal=Cambridge Journal of Education |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=2–11 |year=2006 |last1=MacDonald |first1=Barry |last2=Walker |first2=Rob }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacDonald1978&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacDonald |first=Barry |year=1978 |title=The Experience of Innovation |journal=CARE Occasional Publications |issue=6 }}{{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kushner2000&gt;{{cite book |last=Kushner |first=S. |year=2000 |title=Personalizing Evaluation |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=SAGE Publications }}{{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educators have used case studies as a teaching method and as part of [[professional development]], especially in [[commerce | business]] and legal education. The [[problem-based learning]] (PBL) movement offers an example. When used in (non-business) education and professional development, case studies are often referred to as ''critical incidents''.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

[[Ethnography]] exemplifies a type of case study, commonly found in communication case studies. Ethnography is the description, interpretation, and analysis of a culture or social group, through field research in the natural environment of the group being studied. The main method of ethnographic research is thorough observation, where the researcher observes study participants over an extended period of time within the participants' own environment.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture{{full|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative case studies have become more popular{{when?|date=June 2017}} in social science, policy, and education research. One approach encourages researchers to compare horizontally, vertically, and temporally.&lt;ref name=Bartlett2017&gt;{{Cite book |title=Rethinking Case Study Research |last1=Bartlett |first1=Lesley |last2=Vavrus |first2=Frances |publisher= Routledge|year= 2017 |isbn= |location= |pages= }}{{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related uses==
Using case studies in research differs from their use in teaching, where they are commonly called [[case method]]s and [[casebook method]]s. Teaching case studies have been a highly popular pedagogical format in many fields ranging from business education to science education. [[Harvard Business School]] has been among the most prominent developers and users of teaching case studies.&lt;ref name="Garvin"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David A. |last1=Garvin |year=2003 |title=Making the Case: Professional Education for the World of Practice |journal=Harvard Magazine |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=56–107 |url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=15306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellet"&gt;{{cite book |first=W. |last=Ellet |title=The Case Study Handbook: How to Read, Write, and Discuss Persuasively about Cases |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |location=Boston, MA |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-422-10158-2 }}{{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business school faculty generally develop case studies with particular learning objectives in mind. Additional relevant documentation, such as financial statements, time-lines, and short biographies, often referred to in the case study as exhibits, and multimedia supplements (such as video-recordings of interviews with the case subject) often accompany the case studies. Similarly, teaching case studies have become increasingly popular in science education. The National Center for Case Studies in Teaching Science has made a growing body of case studies available for classroom use, for university as well as secondary school coursework.&lt;ref name=Palmer2015&gt;{{Cite book|title = Exploring Cases Using Emotion, Open Space and Creativity|last = Palmer|first = Grier|publisher = Libri|year = 2015|isbn = 978 1 909818 57 6|location = |pages = 19–38|last2 = Iordanou|first2 = Ioanna|work = Case-based Teaching and Learning for the 21st Century}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCCSTS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sciencecases.lib.buffalo.edu/cs/about/ |title=About Us |website=National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science (NCCSTS) |editor-first1=Clyde F. |editor-last1=Herreid |editor-first2=Nancy A. |editor-last2=Schiller |editor-first3=Carolyn |editor-last3=Wright |editor-first4=Ky |editor-last4=Herreid |publisher=University at Buffalo |accessdate=2018-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the principles involved in doing case study research contrast with those involved in doing case studies for teaching. Teaching case studies need not adhere strictly to the use of evidence, as they can be manipulated to satisfy educational needs. The generalizations from teaching case studies also may relate to pedagogical issues rather than the substance of the case being studied.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

Case studies are commonly used in [[case competition]]s and in job interviews for consulting firms such as [[McKinsey &amp; Company]], [[CEB Inc.]] and the [[Boston Consulting Group]], in which candidates are asked to develop the best solution for a case in an allotted time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mamou|first1=Victor|title=Consulting Case Study|url=http://management-consulting-formula.com/consulting-case-study/|publisher=Management Consulting Formula|accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chronometry''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] χρόνος ''[[chronos]]'', "time" and μέτρον ''metron'', "measure") is the science of the measurement of [[time]], or timekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Dictionary'', 1913&lt;/ref&gt; Chronometry applies to [[electronics|electronic]] devices, while [[horology]] refers to mechanical devices.

It should not to be confused with [[chronology]], the science of locating events in time, which often relies upon it.

[[Chemistry]] and [[physics]] are branches of [[science]] that both study [[matter]]. The difference between the two lies in their scope and approach. Chemists and physicists are trained differently, and they have different professional roles, even when working in a team. The division between chemistry and physics becomes diffuse at the interface of the two branches, notably in fields such as [[physical chemistry]], [[chemical physics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[nuclear physics]]/[[Nuclear chemistry|chemistry]], [[materials science]], [[spectroscopy]], [[solid state physics]], [[solid-state chemistry]], [[crystallography]], and [[nanotechnology]].

== Scope ==
Physics and chemistry may overlap when the system under study involves matter composed of electrons and nuclei made of protons and neutrons. On the other hand, chemistry is not concerned with other forms of matter such as [[quarks]], [[Mu lepton|mu]] and [[tau lepton]]s and [[dark matter]].

Although fundamental laws that govern the behavior of matter apply both in chemistry and physics, the disciplines of physics and chemistry are distinct. Physics is concerned with nature from a very large scale (the entire universe) down to a very small scale ([[subatomic particles]]). All physical phenomena that are measurable follow some behavior that is in accordance with the most basic principles studied in physics.&lt;ref name=APS /&gt;&lt;ref name=IOP /&gt;

Physics is involved with the fundamental principles of physical phenomena and the basic forces of nature, and also gives insight into the aspects of space and time. Physics also deals with the basic principles that explain matter and energy, and may study aspects of atomic matter by following concepts derived from the most fundamental principles.

Chemistry focuses on how substances interact with each other and with energy (for example heat and light).&lt;ref name=IUPAC /&gt;&lt;ref name=ACS /&gt; The study of change of matter ([[chemical reactions]]) and [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] lies at the heart of chemistry, and gives rise to concepts such as [[Organic chemistry|organic]] [[functional group]]s and rate laws for chemical reactions. Chemistry also studies the properties of matter at a larger scale (for example, [[astrochemistry]]) and the reactions of matter at a larger scale (for example, technical chemistry), but typically, explanations and predictions are related back to the underlying atomic structure, giving more emphasis on the methods for the identification of molecules and their mechanisms of transformation than any other science.

== Approach ==
Although both physics and chemistry are concerned with matter and its interaction with energy, the two disciplines differ in approach. In physics, it is typical to abstract from the specific type of matter, and to focus on the common properties of many different materials.&lt;ref name=PhysApproach /&gt;&lt;ref name=PhysThinking /&gt;  In [[optics]], for example, materials are characterized by their [[index of refraction]], and materials with the same index of refraction will have identical properties. Chemistry, on the other hand, focuses on what compounds are present in a sample, and explores how changing the [[Chemical structure|structure]] of molecules will change their reactivity and their physical properties.&lt;ref name=ChemThinking /&gt;

The two sciences differ in the role that theory plays within the discipline. Physics can be divided into experimental and [[theoretical physics]]. Historically, theoretical physics has correctly predicted phenomena that were out of experimental reach at the time, and could be verified only after experimental techniques caught up.&lt;ref name=PhysTheory /&gt;  In chemistry, the role of theory historically has been a retrospective one, summarizing experimental data and predicting the outcome of similar experiments.&lt;ref name=ChemTheory /&gt;  However, with the increasing power of computational methods in chemistry, it has become possible to predict whether a hypothetical compound is stable or not before experimental data is available.

== Training ==
In a typical undergraduate program for physics majors, required courses are in the sub-disciplines of physics, with additional required courses in mathematics. Because much of the insight of physics is described by [[differential equations]] relating matter, space, and time (for example [[Newton's law of motion]] and the [[Maxwell equations]] of [[electromagnetism]]), students have to be familiar with differential equations. In a typical undergraduate program for chemistry majors, emphasis is placed on laboratory classes and understanding and applying models describing [[chemical bond]]s and [[molecular structure]]. Emphasis is also placed in the methods for analysis and the formulas and equations used when considering the chemical transformation. Students take courses in math, physics, chemistry, and often [[biochemistry]]. Between the two programs of study, there is a large area of overlap ([[calculus]], introductory physics, [[quantum mechanics]], [[thermodynamics]]). However, physics places a larger emphasis on fundamental theory (with its deep mathematical treatment) while chemistry places more emphasis in combining the most important mathematical definitions of the theory with the approach of the molecular models. [[Laboratory]] skills may differ in both programs, as students may be involved in different technologies, depending on the program and the institution of higher education (for example, a chemistry student may spend more laboratory time dealing with [[Laboratory glassware|glassware]] for [[distillation]] and purification or on a form of [[chromatography]]-[[spectroscopy]] instrument, while a physics student may spend much more time dealing with a [[laser]] and non-linear optics technology or some complex electrical circuit).

== Careers in chemistry and physics ==
According to Bureau of Labor Statistics (United States Department of Labor), there are 80,000 [[chemist]]s and 17,000 [[physicist]]s working in the United States as of May 2010.&lt;ref name=LaborStats /&gt;  In addition, 21,000 chemists and 13,500 physicists teach in high school. Chemistry is the only science that has an entire industry, the [[chemical industry]], named after it, and many chemists work in this industry, in [[research and development]], production, training, or management. Other industries employing chemists include the [[Petroleum industry|petroleum]], pharmaceutical, and food industry. While there is no industry named after physics, many industries have grown out of physics research, most notably the [[semiconductor]] and [[electronics industry]]. Physicists are also employed outside of science, for example in finance, because of their training in modeling complex systems.&lt;ref name=CareersNonScience /&gt;

Chemistry and physics are not strictly separated sciences, and chemists and physicists work in interdisciplinary teams to explore the following topics.
* [[Quantum chemistry]]
* [[Spectroscopy]]
* [[Thermodynamics]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1349">The '''conical refiner''' is a machine used in the refining of pulp in the papermaking process.  It may also be referred to as a Jordan refiner, after the American inventor Joseph Jordan who patented the device in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780080533681|title=Handbook of Pulping and Papermaking|last1=Biermann|first1=C|publisher=Academic Press|date=1996|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfZfyEmqs_AC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jordan refiner.jpg|Jordan patent|thumb]]

The conical refiner is a chamber with metal bars mounted around the inside of the container.  The material to be refined is pumped into the chamber at high-pressure rate in order to create an abrasive effect as the material is forced through the machine, abraided by the metal bars.  At the opposite end of the chamber the resulting pulp is pumped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=197|isbn=9781483279602|title=The Paper-making Machine: Its Invention, Evolution, and Development|last1=Clapperton|first1=R.

The first use of the term "creationist"  to describe a proponent of creationism is found in an 1856 letter of [[Charles Darwin]] describing those who objected on religious grounds to the then emerging science of [[Introduction to evolution|evolution]].&lt;ref name="Darwin_letters_1856_1863"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-1919 |title=Darwin, C.

==Biblical basis==
The basis for many creationists' beliefs is a literal or quasi-literal interpretation of the [[Old Testament]], especially from stories from the [[book of Genesis]]:

* The [[Genesis creation narrative]] (Genesis 1–2) describes how [[God]] brings the Universe into being in a series of creative acts over six days and places the first man and woman ([[Adam and Eve]]) in a divine garden (the [[Garden of Eden]]). This story is the basis of creationist cosmology and biology.
* The [[Genesis flood narrative]] (Genesis 6–9) tells how God destroys the world and all life through a great flood, saving representatives of each form of life by means of [[Noah's ark]]. This forms the basis of creationist geology, better known as [[flood geology]].

A further important element is the interpretation of the [[Biblical chronology]], the elaborate system of life-spans, "generations," and other means by which the Bible measures the passage of events from the creation (Genesis 1:1) to the [[Book of Daniel]], the last biblical book in which it appears. Recent decades have seen attempts to de-link creationism from the Bible and recast it as science; these include [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Carlson, Tremper Longman III, Science, Creation and the Bible: Reconciling Rival Theories of Origins, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; There are also non-Christian forms of creationism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/creationism_1.shtml |title=Creationism and intelligent design |date=2 June 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably [[Islamic creationism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/science/03islam.html |title=Creationism, Minus a Young Earth, Emerges in the Islamic World |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=2 November 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[NY Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hindu creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/16/darwin-evolution-china-politics |title=Darwinism, through a Chinese lens |first=Riazat |last=Butt |date=16 November 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Several attempts have been made to categorize the different types of creationism, and create a "[[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]" of creationists.&lt;ref name="Scott1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |date=July–August 1999 |title=The Creation/Evolution Continuum |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/general/creationevolution-continuum |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=16–17, 23–25 |issn=2158-818X |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise-p30"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wise |first=Donald U. |date=January 2001 |title=Creationism's Propaganda Assault on Deep Time and Evolution |url=http://nagt.org/nagt/jge/abstracts/jan01.html |journal=Journal of Geoscience Education |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=30–35 |issn=1089-9995 |accessdate=2014-03-09|bibcode=2001JGeEd..49...30W |doi=10.5408/1089-9995-49.1.30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nagt-pdf-Ross"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Marcus R. |authorlink=Marcus R.

===Young Earth creationism===
{{Main|Young Earth creationism}}
[[File:ICR building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) is a young-Earth creationist organization.]]
Young Earth creationists such as [[Ken Ham]] and [[Doug Phillips]] believe that God created the Earth within the last ten thousand years, literally as described in the Genesis creation narrative, within the approximate time-frame of biblical genealogies (detailed for example in the [[Ussher chronology]]). Most young Earth creationists believe that the universe has a similar age as the Earth. A few assign a much older age to the universe than to Earth. [[Creationist cosmologies]] give the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other young Earth time frames. Other young Earth creationists believe that the Earth and the universe were created with the appearance of age, so that the world appears to be much older than it is, and that this appearance is what gives the geological findings and other methods of dating the Earth and the universe their much longer [[timeline]]s.

The Christian organizations [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) and the [[Creation Research Society]] (CRS) both promote young Earth creationism in the US. Another organization with similar views, [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG)—based in both the U.S. and the [[United Kingdom]]—has opened the [[Creation Museum]] in [[Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky|Petersburg, Kentucky]], to promote young Earth creationism. [[Creation Ministries International]] promotes young Earth views in Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, the US, and the UK. Among [[Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], the [[List of Catholic creationist organisations|Kolbe Center]] for the Study of Creation promotes similar ideas. In 2007, Ken Ham founded the [[Creation Museum]] and [[Ark Encounter]] in northern [[Kentucky]].

===Old Earth creationism===
{{Main|Old Earth creationism}}
Old Earth creationism holds that the physical universe was created by God, but that the creation event described in the Book of Genesis is to be taken figuratively. This group generally believes that the [[age of the universe]] and the age of the Earth are as described by [[astronomer]]s and [[geologist]]s, but that details of [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary theory]] are questionable.&lt;ref name="Scott1999" /&gt;

Old Earth creationism itself comes in at least three types:&lt;ref name="Scott1999" /&gt;

====Gap creationism====
{{Main|Gap creationism}}
Gap creationism, also called "restoration creationism," holds that life was recently created on a pre-existing old Earth. This version of creationism relies on a particular interpretation of {{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:1–2|KJV}}. It is considered that the words [[Tohu wa-bohu|''formless'' and ''void'']] in fact denote waste and ruin, taking into account the original Hebrew and other places these words are used in the [[Old Testament]]. Genesis 1:1–2 is consequently translated:

: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." (Original act of creation.)
: "And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."

Thus, the six days of creation (verse 3 onwards) start sometime after the Earth was "without form and void." This allows an indefinite "gap" of time to be inserted after the original creation of the universe, but prior to the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation according to Genesis]], (when present biological species and [[human]]ity were created). Gap theorists can therefore agree with the [[scientific consensus]] regarding the age of the Earth and universe, while maintaining a literal interpretation of the biblical text.

Some{{which|date=November 2013}} gap creationists expand the basic version of creationism by proposing a "primordial creation" of biological life within the "gap" of time. This is thought to be "the world that then was" mentioned in [[2 Peter]] 3:3–7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Peter|3|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discoveries of fossils and archaeological ruins older than 10,000 years are generally ascribed to this "world that then was," which may also be associated with [[Lucifer]]'s rebellion. These views became popular with publications of Hebrew Lexicons such as ''[[Strong's Concordance]]'', and Bible commentaries such as the ''[[Scofield Reference Bible]]'' and [[E. W. Bullinger|''The Companion Bible'']].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

====Day-age creationism====
{{Main|Day-age creationism}}
Day-age creationism states that the "six days" of the Book of Genesis are not ordinary 24-hour days, but rather much longer periods (for instance, each "day" could be the equivalent of millions, or billions of years of human time). The physicist [[Gerald Schroeder]] is one such proponent of this view. This version of creationism often states that the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word "yôm," in the context of Genesis 1, can be properly interpreted as "age."

Strictly speaking, day-age creationism is not so much a version of creationism as a [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] option which may be combined with other versions of creationism such as progressive creationism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Progressive creationism====
{{Main|Progressive creationism}}
Progressive creationism holds that species have changed or evolved in a process continuously guided by God, with various ideas as to how the process operated—though it is generally taken that God directly intervened in the natural order at key moments in Earth history. This view accepts most of modern physical science including the age of the Earth, but rejects much of modern [[evolutionary biology]] or looks to it for evidence that evolution by [[natural selection]] alone is incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Organizations such as [[Reasons To Believe]], founded by [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], promote this version of creationism.

Progressive creationism can be held in conjunction with [[hermeneutic]] approaches to the Genesis creation narrative such as the [[day-age creationism]] or [[Framework interpretation (Genesis)|framework]]/metaphoric/poetic views.

===Philosophic and scientific creationism===
====Creation science====
{{Main|Creation science}}
Creation science, or initially scientific creationism, is a [[pseudoscience]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2267227 | pmid=18059309 | doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7401131 | volume=8 | issue=12 | title=Taking on creationism.

Okasha's full statement is that "virtually all professional biologists regard creation science as a sham{{snd}}a dishonest and misguided attempt to promote religious beliefs under the guise of science, with extremely harmful educational consequences."&lt;/ref&gt; that emerged in the 1960s with proponents aiming to have young Earth creationist beliefs taught in school science classes as a counter to teaching of evolution. Common features of creation science argument include: creationist cosmologies which accommodate a universe on the order of thousands of years old, criticism of [[radiometric dating]] through a technical argument about [[radiohalo]]s, explanations for the [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] as a record of the [[Genesis flood narrative]] (see [[flood geology]]), and explanations for the present diversity as a result of pre-designed genetic variability and partially due to the rapid degradation of the perfect [[genome]]s God placed in "created kinds" or "[[Baraminology|Baramin]]" (see [[Creation science#Creationist biology|creationist biology]]) due to [[mutation]]s.

====Neo-creationism====
{{Main|Neo-creationism}}
Neo-creationism is a [[pseudoscientific]] movement which aims to restate creationism in terms more likely to be well received by the public, by policy makers, by educators and by the [[scientific community]]. It aims to [[Framing (social sciences)|re-frame]] the debate over the [[Creation myth|origins of life]] in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture. This comes in response to the 1987 ruling by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' that creationism is an inherently religious concept and that advocating it as correct or accurate in public-school curricula violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].&lt;ref name=morris_neo&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=425 |title=Neocreationism |last=Morris |first=Henry M. |authorlink=Henry M.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the principal claims of neo-creationism propounds that ostensibly [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] orthodox science, with a foundation in [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], is actually a dogmatically [[atheism|atheistic]] [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.darwinreconsidered.org/media/MaterialistMythology.pdf |title= Darwinism is Materialist Mythology, Not Science |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |date=October 2004 |website= DarwinReconsidered.org |accessdate=Sep 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its proponents argue that the [[scientific method]] excludes certain explanations of phenomena, particularly where they point towards [[supernatural]] elements, thus effectively excluding religious insight from contributing to understanding the [[universe]]. This leads to an open and often hostile opposition to what neo-creationists term "[[Darwinism]]", which they generally mean to refer to [[evolution]], but which they may extend to include such concepts as [[abiogenesis]], [[stellar evolution]] and the [[Big Bang]] theory.

Unlike their philosophical forebears, neo-creationists largely do not believe in many of the traditional cornerstones of creationism such as a young Earth, or in a dogmatically [[Biblical inerrancy|literal interpretation of the Bible]].

ID originated as a re-branding of creation science in an attempt to avoid a series of court decisions ruling out the teaching of creationism in American public schools, and the Discovery Institute has run [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|a series of campaigns]] to change school curricula.&lt;ref name="Flank_April2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |title=Creationism/ID: A Short Legal History |last=Flank |first=Lenny |website=Talk Reason |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=2014-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063247/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |archivedate=August 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, where curricula are under the control of state governments rather than local school boards, there was a public outcry when the notion of ID being taught in science classes was raised by the Federal Education Minister [[Brendan Nelson]]; the minister quickly conceded that the correct forum for ID, if it were to be taught, is in religious or philosophy classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Deborah |date=October 21, 2005 |title=Intelligent design not science: experts |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/intelligent-design-not-science-experts/2005/10/20/1129775902661.html |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, teaching of intelligent design in public schools has been decisively ruled by a [[United States district court|federal district court]] to be in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller v. Dover]], the court found that intelligent design is not science and "cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District |vol=04 |reporter=cv |opinion=2688 |date=December 20, 2005}}, [[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#Page 136 of 139|Curriculum, Conclusion, p. 136]].&lt;/ref&gt; and hence cannot be taught as an alternative to evolution in public school science classrooms under the jurisdiction of that court. This sets a [[Precedent#Persuasive precedent|persuasive precedent]], based on previous US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions in ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' and ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' (1968), and by the application of the [[Lemon v.

===Geocentrism===
{{Main|Geocentric model}}
In [[astronomy]], the geocentric model (also known as geocentrism, or the Ptolemaic system), is a description of the [[Cosmos]] where Earth is at the orbital center of all celestial bodies. This model served as the predominant cosmological system in many ancient civilizations such as [[ancient Greece]]. As such, they assumed that the Sun, Moon, stars, and [[Classical planet|naked eye planets]] circled Earth, including the noteworthy systems of [[Aristotle]] (see [[Aristotelian physics]]) and [[Ptolemy]].

Articles arguing that geocentrism was the biblical perspective appeared in some early creation science newsletters associated with the Creation Research Society pointing to some passages in the Bible, which, when taken literally, indicate that the daily apparent motions of the Sun and the Moon are due to their actual motions around the Earth rather than due to the rotation of the Earth about its axis for example, [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 10:12 where the Sun and Moon are said to stop in the sky, and [[Psalms]] 93:1 where the world is described as immobile.&lt;ref name="Numbers1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Numbers |first=Ronald L. |year=1993 |origyear=Originally published 1992; New York: [[Alfred A.

Most contemporary creationist organizations reject such perspectives.{{refn|group="note"|Donald B. DeYoung, for example, states that "Similar terminology is often used today when we speak of the sun's rising and setting, even though the earth, not the sun, is doing the moving. Bible writers used the 'language of appearance,' just as people always have. Without it, the intended message would be awkward at best and probably not understood clearly. When the Bible touches on scientific subjects, it is entirely accurate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/1997/11/05/astronomy-bible |title=Astronomy and the Bible: Selected questions and answers excerpted from the book |last=DeYoung |first=Donald B. |date=November 5, 1997 |website=[[Answers in Genesis]] |publisher=Answers in Genesis Ministries International |location=Hebron, KY |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Omphalos hypothesis ===
{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}
The Omphalos hypothesis argues that in order for the world to be functional, God must have created a mature Earth with mountains and canyons, rock strata, trees with growth rings, and so on; therefore ''no'' evidence that we can see of the presumed age of the Earth and age of the universe can be taken as reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gosse 1857|Gosse 1857]]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has seen some revival in the 20th century by some modern creationists, who have extended the argument to address the [[Creationist cosmologies#Starlight problem|"starlight problem"]]. The idea has been criticised as [[Last Thursdayism]], and on the grounds that it requires a deliberately deceptive creator.

==Theistic evolution==
{{Main|Theistic evolution}}
Theistic evolution, or evolutionary creation, is a belief that "the personal God of the Bible created the universe and life through evolutionary processes."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sweet &amp; Feist 2007|Sweet &amp; Feist 2007]], [https://books.google.com/?id=qwaRUNj6S34C&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=theistic+evolution+evolutionary+creation#v=onepage&amp;q=theistic%20evolution%20evolutionary%20creation&amp;f=false p. 48], "''Evolutionary Creation'' (or Theistic Evolution) asserts that the personal God of the Bible created the universe and life through evolutionary processes."&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Scientific Affiliation:

{{quote|A theory of theistic evolution (TE){{snd}}also called evolutionary creation{{snd}}proposes that God's method of creation was to cleverly design a universe in which everything would naturally evolve. Usually the "evolution" in "theistic evolution" means Total Evolution{{snd}}astronomical evolution (to form galaxies, solar systems,...) and geological evolution (to form the earth's geology) plus chemical evolution (to form the first life) and biological evolution (for the development of life){{snd}}but it can refer only to biological evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/origins/te2-cr.htm |title=Evolutionary Creation |last=Rusbult |first=Craig |year=1998 |publisher=American Scientific Affiliation |location=Ipswich, MA |accessdate=2014-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Through the 19th century the term ''creationism'' most commonly referred to [[Creationism (soul)|direct creation of individual souls]], in contrast to [[traducianism]]. Following the publication of ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', there was interest in ideas of Creation by [[divine law]]. In particular, the [[liberal Christianity|liberal theologian]] [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] argued that this illustrated the Creator's power better than the idea of miraculous creation, which he thought ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bowler 2003|Bowler 2003]], p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; When ''On the Origin of Species'' was published, the cleric [[Charles Kingsley]] wrote of evolution as "just as noble a conception of Deity."&lt;ref name="Darwinanddesign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |title=Darwin and design: historical essay |year=2007 |website=Darwin Correspondence Project |publisher=Cambridge University Library |location=Cambridge, UK |accessdate=2012-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021101910/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |archivedate=2014-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-2534 |title=Kingsley, Charles to Darwin, C.

Eventually it was realised that supernatural intervention could not be a scientific explanation, and naturalistic mechanisms such as [[Lamarckism#Neo-Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckism]] were favoured as being more compatible with purpose than natural selection.&lt;ref name="bowl202"&gt;[[#Bowler 2003|Bowler 2003]], pp. 202–08&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theists took the general view that, instead of faith being in opposition to biological evolution, some or all classical religious teachings about [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] and creation are compatible with some or all of modern scientific theory, including specifically evolution; it is also known as "evolutionary creation." In Evolution versus Creationism, [[Eugenie Scott]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] state that it is in fact a type of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott 2005|Scott 2005]], pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

It generally views evolution as a tool used by God, who is both the [[Unmoved mover#First cause|first cause]] and [[Immanence|immanent]] sustainer/upholder of the universe; it is therefore well accepted by people of strong [[theism|theistic]] (as opposed to [[deism|deistic]]) convictions. Theistic evolution can synthesize with the day-age creationist interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative; however most adherents consider that the first chapters of the Book of Genesis should not be interpreted as a "literal" description, but rather as a [[framework view|literary framework]] or allegory.

From a theistic viewpoint, the underlying laws of nature were designed by God for a purpose, and are so self-sufficient that the complexity of the entire physical universe evolved from fundamental particles in processes such as [[stellar evolution]], life forms developed in biological evolution, and in the same way the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life by natural causes]] has resulted from these laws.&lt;ref name="The Origin of Life"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/originoflife.html#intro |title=The Origin of Life |last=Moritz |first=Albrecht |date=October 31, 2006 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one form or another, theistic evolution is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline [[Protestantism|Protestant]] seminaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott 1999|Scott 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; For Roman Catholics, human evolution is not a matter of religious teaching, and must stand or fall on its own scientific merits. [[Catholic Church and evolution|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church]] are not in conflict. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] comments positively on the theory of evolution, which is neither precluded nor required by the sources of faith, stating that scientific studies "have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the development of life-forms and the appearance of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akin |first=Jimmy |date=January 2004 |title=Evolution and the Magisterium |url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2004/0401bt.asp |journal=[[Catholic Answers|This Rock]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |issn=1049-4561 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804102139/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2004/0401bt.asp |archivedate=2007-08-04 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] schools teach evolution without controversy on the basis that scientific knowledge does not extend beyond the physical, and scientific truth and religious truth cannot be in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Guntzel |first=Jeff Severns |url=http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2005a/032505/032505ssn.htm |date=March 25, 2005 |title=Catholic schools steer clear of anti-evolution bias |newspaper=[[National Catholic Reporter]] |location=Kansas City, MO |publisher=The National Catholic Reporter Publishing Company |issn=0027-8939 |accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theistic evolution can be described as "creationism" in holding that [[Miracle|divine intervention]] brought about the origin of life or that divine laws govern formation of species, though many creationists (in the strict sense) would deny that the position is creationism at all. In the [[creation–evolution controversy]], its proponents generally take the "evolutionist" side. This sentiment was expressed by Fr. [[George Coyne]], (the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]'s chief astronomer between 1978 and 2006):&lt;blockquote&gt;...in America, creationism has come to mean some fundamentalistic, literal, scientific interpretation of Genesis. Judaic-Christian faith is radically creationist, but in a totally different sense. It is rooted in a belief that everything depends upon God, or better, all is a gift from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=18504 |title=Text of talk by Vatican Observatory director on 'Science Does Not Need God.

While supporting the [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] inherent in modern science, the proponents of theistic evolution reject the implication taken by some [[atheism|atheists]] that this gives credence to [[Ontology|ontological]] [[materialism]].

{{Further|Genesis creation narrative|creation–evolution controversy}}
{{As of|2006}}, most [[Christian]]s around the world accepted evolution as the most likely explanation for the origins of species, and did not take a [[Biblical literalism|literal view]] of the [[Genesis creation myth]]. The United States is an exception where belief in religious [[fundamentalism]] is much more likely to affect attitudes towards evolution than it is for believers elsewhere. Political partisanship affecting religious belief may be a factor because political partisanship in the US is highly correlated with fundamentalist thinking, unlike in Europe.&lt;ref name="Science survey"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Jon D. |last2=Scott |first2=Eugenie C. |authorlink2=Eugenie Scott |last3=Okamoto |first3=Shinji |date=August 2006 |title=Public acceptance of evolution |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5788/765 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=313 |issue=5788 |pages=765–66 |doi=10.1126/science.1126746 |pmid=16902112 |accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; churches have made statements in favor of evolutionary theory, as have scholars such as the physicist [[John Polkinghorne]], who argues that evolution is one of the principles through which God created living beings. Earlier supporters of evolutionary theory include [[Frederick Temple]], Asa Gray and Charles Kingsley who were enthusiastic supporters of Darwin's theories upon their publication,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polkinghorne 1998|Polkinghorne 1998]], pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; and the French Jesuit priest and geologist [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] saw evolution as confirmation of his Christian beliefs, despite condemnation from Church authorities for his more speculative theories. Another example is that of [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal theology]], not providing any creation models, but instead focusing on the [[symbol]]ism in beliefs of the time of authoring Genesis and the cultural environment.

Many Christians and Jews had been considering the idea of the creation history as an allegory (instead of historical) long before the development of Darwin's theory of evolution. For example, Philo, whose works were taken up by early Church writers, wrote that it would be a mistake to think that creation happened in six days, or in any set amount of time.&lt;ref name="Philo_Chapter2"&gt;[[#Philo|Philo]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.earlychurch.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlychurch.org.uk/philo.php |title=Philo of Alexandria (c. 20&amp;nbsp;BC{{snd}}c.

In 1950, [[Pope Pius XII]] stated limited support for the idea in his [[Encyclical#Catholic usage|encyclical]] ''[[Humani generis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |author=Pope Pius XII |authorlink=Pope Pius XII |title=Humani Generis |website=Vatican: the Holy See |publisher=[[Holy See]] |location=St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City |type=[[Encyclical#Catholic usage|Papal encyclical]] |date=August 12, 1950 |accessdate=2011-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419021937/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |archivedate=April 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[Pope John Paul II]] stated that "new knowledge has led to the recognition of the theory of evolution as more than a hypothesis," but, referring to previous papal writings, he concluded that "if the human body takes its origin from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual [[soul]] is immediately created by God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Pope John Paul II |authorlink=Pope John Paul II |date=October 30, 1996 |title=Magisterium is concerned with question of evolution, for it involves conception of man |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~nmcenter/sci-cp/evolution.html |newspaper=[[L'Osservatore Romano]] |type=Message to the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] |edition=Weekly English |location=Tipografia Vaticana, Vatican City |publisher=Holy See |number=44 |pages=3, 7 |accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, Evangelical Christians have continued to believe in a literal Genesis. Members of evangelical Protestant (70%), [[Mormons|Mormon]] (76%) and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (90%) denominations are the most likely to reject the evolutionary interpretation of the origins of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2008 |title=U.S. Religious Landscape Survey |url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report2religious-landscape-study-chapter-2.pdf |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=Social and Political Views |page=95 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-19}} Report 2: Religious Beliefs &amp; Practices, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jehovah's Witnesses adhere to a combination of [[gap creationism]] and [[day-age creationism]], asserting that scientific evidence about the age of the universe is compatible with the Bible, but that the 'days' after Genesis 1:1 were each thousands of years in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chryssides|first1=George D.|title=Historical Dictionary of Jehovah's Witnesses|date=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810862692|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xx6nUwZzeCsC&amp;pg=PA37|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic Christian literal interpretation of creation requires the harmonization of the two creation stories, Genesis 1:1–2:3 and Genesis 2:4–25, for there to be a consistent interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2194 |title=Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis? |last=Jackson |first=Wayne |website=Apologetics Press |location=Montgomery, Al |accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rejectionofpascalswager.net/creationint.html |last=Tobin |first=Paul N. |year=2000 |title=The Creation Myths: Internal Difficulties |website=The Rejection of Pascal's Wager: A Skeptic's Guide to Christianity |publisher=Paul Tobin |location=Singapore |accessdate=2014-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008175621/http://www.rejectionofpascalswager.net/creationint.html |archivedate=2014-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes seek to ensure that their belief is taught in science classes, mainly in American schools. Opponents reject the claim that the literalistic biblical view meets the criteria required to be considered scientific. Many religious groups teach that God created the Cosmos. From the days of the early Christian Church Fathers there were allegorical interpretations of the Book of Genesis as well as literal aspects.&lt;ref name="rsf"&gt;[[#Forster &amp; Marston 1999|Forster &amp; Marston 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Science]], a system of thought and practice derived from the writings of [[Mary Baker Eddy]], interprets the Book of Genesis figuratively rather than literally. It holds that the material world is an illusion, and consequently not created by God: the only real creation is the spiritual realm, of which the material world is a distorted version. Christian Scientists regard the story of the creation in the Book of Genesis as having symbolic rather than literal meaning. According to Christian Science,  both creationism and evolution are false from an absolute or "spiritual" point of view, as they both proceed from a (false) belief in the reality of a material universe. However, Christian Scientists do not oppose the teaching of evolution in schools, nor do they demand that alternative accounts be taught: they believe that both material science and literalist theology are concerned with the illusory, mortal and material, rather than the real, immortal and spiritual. With regard to material theories of creation, Eddy showed a preference for Darwin's theory of evolution over others.&lt;ref name=S&amp;Hp547&gt;[[#Eddy 1934|Eddy 1934]], p. 547&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Hindu views on evolution}}
According to Hindu creationism, all species on Earth including humans have "devolved" or come down from a high state of pure [[consciousness]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Hindu creationists claim that species of [[plants]] and [[animals]] are material forms adopted by pure consciousness which live an endless cycle of births and rebirths.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McGrath 2010|McGrath 2010]], p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Numbers]] says that: "Hindu Creationists have insisted on the antiquity of humans, who they believe appeared fully formed as long, perhaps, as trillions of years ago."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Numbers 2006|Numbers 2006]], p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu creationism is a form of old Earth creationism, according to Hindu creationists the universe may even be older than billions of years. These views are based on the [[Vedas]], the creation myths of which depict an extreme antiquity of the universe and history of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Carper &amp; Hunt 2009|Carper &amp; Hunt 2009]], p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dasgupta 1922|Dasgupta 1922]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic views on evolution}}
[[Islamic views on evolution|Islamic creationism]] is the belief that the universe (including humanity) was directly created by [[God in Islam|God]] as explained in the [[Quran|Qur'an]]. It usually views the Book of Genesis as a corrupted version of God's message. The creation myths in the Qur'an are vaguer and allow for a wider range of interpretations similar to those in other Abrahamic religions.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Islam also has its own school of theistic evolutionism, which holds that mainstream scientific analysis of the origin of the universe is supported by the Qur'an. Some [[Muslims]] believe in evolutionary creation, especially among [[liberal movements within Islam]].&lt;ref name="Huffpo"/&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Drake Bennett noted: "Without a Book of Genesis to account for ... Muslim creationists have little interest in proving that the age of the Earth is measured in the thousands rather than the billions of years, nor do they show much interest in the problem of the dinosaurs. And the idea that animals might evolve into other animals also tends to be less controversial, in part because there are passages of the Koran that seem to support it. But the issue of whether human beings are the product of evolution is just as fraught among Muslims."&lt;ref name="Bennett 4"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bennett |first=Drake |date=October 25, 2009 |title=Islam's Darwin problem |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/10/25/in_the_muslim_world_creationism_is_on_the_rise/?page=full |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |location=Boston, MA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030044754/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/10/25/in_the_muslim_world_creationism_is_on_the_rise/?page=full |archivedate=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Muslims, such as [[Adnan Oktar]] (also known as Harun Yahya), do not agree that one species can develop from another.&lt;ref name="PrizeforFossil"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/3102103/Creationist-Adnan-Oktar-offers-trillion-pound-prize-for-fossil-proof-of-evolution.html |last=Irvine |first=Chris |date=September 29, 2008 |title=Creationist Adnan Oktar offers trillion-pound prize for fossil proof of evolution |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian0104&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 7, 2004 |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/conferences/story/0,,1117752,00.html |title=Creationism: Science and Faith in Schools |newspaper=The Guardian |type=Conferences |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group |accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, unlike orthodox Muslims, Ahmadis believe that humans have gradually evolved from different species. Ahmadis regard [[Adam]] as being the first Prophet of God{{spaced ndash}}as opposed to him being the first man on Earth.&lt;ref name="Masood_Ch13" /&gt; Rather than wholly adopting the theory of natural selection, Ahmadis promote the idea of a "guided evolution," viewing each stage of the evolutionary process as having been selectively woven by God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Guided_evolution_and_punctuated_equilibrium-20081104MN.pdf |title=Guided Evolution: Proof From Punctuated Equilibrium |last1=Lahaye |first1=Ataul Wahid |last2=Shah |first2=Zia H. |website=Al Islam |publisher=[[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] |location=London |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], Fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] has stated in his magnum opus ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth]]'' (1998) that evolution did occur but only through God being the One who brings it about.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish views on evolution}}
For [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] who seek to reconcile discrepancies between science and the creation myths in the Bible, the notion that science and the Bible should even be reconciled through traditional scientific means is questioned. To these groups, science is as true as the [[Torah]] and if there seems to be a problem, [[Epistemology|epistemological]] limits are to blame for apparently irreconcilable points. They point to discrepancies between what is expected and what actually is to demonstrate that things are not always as they appear. They note that even the root word for "world" in the [[Hebrew language]]—עולם (Olam)—means hidden—נעלם (Neh-Eh-Lahm). Just as they know from the Torah that God created man and trees and the light on its way from the stars in their observed state, so too can they know that the world was created in its over the six days of Creation that reflects progression to its currently-observed state, with the understanding that physical ways to verify this may eventually be identified. This knowledge has been advanced by Rabbi [[Dovid Gottlieb]], former philosophy professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Also, relatively old [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] sources from well before the scientifically apparent age of the universe was first determined are in close concord with modern scientific estimates of the age of the universe, according to Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], and based on Sefer Temunah, an early kabbalistic work attributed to the first-century [[Tannaim|Tanna]] [[Nehunya ben HaKanah]]. Many kabbalists accepted the teachings of the [[Sefer HaTemunah]], including the medieval Jewish scholar [[Nahmanides]], his close student [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre]], and [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]]. Other parallels are derived, among other sources, from Nahmanides, who expounds that there was a [[Neanderthal]]-like species with which Adam mated (he did this long before Neanderthals had even been discovered scientifically).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aviezer 1990|Aviezer 1990]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Carmell &amp; Domb 1976|Carmell &amp; Domb 1976]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schroeder 1998|Schroeder 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tigay |first=Jeffrey H. |date=Winter 1987–1988 |title=Genesis, Science, and 'Scientific Creationism' |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jtigay/sci.htm |journal=[[Conservative Judaism (journal)|Conservative Judaism]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=20–27 |issn=0010-6542 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reform Judaism]] does not take the Torah as a literal text, but rather as a symbolic or open-ended work.

Some contemporary writers such as Rabbi Gedalyah Nadel have sought to reconcile the discrepancy between the account in the Torah, and scientific findings by arguing that each day referred to in the Bible was not 24 hours, but billions of years long.&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that the Earth was created a few thousand years ago, but was deliberately made to look as if it was five billion years old, e.g. by being created with ready made fossils. The best known exponent of this approach being Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;   Others state that although the world was physically created in six 24 hour days, the Torah accounts can be interpreted to mean that there was a period of billions of years before the six days of creation.&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, pp. 169, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{main|Bahai Faith and science#Creation}}
In the creation myth taught by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]] founder, the universe has "neither beginning nor ending," and that the component elements of the material world have always existed and will always exist.&lt;ref&gt;[[#`Abdu'l-Bahá 1982|`Abdu'l-Bahá 1982]], [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-79.html#gr8 p. 220]&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to evolution and the origin of human beings, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] gave extensive comments on the subject when he addressed western audiences in the beginning of the 20th century. Transcripts of these comments can be found in ''[[Some Answered Questions]]'', ''[[Paris Talks]]'' and ''The Promulgation of Universal Peace''. `Abdu'l-Bahá described the human species as having evolved from a primitive form to modern man, but that the capacity to form human intelligence was always in existence.

Most vocal literalist creationists are from the US, and strict creationist views are much less common in other developed countries. According to a study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', a survey of the US, Turkey, [[Japan]] and Europe showed that public acceptance of evolution is most prevalent in Iceland, Denmark and Sweden at 80% of the population.&lt;ref name="Science survey" /&gt; There seems to be no significant correlation between believing in evolution and understanding evolutionary science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culturalcognition.net/blog/2014/5/24/weekend-update-youd-have-to-be-science-illiterate-to-think-b.html |title=Weekend update: You'd have to be science illiterate to think 'belief in evolution' measures science literacy |last=Kahan |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Kahan |date=May 24, 2014 |website=[[Cultural cognition#Cultural cognition project at Yale Law School|Cultural Cognition Project]] |publisher=[[Yale Law School]] |location=New Haven, CT |type=Blog |accessdate=2015-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shtulman |first=Andrew |date=March 2006 |title=Qualitative differences between naïve and scientific theories of evolution |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010028505000745 |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=170–94 |doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2005.10.001 |pmid=16337619 |issn=0010-0285 |accessdate=2015-03-23|bibcode=1992CogPs..24..535V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
A 2009 [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] poll, showed that almost a quarter of Australians believe "the biblical account of human origins." Forty-two percent believe in a "wholly scientific" explanation for the origins of life, while 32 percent believe in an evolutionary process "guided by God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Maley |first=Jacqueline |date=December 19, 2009 |title=God is still tops but angels rate well |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/god-is-still-tops-but-angels-rate-well-20091218-l5v9.html |newspaper=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne, Australia |publisher=Fairfax Media |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In Europe, literalist creationism is more widely rejected, though regular opinion polls are not available. Most people accept that evolution is the most widely accepted scientific theory as taught in most schools. In countries with a Roman Catholic majority, [[Catholic Church and evolution|papal acceptance of evolutionary creationism]] as worthy of study has essentially ended debate on the matter for many people.

In the UK, a 2006 poll on the "origin and development of life", asked participants to choose between three different perspectives on the origin of life: 22% chose creationism, 17% opted for intelligent design, 48% selected evolutionary theory, and the rest did not know.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 26, 2006 |title=Britons unconvinced on evolution |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4648598.stm |work=BBC News |location=London |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=262 |title=BBC Survey On The Origins Of Life |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 30, 2006 |website=[[Ipsos MORI]] |publisher=Ipsos MORI |location=London |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent 2010 [[YouGov]] poll on the correct explanation for the origin of humans found that 9% opted for creationism, 12% intelligent design, 65% evolutionary theory and 13% didn't know.&lt;ref name="YouGov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdn.yougov.com/today_uk_import/YG-Archives-Pol-Prospect-Evolution-181110.pdf |title=The origin of humans |date=November 20, 2010 |website=YouGov Global |publisher=[[YouGov|YouGov Plc]] |location=London |type=Prospect Survey Results |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, head of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]], views the idea of teaching creationism in schools as a mistake.&lt;ref name="Archbishop_2006"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bates |first=Stephen |date=March 20, 2006 |title=Archbishop: stop teaching creationism |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/mar/21/religion.topstories3 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland saw a major controversy over creationism in 2006, when the Deputy Education Minister, [[Mirosław Orzechowski]], denounced evolution as "one of many lies" taught in Polish schools. His superior, Minister of Education [[Roman Giertych]], has stated that the theory of evolution would continue to be taught in Polish schools, "as long as most scientists in our country say that it is the right theory." Giertych's father, [[Member of the European Parliament]] [[Maciej Giertych]], has opposed the teaching of evolution and has claimed that [[dinosaur]]s and humans co-existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 18, 2006 |title=And finally... |url=http://www.wbj.pl/?command=article&amp;id=35336&amp;type=wbj |newspaper=[[Warsaw Business Journal]] |location=Warsaw, Poland |publisher=Valkea Media |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Creation–evolution controversy}}
In the US, creationism has become centered in the political controversy over [[Creation and evolution in public education#United States|creation and evolution in public education]], and whether teaching creationism in science classes conflicts with the separation of church and state. Currently, the controversy comes in the form of whether advocates of the intelligent design movement who wish to "[[Teach the Controversy]]" in science classes have conflated [[Relationship between religion and science|science with religion]].&lt;ref name="kitz" /&gt;

[[People for the American Way]] polled 1500 North Americans about the teaching of evolution and creationism in November and December 1999. They found that most North Americans were not familiar with Creationism, and most North Americans had heard of evolution, but many did not fully understand the basics of the theory. The main findings were:

In such political contexts, creationists argue that their particular religiously based origin belief is superior to those of other [[belief system]]s, in particular those made through secular or scientific rationale.

Most Christians disagree with the teaching of creationism as an alternative to evolution in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Exploring and Proclaiming the Apostles' Creed |first1=Roger |last1=van Harn |first2=David F. |last2=Ford |first3=Colin E. |last3=Gunton |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8192-8116-6 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCXUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=GCXUAwAAQBAJ Extract of page 44]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Foundational Falsehoods of Creationism |first1=Aron |last1=Ra |publisher=Pitchstone Publishing |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-63431-079-6 |page=182 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-rvDAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=F-rvDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182 Extract of page 182]&lt;/ref&gt; Several religious organizations, among them the [[Catholic Church]], hold that their faith does not conflict with the scientific consensus regarding evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/media/voices/religion |title=Statements from Religious Organizations |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2011-03-10|date=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Clergy Letter Project]], which has collected more than 13,000 signatures, is an "endeavor designed to demonstrate that religion and science can be compatible."

In his 2002 article "Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem," George Murphy argues against the view that life on Earth, in all its forms, is direct evidence of God's act of creation (Murphy quotes [[Phillip E. Johnson]]'s claim that he is speaking "of a God who acted openly and left his fingerprints on all the evidence."). Murphy argues that this view of God is incompatible with the Christian understanding of God as "the one revealed in the cross and resurrection of Christ." The basis of this theology is [[Isaiah]] 45:15, "Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour."

Murphy observes that the execution of a Jewish carpenter by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities is in and of itself an ordinary event and did not require [[Miracle|divine action]]. On the contrary, for the crucifixion to occur, God had to limit or "empty" himself. It was for this reason that [[Paul the Apostle]] wrote, in [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] 2:5-8:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Murphy concludes that,&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as the Son of God limited himself by taking human form and dying on a cross, God limits divine action in the world to be in accord with rational laws which God has chosen. This enables us to understand the world on its own terms, but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a [[Naturalism (philosophy)#Methodological naturalism|''methodological'' naturalism]], meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a [[Metaphysical naturalism|''metaphysical'' naturalism]], which proposes that nature is all that there is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murphy |first=George L. |year=2002 |title=Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem |url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/nrcse/IDTHG.html |journal=Covalence: The Bulletin of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Alliance for Faith, Science and Technology |volume=IV |issue=2 |oclc=52753579 |accessdate=2014-03-31}} Reprinted with permission.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jesuit priest [[George Coyne]] has stated that is "unfortunate that, especially here in America, creationism has come to mean...some literal interpretation of Genesis." He argues that "...Judaic-Christian faith is radically creationist, but in a totally different sense. It is rooted in belief that everything depends on God, or better, all is a gift from God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purcell|first1=Brendan|title=From Big Bang to Big Mystery: Human Origins in the Light of Creation and Evolution|date=2012|publisher=New City Press of the Focolare|isbn=978-1565484337|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching of creationism===
Other Christians have expressed qualms about teaching creationism. In March 2006, then Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the leader of the world's Anglicans, stated his discomfort about teaching creationism, saying that creationism was "a kind of [[category mistake]], as if the Bible were a theory like other theories." He also said: "My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it." The views of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]{{snd}}a major American-based branch of the Anglican Communion{{snd}}on teaching creationism resemble those of Williams.&lt;ref name="Archbishop_2006" /&gt;

The National Science Teachers Association is opposed to teaching creationism as a science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSTA Position Statement: The Teaching of Evolution |publisher=National Science Teachers Association | year=2013 |url=http://www.nsta.org/about/positions/evolution.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the Association for Science Teacher Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= ASTE Position Statement on Teaching Biological Evolution |year=2015 |publisher=Association for Science Teacher Education |url=https://theaste.org/about/aste-position-statement-on-teaching-biological-evolution/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Association of Biology Teachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NABT Position Statement on Teaching Evolution |publisher=National Association of Biology Teachers |year=2011 |url=http://www.nabt.org/websites/institution/?p=92 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916020337/http://www.nabt.org/websites/institution/?p=92 |archivedate=2015-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the American Anthropological Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement on Evolution and Creationism |publisher=American Anthropological Association |year=2000 |url=http://www.americananthro.org/ConnectWithAAA/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2599}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American Geosciences Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=American Geological Institute Position on Teaching Evolution |publisher=American Geoscience Institute |year=2000 |url=http://www.agiweb.org/gapac/evolution_statement.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Geological Society of America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2012 |title=Position Statement: Teaching Evolution |publisher=Geological Society of America |url=http://www.geosociety.org/positions/position1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American Geophysical Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AGU Position Statement on Teaching Creationism as Science |publisher=American Geophysical Institute |year=1998 |url=http://www.rbsp.info/rbs/CLONE/debate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous other professional teaching and scientific societies.

In April 2010, the [[American Academy of Religion]] issued ''Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K‐12 Public Schools in the United States'', which included guidance that creation science or intelligent design should not be taught in science classes, as "Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning." However, they, as well as other "worldviews that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses. Such study, however, must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2010/07/american-academy-religion-teaching-creationism-005712 |title=American Academy of Religion on teaching creationism |date=July 23, 2010 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Randy Moore and Sehoya Cotner, from the biology program at the [[University of Minnesota]], reflect on the relevance of teaching creationism in the article "The Creationist Down the Hall: Does It Matter When Teachers Teach Creationism?" They conclude that "Despite decades of science education reform, numerous legal decisions declaring the teaching of creationism in public-school science classes to be unconstitutional, overwhelming evidence supporting evolution, and the many denunciations of creationism as nonscientific by professional scientific societies, creationism remains popular throughout the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Randy |last2=Cotner |first2=Sehoya |date=May 2009 |title=The Creationist Down the Hall: Does It Matter When Teachers Teach Creationism? |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=429–35 |doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.5.10 |issn=0006-3568 |jstor=25502451|bibcode=1985BioSc..35..499W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific criticism===
{{Main|Creation–evolution controversy}}
Science is a system of knowledge based on observation, empirical evidence, and the development of theories that yield testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena. By contrast, creationism is often based on literal interpretations of the narratives of particular religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NAS 2008|NAS 2008]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=12 p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt; Some creationist beliefs involve purported forces that lie outside of nature, such as supernatural intervention, and often do not allow predictions at all. Therefore, these can neither be confirmed nor disproved by scientists.&lt;ref name="SEaC"&gt;[[#NAS 2008|NAS 2008]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=10 p. 10], "In science, explanations must be based on naturally occurring phenomena. Natural causes are, in principle, reproducible and therefore can be checked independently by others. If explanations are based on purported forces that are outside of nature, scientists have no way of either confirming or disproving those explanations."&lt;/ref&gt; However, many creationist beliefs can be framed as testable predictions about phenomena such as the age of the Earth, its [[geological history of Earth|geological history]] and the origins, [[biogeography|distributions]] and [[Phylogenetics|relationships]] of living organisms found on it. [[History of science|Early science]] incorporated elements of these beliefs, but as science developed these beliefs were gradually [[Falsifiability|falsified]] and were replaced with understandings based on accumulated and reproducible evidence that often allows the accurate prediction of future results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/index.html |title=An Index to Creationist Claims |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |year=2006 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Futuyma 2005|Futuyma 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists, such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]],&lt;ref name="RoA"&gt;[[#Gould 1999|Gould 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; consider science and religion to be two compatible and complementary fields, with authorities in distinct areas of human experience, so-called [[non-overlapping magisteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |date=March 1997 |title=Nonoverlapping Magisteria |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html |journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |volume=106 |pages=16–22 |issue=3 |issn=0028-0712 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is also held by many theologians, who believe that [[Unmoved mover|ultimate origins]] and [[meaning of life|meaning]] are addressed by religion, but favor verifiable scientific explanations of natural phenomena over those of creationist beliefs. Other scientists, such as [[Richard Dawkins]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dawkins 2006|Dawkins 2006]], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; reject the non-overlapping magisteria and argue that, in disproving literal interpretations of creationists, the scientific method also undermines religious texts as a source of truth. Irrespective of this diversity in viewpoints, since creationist beliefs are not supported by empirical evidence, the scientific consensus is that any attempt to teach creationism as science should be rejected.&lt;ref name="RoyalSociety_2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298|title=Royal Society statement on evolution, creationism and intelligent design|date=April 11, 2006|website=[[Royal Society]]|publisher=Royal Society|location=London|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602213726/http://royalsociety.org/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298|archivedate=2008-06-02|accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/taking-action/ten-major-court-cases-evolution-creationism |title=Ten Major Court Cases about Evolution and Creationism |last1=Matsumura |first1=Molleen |last2=Mead |first2=Louise |date=February 14, 2001 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2008-11-04}} Updated 2007-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/ann_coulter_no_evidence_for_ev.php |title=Ann Coulter: No evidence for evolution? |last=Myers |first=PZ |authorlink=PZ Myers |date=June 18, 2006 |website=[[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]] |publisher=[[ScienceBlogs|ScienceBlogs LLC]] |type=Blog |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809011055/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/ann_coulter_no_evidence_for_ev.php |archivedate=August 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism of the theory of relativity''' of [[Albert Einstein]] was mainly expressed in the early years after its publication in the early twentieth century, on [[Science|scientific]], [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]], or [[Ideology|ideological]] bases.&lt;ref group=A name=hentschel&gt;Hentschel (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=goenner&gt;Goenner (1993ab)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=wazeck&gt;Wazeck (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Though some of these criticisms had the support of reputable scientists, Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] is now accepted by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Research Methodology: The Aims, Practices and Ethics of Science |edition=illustrated |first1=Peter |last1=Pruzan |publisher=Springer |year=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-27167-5 |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWShCwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=uWShCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81 Extract of page 81]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons for criticism of the theory of relativity have included alternative theories, rejection of the abstract-mathematical method, and alleged errors of the theory. According to some authors, [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] objections to Einstein's Jewish heritage also occasionally played a role in these objections.&lt;ref group=A name=hentschel /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=goenner /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=wazeck /&gt; There are still some critics of relativity today, but their opinions are not shared by the majority in the scientific community.&lt;ref group=A name=farrell&gt;Farrell (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=wazeck2&gt;Wazeck (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special relativity==

===Relativity principle versus electromagnetic worldview===
Around the end of the 19th century, the view was widespread that all forces in nature are of electromagnetic origin (the "[[Electromagnetic mass|electromagnetic worldview]]"), especially in the works of [[Joseph Larmor]] (1897) and [[Wilhelm Wien]] (1900). This was apparently confirmed by the experiments of [[Walter Kaufmann (physicist)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1901–1903), who measured an increase of the mass of a body with velocity which was consistent with the hypothesis that the mass was generated by its electromagnetic field. [[Max Abraham]] (1902) subsequently sketched a theoretical explanation of Kaufmann's result in which the electron was considered as rigid and spherical. However, it was found that this model was incompatible with the results of many experiments (including the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]], the [[Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace]], and the [[Trouton–Noble experiment]]), according to which no motion of an observer with respect to the [[luminiferous aether]] ("aether drift") had been observed despite numerous attempts to do so. [[Henri Poincaré]] (1902) conjectured that this failure arose from a general law of nature, which he called "the [[principle of relativity]]". [[Hendrik Antoon Lorentz]] (1904) created a detailed theory of electrodynamics ([[Lorentz ether theory]]) that was premised on the existence of an immobile aether and employed a set of space and time coordinate transformations that Poincaré called the Lorentz transformations, including the effects of [[length contraction]] and [[relativity of simultaneity|local time]]. However, Lorentz's theory only partially satisfied the relativity principle, because his transformation formulas for velocity and charge density were incorrect. This was corrected by Poincaré (1905) who obtained full Lorentz covariance of the electrodynamic equations.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Miller (1981), pp. 47–75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Lorentz (1904)&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticizing Lorentz's 1904 theory, Abraham (1904) held that the Lorentz contraction of electrons requires a non-electromagnetic force to ensure the electron's stability. This was unacceptable to him as a proponent of the electromagnetic worldview. He continued that as long as a consistent explanation is missing as to how those forces and potentials act together on the electron, Lorentz's system of hypotheses is incomplete and doesn't satisfy the relativity principle.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Miller (1981), pp. 75–85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Abraham (1904)&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré (1905) removed this objection by showing that the non-electromagnetic potential ("[[Electromagnetic mass#Poincaré stresses and 4/3 problem|Poincaré stress]]") holding the electron together can be formulated in a Lorentz covariant way, and showed that in principle it is possible to create a Lorentz covariant model for gravitation which he considered non-electromagnetic in nature as well.&lt;ref group=B name=poinc&gt;Poincaré (1906)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the consistency of Lorentz's theory was proven, but the electromagnetic worldview had to be given up.&lt;ref group=A name=darr&gt;Darrigol (2000), pp. 372–392&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Janssen (2007), pp. 25–34&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, [[Albert Einstein]] published in September 1905 what is now called [[special relativity]], which was based on a radical new application of the relativity principle in connection with the constancy of the speed of light. In special relativity, the space and time coordinates depend on the inertial observer's frame of reference, and the luminiferous aether plays no role in the physics. Although this theory was founded on a very different kinematical model, it was experimentally indistinguishable from the aether theory of Lorentz and Poincaré, since both theories satisfy the relativity principle of Poincaré and Einstein, and both employ the Lorentz transformations. After Minkowski's introduction in 1908 of the geometric spacetime model for Einstein's version of relativity, most physicists eventually decided in favor of the Einstein-Minkowski version of relativity with its radical new views of space and time, in which there was no useful role for the aether.&lt;ref group=B&gt;Einstein (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=darr /&gt;

[[Kaufmann–Bucherer–Neumann experiments]]: To conclusively decide between the theories of Abraham and Lorentz, Kaufmann repeated his experiments in 1905 with improved accuracy. However, in the meantime the theoretical situation had changed. [[Alfred Bucherer]] and [[Paul Langevin]] (1904) developed another model, in which the electron is contracted in the line of motion, and dilated in the transverse direction, so that the volume remains constant. While Kaufmann was still evaluating his experiments, Einstein published his theory of special relativity. Eventually, Kaufmann published his results in December 1905 and argued that they are in agreement with Abraham's theory and require rejection of the "basic assumption of Lorentz and Einstein" (the relativity principle). Lorentz reacted with the phrase "I am at the end of my Latin", while Einstein did not mention those experiments before 1908. Yet, others started to criticize the experiments. [[Max Planck]] (1906) alluded to inconsistencies in the theoretical interpretation of the data, and [[Adolf Bestelmeyer]] (1906) introduced new techniques, which (especially in the area of low velocities) gave different results and which cast doubts on Kaufmann's methods. Therefore, Bucherer (1908) conducted new experiments and arrived at the conclusion that they confirm the mass formula of relativity and thus the "relativity principle of Lorentz and Einstein". Yet Bucherer's experiments were criticized by Bestelmeyer leading to a sharp dispute between the two experimentalists. On the other hand, additional experiments of Hupka (1910), Neumann (1914) and others seemed to confirm Bucherer's result. The doubts lasted until 1940, when in similar experiments Abraham's theory was conclusively disproved. (It must be remarked that besides those experiments, the relativistic mass formula had already been  confirmed by 1917 in the course of investigations on the theory of spectra. In modern [[particle accelerator]]s, the relativistic mass formula is routinely confirmed.)&lt;ref group=A&gt;Pauli (1921), pp. 636–637&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Pauli (1981), pp. 334–352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Staley (2009), pp. 219–259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Planck (1906b)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Bucherer (1908)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Kaufmann (1906)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902–1906, [[Dayton Miller]] repeated the Michelson–Morley experiment together with [[Edward W. Morley]]. They confirmed the [[null result]] of the initial experiment. However, in 1921–1926, Miller conducted new experiments which apparently gave positive results.&lt;ref group=C&gt;Miller (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; Those experiments initially attracted some attention in the media and in the scientific community&lt;ref group=A&gt;Lalli (2012), p. 171–186&lt;/ref&gt; but have been considered refuted for the following reasons:&lt;ref group=A&gt;Swenson (1970), pp. 63–68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Lalli (2012), pp. 187–212.&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein, [[Max Born]], and [[Robert S. Shankland]] pointed out that Miller hadn't appropriately considered the influence of temperature. A modern analysis by Roberts shows that Miller's experiment gives a null result, when the technical shortcomings of the apparatus and the error bars are properly considered.&lt;ref group=B&gt;Roberts (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Miller's result is in disagreement with all other experiments, which were conducted before and after. For example, [[Georg Joos]] (1930) used an apparatus of similar dimensions to Miller's, but he obtained null results. In recent experiments of Michelson–Morley type where the [[coherence length]] is increased considerably by using [[laser]]s and [[maser]]s the results are still negative.

In the 2011 [[Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly]], the [[OPERA experiment|OPERA collaboration]] published results which appeared to show that the speed of [[neutrino]]s is slightly faster than the speed of light. However, sources of errors were found and confirmed in 2012 by the OPERA collaboration, which fully explained the initial results. In their final publication, a neutrino speed consistent with the speed of light was stated. Also subsequent experiments found agreement with the speed of light, see [[measurements of neutrino speed]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Acceleration in special relativity===
It was also claimed that special relativity cannot handle acceleration, which would lead to contradictions in some situations. However, this assessment is not correct, since acceleration actually can be described in the framework of special relativity (see [[Acceleration (special relativity)]], [[Proper reference frame (flat spacetime)]], [[Hyperbolic motion (relativity)|Hyperbolic motion]], [[Rindler coordinates]], [[Born coordinates]]). Paradoxes relying on insufficient understanding of these facts were discovered in the early years of relativity. For example, [[Max Born]] (1909) tried to combine the concept of rigid bodies with special relativity. That this model was insufficient was shown by [[Paul Ehrenfest]] (1909), who demonstrated that a rotating rigid body would, according to Born's definition, undergo a contraction of the circumference without contraction of the radius, which is impossible ([[Ehrenfest paradox]]). [[Max von Laue]] (1911) showed that rigid bodies cannot exist in special relativity, since the propagation of signals cannot exceed the speed of light, so an accelerating and rotating body will undergo deformations.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Pauli (1920), pp. 689–691&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Born (1909)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Laue (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Ehrenfest (1909)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Langevin]] and von Laue showed that the [[twin paradox]] can be completely resolved by consideration of acceleration in special relativity. If two twins move away from each other, and one of them is accelerating and coming back to the other, then the accelerated twin is younger than the other one, since he was located in at least two inertial frames of reference, and therefore his assessment of which events are simultaneous changed during the acceleration. For the other twin nothing changes since he remained in a single frame.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Laue (1921a), pp. 59, 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Langevin (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Sagnac effect]]. Two signals were sent in opposite directions around a rotating platform. After their arrival a displacement of the interference fringes occurs. Sagnac himself believed that he had proved the existence of the aether. However, special relativity can easily explain this effect. When viewed from an inertial frame of reference, it is a simple consequence of the independence of the speed of light from the speed of the source, since the receiver runs away from one beam, while it approaches the other beam. When viewed from a rotating frame, the assessment of simultaneity changes during the rotation, and consequently the speed of light is not constant in accelerated frames.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Laue (1921a), pp. 25–26, 128–130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Langevin (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;

As was shown by Einstein, the only form of accelerated motion that cannot be described is the one due to [[gravitation]], since special relativity is not compatible with the [[Equivalence principle]]. Einstein was also unsatisfied with the fact that inertial frames are preferred over accelerated frames. Thus over the course of several years (1908–1915), Einstein developed [[general relativity]]. This theory includes the replacement of [[Euclidean geometry]] by [[non-Euclidean geometry]], and the resultant curvature of the path of light led Einstein (1912) to the conclusion that (like in accelerated frames) the speed of light is not constant in extended gravitational fields. Therefore, Abraham (1912) argued that Einstein had given special relativity a [[coup de grâce]]. Einstein responded that within its area of application (in areas where gravitational influences can be neglected) special relativity is still applicable with high precision, so one cannot speak of a coup de grâce at all.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Pais (1982), pp. 177–207, 230–232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Einstein (1908)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Einstein (1912)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Einstein (1916)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Abraham (1912)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superluminal speeds===
In special relativity, the transfer of signals at [[Faster-than-light|superluminal speeds]] is impossible, since this would violate the Poincaré-[[Einstein synchronization]], and the [[causality]] principle. Following an old argument by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], Poincaré (1904) alluded to the fact that [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] is founded on an infinitely great [[speed of gravity]]. So the clock-synchronization by light signals could in principle be replaced by a clock-synchronization by instantaneous gravitational signals. In 1905, Poincaré himself solved this problem by showing that in a relativistic theory of gravity the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light. Although much more complicated, this is also the case in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]].&lt;ref group=B name=poin&gt;Poincaré (1906)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Carlip (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Poincaré (1904)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another apparent contradiction lies in the fact that the [[group velocity]] in [[Dispersion (optics)|anomalously dispersive media]] is higher than the speed of light. This was investigated by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1907, 1914) and [[Léon Brillouin]] (1914). They came to the conclusion that in such cases the [[signal velocity]] is not equal to the group velocity, but to the [[front velocity]] which is never faster than the speed of light. Similarly, it is also argued that the apparent superluminal effects discovered by [[Günter Nimtz]] can be explained by a thorough consideration of the velocities involved.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Pauli (1921), 672–673&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B name=Faq&gt;PhysicsFaq: FTL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Sommerfeld (1907, 1914)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Brillouin (1914)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also [[quantum entanglement]] (denoted by Einstein as "spooky action at a distance"), according to which the quantum state of one entangled particle cannot be fully described without describing the other particle, does not imply superluminal transmission of information (see [[quantum teleportation]]), and it is therefore in conformity with special relativity.&lt;ref group=B name=Faq&gt;PhysicsFaq: FTL&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paradoxes===
Insufficient knowledge of the basics of special relativity, especially the application of the Lorentz transformation in connection with [[length contraction]] and [[time dilation]], led and still leads to the construction of various apparent [[paradox]]es. Both the [[twin paradox]] and the [[Ehrenfest paradox]] and their explanation were already mentioned above. Besides the twin paradox, also the reciprocity of time dilation (''i.e.'' every inertially moving observer considers the clock of the other one as being dilated) was heavily criticized by [[Herbert Dingle]] and others. For example, Dingle wrote a series of letters to [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] at the end of the 1950s. However, the self-consistency of the reciprocity of time dilation had already been  demonstrated long before in an illustrative way by Lorentz (in his lectures from 1910, published 1931&lt;ref group=A&gt;Miller (1981), pp. 257–264&lt;/ref&gt;) and many others—they alluded to the fact that it is only necessary to carefully consider the relevant measurement rules and the [[relativity of simultaneity]]. Other known paradoxes are the [[Ladder paradox]] and [[Bell's spaceship paradox]], which also can simply be solved by consideration of the relativity of simultaneity.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Chang (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Mathpages: Dingle&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Dingle (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aether and absolute space===
Many physicists (like [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Oliver Lodge]], [[Albert Abraham Michelson]], [[Edmund Taylor Whittaker]], [[Harry Bateman]], [[Ebenezer Cunningham]], [[Charles Émile Picard]], [[Paul Painlevé]]) were uncomfortable with the rejection of the [[luminiferous aether|aether]], and preferred to interpret the Lorentz transformation based on the existence of a preferred frame of reference, as in the aether-based theories of Lorentz, Larmor, and Poincaré. However, the idea of an aether hidden from any observation was not supported by the  mainstream scientific community, therefore the aether theory of Lorentz and Poincaré was superseded by Einstein's special relativity which was subsequently formulated in the framework of four-dimensional spacetime by Minkowski.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Miller (1983), pp. 216–217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Warwick (2003), pp. 410–419, 469–475&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Paty (1987), pp. 145–147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Lodge (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Michelson (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Prokhovnik (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

Others such as [[Herbert E. Ives]] argued that it might be possible to experimentally determine the motion of such an aether,&lt;ref group=C&gt;Ives (1951)&lt;/ref&gt; but it was never found despite numerous experimental tests of Lorentz invariance (see [[tests of special relativity]]).

Also attempts to introduce some sort of relativistic aether (consistent with relativity) into modern physics such as by Einstein on the basis of general relativity (1920), or by [[Paul Dirac]] in relation to quantum mechanics (1951), were not supported by the scientific community (see [[Luminiferous aether#End of aether?]]).&lt;ref group=A&gt;Kragh (1990), pp. 189–205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Dirac (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Nobel Prize|Nobel lecture]], [[George F. Smoot]] (2006) described his own experiments on the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation]] anisotropy as "New Aether drift experiments". Smoot explained that "one problem to overcome was the strong prejudice of good scientists who learned the lesson of the Michelson and Morley experiment and Special Relativity that there were no preferred frames of reference." He continued that "there was an education job to convince them that this did not violate Special Relativity but did find a frame in which the expansion of the universe looked particularly simple."&lt;ref group=B&gt;Smoot (2006), pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative theories===
The theory of complete [[aether drag hypothesis|aether drag]], as proposed by [[George Gabriel Stokes]] (1844), was used by some critics as [[Ludwig Silberstein]] (1920) or [[Philipp Lenard]] (1920) as a counter-model of relativity. In this theory, the aether was completely dragged within and in the vicinity of matter, and it was believed that various phenomena, such as the absence of aether drift, could be explained in an "illustrative" way by this model. However, such theories are subject to great difficulties. Especially the [[aberration of light]] contradicted the theory, and all auxiliary hypotheses, which were invented to rescue it, are self-contradictory, extremely implausible, or in contradiction to other experiments like the [[Michelson–Gale–Pearson experiment]]. In summary, a sound mathematical and physical model of complete aether drag was never invented, consequently this theory was no serious alternative to relativity.&lt;ref group=B&gt;Joos (1959), pp. 448ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Michelson (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C name=lenard&gt;Lenard (1921a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Silberstein (1921a)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative was the so-called [[emission theory]] of light. As in special relativity the aether concept is discarded, yet the main difference from relativity lies in the fact that the velocity of the light source is added to that of light in accordance with the [[Galilean transformation]]. As the hypothesis of complete aether drag, it can explain the negative outcome of all aether drift experiments. Yet, there are various experiments that contradict this theory. For example, the [[Sagnac effect]] is based on the independence of light speed from the source velocity, and the image of [[Double star]]s should be scrambled according to this model—which was not observed. Also in modern experiments in particle accelerators no such velocity dependence could be observed.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Norton (2004), pp. 14–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;De Sitter (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Fox (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Ritz (1908)&lt;/ref&gt;  These results are further confirmed by the [[De Sitter double star experiment]] (1913), conclusively repeated in the X-ray spectrum by K. Brecher in 1977;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Brecher, K.|title=Is the speed of light independent of the velocity of the source|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=39|issue=17|year=1977|pages=1051–1054|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.39.1051|postscript=.|bibcode=1977PhRvL..39.1051B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the terrestrial experiment by Alväger, ''et al''. (1963);,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Alväger, T. |author2=Nilsson, A. |author3=Kjellman, J. |title=A Direct Terrestrial Test of the Second Postulate of Special Relativity|journal=Nature|volume=197|issue=4873|year=1963|pages=1191 |doi=10.1038/1971191a0|bibcode = 1963Natur.197.1191A}}&lt;/ref&gt; which all show that the speed of light is independent of the motion of the source within the limits of experimental accuracy.

===Principle of the constancy of the speed of light===
Some consider the ''principle of the constancy of the velocity of light'' insufficiently substantiated. However, as already shown by [[Robert Daniel Carmichael]] (1910) and others, the constancy of the speed of light can be interpreted as a natural consequence of ''two'' experimentally demonstrated facts:&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 343–348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Carmichael (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;

# The velocity of light is independent of the ''velocity of the source'', as demonstrated by [[De Sitter double star experiment]], [[Sagnac effect]], and many others (see [[emission theory]]).
# The velocity of light is independent of the direction of ''velocity of the observer'', as demonstrated by [[Michelson–Morley experiment]], [[Kennedy–Thorndike experiment]], and many others (see [[luminiferous aether]]).

Note that measurements regarding the speed of light are actually measurements of the two-way speed of light, since the [[one-way speed of light]] depends on which convention is chosen to synchronize the clocks.

==General relativity==

===General covariance===
Einstein emphasized the importance of [[general covariance]] for the development of general relativity, and took the position that the general covariance of his 1915 theory of gravity ensured implementation of a generalized relativity principle.  This view was challenged by [[Erich Kretschmann]] (1917), who argued that every theory of space and time (even including Newtonian dynamics) can be formulated in a covariant way, if additional parameters are included, and thus general covariance of a theory would in itself be insufficient to implement a generalized relativity principle. Although Einstein (1918) agreed with that argument, he also countered that Newtonian mechanics in general covariant form would be too complicated for practical uses. Although it is now understood that Einstein's response to Kretschmann was mistaken (subsequent papers showed that such a theory would still be usable), another argument can be made in favor of general covariance: it is a natural way to express the [[equivalence principle]], ''i.e.'', the equivalence in the description of a free-falling observer and an observer at rest, and thus it is more convenient to use general covariance together with general relativity, rather than with Newtonian mechanics. Connected with this, also the question of absolute motion was dealt with. Einstein argued that the general covariance of his theory of gravity supports [[Mach's principle]], which would eliminate any "absolute motion" within general relativity. However, as pointed out by [[Willem de Sitter]] in 1916, Mach's principle is not completely fulfilled in general relativity because there exist matter-free solutions of the field equations. This means that the "inertio-gravitational field", which describes both gravity and inertia, can exist in the absence of gravitating matter. However, as pointed out by Einstein, there is one fundamental difference between this concept and absolute space of Newton: the inertio-gravitational field of general relativity is determined by matter, thus it is not absolute.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Janssen (2008), pp. 3–4, 17–18, 28–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Norton (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Einstein (1916)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;De Sitter (1916ab)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Kretschmann (1917)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Einstein (1920, 1924)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bad Nauheim Debate===
In the "Bad Nauheim Debate" (1920) between Einstein and (among others) [[Philipp Lenard]], the latter stated the following objections: He criticized the lack of "illustrativeness" of Einstein's version of relativity, a condition that he suggested could only be met by an aether theory. Einstein responded that for physicists the content of "illustrativeness" or "[[common sense]]" had changed in time, so it could no longer be used as a criterion for the validity of a physical theory. Lenard also argued that with his relativistic theory of gravity Einstein had tacitly reintroduced the aether  under the name "space". While this charge was rejected (among others) by [[Hermann Weyl]], in an inaugural address given at the University of Leiden in 1920, shortly after the Bad Nauheim debates, Einstein himself acknowledged that according to his general theory of relativity, so-called "empty space" possesses physical properties that influence matter and ''vice versa''. Lenard also argued that Einstein's general theory of relativity admits the existence of superluminal velocities, in contradiction to the principles of special relativity; for example, in a rotating coordinate system in which the Earth is at rest, the distant points of the whole universe are rotating around Earth with superluminal velocities. However, as been pointed out by Weyl, it's not possible to handle a rotating extended system as a rigid body (neither in special nor in general relativity)—so the [[signal velocity]] of an object never exceeds the speed of light. Another criticism that was raised by both Lenard and [[Gustav Mie]] concerned the existence of "fictitious" gravitational fields in accelerating frames, which according to Einstein's Equivalence Principle are no less physically real than those produced by material sources. Lenard and Mie argued that physical forces can only be produced by real material sources, while the gravitational field that Einstein supposed to exist in an accelerating frame of reference has no concrete physical meaning. Einstein responded that, based on [[Mach's principle]], one can think of these gravitational fields as induced by the distant masses. In this respect the criticism of Lenard and Mie has been vindicated, since according to the modern consensus, in agreement with Einstein's own mature views, Mach's principle as originally conceived by Einstein is not actually supported by general relativity, as already mentioned above.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Goenner (1993a), pp. 124–128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C name=nau&gt;Lenard, Einstein, Gehrcke, Weyl (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silberstein–Einstein controversy===
[[Ludwik Silberstein]], who initially was a supporter of the special theory, objected at different occasions against general relativity. In 1920 he argued that the deflection of light by the sun, as observed by [[Arthur Eddington]] et al. (1919), is not necessarily a confirmation of general relativity, but may also be explained by the [[Hamar experiment|Stokes-Planck theory]] of complete aether drag. However, such models are in contradiction with the [[aberration of light]] and other experiments (see "Alternative theories"). In 1935, Silberstein claimed to have found a contradiction in the [[Two-body problem in general relativity]]. However, also this claim was refuted by Einstein and Rosen (1935).&lt;ref group=A&gt;Havas (1993), pp. 97–120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Einstein/Rosen (1936)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Silberstein (1936)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical criticism==
The consequences of relativity, such as the change of ordinary concepts of space and time, as well as the introduction of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] in general relativity, were criticized by some philosophers of different [[List of schools of philosophy|philosophical schools]]. It was characteristic for many philosophical critics that they had insufficient knowledge of the mathematical and formal basis of relativity,&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), Chapter 6.2, pp. 555–557&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the criticisms often missing the heart of the matter. For example, relativity was misinterpreted as some form of [[relativism]]. However, this is misleading as it was emphasized by Einstein or Planck. On one hand it's true that space and time became relative, and the inertial frames of reference are handled on equal footing. On the other hand, the theory makes natural laws invariant—examples are the constancy of the speed of light, or the covariance of Maxwell's equations. Consequently, [[Felix Klein]] (1910) called it the "invariant theory of the Lorentz group" instead of relativity theory, and Einstein (who reportedly used expressions like "absolute theory") sympathized with this expression as well.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 92–105, 401–419&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Klein (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Petzoldt (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Planck (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical responses to relativity were also expressed by proponents of [[Neo-Kantianism]] ([[Paul Natorp]], [[Bruno Bauch]], etc.), and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] ([[Oskar Becker]], [[Moritz Geiger]] etc.). While some of them only rejected the philosophical consequences, others rejected also the physical consequences of the theory. Einstein was criticized for violating [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[Category (Kant)|categoric]] scheme, ''i.e.'', it was claimed that space-time curvature caused by matter and energy is impossible, since matter and energy already require the concepts of space and time. Also the three-dimensionality of space, Euclidean geometry, and the existence of absolute simultaneity were claimed to be necessary for the understanding of the world; none of them can possibly be altered by empirical findings. By moving all those concepts into a metaphysical area, any form of criticism of [[Kantianism]] would be prevented. Other pseudo-Kantians like [[Ernst Cassirer]] or [[Hans Reichenbach]] (1920), tried to modify Kant's philosophy. Subsequently, Reichenbach rejected Kantianism at all and became a proponent of [[logical positivism]].&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 199–239, 254–268, 507–526&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Reichenbach (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Cassirer (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Natorp (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Linke (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Friedlaender (1932)&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on [[Henri Poincaré]]'s [[conventionalism]], philosophers such as [[Pierre Duhem]] (1914) or [[Hugo Dingler]] (1920) argued that the classical concepts of space, time, and geometry were, and will always be, the most convenient expressions in natural science, therefore the concepts of relativity cannot be correct. This was criticized by proponents of [[logical positivism]] such as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], or Reichenbach. They argued that Poincaré's conventionalism could be modified, as to bring it into accord with relativity. Although it is true that the basic assumptions of Newtonian mechanics are simpler, it can only be brought into accord with modern experiments by inventing auxiliary hypotheses. On the other hand, relativity doesn't need such hypotheses, thus from a conceptual viewpoint, relativity is in fact simpler than Newtonian mechanics.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 293–336&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Schlick (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Reichenbach (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Dingler (1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of [[Philosophy of Life]], [[Vitalism]], [[Critical realism (philosophy of perception)|Critical realism]] (in German speaking countries) argued that there is a fundamental difference between physical, biological and psychological phenomena. For example, [[Henri Bergson]] (1921), who otherwise was a proponent of special relativity, argued that [[time dilation]] cannot be applied to biological organisms, therefore he denied the relativistic solution of the [[twin paradox]]. However, those claims were rejected by [[Paul Langevin]], [[André Metz]] and others. Biological organisms consist of physical processes, so there is no reason to assume that they are not subject to relativistic effects like time dilation.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 240–243, 441–455&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Metz (1923)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Bergson (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the philosophy of [[Fictionalism]], the philosopher [[Oskar Kraus]] (1921) and others claimed that the foundations of relativity were only fictitious and even self-contradictory. Examples were the constancy of the speed of light, time dilation, length contraction. These effects appear to be mathematically consistent as a whole, but in reality they allegedly are not true. Yet, this view was immediately rejected. The foundations of relativity (such as the equivalence principle or the relativity principle) are not fictitious, but based on experimental results. Also, effects like constancy of the speed of light and relativity of simultaneity are not contradictory, but complementary to one another.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 276–292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Kraus (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Soviet Union (mostly in the 1920s), philosophical criticism was expressed on the basis of [[dialectic materialism]]. The theory of relativity was rejected as anti-materialistic and speculative, and a mechanistic worldview based on "[[common sense]]" was required as an alternative. Similar criticisms also occurred in the [[People's Republic of China]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. (On the other hand, other philosophers considered relativity as being compatible with [[Marxism]].)&lt;ref group=A name=vizgin&gt;Vizgin/Gorelik (1987), pp. 265–326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=hu&gt;Hu (2007), 549–555&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relativity hype and popular criticism==
Although Planck already in 1909 compared the changes brought about by relativity with the [[Copernican Revolution]], and although special relativity was accepted by most of the theoretical physicists and mathematicians by 1911, it was not before publication of the experimental results of the eclipse expeditions (1919) by a group around [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] that relativity was noticed by the public. Following Eddington's publication of the eclipse results, Einstein was glowingly praised in the mass media, and was compared to [[Nikolaus Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]], which caused a popular "relativity hype" ("Relativitätsrummel", as it was called by Sommerfeld, Einstein, and others). This triggered a counter-reaction of some scientists and scientific laymen who could not accept the concepts of modern physics, including relativity theory and quantum mechanics. The ensuing public controversy regarding the scientific status of Einstein's theory of gravity, which was unprecedented, was partly carried out in the press. Some of the criticism was not only directed to relativity, but personally at Einstein as well, who some of his critics accused of being behind the promotional campaign in the German press. &lt;ref group=A name=goenner1&gt;Goenner (1993a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=wazeck /&gt;

===Academic and non-academic criticism===
Some academic scientists, especially experimental physicists such as the Nobel laureates [[Philipp Lenard]] and [[Johannes Stark]], as well as [[Ernst Gehrcke]], [[Stjepan Mohorovičić]], [[Rudolf Tomaschek]] and others criticized the increasing abstraction and mathematization of modern physics, especially in the form of [[relativity theory]], and later [[quantum mechanics]]. It was seen as a tendency to abstract theory building, connected with the loss of intuitive "[[common sense]]". In fact, relativity was the first theory, in which the inadequacy of the "illustrative" classical physics was thought to have been demonstrated. Some of Einstein's critics ignored these developments and tried to revitalize older theories, such as aether drag models or emission theories (see "Alternative Theories"). However, those qualitative models were never sufficiently advanced to compete with the success of the precise experimental predictions and explanatory powers of the modern theories. Additionally, there was also a great rivalry between experimental and theoretical physicists, as regards the professorial activities and the occupation of chairs at German universities. The opinions clashed at the "[[Bad Nauheim]] debates" in 1920 between Einstein and (among others) Lenard, which attracted much attention in the public.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 74–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=goenner1 /&gt;&lt;ref group=C name=nau /&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Gehrcke (1924a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Mohorovičić (1923)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there were many critics (with or without physical training) whose ideas were far outside the scientific mainstream. These critics were mostly people who had developed their ideas long before the publication of Einstein's version of relativity, and they tried to resolve in a straightforward manner some or all of the enigmas of the world. Therefore, Wazeck (who studied some German examples) gave to these "free researchers" the name "world riddle solver" ("Welträtsellöser", such as Arvid Reuterdahl, Hermann Fricke or Johann Heinrich Ziegler). Their views had their quite different roots in [[monism]], [[Lebensreform]], or [[occultism]]. Their views were typically characterized by the fact that they practically rejected the entire terminology and the (primarily mathematical) methods of modern science. Their works were published by private publishers, or in popular and non-specialist journals. It was significant for many "free researchers" (especially the monists) to explain all phenomena by intuitive and illustrative mechanical (or electrical) models, which also found its expression in their defense of the aether. For this reason they objected to the abstractness and inscrutability of the relativity theory, which was considered a pure calculation method that cannot reveal the true reasons underlying the phenomena. The "free researchers" often used [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation]], in which gravity is caused by some sort of "aether pressure" or "mass pressure from a distance". Such models were regarded as an illustrative alternative to the abstract mathematical theories of gravitation of both Newton and Einstein. Additionally, also the enormous self-confidence of the "free researchers" is noteworthy, since they not only believed to have solved all the riddles of the world, but also had the expectation that they would rapidly convince the scientific community.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Wazeck (2009), pp. 27–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Fricke (1919)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Ziegler (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Reuterdahl (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Einstein rarely defended himself against these attacks, this task was undertaken by other relativity theoreticians, who (according to Hentschel) formed some sort of "defensive belt" around Einstein. Some representatives were [[Max von Laue]], [[Max Born]], etc. and on popular-scientific and philosophical level [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[André Metz]] etc., who led many discussions with critics in semi-popular journals and newspapers. However, most of these discussions failed from the start. Physicists like Gehrcke, some philosophers, and the "free researchers" were so obsessed with their own ideas and prejudices that they were unable to grasp the basics of relativity; consequently, the participants of the discussions were talking past each other. In fact, the theory that was criticized by them was not relativity at all, but rather a caricature of it. The "free researchers" were mostly ignored by the scientific community, but also, in time, respected physicists such as Lenard and Gehrcke found themselves in a position outside the scientific community. However, the critics didn't believe that this was due to their incorrect theories, but rather due to a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] of the relativistic physicists (and in the 1920s &amp; 1930s of the [[Jew]]s as well), which allegedly tried to put down the critics, and to preserve and improve their own positions within the academic world. For example, Gehrcke (1920/24) held that the propagation of relativity is a product of some sort of mass [[Hypnosis|suggestion]]. Therefore, he instructed a [[media monitoring service]] to collect over 5000 newspaper clippings which were related to relativity, and published his findings in a book. However, Gehrcke's claims were rejected, because the simple existence of the "relativity hype" says nothing about the validity of the theory, and thus it cannot used for or against relativity.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 163–195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Wazeck (2009), pp. 113–193, 217–292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Gehrcke (1924b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterward, some critics tried to improve their positions by the formation of [[Voluntary association|alliances]]. One of them was the "Academy of Nations", which was founded in 1921 in the USA by [[Robert T. Browne]] and [[Arvid Reuterdahl]]. Other members were [[Thomas Jefferson Jackson See]] and as well as Gehrcke and Mohorovičić in Germany. It is unknown whether other American critics such as [[Charles Lane Poor]], [[Charles Francis Brush]], [[Dayton Miller]] were also members. The alliance disappeared as early as the mid-1920s in Germany and by 1930 in the USA.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Wazeck (2009), pp. 293–378&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chauvinism and antisemitism===
Shortly before and during World War I, there appeared some nationalistically motivated criticisms of relativity and modern physics. For example, [[Pierre Duhem]] regarded relativity as the product of the "too formal and abstract" German spirit, which was in conflict with the "common sense". Similarly, popular criticism in the Soviet Union and China, which partly was politically organized, rejected the theory not because of factual objections, but as ideologically motivated as the product of western decadence.&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 123–131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=vizgin /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=hu /&gt;

So in those countries, the Germans or the Western civilization were the enemies. However, in Germany the [[Jewish]] ancestry of some leading relativity proponents such as Einstein and Minkowski made them targets of racially minded critics, although many of Einstein's German critics did not show evidence of such motives. The engineer [[Paul Weyland]], a known nationalistic agitator, arranged the first public meeting against relativity in Berlin in 1919. While Lenard and Stark were also known for their nationalistic opinions, they declined to participate in Weyland's rallies, and Weyland's campaign eventually fizzled out due to a lack of prominent speakers. Lenard and others instead responded to Einstein's challenge to his professional critics to debate his theories at the scientific conference held annually at Bad Nauheim. While Einstein's critics, assuming without any real justification that Einstein was behind the activities of the German press in promoting the triumph of relativity, generally avoided antisemitic attacks in their earlier publications, it later became clear to many observers that antisemitism did play a significant role in some of the attacks.

Reacting to this underlying mood, Einstein himself openly speculated in a newspaper article that in addition to insufficient knowledge of theoretical physics, antisemitism at least partly motivated their criticisms. Some critics, including Weyland, reacted angrily and claimed that such accusations of antisemitism were only made to force the critics into silence. However, subsequently Weyland, Lenard, Stark and others clearly showed their antisemitic biases by beginning to combine their criticisms with [[racism]]. For example, [[Theodor Fritsch]] emphasized the alleged negative consequences of the "Jewish spirit" within relativity physics, and the [[Far-right politics|far right]]-press continued this propaganda unhindered. After the murder of [[Walther Rathenau]] (1922) and murder threats against Einstein, he left Berlin for some time. Gehrcke's book on "The mass suggestion of relativity theory" (1924) was not antisemitic itself, but it was praised by the far-right press as describing an alleged typical Jewish behavior, which was also imputed to Einstein personally. [[Philipp Lenard]] in 1922 spoke about the "foreign spirit" as the foundation of relativity, and afterward he joined the [[Nazi party]] in 1924; [[Johannes Stark]] did the same in 1930. Both were proponents of the so-called [[Deutsche Physik|German Physics]], which only accepted scientific knowledge based on experiments, and only if accessible to the senses. According to Lenard (1936), this is the "[[Aryanism|Aryan]] physics or physics by man of [[Nordic race|Nordic kind]]" as opposed to the alleged formal-dogmatic "Jewish physics". Additional antisemitic critics can be found in the writings of [[Wilhelm Müller (physicist)|Wilhelm Müller]], [[Bruno Thüring]] and others. For example, Müller erroneously claimed that relativity was a purely "Jewish affair" and it would correspond to the "Jewish essence" etc., while Thüring made comparisons between the [[Talmud]] and relativity.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;Kleinert (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="A"&gt;Beyerchen (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="A"&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 131–150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="A" name="goenner1" /&gt;&lt;ref group="A"&gt;Posch (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="A"&gt;Wazeck (2009), pp. 271–392&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="B"&gt;Einstein (1920a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="C"&gt;Lenard (1936)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="C"&gt;Stark/Müller (1941)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="C"&gt;Thüring (1941)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of plagiarism and priority discussions===
Some of Einstein's critics, like Lenard, Gehrcke and Reuterdahl, accused him of plagiarism, and questioned his priority claims to the authorship of relativity theory. The thrust of such allegations was to promote more traditional alternatives to Einstein's abstract hypothetico-deductive approach to physics, while Einstein himself was to be personally discredited. It was argued by Einstein's supporters that such personal accusations were unwarranted, since the physical content and the applicability of former theories were quite different from Einstein's theory of relativity. However, others argued that between them Poincaré and Lorentz had earlier published several of the core elements of Einstein's 1905 relativity paper, including a generalized relativity principle that was intended by Poincaré to apply to all physics. Some examples:&lt;ref group=A&gt;Hentschel (1990), pp. 150–162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Wazeck (2009), pp. 194–216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Laue (1917)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Laue (1921b)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Gehrcke (1916)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Lenard (1921b)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Johann Georg von Soldner]] (1801) was credited for his calculation of the [[Tests of general relativity|deflection of light]] in the vicinity of celestial bodies, long before Einstein's prediction which was based on general relativity. However, Soldner's derivation has nothing to do with Einstein's, since it was fully based on Newton's theory, and only gave half of the value as predicted by general relativity.
* [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) published a formula for the perihelion advance of Mercury, which was formally identical to an approximate solution given by Einstein. However, since Einstein's formula was only an approximation, the solutions are not identical. In addition, Gerber's derivation has no connection with General relativity and was even considered as meaningless.
* [[Woldemar Voigt]] (1887) derived a [[History of Lorentz transformations|transformation]], which is very similar to the [[Lorentz transformation]]. As Voigt himself acknowledged, his theory was not based on electromagnetic theory, but on an elastic aether model. His transformation also violates the relativity principle.
* [[Friedrich Hasenöhrl]] (1904) applied the concept of [[electromagnetic mass]] and momentum (which were known long before) to cavity- and thermal radiation. Yet, the applicability of Einstein's [[Mass–energy equivalence]] goes much further, since it is derived from the relativity principle and applies to all forms of energy.
* [[Menyhért Palágyi]] (1901) developed a philosophical "space-time" model in which time plays the role of an imaginary fourth dimension. Palágyi's model was only a reformulation of Newtonian physics, and had no connection to electromagnetic theory, the relativity principle, or to the constancy of the speed of light.

Some contemporary historians of science have revived the question as to whether Einstein was possibly influenced by the ideas of Poincaré, who first stated the relativity principle and applied it to electrodynamics, developing interpretations and modifications of Lorentz's electron theory that appear to have anticipated what is now called special relativity. &lt;ref group=A&gt;Darrigol (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Another discussion concerns a possible mutual influence between Einstein and [[David Hilbert]] as regards completing the [[Einstein field equations|field equations]] of general relativity (see [[Relativity priority dispute]]).

===''A Hundred Authors Against Einstein''===
A collection of various criticisms can be found in the book ''Hundert Autoren gegen Einstein'' (''A Hundred Authors Against Einstein''), published in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1=Israel, Hans |editor2=Ruckhaber, Erich |editor3=Weinmann, Rudolf | year=1931 | title=Hundert Autoren gegen Einstein | location=Leipzig | publisher=Voigtländer | url=https://archive.org/details/HundertAutorenGegenEinstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains very short texts from 28 authors, and excerpts from the publications of another 19 authors. The rest consists of a list that also includes people who only for some time were opposed to relativity. Besides philosophic objections (mostly based on [[Kantianism]]), also some alleged elementary failures of the theory were included; however, as some commented, those failures were due to the authors' misunderstanding of relativity. For example, [[Hans Reichenbach]] described the book as an "accumulation of naive errors", and as "unintentionally funny". Albert von Brunn interpreted the book as a backward step to the 16th and 17th century, and Einstein said, in response to the book, that if he were wrong, then one author would have been enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Goenner, the contributions to the book are a mixture of mathematical–physical incompetence, [[hubris]], and the feelings of the critics of being suppressed by contemporary physicists advocating for the new theory. The compilation of the authors show, Goenner continues, that this was not a reaction within the physics community—only one physicist (Karl Strehl) and three mathematicians ([[Jean-Marie Le Roux]], [[Emanuel Lasker]] and [[Hjalmar Mellin]]) were present—but a reaction of an inadequately educated academic citizenship, which didn't know what to do with relativity. As regards the average age of the authors: 57% were substantially older than Einstein, one third was around the same age, and only two persons were substantially younger.&lt;ref name=goenner2 group=A /&gt; Two authors (Reuterdahl, von Mitis) were antisemitic and four others were possibly connected to the Nazi movement. On the other hand, no antisemitic expression can be found in the book, and it also included contributions of some authors of Jewish ancestry (Salomo Friedländer, Ludwig Goldschmidt, Hans Israel, [[Emanuel Lasker]], [[Oskar Kraus]], [[Menyhért Palágyi]]).&lt;ref name=goenner2 group=A&gt;Goenner (1993b)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=A&gt;Wazeck (2009), pp. 356–361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=C&gt;Israel et al. (1931)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of criticism==
{{See also|Tests of special relativity|Tests of general relativity}}

The theory of relativity is considered to be self-consistent, is consistent with many experimental results, and serves as the basis of many successful theories like [[quantum electrodynamics]]. Therefore, fundamental criticism (like that of [[Herbert Dingle]], [[Louis Essen]], [[Petr Beckmann]], [[Maurice Allais]] and [[Tom van Flandern]]) has not been taken seriously by the scientific community, and due to the lack of quality of many critical publications (found in the process of [[peer review]]) they were rarely accepted for publication in reputable scientific journals. Just as in the 1920s, most critical works are published in small publications houses, alternative journals (like "Apeiron" or "Galilean Electrodynamics"), or private websites.&lt;ref group=A name=farrell /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=wazeck2 /&gt; Consequently, where criticism of relativity has been dealt with by the scientific community, it has mostly been in historical studies.&lt;ref group=A name=hentschel /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=goenner /&gt;&lt;ref group=A name=wazeck /&gt;

However, this does not mean that there is no further development in modern physics. The progress of technology over time has led to extremely precise ways of testing the predictions of relativity, and so far it has successfully passed all tests (such as in particle accelerators to test special relativity, and by astronomical observations to test general relativity). In addition, in the theoretical field there is continuing research intended to unite general relativity and quantum theory. The most promising models are [[string theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]]. Some variations of those models also predict violations of Lorentz invariance on a very small scale.&lt;ref group=B&gt;Mattingly (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=will group=B&gt;Will (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=B&gt;Liberati (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dinosaur in a Haystack''''' (1995) is the seventh volume of collected essays by the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]]. The essays were culled from his monthly column "The View of Life" published in ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine, which Gould contributed for 27 years. The book deals with themes familiar to Gould's writing: evolution, science biography, probabilities, and strange oddities found in nature. 

His essay "Poe's Greatest Hit" analyzes the controversial [[conchology]] textbook ''[[The Conchologist's First Book]]'' (1839), edited by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Poe's volume on natural history sold out within two months, and was his only book republished during his lifetime. Essay "Dinomania" is a review of [[Michael Crichton]]'s [[Jurassic Park (novel)|novel]] and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s blockbuster [[Jurassic Park (film)|film]], ''[[Jurassic Park]]''.

==Reception==
Gould's book received favorable reviews in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-517-70393-9 | title=Dinosaur in a Haystack review |author=[[Publishers Weekly]] | publisher=''Publishers Weekly'' | accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phillip Lopate|Lopate, Phillip]] (1996).

'''''Diseases from Space''''' is a book published in 1979 that authored by astronomers [[Fred Hoyle]] and [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]], where they propose that many of the most common diseases which afflict humanity, such as [[influenza]], the common cold and [[whooping cough]], have their origins in extraterrestrial sources. The two authors argue the case for [[outer space]] being the main source for these pathogens- or at least their causative agents.&lt;ref name="kirjasto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hoyle.htm |title=Fred Hoyle |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115125017/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hoyle.htm |archivedate=15 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senns.demon.co.uk/COMWEB2.html |title=Comets, Contagion And Contingency |publisher=Senns.demon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/W/Wickramasinghe.html |title=Wickramasinghe, Chandra (1939-) |publisher=Daviddarling.info |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The claim connecting terrestrial disease and extraterrestrial pathogens was rejected by the scientific community.

== Overview ==

[[Fred Hoyle]] and [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] spent over 20 years investigating the nature and composition of [[interstellar dust]]. Though many hypotheses regarding this dust had been postulated by various astronomers since the middle of the 19th century, all were found to be wanting as and when new data on the gas and dust clouds became available. probably polymers.  [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] proposed the existence of polymeric composition based on the molecule [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO).&lt;ref&gt;N.C. Wickramasinghe, Formaldehyde Polymers in Interstellar Space, Nature,  252, 462, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 Wickramasinghe first proposed the hypothesis that some dust in interstellar space was largely [[Organic compound|organic]] (containing carbon and nitrogen),&lt;ref&gt;''Nature'', vol: 252,  462, 1974; and ''Nature'', Vol 268, 610, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AXV-20141219"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruaud |first1=M. |last2=Loison |first2=J.C. |last3=Hickson |first3=K.M. |last4=Gratier |first4=P. |last5=Hersant |first5=F. |last6=Wakelam |first6=V. |title=Modeling Complex Organic Molecules in dense regions: Eley-Rideal and complex induced reaction |year=2015 |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=447 |issue=4 |pages=4004–4017 |arxiv=1412.6256 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stu2709 |bibcode=2015MNRAS.447.4004R}}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed this up with other research confirming the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Wickramasinghe, D. T. &amp; Allen, D. A. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v287/n5782/abs/287518a0.html ''The 3.4-µm interstellar absorption feature.''] Nature 287, 518−519 (1980). Allen, D. A. &amp; Wickramasinghe, D. T. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v294/n5838/abs/294239a0.html ''Diffuse interstellar absorption bands between 2.9 and 4.0 µm.''] Nature 294, 239−240 (1981). Wickramasinghe, D. T. &amp; Allen, D. A. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00653492 ''Three components of 3–4 μm absorption bands.''] Astrophys. Space Sci. 97, 369−378 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Wickramasinghe also proposed and confirmed the existence of polymeric compounds based on the molecule [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO).&lt;ref&gt;N.C. Wickramasinghe, Formaldehyde Polymers in Interstellar Space, Nature,  252, 462, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Hoyle]] and Wickramasinghe later proposed the identification of bicyclic aromatic compounds from an analysis of the ultraviolet extinction absorption at 2175A.,&lt;ref&gt;F. Hoyle and N.C. Wickramasinghe, Identification of the lambda 2200A interstellar absorption feature, Nature, 270, 323, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; thus demonstrating the existence of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] molecules in space.

Hoyle and Wickramasinghe went further and speculated that the overall [[spectroscopic]] data of cosmic dust and gas clouds also matched those for desiccated bacteria. This led them to conclude that diseases such as [[influenza]] and the [[common cold]] are incident from space and fall upon the Earth in what they term "pathogenic patches." Hoyle and Wickramasinghe viewed the process of [[evolution]] in a manner at variance with the standard [[Darwinian]] model. They speculated that [[genetic material]] in the form of incoming [[pathogens]] from the [[cosmos]] provided the mechanism for driving the evolutionary engine.&lt;ref name="kirjasto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/cosmic_reference/dust.html |title=Cool Cosmos |publisher=Coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoyle passed away in 2001, and Wickramasinghe still advocates for these views and beliefs.

== Rejected by scientific consensus ==

The claim connecting terrestrial disease and extraterrestrial pathogens was rejected and dismissed by the scientific community.&lt;ref name="Byrne2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Patrick Byrne|title=Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Pvi-ksuKFIC&amp;pg=PA454|year=2008| publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34102-1| pages=454–455}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May 2003 ''[[The Lancet]]'' journal published a letter from Wickramasinghe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wickramasinghe|first=C|author2=Wainwright, M |author3=Narlikar, J |title=SARS&amp;mdash;a clue to its origins?|journal=Lancet|date=May 24, 2003|volume=361|issue=9371|pages=1832|pmid=12781581|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13440-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; jointly signed by Milton Wainwright and [[Jayant Narlikar]], in which they speculate that the [[virus]] that causes [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) could be extraterrestrial in origin instead of originating from chickens. ''The Lancet'' subsequently published three responses to this letter, showing that the hypothesis was not evidence-based, and casting doubts on the quality of the experiments referenced by Wickramasinghe in his letter.&lt;ref name=Willerslev&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willerslev|first=E|author2=Hansen, AJ |author3=Rønn, R |author4= Nielsen, OJ |title=Panspermia--true or false?|journal=Lancet|date=Aug 2, 2003|volume=362|issue=9381|pages=406; author reply 407–8|pmid=12907025|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14039-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bhargava&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhargava|first=PM|title=Panspermia--true or false?|journal=Lancet|date=Aug 2, 2003|volume=362|issue=9381|pages=407; author reply 407–8|pmid=12907028|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14041-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PdL&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ponce de Leon|first=S|author2=Lazcano, A|title=Panspermia--true or false?|journal=Lancet|date=Aug 2, 2003|volume=362|issue=9381|pages=406–7; author reply 407–8|pmid=12907026|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(03)14040-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7151">'''Domestication theory''' is an approach in [[science and technology studies]] and [[media studies]] that describe the processes by which innovations, especially new [[technology]] is 'tamed' or appropriated by its users. First, technologies are integrated into everyday life and adapted to daily practices. Secondly, the user and its environment change and adapt accordingly. Thirdly, these adaptations feedback into innovation processes in industry, shaping the next generation of technologies and services.
The theory was initially developed to help understand the adoption and use of new media technologies by households (Silverstone et al. 1992), but has since been expanded in the innovation literature as a tool to understand technologies and innovations entering any consuming unit (workplace, country etc. e.g. Lie et al., Habib, Punie, Sørensen) that can be analysed economically, culturally and sociologically. The domestication approach considers both the practical and the symbolic aspects of the adoption and use of technologies, showing how these two elements- the meanings of things, and their materiality, are equally important understanding how technologies become part of everyday life.  It is a foremost a social theory as it highlights the negotiations, challenges to power and control, rule-making and breaking that accompany the introduction of technologies into any social setting.

One variant of domestication theory identified three stages of technology being adapted by users. According to Nancy K. Baym, these three stages are (1) initially marvelous and strange, (2) then become capable of creating greatness and horror and (3) and are then so ordinary as to be invisible (Baym, 2015). This can also be thought of as (1) euphoria, (2) moral panic, and (3) domestication. An example of this is the introduction of video games into society. Initially, there was a euphoric response to video games as it had the potential to improve hand, eye, and brain coordination. Then, moral panic set in and there was a fear of violence, addiction, and obesity. Lastly, there was a domestication of video games with acceptance of the technology as an ordinary part of society. 

The Domestication approach has roots in cultural studies of media use, but is informed by [[Science and technology studies]], [[gender studies]] of household technology, sociology of [[everyday life]], consumption studies and [[innovation]] studies, and has been most widely used in studying the mass adoption of computers, the internet and mobile phones.

As a strand of the [[Social shaping of technology]] approach to understanding how technology is created, Domestication theory highlights the role of users in innovation - the work done by individuals and communities in order to make a technology from the outside do practical work, and make sense within that community. This strand of work  links to the role of end users, lead users etc. in long term innovation processes (Williams et al. 2004).

Domestication studies are generally done using qualitative methods, such as long interviews and [[ethnography]] to explore the emerging meanings of technologies, and the changing routines, and conflicts that would not normally be accessible to quantitative methods.

The Domestication approach uses a number of different concepts to distinguish various aspects of the process. For example: Appropriation is the process of bringing a technology into a household, or another local cultural context; Conversion is the remaking of the meanings, or values and norms associated with the technology and the transfer of these back to the 'outside' world.

The principal criticism of the domestication approach is its reliance on detailed case studies, and its rather descriptive approach which is difficult to turn into prescriptive lessons of the type required by business and policy makers.  However, this rich-descriptive approach is also its strength: it enables processes and the complex interplay of artifacts and cultural values to be explored in much  more depth than individualistic, quantitative methods.

The Domestication approach, describing the integration of technologies into social relationships and structures using evidence obtained using qualitative methods, stands in sharp contrast to individualistic and quantitative approaches (such as [[Technology acceptance model]]) of North-American marketing and IS research, that draw on primarily psychological models.

It involves the use of either solid filiform needles or hollow-core hypodermic needles for therapy of muscle pain, including pain related to [[myofascial pain syndrome]]. Dry needling is sometimes also known as intramuscular stimulation (IMS).&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

While many studies have been performed to test the [[efficacy]] of dry needling as a treatment for muscle pain, there remains no scientific consensus as to whether  or not it is effective.&lt;ref name="ebsco01"/&gt; Some results suggest that it is an effective treatment for certain kinds of muscle pain, while other studies have shown no benefit compared to a [[placebo]]. There are not enough high-quality studies of the technique to draw clear conclusions about its efficacy.

== Origin ==
The origin of the term "dry needling" is attributed to [[Janet G. Travell]]. In her book, ''Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: Trigger Point Manual'', Travell uses the term "dry needling" to differentiate between two hypodermic needle techniques when performing [[Myofascial trigger point|trigger point]] therapy. However, Travell did not elaborate on the details on the techniques of dry needling; the current techniques of dry needling were based on the traditional and western medical acupuncture. The two techniques Travell described are the injection of a local anesthetic and the mechanical use of a hypodermic needle without injecting a solution (Travell, Simons, &amp; Simons, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;154–155). Travell preferred a 22-gauge, 1.5-in hypodermic needle for [[Myofascial trigger point|trigger point]] therapy and used this needle for both injection therapy and dry needling. Travell never used an acupuncture needle. Travell had access to acupuncture needles but reasoned that they were far too thin for [[Myofascial trigger point|trigger point]] therapy. She preferred hypodermic needles because of their strength and tactile feedback: "A 22-gauge, 3.8-cm (1.5-in) needle is usually suitable for most superficial muscles. In hyperalgesic patients, a 25-gauge, 3.8-cm (1.5-in) needle may cause less discomfort, but will not provide the clear "feel" of the structures being penetrated by the needle and is more likely to be deflected by the dense contraction knots that are the target... A 27-gauge needle, 3.8-cm (1.5-in) needle is even more flexible; the tip is more likely to be deflected by the contraction knots and it provides less tactile feedback for precision injection" (Travell, Simons, &amp; Simons, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;156).

The use of a hypodermic needle for dry needling was described by Chang-Zern Hong in his research paper on "Lidocaine Injection Versus Dry Needling to Myofascial Trigger Point". In his research, he describes the procedure for [[Myofascial trigger point|trigger point]] or MTrP injection and dry needling by using a 27-gauge hypodermic needle {{frac|1|1|4}}-in long (Hong, 1994). Both Travell and Hong used hypodermic needles for dry needling. Hong, like Travell, did not use an acupuncture needle for dry needling.

Although dry needling originally utilized only hypodermic needles due to the concern that solid needles had neither the strength or tactile feedback that hypodermic needles provided and that the needle could be deflected by "dense contraction knots", those concerns have proven unfounded and many healthcare practitioners who perform dry needling have found that the acupuncture needles not only provides better tactile feedback but also penetrate the "dense muscle knots" better and are easier to manage and caused less discomfort to patients. For that reason, both the use of hypodermic needles and the use of acupuncture needles are now accepted in dry needling practice.  Ofttimes practitioners who use hypodermic needles also provide [[Myofascial trigger point|trigger point]] injection treatment to patients and therefore find the use of hypodermic needles a better choice. As their use became more common, some dry needling practitioners without acupuncture in their scope of practice, started to refer to these needles by their technical design term as "solid filiform needles" as opposed to the FDA designation "acupuncture needle".

The "solid filiform needle" used in dry needling is regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device described in the code titled "Sec. 880.5580 Acupuncture needle" as "a device intended to pierce the skin in the practice of acupuncture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=[Code of Federal Regulations]|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=880.5580|publisher=FDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Per the Food and Drug Act of 1906 and the subsequent Amendments to said act, the FDA definition applies to how the needles can be marketed and does not mean that acupuncture is the only medical procedure where these needles can be used.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapV-partA-sec360j.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapV-partA-sec360c.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapV-partA-sec353.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapV-partE-sec360bbb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapV-partE-sec360bbb-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Dry needling using such a needle contrasts with the use of a hollow [[hypodermic needle]] to inject substances such as [[saline solution]], botox or corticosteroids to the same point. In a small number of studies, the use of a solid needle has been found to be as effective as injection of substances in such cases as relief of pain in muscles and [[fascia|connective tissue]].

The Founder of Integrative Systemic Dry Needling (ISDN), Yun-Tao Ma, has been spearheading the "dry needling" movement in the United States. Ma states, "Although ISDN originated in traditional Chinese methods, it has developed from the ancient empirical approach to become modern medical art rooted in evidence-based thinking and practice."&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Yun-Tao. "Integrative Systemic Dry Needling/ A New Modality for Athletes." Biomedical Acupuncture for Sports and Trauma Rehabilitation: Dry Needling Techniques. St. Louis: Churchill Livingstone Elsevier, 2011. 4. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Ma then contradicts himself stating, "Dry needling technique is a modern Western medical modality that is not related to traditional Chinese acupuncture in any way. Dry needling has its own theoretical concepts, terminology, needling technique and clinical application."&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Yun-Tao. "What Is Dry Needling?" (n.d.): 1. Web. 02 Aug. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Ma realizing both the self-contradictions and the legal ramifications of dry needling being rooted in acupuncture and Chinese medicine has since taken down all information in his bios regarding his education in Chinese Medicine and being a Licensed Acupuncturist in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Yun-Tao. "Meet Your Teacher." Dry Needling Course RSS. Dr. Yun-Tao Ma, Ph.D., LAc, n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Academy of Orthopedic Manual Physical Therapists (AAOMPT) states:

{{Quote|Dry needling is a neurophysiological evidence-based treatment technique that requires effective manual assessment of the neuromuscular system. Physical therapists are well trained to utilize dry needling in conjunction with manual physical therapy interventions. Research supports that dry needling improves pain control, reduces muscle tension, normalizes biochemical and electrical dysfunction of motor end plates, and facilitates an accelerated return to active rehabilitation.}}

The statement above is self-explanatory on the functional, physiological and medical aspect of treatment. His book Manual of Dry Needling Techniques Color Edition (2) (Volume 1) is a basic reference text for the therapists who are trained in the method of dry needling procedures in accordance with the norm of the practice of their respective countries. The basic steps given in the book can make a practicing therapist use dry needling technique for the subjects in different clinical conditions. The text focus not only on the steps needed to be performed but also focus on what should not be done by a therapist while performing the procedure. At work, we have taken all the guidelines given by OSHA for blood borne diseases as well as WHO guideline on workplace and hand hygiene.

Dry needling for the treatment of myofascial (muscular) [[Myofascial trigger point|trigger points]] is based on theories similar, but not exclusive, to traditional acupuncture; both acupuncture and dry needling target the [[Myofascial trigger point|trigger points]], which is a direct and palpable source of patient pain.  However, dry needling theory is only beginning to describe the complex sensation referral patterns that have been documented as "channels" or "meridians" in Chinese Medicine. Dry needling, and its treatment techniques and desired effects, would be most directly comparable to the use of 'a-shi' points in acupuncture.&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"&gt;[[#Aung2007|Aung &amp; Chen]], 2007, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 101].&lt;/ref&gt; What further distinguishes dry needling from traditional acupuncture is that it does not use the full range of traditional theories of Chinese Medicine which is used to treat not only pain but other non-musculoskeletal issues which often are the cause of pain. The distinction between trigger points and acupuncture points for the relief of pain is blurred. As reported by Melzack, et al., there is a high degree of correspondence (71% based on their analysis) between published locations of trigger points and classical acupuncture points for the relief of pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Travell|last2=Simons|title=Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction, The Trigger Point Manual, Volume 1. Upper Half of Body, Second Edition|publisher=North Atlantic Books|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debated distinction between dry needling and acupuncture has become a [[dry needling#Controversy|controversy]] because it relates to an issue of [[scope of practice]] of various professions.

== Technique ==

In the treatment of [[trigger point]]s for persons with [[myofascial pain syndrome]], dry needling is an invasive procedure in which a filiform needle is inserted into the skin and muscle directly at a myofascial trigger point. A myofascial trigger point consists of multiple contraction knots, which are related to the production and maintenance of the pain cycle. Deep dry needling for treating trigger points was first introduced by Czech physician [[Karel Lewit]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=baldry&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baldry|first1=Peter|last2=Yunus|first2=Muhammad B.|last3=Inanici|first3=Fatma|title=Myofascial pain and fibromyalgia syndromes: a clinical guide to diagnosis and management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpjTcoDLXPQC&amp;pg=PA36|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-443-07003-2|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lewit had noticed that the success of injections into trigger points in relieving pain was apparently unconnected to the analgesic used.&lt;ref name=lewit&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The needle effect in the relief of myofascial pain|author=K. Lewit|journal=Pain|date= February 1979|volume=6|pmid=424236|issue=1|pages=83–90|doi=10.1016/0304-3959(79)90142-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper dry needling of a myofascial trigger point will elicit a local twitch response (LTR), which is an involuntary spinal cord reflex in which the muscle fibers in the taut band of muscle contract. The LTR indicates the proper placement of the needle in a trigger point. Dry needling that elicits LTRs improves treatment outcomes,&lt;ref name=cochrane/&gt; and may work by activating [[endogenous opioids]].&lt;ref name=baldry/&gt;  The activation of the endogenous opioids is for an analgesic effect using the Gate Control Theory of Pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction|last = Travell|first = JG|date = 1999|journal = Trigger Point Manual|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inserting the needle can itself cause considerable pain,&lt;ref name=baldry/&gt; although when done by well-trained practitioners that is not a common occurrence.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} No study to date has reported the reliability of trigger point diagnosis and physical diagnosis cannot be recommended as a reliable test for the diagnosis of trigger points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=N.|author2=Macaskill P. |author3=Irwig L. |author4=Moran R. |author5=Bogduk N. |year=2009|title=Reliability of physical examination for diagnosis of myofascial trigger points: a systematic review of the literature|journal=The Clinical Journal of Pain|publisher=Eastern Pain Association|volume=25|issue=1|pages=80–9|issn=0749-8047|doi=10.1097/AJP.0b013e31817e13b6|pmid=19158550|url=http://journals.lww.com/clinicalpain/Abstract/2009/01000/Reliability_of_Physical_Examination_for_Diagnosis.12.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tough|first=Elizabeth A.|author2=White, Adrian R. |author3=Richards, Suzanne |author4= Campbell, John |year=2007|title=Variability of Criteria Used to Diagnose Myofascial Trigger Point Pain Syndrome-Evidence From a Review of the Literature|journal=The Clinical Journal of Pain|publisher=Eastern Pain Association|volume=23|issue=3|pages=278–286|doi=10.1097/AJP.0b013e31802fda7c|pmid=17314589|url=http://journals.lww.com/clinicalpain/Abstract/2007/03000/Variability_of_Criteria_Used_to_Diagnose.13.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficacy ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2013}}

There is currently no standardized form of dry needling, no body of evidence that indicates its efficacy, and there is no medical action pathway that provides a theoretical basis for why dry needling should be efficacious. Many of the studies published about dry needling do not have strong evidence; either the studies were not randomized, contained small sample sizes, had high dropout rates, used active interventions in the control group, did not follow the minimally acceptable criteria to diagnose a myofascial trigger point, or did not clearly state that myofascial trigger points were the sole cause for the pain. For example, in a [[systematic review]] on needling therapies in the management of myofascial trigger points, only 8 of the 23 trials described the minimally acceptable criteria for diagnosing a trigger point. Locating the trigger point for dry needling is the basis for performing dry needling and should, therefore, be documented in each study performing this technique. In the same review, two studies tested the efficacy beyond placebo of dry needling in the treatment of myofascial trigger point pain, but, in one, the dropout rate was 48% and it was neither blinded nor randomized, and the other study used potentially active interventions in the control group. Another concluded that dry needling can reduce pain, thus improving mood, function, and disability. The study used the dry needling on trigger points to relieve pain in patients with chronic myofascial pain.&lt;ref name="ebsco01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=433ddf1c-3e1d-4228-b7a2-65b00b10f9c1%2540sessionmgr115&amp;hid=124&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=109604111&amp;db=rzh|title=|author=|date=|website= ebscohost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another [[systematic review]] concluded that dry needling for the treatment of myofascial pain syndrome in the lower back appeared to be a useful addition to standard therapies, but stated clear recommendations could not be made because the published studies are small and of low quality.&lt;ref name=cochrane&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Furlan AD, van Tulder MW, Cherkin DC, etal |title=Acupuncture and dry-needling for low back pain |journal=[[Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]]|volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD001351 |year=2005 |pmid=15674876 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001351.pub2 |url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD001351/frame.html|editor1-last=Furlan|editor1-first=Andrea D}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 meta-analysis examining dry needling of myofascial trigger points concluded that the effect of needling was not significantly different to that of placebo controls, though the trend in the results could be compatible with a treatment effect. One study (Lorenzo et al. 2004) did show a short-term reduction in shoulder pain in stroke patients who received needling with standard rehabilitation compared to those who received standard care alone, but the study was open-label and measurement timings differed, limiting the use of the study. Again the small sample size and poor quality of studies was highlighted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ejpain.2008.02.006 |last=Tough |first=Elizabeth A. |author2=Adrian R. White |author3=T.

A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis released by [[Journal of Orthopaedic &amp; Sports Physical Therapy|JOSPT]] on "effectiveness of dry needling for upper-quarter myofascial pain" recommends the usage of dry needling, compared to sham or placebo, for decreasing pain immediately after treatment and at 4 weeks in patients with upper quarter myofascial pain syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kietrys |first=David M. |last2=Palombaro |first2=Kerstin M. |last3=Azzaretto |first3=Erica |last4=Hubler |first4=Richard |last5=Schaller |first5=Bret |last6=Schlussel |first6=J.

A 2014 review of dry needling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=4117383|year=2014|author1=Dunning|first1=J|title=Dry needling: A literature review with implications for clinical practice guidelines|journal=Physical Therapy Reviews|volume=19|issue=4|pages=252–265|last2=Butts|first2=R|last3=Mourad|first3=F|last4=Young|first4=I|last5=Flannagan|first5=S|last6=Perreault|first6=T|doi=10.1179/108331913X13844245102034|pmid=25143704}}&lt;/ref&gt; found insufficient high-quality evidence for the use of direct dry needling for short and long-term pain and disability reduction in patients with musculoskeletal pain syndromes.
The same review found that robust evidence validating the clinical diagnostic criteria for trigger point identification or diagnosis is lacking and that high-quality studies demonstrate that manual examination for the identification and localization of a trigger point is neither valid nor reliable between-examiners.

== Controversy ==

Many physical therapists and chiropractors have asserted that they are not practicing acupuncture when dry needling.&lt;ref name=dommerholt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaaomonline.info/qiunity/08/07/3a.html |title=The "Dry Needling Issue" |last=Dommerholt |first=Jan |year=2008 |work=Qi-Unity Report |accessdate=16 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104134841/http://www.aaaomonline.info/qiunity/08/07/3a.html |archivedate=4 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that much of the basic physiological and biomechanical knowledge that dry needling utilizes is taught as part of their core physical therapy and chiropractic education and that the specific dry needling skills are supplemental to that knowledge and not exclusive to acupuncture.  However, the originators and proponents of dry needling acknowledged that certain aspects of this techniques were inspired by acupuncture although they also acknowledge that the medical basis for it is purely Western Medicine in nature and therefore is not validly a subset of acupuncture and is a separate medical process. Many acupuncturists have argued that dry needling appears to be an acupuncture technique requiring minimal training that has been re-branded under a new name ("dry needling").  Whether dry needling is considered to be acupuncture depends on the definition of acupuncture, and it is argued that trigger points do not correspond to acupuncture points or meridians.&lt;ref name=headaches&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fernández De las Peñas|first1=César|last2=Arendt-Nielsen|first2=Lars|last3=Gerwin|first3=Robert D.|title=Tension-Type and Cervicogenic Headache: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E77N-9iIaMAC&amp;pg=PA250|year=2009|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=0-7637-5283-5|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; They correspond by definition to the ad hoc category of 'a-shi' acupoints.&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"/&gt; It is important to note that this category of points is not necessarily distinct from other formal categories of acupoints. In 1983, Janet Travell et al. described trigger point locations as 92% in correspondence with known acupuncture points. In 2006, Peter T. Dorsher, acupuncturist at the Mayo Clinic, concludes that the two point systems are in over 90% agreement.&lt;ref name=Dorsher&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Trigger Points and Acupuncture Points: Anatomic and Clinical Correlations|author=Peter T. Dorsher|journal=Medical Acupuncture|date= May 2006|volume=17|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Dorsher and Fleckenstein conclude that the strong (up to 91%) consistency of the distributions of trigger point regions’ referred pain patterns to acupuncture meridians provides evidence that trigger points most likely represent the same physiological phenomenon as acupuncture points in the treatment of pain disorders.&lt;ref name="Dorsher and Fleckenstein.J"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Trigger Points and Acupuncture Points: Anatomic and Clinical Correlations|author1=Peter T.

In 2011, The Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (CCAOM) published a [http://www.ccaom.org/downloads/CCAOM_Position_Paper__May_2011_Update.pdf position paper] describing dry needling as an acupuncture technique.
  
The North Carolina Acupuncture Licensing Board has published a position statement  asserting that dry needling is acupuncture and thus is covered by the North Carolina Acupuncture Licensing law, and is not within the present scope of practice of Physical Therapists, and Physical Therapists are not among the professions exempt from the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In May 2011 the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners ruled to allow "dry needling" into the chiropractic scope of practice with 24 hours of training. In July 2011 the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon issued an injunction, preventing chiropractors from practicing dry needling until the case is heard in court. The document issued by the court states that "dry needling" is "substantially the same" as acupuncture and that the "respondent has not explained how 24 hours of training, with no clinical component, provides sufficient training to chiropractors to adequately protect patients."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/physicaltherapy/comments/7uzi4l/trigger_point_dry_needling/ Trigger points for dry needling technique] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners And Oregon Attorney General appealed said order on the grounds that they feel the commissioner who issued the order was mistaken in his assertion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oregon.gov/OBCE/pdfs/DN4A_OBCE_vs_OAAOM_BRIEF_requesting_Stay_be_overturned.pdf OBCE &amp; Oregon State Attorney General Motion Requesting Reconsideration of Administrative Stay, September 22, 2011] {{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10, 2011, The Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon issued an Order Denying the Motion for Reconsideration.&lt;ref&gt;Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration, Court of Appeals, State of Oregon, No. A148924, November 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of said ruling is that the entire Appeals Court will now determine if the stay was appropriate. The stay is relevant ''only'' in the State of Oregon.

In January 2014, The Oregon Court of Appeals ruled that the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners did not have the statutory authority to include dry needling in the scope of practice for chiropractors in that state. The ruling did not address whether chiropractors have the medical expertise to use dry needling or whether the training they were being given was adequate.&lt;ref name="publications.ojd.state.or.us"&gt;http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/docs/A148924.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Pending further discussion of training requirements the Oregon Physical Therapist Licensing Board has advised all Oregon physical therapists against practicing dry needling.  They have not changed their ruling that dry needling is within the scope of practice for Oregon Physical Therapists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregon.gov/PTBrd/docs/current.topics/board.statement.relevant.to.dry.needling.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Medical Association]] adopted a policy in 2016 that said physical therapists and other non-physicians practicing dry needling should – at a minimum – have standards that are similar to the ones for training, certification, and continuing education that exist for acupuncture. AMA board member Russell W. H. Kridel, M.D. stated "Lax regulation and nonexistent standards surround this invasive practice. For patients' safety, practitioners should meet standards required for licensed acupuncturists and physicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2016/2016-06-15-new-policies-annual-meeting.page|title=AMA Adopts New Policies on Final Day of Annual Meeting - American Medical Association|author=|date=|website=www.ama-assn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''e-Research''' (alternately spelled '''eResearch''') refers to the use of [[information technology]] to support existing and new forms of research.  E-research extends [[e-Science]] and [[cyberinfrastructure]] to other disciplines, including the humanities and social sciences.

==Overview==
Examples of e-Research problems range across disciplines which include:

==== Modelling of ecosystems or economies - ====

==== Exploration of human genome structures - ====

==== Studies of large linguistic corpora - ====

==== Integrated social policy analyses - ====

=== Principle features of e-Research include: ===

==== Collaboration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = e-Research Collaboration - Theory, Techniques and {{!}} Murugan Anandarajan {{!}} Springer|url = https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642122569|website = www.springer.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; - ====

==== Use of [[grid-computing]] technologies - ====

==== [[Data-intensive computing|data-intensive]] activity - ====
E-Research includes research activities that use a spectrum of advanced [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) capabilities. It embraces new research methodologies emerging from increasing access to:

* networks
* services
* tools

==In Australia==
Specialist services, centres or programmes instituted to support [[Australia]]n data and technology intensive research operate under the umbrella term: eResearch.  In March 2012, representatives from these eResearch groups came together to discuss the need build a "collaborative program to strengthen eResearch and address issues facing the sector nationally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intersect Newsletter, 6 March 2012|url=http://www.intersect.org.au/intersect-newsletter-18|website=Intersect Australia|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Australian eResearch Organisation (AeRO) emerged from this forum as "a collaborative organisation of national and state-based research organisations to advance eResearch implementation and innovation in Australia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://aero.edu.au/|website=Australian eResearch Organisation (AeRO)|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Professionals working in Australian eResearch annually convene a conference known as: eResearch Australasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://conference.eresearch.edu.au/eres2015/about/|website = eResearch Australasia Conference|accessdate = 15 January 2016|date = |title = About}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grid is designated as Grid_ETRS89-LAEA5210. For identification of an individual resolution level, the name is extended by identification of cell size in metres (example: _100K).

The origin of Grid_ETRS89-LAEA5210 coincides with the [[false origin]] of the ETRS89-LAEA [[Spatial_reference_system|coordinate reference system]] (x=0, y=0). Grid points of grids based on ETRS89-LAEA must coincide with grid points at Grid_ETRS89-LAEA5210.

The grid is defined as hierarchical one in metric coordinates in power of 10.
The resolution of the grid is 1m, 10m, 100m, 1000m, 10,000m, 100,000m.
The grid orientation is south-north, west-east.
The reference point of the grid cell for grids based on ETRS89-LAEA is the lower left corner of the grid cell.

'''Faith healing''' is the practice of prayer and gestures (such as [[laying on of hands]]) that are believed by some to elicit [[miracle|divine intervention]] in spiritual and physical healing, especially the Christian practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Faith healing|url=http://www.thearda.com/learningcenter/religiondictionary.asp#F|website=thearda.com|location=University Park, PA|publisher=Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=2015-10-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101012004/http://www.thearda.com/learningcenter/religiondictionary.asp|archivedate=2016-01-01|deadurl=no}} Citing {{cite encyclopedia|year=1995|title=|editor1-last=Smith|editor1-first=Jonathan|editor2-last=Green|editor2-first=William Scott|encyclopedia=The Harper Collins Dictionary of Religion|location=San Francisco, CA|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Believers assert that the healing of disease and disability can be brought about by religious faith through prayer and/or other rituals that, according to adherents, can stimulate a [[divine presence]] and power. Religious belief in divine intervention does not depend on [[empirical evidence]] that faith healing achieves an [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based outcome]].&lt;ref name=Village/&gt;

Claims "attributed to a myriad of techniques" such as prayer, divine intervention, or the ministrations of an individual healer can cure illness have been popular throughout history.&lt;ref name= "Barrett2009"&gt;{{cite web |first= Stephen |last= Barrett |authorlink= Stephen Barrett |title= Some Thoughts about Faith Healing |date= December 27, 2009 |url= http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/faith.html |publisher= [[Quackwatch]] |accessdate= 2014-01-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209040254/http://quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/faith.html|archivedate=2014-02-09|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been claims that faith can cure blindness, deafness, cancer, AIDS, developmental disorders, anemia, arthritis, corns, defective speech, multiple sclerosis, skin rashes, total body paralysis, and various injuries.&lt;ref name="ACS" /&gt; Recoveries have been attributed to many techniques commonly classified as faith healing.

Many people interpret the Bible, especially the [[New Testament]], as teaching belief in, and the practice of, faith healing. According to a 2004 ''[[Newsweek]]'' poll, 72 percent of Americans said they believe that praying to God can cure someone, even if science says the person has an incurable disease.&lt;ref name="Kalb2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalb|first=Claudia|date=2004-11-10|title=Can religion improve health?

[[File:Fallerjfa.JPG|thumb|Faith healing by Fr. Joey Faller, Pulilan, Bulacan, Philippines]]
[[File:FvfFaithhealing6177 15.JPG|thumb|Faith healing by [[Fernando Suarez]], Philippines]] 
Regarded as a Christian belief that God heals people through the power of the [[Holy Spirit]], faith healing often involves the [[laying on of hands]]. It is also called supernatural healing, divine healing, and miracle healing, among other things. Healing in the Bible is often associated with the ministry of specific individuals including [[Elijah]], [[Jesus]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]].&lt;ref name="Village" /&gt;

Christian physician Reginald B. Cherry views faith healing as a pathway of healing in which God uses both the natural and the supernatural to heal.&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;{{cite book |first= Reginald B. |last= Cherry |title= The Bible Cure |publisher= HarperOne |year= 1999 |origyear= 1998 |edition= reprint |isbn= 0062516159}}{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} Citing: {{Bibleref2|John|9:1–7}} and {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:46–52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Being healed has been described as a privilege of accepting Christ's redemption on the cross.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|p=32}} Pentecostal writer Wilfred Graves, Jr. views the healing of the body as a physical expression of [[salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Wilfred, Jr. |last= Graves |authorlink= Wilfred Graves, Jr. |title= In Pursuit of Wholeness: Experiencing God's Salvation for the Total Person |page= 52 |location= Shippensburg, PA |publisher= Destiny Image |isbn= 9780768437942}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Bibleref2|Matthew|8:17|NIV}}, after describing [[Jesus exorcising at sunset]] and healing all of the sick who were brought to him, quotes these miracles as a fulfillment of the prophecy in {{bibleref2|Isaiah|53:5|NIV}}: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases."

Even those Christian writers who believe in faith healing do not all believe that one's faith presently brings about the desired healing. "[Y]our faith does not effect your healing now. When you are healed rests entirely on what the sovereign purposes of the Healer are."&lt;ref name="Charisma1"&gt;{{cite news |first= Larry |last= Keefauver |title= The myths of faith healing |date= June 17, 2009 |url= http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/charisma-channels/spiritled-living/20588-the-myths-of-faith-healing |magazine= [[Charisma (magazine)|Charisma]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511085525/http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/charisma-channels/spiritled-living/20588-the-myths-of-faith-healing |archivedate= 2009-05-11|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Keefauver cautions against allowing enthusiasm for faith healing to stir up false hopes.  "Just believing hard enough, long enough or strong enough will not strengthen you or prompt your healing. Doing mental gymnastics to 'hold on to your miracle' will not cause your healing to manifest now."&lt;ref name="Charisma1" /&gt; Those who actively lay hands on others and pray with them to be healed are usually aware that healing may not always follow immediately. Proponents of faith healing say it may come later, and it may not come in this life. "The truth is that your healing may manifest in eternity, not in time."&lt;ref name="Charisma1" /&gt;

====New Testament====
{{Religious text primary|section|date=September 2015}}
Parts of the four [[gospel]]s in the [[New Testament]] say that [[Jesus]] cured physical ailments well outside the capacity of first-century medicine. One example is the case of "a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not better but rather grew worse."{{Bibleref2c|Mark|5:26–27}} After healing her, Jesus tells her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace! Be cured from your illness."{{Bibleref2c|Mark|5:34|GW}} At least two other times Jesus credited the sufferer's faith as the means of being healed: {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:52}} and {{bibleref2|Luke|19:10}}.

Jesus endorsed the use of the medical assistance of the time (medicines of oil and wine) when he told the parable of the [[Good Samaritan]] (Luke 10:25-37), who "bound up [an injured man's] wounds, pouring on oil and wine" (verse 34) as a physician would. Jesus then told the doubting teacher of the law (who had elicited this parable by his self-justifying question, "And who is my neighbor?" in verse 29) to "go, and do likewise" in loving others with whom he would never ordinarily associate (verse 37).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thefaithfulword.org/faithhealing.html |title= Faith Healing – God's Compassion, God's Power, and God's Sovereignty: Is a Christian permitted to seek medical assistance and to use medicine? |date= December 16, 2003 |first= Craig W. |last= Booth |accessdate= 2007-05-01 |work= thefaithfulword.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The healing in the gospels is referred to as a "sign"{{Bibleref2c|John|6:2}} to prove Jesus' divinity and to foster belief in him as the Christ.{{Bibleref2c|John|4:48}} However, when asked for other types of miracles, Jesus refused some{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|12:38-42}} but granted others{{Bibleref2c|Luke|9:38–43}} in consideration of the motive of the request. Some theologians' understanding is that Jesus healed ''all'' who were present every single time.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|p=61}} Sometimes he determines whether they had faith that he would heal them.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2014}}}}

Jesus told his followers to heal the sick and stated that signs such as healing are evidence of faith. Jesus also told his followers to "cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. You received free, give free".{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|10:8}}{{Bibleref2c|Mark|16:17–18}}

Jesus sternly ordered many who received healing from him: "Do not tell anyone!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|8:4}}; {{Bibleref2-nb|Matthew|9:30}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|5:43}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|7:24}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|7:36}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|8:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|9:9}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|5:14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus did not approve of anyone asking for a sign just for the spectacle of it, describing such as coming from a "wicked and adulterous generation."{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|12:38–39}}

The apostle Paul believed healing is one of the special gifts of the [[Holy Spirit]],{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|12:9||1 Corinthians 12:9}} and that the possibility exists that certain persons may possess this gift to an extraordinarily high degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Price |first= Charles P. |url= http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560864/Faith_Healing.html |chapter= Faith Healing |title= Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia. |year= 2009 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5kwpJ3YJj?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560864/Faith_Healing.html |archivedate= 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Testament [[Epistle of James]],{{Bibleref2c-nb|James|5:14}} the faithful are told that to be healed, those who are sick should call upon the elders of the church to pray over [them] and anoint [them] with oil in the name of the Lord.

The New Testament says that during Jesus' [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]] and after his [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] healed the sick and cast out demons, made lame men walk, raised the dead and performed other miracles.

Jesus used miracles to convince people that he was inaugurating the Messianic Age. as in Mt 12.28. Scholars have described Jesus' miracles as establishing the kingdom during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Jerome Biblical Commentary|last=Brown, et al|first=Raymond E.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1990|isbn=0-13-614934-0|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|pages=|chapter=78:20; 81:106,112,113,117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pentecostalism/Charismatic movement====
[[File:RichardRossiHealingService.JPG|right|thumb|[[Richard Rossi]] prays for the sick at one of his faith healing services, September, 1990.]]At the beginning of the 20th century, the new [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] movement drew participants from the [[Holiness movement]] and other movements in America that already believed in divine healing. By the 1930s, several faith healers drew large crowds and established worldwide followings.

The first Pentecostals in the modern sense appeared in [[Topeka, Kansas]], in a Bible school conducted by [[Charles Fox Parham]], a holiness teacher and former [[Methodist]] pastor. Pentecostalism achieved worldwide attention in 1906 through the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in [[Los Angeles]] led by [[William Joseph Seymour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Synan |first= Vinson |title= The Origins of the Pentecostal Movement |url= http://webapps.oru.edu/new_php/library/holyspirit/pentorg1.html |publisher= Holy Spirit Research Center, Oral Roberts University |date= 14 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Smith Wigglesworth]] was also a well-known figure in the early part of the 20th century. A former English plumber turned [[evangelism|evangelist]] who lived simply and read nothing but the Bible from the time his wife taught him to read, Wigglesworth traveled around the world preaching about Jesus and performing faith healings. Wigglesworth claimed to raise several people from the dead in Jesus' name in his meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Sarah |last1=Posner |first2= Joe |last2= Conason |title= God's Profits: Faith, Fraud, and the Republican Crusade for Values Voters |publisher= Polipoint Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 0979482216 |page= 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s, [[Aimee Semple McPherson]] was a controversial faith healer of growing popularity during the [[Great Depression]]. Subsequently, [[William M. Branham]] has been credited as the initiater of the post-World War II [[healing revival]]s.&lt;ref name="Anderson2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first= Allan|year=2004|title=An introduction to Pentecostalism: global charismatic Christianity|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521532808|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPbPTOi0Rk4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=58}}&lt;ref name="Harrell1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrell|first=David E.|year=1975|title=All things are possible: the healing and charismatic revivals in modern America|location=Bloomington, IN|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253100900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ks-Sa1mSnI8C&amp;pg=PA25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=25}} The healing revival he began led many to emulate his style and spawned a generation of faith healers. Because of this, Branham has been recognized as the "father of modern faith healers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Oral Roberts's successful use of television as a medium to gain a wider audience led others to follow suit. His former pilot, [[Kenneth Copeland]], started a healing ministry.

Faith in a [[scientific discovery]] acts through the mind of a patient to bring about an improvement of symptoms, if not a cure of the disease. The patients who are cured usually suffer from [[chronic condition]]s, they either have only a [[persuasion]] that they are ill or have some physical ailment, but the patients inhibit through {{linktext|solicitude}} and worry the natural forces that would bring about a cure. This inhibition cannot be lifted until the mind is relieved by confidence in a remedy or scientific discovery that gives them a conviction of cure.&lt;ref name="Walsh1911"/&gt;}} but it rejects superstitious practices which are neither compatible with Christian teaching nor compatible with scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="USCCB2009"/&gt;{{rp|at=nn11–12}}

Faith healing is reported by [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] as the result of [[intercessory prayer]] to a [[saint]] or to a person with the gift of healing. According to ''U.S. Catholic'' magazine, "Even in this skeptical, postmodern, scientific age—miracles really are possible." Three-fourths of American Catholics say they pray for miracles.&lt;ref name=Scanlon&gt;{{cite news |first= Leslie |last= Scanlon |title= It's a miracle! |magazine= U.S. Catholic |date= June 2009 |volume= 74 |issue= 6 |page= 12 |url= http://www.uscatholic.org/church/2009/05/its-miracle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Cavadini, when healing is granted, "The miracle is not primarily for the person healed, but for all people, as a sign of God's work in the ultimate healing called 'salvation,' or a sign of the kingdom that is coming." Some might view their own healing as a sign they are particularly worthy or holy, while others do not deserve it.&lt;ref name=Scanlon/&gt;

The Catholic Church has a special Congregation dedicated to the careful investigation of the validity of alleged miracles attributed to prospective saints. Pope Francis tightened the rules on money and miracles in the canonization process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2016/09/23/vatican-tightens-rules-miracles-money-sainthood-cases/|title=Vatican tightens rules on miracles and money in sainthood cases|date=2016-09-23|work=Crux|access-date=2017-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Catholic Christians believe the lives of canonized saints in the Church will reflect Christ's, many have come to expect healing miracles. While the popular conception of a miracle can be wide-ranging, the Catholic Church has a specific definition for the kind of miracle formally recognized in a canonization process.&lt;ref name=Pinches&gt;{{cite journal |last= Pinches |first= Charles |title= Miracles: A Christian theological overview |journal= [[Southern Medical Journal]] |year= 2007 |volume= 100 |issue= 12 |pages= 1236–42 |pmid= 18090969 |doi= 10.1097/SMJ.0b013e31815843cd |url= http://journals.lww.com/smajournalonline/Fulltext/2007/12000/Miracles__A_Christian_Theological_Overview.17.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', it is often said that cures at [[shrine]]s and during [[Christian pilgrimage]]s are mainly due to psychotherapy — partly to confident trust in [[Divine providence]], and partly to the strong expectancy of cure that comes over suggestible persons at these times and places.&lt;ref name="Walsh1911"&gt;{{Catholic|inline=1|title=Psychotherapy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12549a.htm|first=James J.|last=Walsh|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|A pre-1911 analysis of the records of cures shows that the majority of accepted cures have been in patients suffering from demonstrable physical conditions.&lt;ref name="Walsh1911"/&gt;}}

Among the best-known accounts by Catholics of faith healings are those attributed to the miraculous intercession of the apparition of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] known as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] at the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] in [[France]] and the remissions of life-threatening disease claimed by those who have applied for aid to [[Saint Jude]], who is known as the "[[patron saint]] of lost causes".

====Christian Science====
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
[[Christian Science]] claims that healing is possible through an understanding of the underlying spiritual perfection of God's creation.&lt;ref name= "Barrett2009"/&gt; The world as humanly perceived is believed to be a distortion of spiritual reality. Christian Scientists believe that healing through prayer is possible insofar as it succeeds in correcting the distortion.&lt;ref name= "SkepDic"&gt;{{cite book |first= Robert Todd |last= Carroll |authorlink= Robert Todd Carroll |title= [[The Skeptic's Dictionary]] |edition= online |chapter= Faith Healing |chapterurl= http://www.skepdic.com/faithhealing.html |accessdate= 2014-06-25 |date= January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality.&lt;ref name= "Bergman2001"&gt;{{cite news |last= Bergman |first= Gerald |date= October 2001 |title= The Christian Science holocaust |url= http://www.theness.com/index.php/the-christian-science-holocaust/ |magazine= The New England Journal of Skepticism |volume= 4 |issue= 4 |publisher= [[New England Skeptical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Eddy, Mary Baker|1875|loc= "Prayer" pp. [http://sentinel.christianscience.com/concordapi/view?book=&amp;verbatim=1&amp;q=SH+1-17 1-17]}} Prayer works through [[love]]: the recognition of God's creation as spiritual, intact, and inherently lovable.{{efn|This is not "intercessory" prayer, but recognition of the good believed to be already present behind the illusory appearance, and gratitude for that good. While Christian Scientists are under no compulsion to choose prayer in preference to material medicine, they normally choose not to combine the two, in the belief that they tend to work against each other if used simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= MBE [Mary Baker Eddy] |url= http://www.christianscience.org/index.php/questions-and-answers/76-is-there-no-intercessory-prayer |title= Is there no intercessory prayer? |date= June 29, 2012 |series= Study Tools |work= christianscience.org |publisher= Healing Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An important point in Christian Science is that effectual prayer and the moral regeneration of one's life go hand-in-hand: that "signs and wonders are wrought in the metaphysical healing of physical disease; but these signs are only to demonstrate its divine origin, to attest the reality of the higher mission of the Christ-power to take away the sins of the world."{{sfn|Eddy, Mary Baker|1875|loc= "Medicine" p. [http://sentinel.christianscience.com/concordapi/view?q=SH%20150:4-150:17 150]}} Christian Science teaches that disease is mental, a mortal fear, a mistaken belief or conviction of the necessity and power of ill-health – an ignorance of God's power and goodness. The chapter "Prayer" in ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]]'' gives a full account of healing through prayer, while the testimonies at the end of the book are written by people who believe they have been healed through spiritual understanding gained from reading the book.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) has had a long history of faith healings. Many members of the LDS Church have told their stories of healing within the LDS publication, the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Miller |first= Brandon J. |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2001/09/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= I needed a blessing |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|The Ensign of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Ensign) |date= September 2001 |pages= 64–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Ribeiro |first= Sérgio |url= http://lds.org/ensign/2004/01/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= He restoreth my soul |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= January 2004 |pages= 70–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Heal |first= Simon |url= http://lds.org/ensign/2010/04/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= Call an ambulance! |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= April 2010 |pages= 60–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Peñate de Guerra |first= Magdalena |url= http://lds.org/ensign/2005/09/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= We rejoiced in her healing |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= September 2005 |pages= 66–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church believes healings come most often as a result of [[priesthood blessing]]s given by the laying on of hands; however, prayer often accompanied with fasting is also thought to cause healings. Healing is always attributed to be God's power. Latter-day Saints believe that the Priesthood of God, held by prophets (such as Moses) and worthy disciples of the Savior, was restored via heavenly messengers to the first prophet of this dispensation, [[Joseph Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith_healings_and_miracles |title= Joseph Smith/Healings and miracles |publisher= [[FairMormon]] |work= fairmormon.org |date= May 23, 2010 |accessdate= 2010-09-20 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100201100307/http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith_healings_and_miracles |archivedate= 2010-02-01 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.josephsmith.net/josephsmith/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=041579179acbff00VgnVCM1000001f5e340aRCRD&amp;locale=0 |title= Joseph Smith: Prophet of God |work= Josephsmith.net |publisher= [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS)}}{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to LDS doctrine, even though members may have the restored [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood authority]] to heal in the name of Jesus Christ, all efforts should be made to seek the appropriate medical help. [[Brigham Young]] stated this effectively, while also noting that the ultimate outcome is still dependent on the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young, Brigham|1997|loc= Chapter 34: "Strengthening the Saints Through the Gifts of the Spirit."

The organization has a panel of medical doctors who review the patient’s records looking at entries prior to the claimed miracles and entries after the miracle was claimed to have taken place. “The overall goal of GMRI is to promote an empirically grounded understanding of the physiological, emotional, and sociological effects of Christian Spiritual Healing practices.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalmri.org/index.php/about Global Medical Research Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; This is accomplished by applying the same rigorous standards used in other forms of medical and scientific research.

[[UC San Diego Health#UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center|UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center]]&lt;ref name='USDMoores1'&gt;{{cite web |title= Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Cancer Patients: Faith Healing |publisher=[[UC San Diego Health System#UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center|UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center]], [[UC San Diego Health System]], [[University of California, San Diego]] |url= http://cancer.ucsd.edu/Outreach/PublicEducation/CAMs/faith.asp |accessdate= 2008-01-17 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081006212016/http://cancer.ucsd.edu/Outreach/PublicEducation/CAMs/faith.asp |archivedate= 2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name='skepdic'&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url= http://skepdic.com/faithhealing.html |chapter=Faith Healing |date= January 8, 2014 |last= Carroll |first= Robert Todd |authorlink= Robert Todd Carroll |title= [[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is ''[[post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'', meaning that a genuine improvement or [[spontaneous remission]] may have been experienced coincidental with but independent from anything the faith healer or patient did or said. These patients would have improved just as well even had they done nothing. The second is the [[placebo]] effect, through which a person may experience genuine pain relief and other symptomatic alleviation. In this case, the patient genuinely has been helped by the faith healer or faith-based remedy, not through any mysterious or numinous function, but by the power of their own belief that they would be healed.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;{{cite book |last= Park |first= Robert L. |authorlink= Robert L. Park |title= [[Voodoo Science|Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud]] |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2000 |location= New York |pages= 50–1 |isbn= 0195135156}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"Patients who seek the assistance of a faith healer must believe strongly in the healer's divine gifts and ability to focus them on the ill."

Both cases, however, are strictly limited to the body's natural abilities.

According to the [[American Cancer Society]]:
{{quote|... available scientific evidence does not support claims that faith healing can actually cure physical ailments... One review published in 1998 looked at 172 cases of deaths among children treated by faith healing instead of conventional methods. These researchers estimated that if conventional treatment had been given, the survival rate for most of these children would have been more than 90 percent, with the remainder of the children also having a good chance of survival. A more recent study found that more than 200 children had died of treatable illnesses in the United States over the past thirty years because their parents relied on spiritual healing rather than conventional medical treatment.}}

The [[American Medical Association]] considers that prayer as therapy should not be a medically reimbursable or deductible expense.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/apps/pf_new/pf_online?f_n=browse&amp;doc=policyfiles/HnE/H-185.987.HTM|title=H-185.987 Prayer Fees Reimbursed As Medical Expenses|accessdate=2008-01-17|publisher=American Medical Association}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative impact on public health===
Reliance on faith healing to the exclusion of other forms of treatment can have a public health impact when it reduces or eliminates access to modern medical techniques.{{efn|"Faith healing can cause patients to shun effective medical care." Bruce Flamm&lt;ref name='SRAM_Flamm'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inherent Dangers of Faith Healing Studies|journal=Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine|date=2004|first=Bruce L.|last=Flamm|volume=8|issue=2|url=http://www.sram.org/0802/faith-healing.html|accessdate=2008-01-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816154915/http://www.sram.org/0802/faith-healing.html|archivedate=2007-08-16|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|"It is often claimed that faith healing may not work but at least does no harm. In fact, reliance on faith healing can cause serious harm and even death." Bruce Flamm&lt;ref name= "Flamm2004"/&gt;}}{{efn|"Faith-healers take from their subjects any hope of managing on their own. And they may very well take them away from legitimate treatments that could really help them." [[James Randi]]{{sfn|Randi|1989|page=141}}}} This is evident in both higher mortality rates for children&lt;ref name="AsserSwan1998"/&gt; and in reduced life expectancy for adults.&lt;ref name='JAMA longevity' /&gt; Critics have also made note of serious injury that has resulted from falsely labelled "healings", where patients erroneously consider themselves cured and cease or withdraw from treatment.&lt;ref name= "Barrett2009"/&gt;{{efn|"These [discarded medications] are substances without which those people might well die."[[James Randi]]{{sfn|Randi|1989|page=141}}}} For example, at least six people have died after faith healing by their church and being told they had been healed of HIV and could stop taking their medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=November 25, 2011|url=http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16117269|title=Church tells HIV patients to stop treatment|first=Liz|last=Lane|publisher=[[Sky News]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126145744/http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16117269|archivedate=November 26, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the stated position of the AMA that "prayer as therapy should not delay access to traditional medical care".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Choosing faith healing while rejecting [[modern medicine]] can and does cause people to die needlessly.&lt;ref name=Cogan1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Cogan|title=Critical Thinking: Step by Step|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fit9rjXiLBUC&amp;pg=PA217|year=1998|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-1067-4|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian theological criticism of faith healing===
Christian theological criticism of faith healing broadly falls into two distinct levels of disagreement.

The first is widely termed the "open-but-cautious" view of the miraculous in the church today. This term is deliberately used by [[Robert L. Saucy]] in the book ''Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?''.&lt;ref name="grudem et al."&gt;{{cite book |last= Saucy |first= Robert L. |authorlink= Robert L. Saucy |title= Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? |editor-last= Grudem |editor-first= Wayne |editor-link= Wayne Grudem |year= 1996 |isbn= 0310201551 |chapter= |page=}}{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Carson]] is another example of a Christian teacher who has put forward what has been described as an "open-but-cautious" view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/articles/bio/dacarson.html |title= D.A. Carson: Biographical Sketch |work= Monergism.com |publisher= Christian Publication Resource Foundation |location= Portland, OR |accessdate= 2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dealing with the claims of [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|Warfield]], particularly "Warfield's insistence that miracles ceased,"{{sfn|Carson|1987|page=156}} Carson asserts, "But this argument stands up only if such miraculous gifts are theologically tied exclusively to a role of attestation; and that is demonstrably not so."{{sfn|Carson|1987|page=156}} However, while affirming that he does not expect healing to happen today, Carson is critical of aspects of the faith healing movement, "Another issue is that of immense abuses in healing practises.... The most common form of abuse is the view that since all illness is directly or indirectly attributable to the devil and his works, and since Christ by his cross has defeated the devil, and by his Spirit has given us the power to overcome him, healing is the inheritance right of all true Christians who call upon the Lord with genuine faith."{{sfn|Carson|1987|pages=174–5}}

The second level of theological disagreement with Christian faith healing goes further. Commonly referred to as [[cessationism]], its adherents either claim that faith healing will not happen today at all, or may happen today, but it would be unusual. [[Richard Gaffin]] argues for a form of cessationism in an essay alongside Saucy's in the book ''Are Miraculous Gifts for Today''? In his book ''Perspectives on Pentecost''{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2014}}}} Gaffin states of healing and related gifts that "the conclusion to be drawn is that as listed in 1 Corinthians 12(vv. 9f., 29f.) and encountered throughout the narrative in Acts, these gifts, particularly when exercised regularly by a given individual, are part of the foundational structure of the church... and so have passed out of the life of the church."{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|pages=113–4}} Gaffin qualifies this, however, by saying "At the same time, however, the sovereign will and power of God today to heal the sick, particularly in response to prayer (see e.g. James 5:14,15), ought to be acknowledged and insisted on."{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|page=114}}

===Fraud===
Skeptics of faith healers point to fraudulent practices either in the healings themselves (such as plants in the audience with fake illnesses), or concurrent with the healing work supposedly taking place and claim that faith healing is a [[quackery|quack]] practice in which the "healers" use well known non-supernatural illusions to exploit credulous people in order to obtain their gratitude, confidence and money.{{sfn|Randi|1989|p=10}} [[James Randi]]'s ''[[The Faith Healers]]'' investigates Christian evangelists such as [[Peter Popoff]], who claimed to heal sick people on stage in front of an audience. Popoff pretended to know private details about participants' lives by receiving radio transmissions from his wife who was off-stage and had gathered information from audience members prior to the show.{{sfn|Randi|1989|p=10}} According to this book, many of the leading modern evangelistic healers have engaged in deception and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/faith.html|title=Some Thoughts about Faith Healing|website=www.quackwatch.com|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also questioned how faith healers use funds that were sent to them for specific purposes.{{efn|"[Some] faith-healers have been less than careful in their use of funds sent to them for specific purposes."[[James Randi]]{{sfn|Randi|1989|page=141}}}} Physicist [[Robert L. Park]]&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; and doctor and consumer advocate [[Stephen Barrett]]&lt;ref name= "Barrett2009"/&gt; have called into question the ethics of some exorbitant fees.

There have also been legal controversies. For example, in 1955 at a [[Jack Coe]] revival service in [[Miami, Florida]], Coe told the parents of a three-year-old boy that he healed their son who had polio.&lt;ref name="Courier19561218"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0040/6776104/33436272_clean.html |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130129191538/http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0040/6776104/33436272_clean.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= January 29, 2013 |title= Faith healer dies – Victim of bulbar polio |newspaper= [[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|Daily Courier]] |location= Yavapai County, AZ |date= December 18, 1956 |accessdate= 2007-11-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salina19561217"&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Faith-healer' dies of polio |date= December 17, 1956 |newspaper= [[The Salina Journal]] |location= Salina, KS |page= 5 |url= https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/40757536/ |subscription= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coe then told the parents to remove the boy's [[leg braces]].&lt;ref name="Courier19561218"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salina19561217"/&gt; However, their son was not cured of polio and removing the braces left the boy in constant pain.&lt;ref name="Courier19561218"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Salina19561217"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Davis |first= Mike |title= Lost faith: Mother's story of healer |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&amp;dat=19560208&amp;id=AJ0yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MekFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3001,2779353 |date= February 8, 1956 |page= 7A |newspaper= [[The Miami News|The Miami Daily News]] |location= Miami, FL |accessdate= 2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, through the efforts of [[Joseph L.

===Miracles for sale===
TV personality [[Derren Brown]] produced a show on faith healing entitled "Miracles for sale" which arguably exposed the art of faith healing as a scam. In this show, Derren trained a scuba diver trainer picked from the general public to be a faith healer and took him to Texas to successfully deliver a faith healing session to a congregation.&lt;ref name="metro-derren-brown"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://metro.co.uk/2011/04/25/derren-brown-miracles-for-sale-tv-review-653303 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130215041421/http://metro.co.uk/2011/04/25/derren-brown-miracles-for-sale-tv-review-653303/ |dead-url= no |archive-date= February 15, 2013 |title= Derren Brown: Miracles For Sale was deceptively entertaining polio |newspaper= [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date= April 25, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States law==
The 1974 [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] (CAPTA) required states to grant religious exemptions to [[child neglect]] and [[child abuse]] laws in order to receive federal money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Merrick |first=Janna C. |year= 2003 |title= Spiritual healing, sick kids and the law: Inequities in the American healthcare system |journal= [[American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine]] |volume= 29 |issue=2-3 |pages= 269–99 |pmid= 12961808}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAPTA amendments of 1996 {{usc|42|5106i}} state:

{{quote|text=
(a) In General. – Nothing in this Act shall be construed –

"(1) as establishing a Federal requirement that a parent or legal guardian provide a child any medical service or treatment against the religious beliefs of the parent or legal guardian; and "(2) to require that a State find, or to prohibit a State from finding, abuse or neglect in cases in which a parent or legal guardian relies solely or partially upon spiritual means rather than medical treatment, in accordance with the religious beliefs of the parent or legal guardian.

"(b) State Requirement. – Notwithstanding subsection (a), a State shall, at a minimum, have in place authority under State law to permit the child protective services system of the State to pursue any legal remedies, including the authority to initiate legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction, to provide medical care or treatment for a child when such care or treatment is necessary to prevent or remedy serious harm to the child, or to prevent the withholding of medically indicated treatment from children with life threatening conditions. Except with respect to the withholding of medically indicated treatments from disabled infants with life threatening conditions, case by case determinations concerning the exercise of the authority of this subsection shall be within the sole discretion of the State.}}

Thirty-one states have child-abuse religious exemptions. These are Alabama, Alaska, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |title=Definitions of Child Abuse and Neglect |accessdate=2009-02-27 |publisher=[[Child Welfare Information Gateway]], [[United States Children's Bureau|Children's Bureau]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services]] |date=April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011062659/http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/define.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- updated version (February 2011) available at url given --&gt; In six of these states, Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Ohio and West Virginia, the exemptions extend to murder and manslaughter.

The '''Greek cancer cure''' was a putative cancer cure invented and promoted by [[microbiologist]] Hariton-Tzannis Alivizatos (died 1991). It consisted of intravenous injections of a fluid for which Aliviatos would not reveal the formula.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/greek.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical claims and criticism==
In 1983, Dr. Alivizatos announced that he had developed a serum that had a 60 percent success rate in arresting most types of cancer, with the exception of extremely advanced cases.  He claimed that the serum could attack a protein-like substance that surrounds cancer cells and weaken the body's ability to keep the disease from spreading.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/10/us/cancer-victims-seek-cure-on-trips-to-athens.html|title=CANCER VICTIMS SEEK CURE ON TRIPS TO ATHENS|last=Times|first=Robert Lindsey and Special To the New York|date=|work=|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Greek health officials ridiculed Dr. Alivizatos's assertions, while the [[American Cancer Society]] warned his current patients that there was no evidence that the diagnostic procedures and treatment for cancer proposed had resulted in any benefits for the treatment of cancer in human beings.  They concluded that, "there is no evidence that any aspect of the diagnostic test nor the treatment... are effective in the treatment of cancer."  In addition they state "Nor is there any evidence that.. the intravenous injections are safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unproven methods of cancer management: Greek cancer cure|journal=[[CA (journal)|CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians]]|date=1990|volume=40|issue=6|pages=368–371|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.40.6.368/pdf|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Certainty}}

A '''hypothesis''' (plural '''hypotheses''') is a proposed [[explanation]] for a [[phenomenon]]. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the [[scientific method]] requires that one can [[testable|test]] it. [[Scientist]]s generally base scientific hypotheses on previous [[observation]]s that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words "hypothesis" and "[[theory]]" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a [[scientific theory]]. A [[working hypothesis]] is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further [[research]],&lt;ref name="HilbornMangel1997"/&gt; in a process beginning with an educated guess or thought.&lt;ref name=Feynman /&gt; 

A different meaning of the term ''hypothesis'' is used in [[formal logic]], to denote the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] of a [[proposition]]; thus in the proposition "If ''P'', then ''Q''", ''P'' denotes the hypothesis (or antecedent); ''Q'' can be called a [[consequent]]. ''P'' is the [[:wikt:assumption|assumption]] in a (possibly [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]]) ''[[wikt:what if|What If]]'' question.

The adjective ''hypothetical'', meaning "having the nature of a hypothesis", or "being assumed to exist as an immediate consequence of a hypothesis", can refer to any of these meanings of the term "hypothesis".

==Uses==

In its ancient usage, ''[[Hypothesis (drama)|hypothesis]]'' referred to a summary of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[Theatre of ancient Greece|classical drama]]. The English word ''hypothesis'' comes from the [[ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:ὑπόθεσις|ὑπόθεσις]] word ''hupothesis'', meaning "to put under" or "to suppose".&lt;ref name="HilbornMangel1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hilborn |first1=Ray |last2=Mangel |first2=Marc |title=The ecological detective: confronting models with data |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=katmvQDi8PMC&amp;pg=PA24 |accessdate=22 August 2011 |year=1997 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03497-3 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Meno]]'' (86e–87b), [[Socrates]] dissects [[virtue]] with a method used by mathematicians,&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wilbur Knorr|Wilbur R. Knorr]], "Construction as existence proof in ancient geometry", p. 125, as selected by Jean Christianidis (ed.), ''Classics in the history of Greek mathematics'', Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt; that of "investigating from a hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt; [[Gregory Vlastos]], Myles Burnyeat (1994) ''Socratic studies'', Cambridge {{ISBN|0-521-44735-6}}, p. 1 &lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, 'hypothesis' refers to a clever idea or to a convenient mathematical approach that simplifies cumbersome [[calculation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Neutral hypotheses, those of which the subject matter can never be directly proved or disproved, are very numerous in all sciences." — [[Morris Raphael Cohen|Morris Cohen]] and  [[Ernest Nagel]] (1934) ''An introduction to logic and scientific method'' p. 375. New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bellarmine|Cardinal Bellarmine]] gave a famous example of this usage in the warning issued to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] in the early 17th century: that he must not treat the motion of the Earth as a reality, but merely as a hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;"Bellarmine (Ital. ''Bellarmino''), Roberto Francesco Romolo", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Eleventh Edition.: 'Bellarmine did not proscribe the Copernican system ... all he claimed was that it should be presented as a hypothesis until it should receive scientific demonstration.' {{EB1911|wstitle=Hypothesis|volume=14|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage in the 21st century, a ''hypothesis'' refers to a provisional idea whose merit requires evaluation. For proper evaluation, the framer of a hypothesis needs to define specifics in operational terms. A hypothesis requires more work by the researcher in order to either confirm or disprove it. In due course, a confirmed hypothesis may become part of a theory or occasionally may grow to become a theory itself. Normally, scientific hypotheses have the form of a [[mathematical model]].&lt;ref&gt;Crease, Robert P.  (2008) ''The Great Equations'' {{ISBN|978-0-393-06204-5}},  p.112 lists the [[conservation of energy]] as an example of accounting a [[constant of motion]]. Hypothesized by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], truth demonstrated by [[James Prescott Joule]], proven by [[Emmy Noether]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, but not always, one can also formulate them as [[existential quantification|existential statements]], stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon under examination has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of [[Universal quantification|universal statements]], stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic.

In entrepreneurial science, a hypothesis is used to formulate provisional ideas within a business setting. The formulated hypothesis is then evaluated where either the hypothesis is proven to be "true" or "false" through a [[Authentication|verifiability]]- or [[falsifiability]]-oriented [[experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything Harvard Business Review (2013) "Why Lean Startup Changes Everything"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://grasshopperherder.com/success-metric-vs-fail-condition-to-the-pain/ Tristan Kromer 2014 "Success Metric vs. Fail Condition"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://leanstartup.pbworks.com/w/page/65946049/Intro%20to%20Lean%20Startup Lean Startup Circle "What is Lean Startup?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Any useful hypothesis will enable [[prediction]]s by [[reasoning]] (including [[deductive reasoning]]). It might predict the outcome of an [[experiment]] in a [[laboratory]] setting or the observation of a phenomenon in [[nature]]. The prediction may also invoke statistics and only talk about probabilities. [[Karl Popper]], following others, has argued that a hypothesis must be [[falsificationism|falsifiable]], and that one cannot regard a proposition or theory as scientific if it does not admit the possibility of being shown false. Other philosophers of science have rejected the criterion of falsifiability or supplemented it with other criteria, such as verifiability (e.g., [[verificationism]]) or coherence (e.g., [[confirmation holism]]). The [[scientific method]] involves experimentation, to test the ability of some hypothesis to adequately answer the question under investigation. In contrast, unfettered observation is not as likely to raise unexplained issues or open questions in science, as would the formulation of a [[crucial experiment]] to test the hypothesis. A [[thought experiment]] might also be used to test the hypothesis as well.

In framing a hypothesis, the investigator must not currently know the outcome of a test or that it remains reasonably under continuing investigation. Only in such cases does the experiment, test or study potentially increase the probability of showing the truth of a hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp17,49–50}} If the researcher already knows the outcome, it counts as a "consequence" — and the researcher should have already considered this while formulating the hypothesis. If one cannot assess the predictions by observation or by [[experience]], the hypothesis needs to be tested by others providing observations. For example, a new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible.

==Scientific hypothesis==
People refer to a trial solution to a problem as a hypothesis, often called an "[[educated guess]]"&lt;ref&gt;
"When it is not clear under which law of nature an effect or class of effect belongs, we try to fill this gap by means of a guess. Such guesses have been given the name ''conjectures'' or ''hypotheses''.", [[Hans Christian Ørsted]](1811) "First Introduction to General Physics" ¶18. ''Selected Scientific Works of Hans Christian Ørsted'', {{ISBN|0-691-04334-5}} p.297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feynman &gt;"In general we look for a new law by the following process. First we guess it. ...", —[[Richard Feynman]] (1965) ''[[The Character of Physical Law]]'' p.156&lt;/ref&gt; because it provides a suggested outcome based on the evidence. However, some scientists reject the term "educated guess" as incorrect. Experimenters may test and reject several hypotheses before solving the problem.

According to Schick and Vaughn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Schick, Theodore |authorlink1=Theodore Schick |author2=Vaughn, Lewis |title=How to think about weird things: critical thinking for a New Age |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |location=Boston |year=2002 |isbn=0-7674-2048-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers weighing up alternative hypotheses may take into consideration:
* [[Testability]] (compare [[falsifiability]] as discussed above)
* Parsimony (as in the application of "[[Occam's razor]]", discouraging the postulation of excessive numbers of [[entity|entities]])
* Scope – the apparent application of the hypothesis to multiple cases of [[Phenomenon|phenomena]]
* Fruitfulness – the prospect that a hypothesis may explain further phenomena in the future
* Conservatism – the degree of "fit" with existing recognized knowledge-systems.

==Working hypothesis==
{{main|Working hypothesis}}
A [[working hypothesis]] is a hypothesis that is provisionally accepted as a basis for further research&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science &amp; Medicine''. [http://www.answers.com/topic/working-hypothesis Eprint] via Answers.com.&lt;/ref&gt; in the hope that a tenable theory will be produced, even if the hypothesis ultimately fails.&lt;ref name=Century&gt;See in "hypothesis", ''[[Century Dictionary]] Supplement'', v. 1, 1909, New York: [[The Century Company]]. Reprinted, [https://archive.org/stream/centurydictionar11whituoft#page/616/mode/1up v. 11, p. 616] (via ''Internet Archive'') of the ''Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia'', 1911. {{quote|'''hypothesis''' [...]—'''Working hypothesis''', a hypothesis suggested or supported in some measure by features of observed facts, from which consequences may be deduced which can be tested by experiment and special observations, and which it is proposed to subject to an extended course of such investigation, with the hope that, even should the hypothesis thus be overthrown, such research may lead to a tenable theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like all hypotheses, a working hypothesis is constructed as a statement of expectations, which can be linked to the [[exploratory research]] purpose in empirical investigation. Working hypotheses are often used as a [[conceptual framework]] in qualitative research.&lt;ref&gt;

The provisional nature of working hypotheses make them useful as an organizing device in applied research. Here they act like a useful guide to address problems that are still in a formative phase.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields]] and Nandhini Rangarajan. 2013. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false.  ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management'']. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. pp. 109–157&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, philosophers of science have tried to integrate the various approaches to evaluating hypotheses, and the scientific method in general, to form a more complete system that integrates the individual concerns of each approach. Notably, [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]], Karl Popper's colleague and student, respectively, have produced novel attempts at such a synthesis.

==Hypotheses, concepts and measurement==
[[Concept]]s in Hempel's [[deductive-nomological model]] play a key role in the development and testing of hypotheses. Most formal hypotheses connect concepts by specifying the expected relationships between [[proposition]]s. When a set of hypotheses are grouped together they become a type of [[conceptual framework]]. When a [[conceptual framework]] is complex and incorporates causality or explanation it is generally referred to as a theory. According to noted philosopher of science [[Carl Gustav Hempel]] "An adequate empirical interpretation turns a theoretical system into a testable theory: The hypothesis whose constituent terms have been interpreted become capable of test by reference to observable phenomena. Frequently the interpreted hypothesis will be derivative hypotheses of the theory; but their confirmation or disconfirmation by empirical data will then immediately strengthen or weaken also the primitive hypotheses from which they were derived."&lt;ref&gt;Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Hempel provides a useful metaphor that describes the relationship between a [[conceptual framework]] and the framework as it is observed and perhaps tested (interpreted framework).  "The whole system floats, as it were, above the plane of observation and is anchored to it by rules of interpretation. These might be viewed as strings which are not part of the network but link certain points of the latter with specific places in the plane of observation. By virtue of those interpretative connections, the network can function as a scientific theory."&lt;ref&gt;Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Hypotheses with concepts anchored in the plane of observation are ready to be tested. In "actual scientific practice the process of framing a theoretical structure and of interpreting it are not always sharply separated, since the intended interpretation usually guides the construction of the theoretician."&lt;ref name="Hempel, C. G. 1952 p. 33"&gt;Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, "possible and indeed desirable, for the purposes of logical clarification, to separate the two steps conceptually."&lt;ref name="Hempel, C. G. 1952 p. 33"/&gt;

===Statistical hypothesis testing===
{{Main|Statistical hypothesis testing}}
When a possible [[correlation]] or similar relation between phenomena is investigated, such as whether a proposed remedy is effective in treating a disease, the hypothesis that a relation exists cannot be examined the same way one might examine a proposed new law of nature. In such an investigation, if the tested remedy shows no effect in a few cases, these do not necessarily falsify the hypothesis. Instead, [[statistical test]]s are used to determine how likely it is that the overall effect would be observed if the hypothesized relation does not exist. If that likelihood is sufficiently small (e.g., less than 1%), the existence of a relation may be assumed. Otherwise, any observed effect may be due to pure chance.

In statistical hypothesis testing, two hypotheses are compared. These are called the [[null hypothesis]] and the [[alternative hypothesis]]. The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that states that there is no relation between the phenomena whose relation is under investigation, or at least not of the form given by the alternative hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis, as the name suggests, is the alternative to the null hypothesis: it states that there ''is'' some kind of relation. The alternative hypothesis may take several forms, depending on the nature of the hypothesized relation; in particular, it can be two-sided (for example: there is ''some'' effect, in a yet unknown direction) or one-sided (the direction of the hypothesized relation, positive or negative, is fixed in advance).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v-walRnRxWQC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=statistical+hypothesis+medical&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oFm-U_CbLYexPIragIAB&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=statistical%20hypothesis%20medical&amp;f=false Altman. DG., ''Practical Statistics for Medical Research'', CRC Press, 1990, Section 8.5,]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional significance levels for testing hypotheses (acceptable probabilities of wrongly rejecting a true null hypothesis) are .10, .05, and .01. The significance level for deciding whether the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted must be determined in advance, before the observations are collected or inspected. If these criteria are determined later, when the data to be tested are already known, the test is invalid.&lt;ref name="Mellenbergh, 2008"&gt;Mellenbergh, G.J.(2008). Chapter 8: Research designs: Testing of research hypotheses. In [[H.J. Adèr]] &amp; [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|G.J. Mellenbergh]] (Eds.) (with contributions by D.J. Hand), Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion (pp. 183-209). Huizen, The Netherlands: Johannes van Kessel Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The above procedure is actually dependent on the number of the participants (units or [[sample size]]) that are included in the study. For instance, to avoid having the sample size be too small to reject a null hypothesis, it is recommended that one specify a sufficient sample size from the beginning. It is advisable to define a small, medium and large effect size for each of a number of important statistical tests which are used to test the hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v-walRnRxWQC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=statistical+hypothesis+medical&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oFm-U_CbLYexPIragIAB&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=statistical%20hypothesis%20medical&amp;f=false Altman.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Latin]] phrase that translates literally to "on site"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dsitus2 Lewis &amp; Short Latin Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; or "in position."&lt;ref&gt;Collins Latin Dictionary &amp; Grammar&lt;/ref&gt; It can mean "locally," "on site," "on the premises," or "in place" to describe an event where it takes place, and is used in many different contexts. For example, in fields such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], or [[biology]], ''in situ'' may describe the way a measurement is taken, that is, in the same place the phenomenon is occurring without isolating it from other systems or altering the original conditions of the test.

== Aerospace ==
In the [[aerospace industry]], equipment on-board aircraft must be tested ''in situ'', or in place, to confirm everything functions properly as a system. Individually, each piece may work but interference from nearby equipment may create unanticipated problems. Special test equipment is available for this ''in situ'' testing.

== Archaeology ==
[[File:Hohokam Arrowhead Sahuarita Arizona 2014.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[Hohokam]] arrowhead ''in situ''.]]

In [[archaeology]], ''in situ'' refers to an artifact that has not been moved from its original place of deposition. In other words, it is stationary, meaning "still." An artifact being ''in situ'' is critical to the interpretation of that artifact and, consequently, of the culture which formed it. Once an artifact's 'find-site' has been recorded, the artifact can then be moved for conservation, further interpretation and display. An artifact that is not discovered ''in situ'' is considered out of context and as not providing an accurate picture of the associated culture. However, the out of context artifact can provide scientists with an example of types and locations of ''in situ'' artifacts yet to be discovered. When excavating a burial site or surface deposit "in situ" refers to cataloging, recording, mapping, photographing human remains in the position they are discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The label ''in situ'' indicates only that the object has not been "newly" moved. Thus, an archaeological ''in situ'' find may be an object that was historically looted from another place, an item of "booty" of a past war, a traded item, or otherwise of foreign origin. Consequently, the ''in situ'' find site may still not reveal its [[provenance]], but with further detective work may help uncover links that otherwise would remain unknown. It is also possible for archaeological layers to be reworked on purpose or by accident (by humans, natural forces or animals). For example, in a [[Tell (archaeology)|Tell]] mound, where layers are not typically uniform or horizontal, or in land cleared or tilled for farming.

The term ''in situ'' is often used to describe ancient sculpture that was carved in place such as the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Sphinx]] or [[Petra]]. This distinguishes it from statues that were carved and moved like the [[Colossi of Memnon]], which was moved in ancient times.

== Art ==
In art, ''in situ'' refers to a work of art made specifically for a host site, or that a work of art takes into account the site in which it is installed or exhibited. For a more detailed account see: [[Site-specific art]]. The term can also refer to a work of art created at the site where it is to be displayed, rather than one created in the artist's studio and then installed elsewhere (''e.g.,'' a sculpture carved ''in situ'').  In [[architectural sculpture]] the term is frequently employed to describe sculpture that is carved on a building, frequently from scaffolds, after the building has been erected.&lt;ref name="FriedlandSobocinski2015"&gt;{{cite book

== Astronomy ==
A fraction of the [[Globular cluster|globular star clusters]] in [[Milky Way|our galaxy]], as well as those in other massive galaxies, might have formed ''in situ''. The rest might have been accreted from now defunct dwarf galaxies.

In astronomy, ''in situ'' also refers to ''in situ'' [[Nebular hypothesis|planet formation]], in which planets are hypothesized to have been formed in the orbit that they are currently observed to be in rather than migrating from a different orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Biology and biomedical engineering ==
[[File:Natica hebraea.jpg|thumb|Live [[sea snail]], species ''[[Nataea]]'', photographed ''in situ'']]

In [[biology]] and [[biomedical engineering]], ''in situ'' means to examine the phenomenon exactly in place where it occurs (i.e., without moving it to some special medium).

In the case of observations or photographs of living animals, it means that the organism was observed (and photographed) in the wild, exactly as it was found and exactly where it was found. This means it was not taken out of the area. The organism had not been moved to another (perhaps more convenient) location such as an aquarium.

This phrase ''in situ'' when used in laboratory science such as cell science can mean something intermediate between ''[[in vivo]]'' and ''[[in vitro]]''. For example, examining a [[w:cell (biology)|cell]] within a whole [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] intact and under [[perfusion]] may be ''in situ'' investigation. This would not be ''in vivo'' as the donor is sacrificed by experimentation, but it would not be the same as working with the cell alone (a common scenario for ''in vitro'' experiments).

''In vitro'' was among the first attempts to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze natural occurrences in the lab. Eventually, the limitation of ''in vitro'' experimentation was that they were not conducted in natural environments. To compensate for this problem, ''in vivo'' experimentation allowed testing to occur in the original organism or environment. To bridge the dichotomy of benefits associated with both methodologies, ''in situ'' experimentation allowed the controlled aspects of ''in vitro'' to become coalesced with the natural environmental compositions of ''in vivo'' experimentation.

In conservation of [[Germplasm|genetic resources]], "[[in situ conservation|''in situ'' conservation]]" (also "on-site [[Conservation movement|conservation]]") is the process of protecting an [[endangered species|endangered]] [[plant]] or [[animal]] [[species]] in its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], as opposed to [[Ex situ conservation|''ex situ'' conservation]] (also "off-site conservation").

== Chemistry and chemical engineering ==
In chemistry, ''in situ'' typically means "in the reaction mixture."

There are numerous situations in which chemical intermediates are synthesized ''in situ'' in various processes. This may be done because the species is unstable, and cannot be isolated, or simply out of convenience. Examples of the former include the [[Corey-Chaykovsky reagent]] and [[adrenochrome]].

In biomedical engineering, protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins. It has tremendous applications for cancer treatment, vaccination, diagnosis, regenerative medicine, and therapies for loss-of-function genetic diseases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemical engineering, ''in situ'' often refers to industrial plant "operations or procedures that are performed in place." For example, aged catalysts in industrial reactors may be regenerated in place (''in situ'') without being removed from the reactors.

== Civil engineering ==
In [[architecture]] and [[building]], ''in situ'' refers to construction which is carried out at the building site using raw materials. Compare that with ''prefabricated'' construction, in which building components are made in a factory and then transported to the building site for assembly. For example, [[concrete slab]]s may be ''in situ'' (also "cast-in-place") or ''prefabricated''.

'''''In situ''''' techniques are often more labour-intensive, and take longer, but the materials are cheaper, and the work is versatile and adaptable. ''Prefabricated'' techniques are usually much quicker, therefore saving money on labour costs, but factory-made parts can be expensive. They are also inflexible, and must often be designed on a grid, with all details fully calculated in advance. Finished units may require special handling due to excessive dimensions.

The phrase may also refer to those assets which are present at or near a project site. In this case, it is used to designate the state of an unmodified sample taken from a given stockpile.

Site construction usually involves grading the existing soil surface so that material is "cut" out of one area and "filled" in another area creating a flat pad on an existing slope.  The term "in situ" distinguishes soil still in its existing condition from soil modified (filled) during construction.  The differences in the soil properties for supporting building loads, accepting underground utilities, and infiltrating water persist indefinitely.

== Computer science ==
{{citation needed span|text=In [[computer science]] an ''in situ'' operation is one that occurs without interrupting the normal state of a system|date=June 2015}}. For example, a file backup may be restored over a running system, without needing to take the system down to perform the restore. In the context of a database, a restore would allow the database system to continue to be available to users while a restore happened. An ''in situ'' upgrade would allow an [[operating system]], [[firmware]] or [[computer program|application]] to be upgraded while the system was still running, perhaps without the need to reboot it, depending on the sophistication of the system.

Another use of the term in-situ that appears in Computer Science focuses primarily on the use of technology and user interfaces to provide continuous access to situationally relevant information in various locations and contexts&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1= Ens|first1=Barrett |last2=Irani |first2=Pourang |date=March 2017 |title= Data representations for in-situ exploration of health and fitness data |url= https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7436646 |journal= IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|volume= 37|issue=2 |pages=66-79 |doi=10.1109/MCG.2016.38 |access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Willett  |first1= Wesley  |last2=Jansen |first2=Yvonne | last3=Dragicevic |first3=Pierre |date=August 2016 |title= Embedded Data Representations |url= https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.uml.idm.oclc.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7539328|journal= IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS|volume= 23|issue=1 |pages=461-470 |doi= 10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598608 |access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{citation needed span|text=An [[algorithm]] is said to be an [[in-place algorithm|''in situ'' algorithm, or in-place algorithm]], if the extra amount of memory required to execute the algorithm is [[O(1)]]|date=June 2015}}, that is, does not exceed a constant no matter how large the input ---except for space for recursive calls on the "call stack." Typically such an algorithm operates on [[object (computer science)|data objects]] directly in place rather than making copies of them. 

For example, [[heapsort]] is an ''in situ'' sorting algorithm, which sorts the elements of an array in place. [[Quicksort]] is an ''in situ'' sorting algorithm, but in the worst case it requires linear space on the call stack (this can be reduced to log space). Merge sort is generally not written as an ''in situ'' algorithm. 

In designing [[user interface]]s, {{citation needed span|text=the term ''in situ'' means that a particular user action can be performed without going to another window|date=June 2015}}, for example, if a word processor displays an image and allows the image to be edited without launching a separate image editor, this is called ''in situ editing.''

AJAX partial page data updates is another example of ''in situ'' in a Web UI/UX context. ''Web 2.0'' included AJAX and the concept of asynchronous requests to servers to replace a portion of a web page with new data, without reloading
the entire page, as the early HTML model dictated. Arguably, ''all'' asynchronous data transfers or ''any'' background task is ''in situ'' as the normal state is normally unaware of background tasks, usually notified on completion
by a callback mechanism.

In Big Data space, in situ data would mean bringing the computation to where data is located, rather than the other way&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flashmemorysummit.com/English/Collaterals/Proceedings/2014/20140806_202E_Alves.pdf|title=In-Situ Processing Presentation|last=Alves|first=Vladimir|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; like in traditional RDBMS systems where data is moved to computational space.

== Design and advertising ==
In design and advertising the term typically means the superimposing of theoretical design elements onto photographs of real world locations. This is a pre-visualization tool to aid in illustrating a proof of concept.

== Earth and atmospheric sciences ==
In [[physical geography]] and the [[Earth science]]s, ''in situ'' typically describes natural material or processes prior to transport. For example, ''in situ'' is used in relation to the distinction between [[weathering]] and [[erosion]], the difference being that erosion requires a transport medium (such as [[Aeolian processes|wind]], [[glacier|ice]], or [[water]]), whereas weathering occurs ''in situ''. [[geochemistry|Geochemical]] processes are also often described as occurring to material ''in situ''.

In the [[atmospheric sciences]], ''in situ'' refers to obtained through direct contact with the respective subject, such as a [[radiosonde]] measuring a parcel of air or an [[anemometer]] measuring wind, as opposed to [[remote sensing]] such as weather [[Weather radar|radar]] or [[Weather satellite|satellites]].

== Economics ==
In economics, ''in situ'' is used when referring to the ''in place'' storage of a product, usually a natural resource. More generally, it refers to any situation where there is no out-of-pocket cost to store the product so that the only storage cost is the opportunity cost of waiting longer to get your money when the product is eventually sold. Examples of ''in situ'' storage would be oil and gas wells, all types of mineral and gem mines, stone quarries, timber that has reached an age where it could be harvested, and agricultural products that do not need a physical storage facility such as hay.

== Electrochemistry ==
In [[electrochemistry]], the phrase in situ refers to performing electrochemical experiments under operating conditions of the electrochemical cell, i.e., under potential control. This is opposed to doing ex situ experiments that are performed under the absence of potential control. Potential control preserves the electrochemical environment essential to maintain the double layer structure intact and the electron transfer reactions occurring at that particular potential in the electrode/electrolyte interphasial region.

== Environmental remediation ==
''In situ'' can refer to where a clean up or [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of a [[polluted]] site is performed using and simulating the natural processes in the [[soil]], contrary to ''[[ex situ]]'' where contaminated soil is excavated and cleaned elsewhere, off site.

== Experimental physics ==
In [[experimental physics]] ''in situ'' typically refers to a method of data collection or manipulation of a sample without exposure to an external environment. For example, the Si(111) 7x7 surface reconstruction is visible using a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] when it is prepared and analyzed ''in situ''.

== Experimental psychology ==
In psychology [[experiment]]s, ''in situ'' typically refers to those experiments done in a field setting as opposed to a laboratory setting.

== Gastronomy ==
In [[gastronomy]], "in situ"&lt;!-- or "in situs" --&gt; refers to the art of cooking with the different resources that are available at the site of the event. Here a person is not going to the restaurant, but the restaurant comes to the person's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law ==
In [[legal]] contexts, ''in situ'' is often used for its literal meaning. For example, in [[Hong Kong]], "''in situ'' land exchange" involves the government exchanging the original or expired [[Leasehold estate|lease]] of a piece of land with a new [[Land grant|grant]] or re-grant with the same piece of land or a portion of that.

In the field of recognition of governments under public international law the term ''in situ'' is used to distinguish between an [[Government in exile|exiled government]] and a government with effective control over the territory, i.e. the government ''in situ''.

== Linguistics ==
In [[linguistics]], specifically [[syntax]], an element may be said to be ''in situ'' if it is pronounced in the position where it is interpreted. For example, [[question]]s in languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] have ''in situ'' wh-elements, with structures comparable to "John bought what?" with ''what'' in the same position in the sentence as the grammatical object would be in its affirmative counterpart (for example, "John bought bread"). An example of an [[English language|English]] wh-element that is not ''in situ'' (see [[wh-movement]]): "What did John buy?"

== Literature ==
In [[literature]] ''in situ'' is used to describe a condition. The [[Rosetta Stone]], for example, was originally erected in a courtyard, for public viewing. Most pictures of the famous stone are not ''in situ'' pictures of it erected, as it would have been originally. The stone was uncovered as part of building material, within a wall. Its '''in situ''' condition today is that it is erected, vertically, on public display at the [[British Museum]] in London, England.

== Medicine ==
[[File:In situ carcinoma.jpg|thumb|In addition to benign tumors, there are in situ tumors and invasive tumors. In situ tumors do not invade the basement membrane, whereas invasive tumors do invade the basement membrane." Diagram of an in [[Carcinoma in situ|situ carcinoma]]]]

In [[oncology]]: for a [[carcinoma]], ''[[Carcinoma in situ|in situ]]'' means that [[malignant]] cells are present as a tumor but have not metastasized, or invaded, beyond the basement membrane of where the tumor was discovered. This can happen anywhere in the body, such as the skin, breast tissue, or lung. This type of tumor can often, depending on where it is located, be removed by [[surgery]].

In [[anatomy]]: ''in situ'' refers to viewing structures as they appear in normal healthy bodies. For example, one can open up a [[cadaver]]'s abdominal cavity and view the liver ''in situ'' or one can look at an isolated liver that has been removed from the cadaver's body.

In [[nursing]], "in situ" describes any devices or appliances on the patient's body that remain in their desired and optimal position.

In [[medical simulation]], "in situ" refers to the practice of clinical professionals using high fidelity patient simulators to train for clinical practice in patient care environments, such as wards, operating rooms, and other settings, rather than in dedicated simulation training facilities.

In biomedical, protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins. It has tremendous applications for cancer treatment, vaccination, diagnosis, regenerative medicine, and therapies for loss-of-function genetic diseases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

== Mining ==
''In situ leaching'' or ''in situ recovery'' refers to the mining technique of injecting water underground to dissolve ore and bringing the uranium-impregnated water to the surface for extraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf27.html In Situ Leach (ISL) Mining of Uranium]. world-nuclear.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Petroleum production ==
''In situ'' refers to recovery techniques which apply heat or solvents to [[heavy crude oil]] or [[bitumen]] reservoirs beneath the earth's crust. There are several varieties of ''in situ'' techniques, but the ones which work best in the [[oil sands]] use heat (steam).

The most common type of ''in situ'' petroleum production is referred to as SAGD ([[steam-assisted gravity drainage]]) this is becoming very popular in the Alberta Oil Sands.

== RF transmission ==
In [[radio frequency]] (RF) transmission systems, ''in situ'' is often used to describe the location of various components while the system is in its standard transmission mode, rather than operation in a test mode. For example, if an ''in situ'' [[wattmeter]] is used in a commercial broadcast transmission system, the [[wattmeter]] can accurately measure power while the station is "on air."

== Space-related ==
Future space exploration or [[terraforming]] may rely on [[In-situ resource utilization|obtaining supplies ''in situ'']], such as previous plans to power the [[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion space vehicle]] with fuel minable on the moon. The [[Mars Direct]] mission concept is based primarily on the ''in situ'' fuel production using [[Sabatier reaction]].

In the [[space sciences]], ''in situ'' refers to measurements of the particle and field environment that the satellite is embedded in, such as the detection of energetic particles in the [[solar wind]], or magnetic field measurements from a [[magnetometer]].

In 2011, Dr Christopher Strevens (an inventor from London) began posting a website with instructions of how to build his "fusion reactor", which he says: "Creates helium from hydrogen. It also captures the power given off during the reaction as electrical power." He also posted several videos to YouTube showing his prototype in operation, and showing the different color of gas from before versus after; as well as showing spectral analysis that indicates that the hydrogen that he puts into the system has transmuted to helium—a nuclear phenomenon.

He said: "I found that when I increased the exciter power to 800 Watts, the output rose to 2,000 Watts [2.5-times overunity], and when I isolated the reactor from the exciter, this power remained. The spark gap regulator became active, keeping the power at this level. I only allowed this for a short time before reconnecting the exciter and turning the power down and the reaction ceased."

Because of the experiment being dangerous it would require a special paramagnetic ceramic bottle glazed inside to contain hydrogen ions and use the magnetic field of the coils and induction of ion fields to make a magnetic bottle to confine the ion reactions.

A brief description of the device, being a hydrogen tube wrapped with high voltage coils and a sort of energizing coil being similar to a high voltage [[tesla coil]] for the ionizer. The device having been made in a clear glass tube in early experiments uses induction to ionize the gases and the field made by ionized gases to energize ion tube coils.

The effect is similar to pyroelectric fusion but instead of pyroelectric crystals stripping the electrons from hydrogen atoms it is a high voltage induced electromagnetic field of coils and electrostatic induction of the ionized gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:Christopher_Strevens_Nuclear_Reactor|title=Directory:Christopher Strevens Nuclear Reactor|work=peswiki.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*"Leuchter's report contained a considerable amount of scientific, or, as it turned out, pseudo-scientific analysis of chemical residues on the gas chamber walls, and similar matters.

Retrieved on 2008-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt; document authored by American [[Capital punishment|execution]] technician [[Fred A. Leuchter]], who was commissioned by [[Ernst Zündel]] to defend him at his trial in Canada for distributing [[Holocaust denial]] material. Leuchter compiled the report in 1988 with the intention of investigating the feasibility of mass homicidal [[gas chamber|gassings]] at Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, specifically at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. He travelled to the camp, collected multiple pieces of brick from the remains of the crematoria and gas chambers (without the camp's permission), brought them back to the United States, and submitted them for chemical analysis. At the trial, Leuchter was called upon to defend the report in the capacity of an expert witness; however during the trial, the court ruled that he had neither the qualifications nor experience to act as such.

Leuchter cited the absence of [[Prussian blue]] in the homicidal gas chambers to support his view that they could not have been used to gas people. However, residual iron-based [[cyanide]] compounds are not a categorical consequence of cyanide exposure. By not discriminating against that, Leuchter introduced an unreliable factor into his experiment, and his findings were seriously flawed as a result. In contrast, tests conducted by Polish forensic scientists (who discriminated against iron-based compounds) confirmed the presence of cyanide in the locations, in accordance with where and how it was used in [[the Holocaust]]. In addition, the report was criticized as Leuchter had overlooked critical evidence, such as documents in the SS architectural office which recorded the mechanical operation of the gas chambers and others which verified the rate at which the Nazis could burn the bodies of those gassed.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Background==
In 1985, [[Ernst Zündel]], a German pamphleteer and publisher living in Canada, was put on trial for publishing [[Richard Verrall (political writer)|Richard Verrall]]'s Holocaust denial pamphlet ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'', which was deemed to violate Canadian laws against distributing false news. Zündel was found guilty, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. This led to a second prosecution.

Zündel and his lawyers were joined by [[Robert Faurisson]], a French academic of literature and Holocaust denier, who came to Toronto to advise the defence,&lt;ref name=Lipstadt&gt;[[Deborah Lipstadt|Lipstadt, Deborah]]. ''Denying the Holocaust&amp;mdash;The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory''. Free Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-02-919235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|160}} having previously testified as expert witness at the first trial.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|161}} He was joined by [[David Irving]], an English writer and Holocaust denier, who was to assist the defence and testify on Zündel's behalf.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|161}} Faurisson claimed that it was technically and physically impossible for the gas chambers at Auschwitz to have functioned as extermination facilities, based on comparisons with American execution gas chambers; he therefore suggested getting an American prison warden who had participated in executions by gas to testify.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} Irving and Faurisson therefore invited Bill Armontrout, warden of the Missouri State Penitentiary,&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} who agreed to testify and suggested they contact Fred A. Leuchter, a Bostonian execution equipment designer. Faurisson reported that Leuchter initially accepted the mainstream account of the Holocaust, but after two days of discussion with him, he stated that Leuchter was convinced that homicidal gassings never occurred. After having met Zündel in Toronto and agreeing to serve as an expert witness for his defence, Leuchter travelled with them to spend a week in Poland.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} He was accompanied by his draftsman, a cinematographer supplied by Zündel, a translator fluent in German and Polish, and his wife. Although Zündel and Faurisson did not accompany them, Leuchter said that they were with them "every step of the way" in spirit.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}}

After arriving in Poland the group spent three days at the former [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp site, and another at the former [[Majdanek]] concentration camp. At these, they filmed Leuchter illicitly collecting what he regarded to be forensic quality samples of materials&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}}from the wreckage of the former gas extermination facilities,&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|162}} while his wife and the translator acted as lookouts.&lt;ref name="transcript"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html| title=Mr. Death: Transcript|publisher=| year=2006 | first=Errol | last=Morris | accessdate = 2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings of where the samples were taken from, the film footage of their physical collection and Leuchter's notebook detailing the work were surrendered to the trial court as evidence.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; Leuchter claimed that his conclusions were based on his expert knowledge of gas chamber operation, his visual inspection of what remained of the structures at Auschwitz, and original drawings and blueprints of some of the facilities.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}} He said that the blueprints had been given to him by Auschwitz Museum officials.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}}

==Report==
The compiled report was published in Canada as ''The Leuchter Report: An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Gas Chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Majdanek, Poland'', by Zündel's Samisdat Publications, and in England as ''Auschwitz: The End of the Line. The Leuchter Report: The First Forensic Examination of Auschwitz'' by Focal Point Publications, David Irving's publishing house.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|163}} However, the court accepted the report only as evidentiary display and not as direct evidence; Leuchter was therefore required to explain it and testify to its veracity in the trial.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

Before Leuchter could do this, he was examined by the court. He admitted that he was not a toxicologist and dismissed the need for having a degree in engineering:

{{Quote|text=THE COURT: How do you function as an engineer if you don't have an engineering degree?

THE WITNESS: Well, I would question, Your Honour, what an engineering degree is. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree and I have the required background training both on the college level and in the field to perform my function as an engineer.

THE COURT: Who determines that? You?

|sign=Exchange between Leuchter and Judge Thomas|source=''Her Majesty the Queen vs. Ernst Zündel'', District Court of Ontario 1988, p. 8973.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|164}}}}

Leuchter admitted under oath that he only had a bachelor of arts degree and implicitly suggested that an engineering degree was unavailable to him by saying that his college did not offer an engineering degree during his studies. [[Boston University]] actually offered three different kinds of such qualification when he was a student there.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|165}} When asked by the court if the B.A. he obtained was in a field that entitled him to operate as an engineer, he confirmed that this was so, even though his degree was in history.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|165}} Similarly, Leuchter claimed that he obtained most of his research material on the camps (including original crematoria blueprints) from the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps' archives, and testified that these documents had a far more important role in shaping his conclusions than the physical samples he collected, yet after the trial the director of the Auschwitz museum denied that Leuchter had received any plans or blueprints from them.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|165}}

Judge Ronald Thomas began to label Leuchter's methodology as "ridiculous" and "preposterous", dismissing many of the report's conclusions on the basis that they were based on "second-hand information", and refused to allow him to testify on the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on humans because he had never worked with the substance, and was neither a toxicologist nor a chemist.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}} Judge Thomas dismissed Leuchter's opinion because it was of "no greater value than that of an ordinary tourist", and in regards to Leuchter's opinion said:

{{Quote|text=His opinion on this report is that there were never any gassings or there was never any exterminations carried on in this facility. As far as I am concerned, from what I've heard, he is not capable of giving that opinion....He is not in a position to say, as he said so sweepingly in this report, what could not have been carried on in these facilities.|sign=Judge Thomas|source=''Her Majesty the Queen vs. Ernst Zündel'', District Court of Ontario 1988, p. 9049-9050.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}}}}

When questioned on the functioning of the crematoria, the judge also prevented Leuchter from testifying because "he hasn't any expertise".&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}} Leuchter also claimed that consultation relating to [[sodium cyanide]] and [[hydrogen cyanide]] with [[DuPont]] was "an on-going thing". DuPont, the largest American manufacturer of hydrogen cyanide, stated that it had "never provided any information on cyanides to persons representing themselves as Holocaust deniers, including Fred Leuchter", and had "never provided any information regarding the use of cyanide at Auschwitz, Birkenau or Majdanek."&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|166}}

==Claims and criticism==
The contents of the report, in particular Leuchter's methodology, are heavily criticised. James Roth, the manager of the lab that carried out the analysis on the samples Leuchter collected, swore under oath to the results at the trial. Roth did not learn what the trial was about until he got off the stand.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; He later stated that cyanide would have only penetrated to a depth of around 10 micrometres, a tenth of the thickness of a human hair. The samples of brick, mortar and concrete that Leuchter took were of indeterminate thickness: not being aware of this, the lab ground the samples to a fine powder which thus severely diluted the cyanide-containing layer of each sample with an indeterminate amount of brick, varying for each sample.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; A more accurate analysis would have been obtained by analysing the surface of the samples Leuchter collected. Roth offered the analogy that the investigation was like analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber behind it.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;

===Prussian blue===
Leuchter's opposition to the possibility of homicidal gassings at Auschwitz relies on residual cyanide remains found in the homicidal gas chambers and delousing chambers at Auschwitz.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|167}} While both facilities were exposed to the same substance ([[Zyklon B]]), many of the delousing chambers are stained with an iron based compound known as Prussian blue, which is not apparent in the homicidal gas chambers.&lt;ref name="ironblues"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://phdn.org/archives/holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/blue/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=Leuchter, Rudolf, and the Iron Blues|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not only this disparity that Leuchter cites, but accordingly from his samples (which included measurements of it) that he claims he measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the gas chambers, which he argues is inconsistent between the amounts necessary to kill human beings and lice.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|167}} This argument is often cited by Holocaust deniers, and similar claims are also made by [[Germar Rudolf]].

According to [[Richard J. Green]]:

{{Quote|text=In order for Leuchter or Rudolf to demonstrate the significance of their findings, it is necessary for them to prove the necessity of Prussian blue formation under the conditions that the homicidal gas chambers were operated. Showing that the delousing chambers have Prussian blue and that the homicidal gas chambers do not, proves nothing, if it cannot be shown that conditions in the gas chambers were such as to produce Prussian blue.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt;}}

In other words, Green states that Leuchter failed to show that Prussian Blue would have been produced in the homicidal gas chambers in the first place—meaning its absence is not in itself proof that no homicidal gassings took place.&lt;ref name="chemistry"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=The Chemistry of Auschwitz|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Majdanek Komora Gazowa.JPG|thumbnail|Gas chamber in [[Majdanek concentration camp]] with blue residue]]
The problem with Prussian blue is that it is by no means a categorical sign of cyanide exposure.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; One factor necessary in its formation is a very high concentration of cyanide.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; In terms of the difference between amounts measured in the delousing chambers and homicidal gas chambers, critics explain that the exact opposite of what deniers claim is true. Insects have a far higher resistance to cyanide than humans, with concentration levels up to 16,000ppm (parts per million) and an exposure time of more than 20 hours&lt;ref name="chemistry"/&gt; (sometimes as long as 72 hours) being necessary for them to succumb. In contrast, a cyanide concentration of only 300ppm is fatal to humans in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/not-the-science/|last=Green|first=Richard J|title=Chemistry is Not the Science: Rudolf, Rhetoric, and Reduction|accessdate=2008-05-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604152626/http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/not-the-science/|archivedate=2008-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference is one of the reasons behind the concentration disparity. Another exceedingly sensitive factor by which very small deviances could determine whether Prussian blue may form is [[pH]]. pH could be affected by the presence of human beings.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; Also, while the delousing chambers were left intact, the ruins of the crematoria at Birkenau had been exposed to the elements for over forty years by the time Leuchter collected his samples. This would have severely affected his results, because unlike Prussian blue and other iron based cyanides, cyanide salts are highly soluble in water.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt;

Since the formation of Prussian blue is not an unconditional outcome of exposure to cyanide, it is not a reliable indicator. Leuchter and Rudolf claim to have measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the homicidal gas chambers, but since they did not discriminate against an unreliable factor, Green maintains that instant bias is introduced into their experiments.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt; Similarly, Rudolf acknowledges that Prussian blue does not always form upon exposure to cyanide and is thus not a reliable marker, yet continues to include the iron compounds in his analysis. Green describe this as "disingenuous".&lt;ref name="science"/&gt; Since a building that contains Prussian blue staining would exhibit much higher levels of detectable cyanides than one without any, Green writes that Leuchter's and Rudolf's measurements reveal nothing more than what is already visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref name="ironblues"/&gt;

====Polish follow-up investigation====
In February 1990, Professor Jan Markiewicz, director of The Institute for Forensic Research (IFRC) in Kraków conducted a fair experiment where iron compounds were excluded.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; Given that the ruins of the gas chambers at Birkenau have been washed by a column of water at least 35m in height based on climatological records since 1945,&lt;ref name="IFRC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/polish/institute-for-forensic-research/introduction.html|title=Cracow (Post-Leuchter) Report|last=Markiewicz|first=Jan|date=|work=A Study of the Cyanide Compounds Content in the Walls of the Gas Chambers in the Former Auschwitz &amp; Birkenau Concentration Camps|publisher=Institute of Forensic Research|location=Cracow|access-date=|via=|author2=Gubala, Wojciech|author3=Labedz, Jerzy|accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Introduction}} Markiewicz and his team were not optimistic at being able to detect cyanides so many years later; nevertheless, having the legal permission to obtain samples, they collected some from areas as sheltered from the elements as possible.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt;

Leuchter's report stated that the small amounts of cyanide he detected in the ruins of the crematoria are merely the result of [[fumigation]]. However the IFRC points out that the control samples they took from living areas which may have been fumigated only once as part of the 1942 typhus epidemic tested negative for cyanide, and that the typhus epidemic occurred before the crematoria at Birkenau even existed.&lt;ref name=IFRC/&gt;{{rp|Final Remarks}}

[[File:Ruin of the gas chamber of Crematorium II.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the Crematorium II gas chamber at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].]]
Accordingly, the IFRC demonstrated that cyanides were present in all of the facilities where it is claimed that they were exposed, i.e. all five crematoria, the cellars of [[Block 11]] and the delousing facilities.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt; Critics state that any attempt to demonstrate that the crematoria could not have functioned as homicidal gas chambers on the basis that they were not exposed to cyanide is unsuccessful, given that its presence in what remains of these facilities is incontrovertible,&lt;ref name=chemistry/&gt; and write that all of the gas chambers were exposed to cyanide at levels higher than background levels elsewhere in the camp, such as living areas, where no cyanides at all were detected.&lt;ref name=ironblues/&gt; In addition, tests conducted at Auschwitz in 1945 revealed the presence of cyanides on ventilation grilles found in the ruins of Crematorium II (thus also demonstrating that the Leuchter report was not the first forensic examination of the camp as purported in the title of the London edition).&lt;ref name=chemistry/&gt; The historian [[Richard J. Evans]] argued that due to Leuchter's ignorance of the large disparity between the amounts of cyanide necessary to kill humans and lice, instead of disproving the homicidal use of gas chambers, the small amounts of cyanide which Leuchter detected actually tended to confirm it.&lt;ref name=confirm&gt;Evans, Richard J. ''Telling Lies about Hitler: The Holocaust, History and the David Irving Trial''. Verso, 2002, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticisms===
By order of Heinrich Himmler, the crematoria and gas chambers at Birkenau were destroyed by the SS in order to hide evidence of genocide.&lt;ref name=Anatomy563&gt;Karny, Miroslav "The Vrba and Wetzler Report" in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael. ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', [[Indiana University Press]], 1994; this edition 1998, p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing more than the bases of Crematoria IV and V can be seen: the floor plans of both facilities are indicated by bricks laid out across the concrete foundations,&lt;ref name=tests&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hdot.org/learning/myth-fact/leuchter//body/1037|title=HDOT: Learning Tools : Myth/Fact Sheets : Scientific tests prove the "Gas Chambers" never existed|publisher=HDOT.org|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Crematoria II and III are in ruins. Professor [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] labels Leuchter's comment that the facilities have not changed at all since 1942 or 1941 as "nonsense".&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;

====Zyklon B====
Because hydrogen cyanide is explosive, Leuchter maintained that the gas chambers could never have been operated due to their proximity to the ovens of the crematoria.&lt;ref name=Lipstadt/&gt;{{rp|168}} It is correct that hydrogen cyanide is explosive, but only at concentrations of 56,000 ppm and above&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/74908.html|title=Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLHs) - 74908|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; over 186 times more than the lethal dose of 300 ppm. Critics estimate conservatively that within 5 to 15 minutes, gas chamber victims were exposed to 450 &amp;ndash; 1810 ppmv&lt;ref name=science/&gt; &amp;ndash; again considerably lower than the [[Flammability limit|lower explosion limit]].

====Gas chamber ventilation====
{{quote|If Leuchter had gone to the archives, if he had spent time in the archives, he would've found evidence about ventilation systems, evidence about ways to introduce Zyklon B into these buildings, evidence of gas chambers, undressing rooms.|Robert Jan van Pelt|''The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter''&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;}}

A cross section view of the width of the room shows the ventilation channels that straddle the building along its longitudinal axis, marked ''Belüftung'' (aeration) and ''Entlüftungskanal'' (de-aeration channel).]]
Leuchter incorrectly assumed that the gas chambers were not ventilated.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix&gt;[http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/van/ix HDOT: Irving v. Lipstadt : Defense Documents : [The Van Pelt Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302004021/http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/van/ix |date=2009-03-02 }}: Electronic Edition - IX The Leuchter Report&lt;/ref&gt; The basement gas chambers of Crematoria II and III were mechanically ventilated via motors in the roof space of the main crematorium structure&lt;ref name=Anatomy166&gt;Piper, Franciszek, "Gas Chambers and Crematoria" in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael.

''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', Indiana University Press, 1994; this edition 1998, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

When ventilation was not used such as in Crematoria IV and V (although a ventilation system was later installed in Crematorium V in May 1944&lt;ref name=Anatomy238&gt;Pressac, Jean-Claude and Van Pelt, Robert-Jan "The Machinery of Mass Murder at Auschwitz" in Gutman, Yisrael &amp; Berenbaum, Michael.

Leuchter was also prepared to act as expert witness regarding crematoria ovens despite admitting during cross examination that he had no expert knowledge.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt; Leuchter presented his own estimate of 156 corpses as the total daily incineration capacity of the installations at Auschwitz. During cross-examination, he was presented with a letter written by the Auschwitz Central Construction Office (''Auschwitz Zentralbauleitung'') of June 28, 1943, from SS-''Sturmbannführer'' Jahrling to SS-''[[Brigadeführer]]'' [[Hans Kammler]] stating that the five crematoria installations had a collective daily capacity of 4,756 corpses. Leuchter conceded that this was quite different from his own figure, and that he had never seen the document in question before.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt;

A patent application by the makers of the ovens, (both of which were made during the war) and two independent testimonies confirmed the capacity of the crematoria.&lt;ref name=pelt-ix/&gt; Because the 4,756 figure is evidence of the Nazis equipping a camp of a maximum of 125,000 prisoners with the facility to cremate 140,000 of them per month, critics of Leuchter explain that this reveals the true exterminationist purpose of Auschwitz: a camp with the capacity to reduce its entire population to ash on a monthly basis was not merely a benign internment camp.&lt;ref name="nizqor1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/features/qar/qar01.html|title=66 Questions and Answers about the Holocaust|publisher=[[Nizkor Project]]|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times (such as in the summer of 1944 when the crematoria couldn't keep up with the extermination rate), bodies were burnt in open-air pits. Accordingly, the capacity of the crematoria was never a limiting factor, and the pits yielded practically no limit to the number of corpses that could be burnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=van Pelt|first=Robert Jan|title=The case for Auschwitz|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=252–253|year=2002|isbn=0-253-34016-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''science magazine''' is a [[periodical literature|periodical publication]] with news, opinions and reports about [[science]], generally written for a non-[[expert]] audience. In contrast, a periodical publication, usually including primary research and/or reviews, that is written by scientific experts is called a "[[scientific journal]]". Science [[magazine]]s are read by non-scientists and [[scientist]]s who want accessible information on fields outside their [[Academic specialization|specialization]].

Articles in science magazines are sometimes republished or summarized by the [[news|general press]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4326">'''MDRC''' is a nonprofit, nonpartisan education and social policy research organization based in New York City and Oakland, CA. MDRC mounts large-scale demonstrations and uses randomized controlled trials to measure the effects of social and educational policy initiatives. MDRC is led by President Gordon Berlin and Senior Vice Presidents Jesús Amadeo and Robert Ivry.

== History ==
In 1974 the Ford Foundation and six government agencies together created the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation. Its purpose was to implement and document the results of new programs intended to help the poor.&lt;ref name=Manpower&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohler|first=Scott|title=Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation |url=http://cspcs.sanford.duke.edu/sites/default/files/descriptive/manpower_demonstration_research_corporation.pdf |publisher=Center for Strategic Philanthropy and Civil Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s and 1990s, it became well known for its evaluations of state welfare-to-work programs.&lt;ref name=Manpower /&gt;  It formally adopted "MDRC" as its registered corporate identity in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About MDRC: MDRC History|url=http://www.mdrc.org/about/about-mdrc-history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
MDRC evaluates and pilot-tests programs in six main areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solutions We're Working On|url=http://www.mdrc.org/solutions-were-working|work=MDRC website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Preschool through twelfth-grade education
* Higher education
* Disconnected youth
* Work and income security
* Families with children
* Health and disability

== Notable accomplishments ==
MDRC helped pioneer the use of [[random assignment]] to test social programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bornstein|first=David|title=Social Change's Age of Enlightenment|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/social-changes-age-of-enlightenment/|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Its evaluations of [[Workfare|welfare work programs]] influenced the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|welfare reform]] of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mead|first=Lawrence|title=Research and Welfare Reform|journal=NYU Department of Politics|date=July 8, 2004|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/papers/source/mead_rwr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s and 2000s, MDRC’s evaluation of the Career Academies high school reform model, which showed impacts on participants’ earnings eight years after graduation, influenced the expansion of the model around the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoye|first=J.D.|author2=David Stern|title=The Career Academy Story: A Case Study of How Research Can Move Policy and Practice|journal=Education Week|date=September 10, 2008|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2008/09/10/03hoye.h28.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;   MDRC was the intermediary for the first [[social impact bond]] demonstration in the United States, a project to reduce [[recidivism]] among 16- to 18-year-olds incarcerated at [[Rikers Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chen|first=David|title=Goldman to Invest in City Jail Program, Profiting if Recidivism Falls Sharply|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/nyregion/goldman-to-invest-in-new-york-city-jail-program.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Eduardo (July 28, 2015).

Retrieved 2015-08-12&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, MDRC's study of the City University of New York's Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP) has demonstrated that the program has doubled the three-year graduation rate of students who begin college requiring remedial education.&lt;ref&gt;Scrivener, Susan, Michael J.

==Controversy==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1370">'''Naturhistorieselskabet''' - the Society for Natural History - was a private society that was the only institution to offer education in [[natural history]] in [[Denmark]] in the late 18th century. The spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and an escalating [[agriculture|agricultural]] crisis, led the [[List of Danish monarchs|king]] and the [[Denmark|Danish]] elite to call foreign experts on [[economy]], including [[botany]] and [[silviculture]], to the country. The autonomous [[University of Copenhagen]], on the other hand, was reluctant to employ foreign experts in little-established disciplines. Naturhistorieselskabet was formed in 1788 in order to ensure education in [[botany]], [[zoology]] and [[mineralogy]] based on private funds. For example, [[Martin Vahl]] lectured in [[botany]]. After the appointment in 1795 of a professor in [[geology]] and in 1797 one in [[botany]], the society gradually lost its importance. It was soon abolished and its collections donated to the state (much later united with the university collections).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3556">{{short description|An argument or explanation that is based on invalid reasoning or speculative premises that can neither be proven correct nor falsified}}
{{Other uses}}
The phrase "'''not even wrong'''" describes an argument or explanation that purports to be scientific but is based on invalid reasoning or speculative premises that can neither be proven correct nor [[falsifiability|falsified]]. Hence, it refers to statements that cannot be discussed in a rigorous, [[scientific method|scientific sense]].&lt;ref name=Bukerman/&gt; For a meaningful discussion on whether a certain statement is true or false, the statement must satisfy the criterion called "falsifiability"—the inherent possibility for the statement to be tested and found false. In this sense, the phrase "not even wrong" is synonymous to "nonfalsifiable".&lt;ref name=Bukerman/&gt;

The phrase is generally attributed to  [[theoretical physicist]] [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who was known for his colorful objections to incorrect or careless thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shermer M |authorlink = Michael Shermer | title = Wronger Than Wrong | journal = Scientific American | year = 2006 | pages =  | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110810231612/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=wronger-than-wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNAPngEACAAJ |title=Atom and Archetype: The Pauli/Jung Letters, 1932–1958 |last=Jung |first=C.

Peierls remarks that quite a few [[Apocrypha#Metaphorical usage|apocryphal stories]] of this kind have been circulated and mentions that he listed only the ones personally vouched for by him. He also quotes another example when Pauli replied to [[Lev Landau]], "What you said was so confused that one could not tell whether it was nonsense or not."&lt;ref name=peierls /&gt;

The phrase is often used to describe [[pseudoscience]] or bad science and is considered derogatory.&lt;ref name=Bukerman&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1573072,00.html |title = Not even wrong |publisher = The Guardian |date = September 19, 2005 |author = Oliver Burkeman |authorlink = Oliver Burkeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica''''' ([[Latin]] for ''Mathematical Principles of [[Natural Philosophy]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|place=London|contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/369153/The-Mathematical-Principles-of-Natural-Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; often referred to as simply the '''''Principia''''' {{IPAc-en|p|r|ɪ|n|ˈ|s|ɪ|p|i|ə}}, is a work in three books by [[Isaac Newton]], in Latin, first published 5 July 1687.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Motte /&gt; After annotating and correcting his personal copy of the first edition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Newton's personally annotated 1st edition)|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-ADV-B-00039-00001/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton published two further editions, in 1713 and 1726.&lt;ref name=variorum /&gt; The ''Principia'' states [[Newton's laws of motion]], forming the foundation of [[classical mechanics]]; [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]; and a derivation of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] (which [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] first obtained [[Empiricism|empirically]]).

The ''Principia'' is considered one of the most important works in the history of science.&lt;ref&gt;J M Steele, University of Toronto, [http://www.cap.ca/brms/Reviews/Reading-Steele.html (review online from [[Canadian Association of Physicists]])] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401071521/http://www.cap.ca/brms/Reviews/Reading-Steele.html |date=1 April 2010 }} of N Guicciardini's "Reading the Principia: The Debate on Newton’s Mathematical Methods for Natural Philosophy from 1687 to 1736" (Cambridge UP, 1999), a book which also states (summary before title page) that the "Principia" "is considered one of the masterpieces in the history of science".&lt;/ref&gt;

The French mathematical physicist [[Alexis Clairaut]] assessed it in 1747: "The famous book of ''Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'' marked the epoch of a great revolution in physics. The method followed by its illustrious author Sir Newton ... spread the light of mathematics on a science which up to then had remained in the darkness of conjectures and hypotheses."&lt;ref&gt;(in French) Alexis Clairaut, "Du systeme du monde, dans les principes de la gravitation universelle", in "Histoires (&amp; Memoires) de l'Academie Royale des Sciences" for 1745 (published 1749), at p.329 (according to a note on p.329, Clairaut's paper was read at a session of November 1747).&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent assessment has been that while acceptance of Newton's theories was not immediate, by the end of a century after publication in 1687, "no one could deny that" (out of the ''Principia'') "a science had emerged that, at least in certain respects, so far exceeded anything that had ever gone before that it stood alone as the ultimate exemplar of science generally."&lt;ref&gt;G E Smith, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/newton-principia/ "Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition), E N Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

In formulating his physical theories, Newton developed and used mathematical methods now included in the field of [[calculus]]. But the language of calculus as we know it was largely absent from the ''Principia''; Newton gave many of his proofs in a [[geometry|geometric]] form of [[infinitesimal calculus]], based on limits of ratios of vanishing small geometric quantities.&lt;ref name="geomcalc"/&gt; In a revised conclusion to the ''Principia'' (see ''[[#General Scholium|General Scholium]]''), Newton used his expression that became famous, ''[[Hypotheses non fingo]]'' ("I formulate no hypotheses"&lt;ref name="gschol-hnf"/&gt;).

===Expressed aim and topics covered===
[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|Sir [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) author of the ''Principia'']]
In the preface of the ''Principia'', Newton wrote:&lt;ref&gt;From Motte's translation of 1729 (at 3rd page of Author's Preface); and see also [[J. W. Herivel]], ''The background to Newton's "Principia"'', Oxford University Press, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|[...] Rational Mechanics will be the sciences of motion resulting from any forces whatsoever, and of the forces required to produce any motion, accurately proposed and demonstrated [...] And therefore we offer this work as mathematical principles of his philosophy. For all the difficulty of philosophy seems to consist in this—from the phenomenas of motions to investigate the forces of Nature, and then from these forces to demonstrate the other phenomena [...]}}

The ''Principia'' deals primarily with massive bodies in motion, initially under a variety of conditions and hypothetical laws of force in both non-resisting and resisting media, thus offering criteria to decide, by observations, which laws of force are operating in phenomena that may be observed. It attempts to cover hypothetical or possible motions both of celestial bodies and of terrestrial projectiles. It explores difficult problems of motions perturbed by multiple attractive forces. Its third and final book deals with the interpretation of observations about the movements of planets and their satellites.

It shows:
*how astronomical observations prove the inverse square law of gravitation (to an accuracy that was high by the standards of Newton's time); 
*offers estimates of relative masses for the known giant planets and for the Earth and the Sun; 
*defines the very slow motion of the Sun relative to the solar-system barycenter; 
*shows how the theory of gravity can account for irregularities in the motion of the Moon; 
*identifies the oblateness of the figure of the Earth; 
*accounts approximately for marine tides including phenomena of spring and neap tides by the perturbing (and varying) gravitational attractions of the Sun and Moon on the Earth's waters; 
*explains the [[Axial_precession#Polar_shift_and_equinoxes_shift|precession of the equinoxes]] as an effect of the gravitational attraction of the Moon on the Earth's equatorial bulge; and 
*gives theoretical basis for numerous phenomena about comets and their elongated, near-parabolic orbits.

The opening sections of the ''Principia'' contain, in revised and extended form, nearly&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'' article indicates the topics that reappear in the ''Principia.''&lt;/ref&gt; all of the content of Newton's 1684 tract ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]''.

The ''Principia'' begin with "Definitions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=1|chapter=Definitions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Axioms or Laws of Motion",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=19|chapter=Axioms or Laws of Motion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA19|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues in three books:

===Book 1, ''De motu corporum''===
Book 1, subtitled ''De motu corporum'' (''On the motion of bodies'') concerns motion in the absence of any resisting medium.  It opens with a mathematical exposition of "the method of first and last ratios",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=41|chapter=Section I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA41|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; a geometrical form of infinitesimal calculus.&lt;ref name=geomcalc /&gt;

If a continuous centripetal force (red arrow) is considered on the planet during its orbit, the area of the triangles defined by the path of the planet will be the same. This is true for any fixed time interval. When the interval tends to zero, the force can be considered instantaneous. (Click image for a detailed description).]]
The second section establishes relationships between centripetal forces and the law of areas now known as Kepler's second law (Propositions 1–3),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=57|chapter=Section II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA57|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relates circular velocity and radius of path-curvature to radial force&lt;ref&gt;This relationship between circular curvature, speed and radial force, now often known as Huygens' formula, was independently found by Newton (in the 1660s) and by Huygens in the 1650s: the conclusion was published (without proof) by Huygens in 1673.This was given by Isaac Newton through his Inverse Square Law.&lt;/ref&gt; (Proposition 4), and relationships between centripetal forces varying as the inverse-square of the distance to the center and orbits of conic-section form (Propositions 5–10).

Propositions 11–31&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=79–153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA79|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|last2=Machin|first2=John|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; establish properties of motion in paths of eccentric conic-section form including ellipses, and their relation with inverse-square central forces directed to a focus, and include [[Newton's theorem about ovals]] (lemma 28).

Propositions 43–45&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=177|chapter=Section IX|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA178-IA1|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; are demonstration that in an eccentric orbit under centripetal force where the [[apsis|apse]] may move, a steady non-moving orientation of the line of apses is an indicator of an inverse-square law of force.

Book 1 contains some proofs with little connection to real-world dynamics. But there are also sections with far-reaching application to the solar system and universe:

Propositions 57–69&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=218|chapter=Section XI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA218|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; deal with the "motion of bodies drawn to one another by centripetal forces". This section is of primary interest for its application to the solar system, and includes Proposition 66&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=234|chapter=Section XI, Proposition LXVI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA234|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with its 22 corollaries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=239–256|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA239|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|last2=Machin|first2=John|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; here Newton took the first steps in the definition and study of the problem of the movements of three massive bodies subject to their mutually perturbing gravitational attractions, a problem which later gained name and fame (among other reasons, for its great difficulty) as the [[three-body problem]].

Propositions 70–84&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=263|chapter=Section XII|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA263|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume I|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; deal with the attractive forces of spherical bodies. The section contains Newton's proof that a massive spherically symmetrical body attracts other bodies outside itself as if all its mass were concentrated at its centre. This fundamental result, called the [[Shell theorem]], enables the inverse square law of gravitation to be applied to the real solar system to a very close degree of approximation.

===Book 2===
Part of the contents originally planned for the first book was divided out into a second book, which largely concerns motion through resisting mediums. Just as Newton examined consequences of different conceivable laws of attraction in Book 1, here he examines different conceivable laws of resistance; thus &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1846)/BookII-I|Section 1]]&lt;/span&gt; discusses resistance in direct proportion to velocity, and &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1846)/BookII-II|Section 2]]&lt;/span&gt; goes on to examine the implications of resistance in proportion to the square of velocity. Book 2 also discusses (in &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1846)/BookII-V|Section 5]]&lt;/span&gt;) hydrostatics and the properties of compressible fluids. The effects of air resistance on pendulums are studied in &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1846)/BookII-VI|Section 6]]&lt;/span&gt;, along with Newton's account of experiments that he carried out, to try to find out some characteristics of air resistance in reality by observing the motions of pendulums under different conditions. Newton compares the resistance offered by a medium against motions of globes with different properties (material, weight, size). In Section 8, he derives rules to determine the speed of waves in fluids and relates them to the density and condensation(Proposition 48;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=176|chapter=Proposition 48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA176|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; this would become very important in acoustics). He assumes that these rules apply equally to light and sound and estimates that the speed of sound is around 1088 feet per second and can increase depending on the amount of water in air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=181|chapter=Scholium to proposition 50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA181|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less of Book 2 has stood the test of time than of Books 1 and 3, and it has been said that Book 2 was largely written on purpose to refute a theory of [[René Descartes|Descartes]] which had some wide acceptance before Newton's work (and for some time after).

Book 3, subtitled ''De mundi systemate'' (''On the system of the world''), is an exposition of many consequences of universal gravitation, especially its consequences for astronomy. It builds upon the propositions of the previous books, and applies them with further specificity than in Book 1 to the motions observed in the solar system.

In Book 3 Newton also made clear his heliocentric view of the solar system, modified in a somewhat modern way, since already in the mid-1680s he recognised the "deviation of the Sun" from the centre of gravity of the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;See Curtis Wilson, "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", pages 233–274 in R Taton &amp; C Wilson (eds) (1989) ''The General History of Astronomy'', Volume, 2A', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA233 at page 233]).&lt;/ref&gt; For Newton, "the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=233|chapter=Proposition 12, Corollary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA233|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that this centre "either is at rest, or moves uniformly forward in a right line".&lt;ref name=prop11&gt;{{cite book|page=232|chapter=Proposition 11 &amp; preceding Hypothesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA232|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton rejected the second alternative after adopting the position that "the centre of the system of the world is immoveable", which "is acknowledg'd by all, while some contend that the Earth, others, that the Sun is fix'd in that centre".&lt;ref name=prop11/&gt; Newton estimated the mass ratios Sun:Jupiter and Sun:Saturn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=228|chapter=Proposition 8, Corollary 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA228|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pointed out that these put the centre of the Sun usually a little way off the common center of gravity, but only a little, the distance at most "would scarcely amount to one diameter of the Sun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=232–233|chapter=Proposition 12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA232|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}} Newton's position is seen to go beyond literal Copernican heliocentrism practically to the modern position in regard to the solar system barycenter (see ''[[Barycenter#Inside or outside the Sun.3F|Barycenter -- Inside or outside the Sun?]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary on the ''Principia''===
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2018}}
The sequence of definitions used in setting up dynamics in the ''Principia'' is recognisable in many textbooks today. Newton first set out the definition of mass

{{quotation|The quantity of matter is that which arises conjointly from its density and magnitude. A body twice as dense in double the space is quadruple in quantity. This quantity I designate by the name of body or of mass.}}

This was then used to define the "quantity of motion" (today called [[momentum]]), and the principle of inertia in which mass replaces the previous Cartesian notion of ''intrinsic force''. This then set the stage for the introduction of forces through the change in momentum of a body. Curiously, for today's readers, the exposition looks dimensionally incorrect, since Newton does not introduce the dimension of time in rates of changes of quantities.

He defined space and time "not as they are well known to all". Instead, he defined "true" time and space as "absolute"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=illustrated |first1=Jens M. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Poul |last2=Hjorth |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-642-97599-8 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 Extract of page 30]&lt;/ref&gt; and explained:

{{quotation|Only I must observe, that the vulgar conceive those quantities under no other notions but from the relation they bear to perceptible objects. And it will be convenient to distinguish them into absolute and relative, true and apparent, mathematical and common. [...] instead of absolute places and motions, we use relative ones; and that without any inconvenience in common affairs; but in philosophical discussions, we ought to step back from our senses, and consider things themselves, distinct from what are only perceptible measures of them.}}

To some modern readers it can appear that some dynamical quantities recognised today were used in the ''Principia'' but not named. The mathematical aspects of the first two books were so clearly consistent that they were easily accepted; for example, [[John Locke|Locke]] asked [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] whether he could trust the mathematical proofs, and was assured about their correctness.

However, the concept of an attractive force acting at a distance received a cooler response. In his notes, Newton wrote that the inverse square law arose naturally due to the structure of matter. However, he retracted this sentence in the published version, where he stated that the motion of planets is consistent with an inverse square law, but refused to speculate on the origin of the law. Huygens and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] noted that the law was incompatible with the notion of the [[aether (classical element)|aether]]. From a Cartesian point of view, therefore, this was a faulty theory. Newton's defence has been adopted since by many famous physicists—he pointed out that the mathematical form of the theory had to be correct since it explained the data, and he refused to speculate further on the basic nature of gravity. The sheer number of phenomena that could be organised by the theory was so impressive that younger "philosophers" soon adopted the methods and language of the ''Principia''.

===Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy===
Perhaps to reduce the risk of public misunderstanding, Newton included at the beginning of Book 3 (in the second (1713) and third (1726) editions) a section entitled "Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy." In the four rules, as they came finally to stand in the 1726 edition, Newton effectively offers a methodology for handling unknown phenomena in nature and reaching towards explanations for them. The four Rules of the 1726 edition run as follows (omitting some explanatory comments that follow each):

Rule 1: ''We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.''

Rule 2: ''Therefore to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes.''

Rule 3: ''The qualities of bodies, which admit neither intensification nor remission of degrees, and which are found to belong to all bodies within the reach of our experiments, are to be esteemed the universal qualities of all bodies whatsoever.''

Rule 4: ''In experimental philosophy we are to look upon propositions inferred by general induction from phenomena as accurately or very nearly true, not withstanding any contrary hypothesis that may be imagined, till such time as other phenomena occur, by which they may either be made more accurate, or liable to exceptions.''

This section of Rules for philosophy is followed by a listing of 'Phenomena', in which are listed a number of mainly astronomical observations, that Newton used as the basis for inferences later on, as if adopting a consensus set of facts from the astronomers of his time.

Both the 'Rules' and the 'Phenomena' evolved from one edition of the ''Principia'' to the next. Rule 4 made its appearance in the third (1726) edition; Rules 1–3 were present as 'Rules' in the second (1713) edition, and predecessors of them were also present in the first edition of 1687, but there they had a different heading:  they were not given as 'Rules', but rather in the first (1687) edition the predecessors of the three later 'Rules', and of most of the later 'Phenomena', were all lumped together under a single heading 'Hypotheses' (in which the third item was the predecessor of a heavy revision that gave the later Rule 3).

From this textual evolution, it appears that Newton wanted by the later headings 'Rules' and 'Phenomena' to clarify for his readers his view of the roles to be played by these various statements.

In the third (1726) edition of the ''Principia'', Newton explains each rule in an alternative way and/or gives an example to back up what the rule is claiming.  The first rule is explained as a philosophers' principle of economy.  The second rule states that if one cause is assigned to a natural effect, then the same cause so far as possible must be assigned to natural effects of the same kind:  for example respiration in humans and in animals, fires in the home and in the Sun, or the reflection of light whether it occurs terrestrially or from the planets.  An extensive explanation is given of the third rule, concerning the qualities of bodies, and Newton discusses here the generalisation of observational results, with a caution against making up fancies contrary to experiments, and use of the rules to illustrate the observation of gravity and space.

Isaac Newton’s statement of the four rules revolutionised the investigation of phenomena. With these rules, Newton could in principle begin to address all of the world’s present unsolved mysteries.  He was able to use his new analytical method to replace that of Aristotle, and he was able to use his method to tweak and update [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]’s experimental method. The re-creation of Galileo's method has never been significantly changed and in its substance, scientists use it today.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===General Scholium===
{{Main|General Scholium}}
The ''General Scholium'' is a concluding essay added to the second edition, 1713 (and amended in the third edition, 1726).&lt;ref&gt;See online ''Principia'' (1729 translation) vol.2, Books 2 &amp; 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA387 starting at page 387 of volume 2 (1729)].&lt;/ref&gt; It is not to be confused with the ''General Scholium'' at the end of Book 2, Section 6, which discusses his pendulum experiments and resistance due to air, water, and other fluids.

Here Newton used what became his famous expression '''[[Hypotheses non fingo]]''', "I formulate no hypotheses",&lt;ref name=gschol-hnf /&gt; in response to criticisms of the first edition of the ''Principia''. (''&lt;nowiki&gt;'Fingo'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' is sometimes nowadays translated 'feign' rather than the traditional 'frame'.) Newton's gravitational attraction, an invisible [[Action at a distance (physics)|force able to act over vast distances]], had led to criticism that he had introduced "[[occult]] agencies" into science.&lt;ref name="Edelglass p. 54"&gt;Edelglass et al., ''Matter and Mind'', {{ISBN|0-940262-45-2}}, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton firmly rejected such criticisms and wrote that it was enough that the phenomena implied gravitational attraction, as they did; but the phenomena did not so far indicate the cause of this gravity, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things not implied by the phenomena: such hypotheses "have no place in experimental philosophy", in contrast to the proper way in which "particular propositions are inferr'd from the phenomena and afterwards rendered general by induction".&lt;ref&gt;See online ''Principia'' (1729 translation) vol.2, Books 2 &amp; 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA392 at page 392 of volume 2 (1729)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton also underlined his criticism of the vortex theory of planetary motions, of Descartes, pointing to its incompatibility with the highly eccentric orbits of comets, which carry them "through all parts of the heavens indifferently".

Newton also gave theological argument. From the system of the world, he inferred the existence of a Lord God, along lines similar to what is sometimes called the [[Teleological argument|argument from intelligent or purposive design]]. It has been suggested that Newton gave "an oblique argument for a unitarian conception of God and an implicit attack on the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]",&lt;ref name="The General Scholium to Isaac Newton's ''Principia mathematica''"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Ducheyne | first =Steffen | authorlink = | title =The General Scholium: Some notes on Newton's published and unpublished endeavours | journal=Lias: Sources and Documents Relating to the Early Modern History of Ideas |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=223–274 | url =http://logica.ugent.be/steffen/GS.pdf  | accessdate =19 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the General Scholium appears to say nothing specifically about these matters.

==Writing and publication==

===Halley and Newton's initial stimulus===
In January 1684, [[Edmond Halley]], [[Christopher Wren]] and [[Robert Hooke]] had a conversation in which Hooke claimed to not only have derived the inverse-square law, but also all the laws of planetary motion. Wren was unconvinced, Hooke did not produce the claimed derivation although the others gave him time to do it, and Halley, who could derive the inverse-square law for the restricted circular case (by substituting Kepler's relation into Huygens' formula for the centrifugal force) but failed to derive the relation generally, resolved to ask Newton.&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrase of 1686 report by Halley, in H. W. Turnbull (ed.), 'Correspondence of Isaac Newton', Vol.2, cited above, pp. 431–448.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halley's visits to Newton in 1684 thus resulted from Halley's debates about planetary motion with Wren and Hooke, and they seem to have provided Newton with the incentive and spur to develop and write what became ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica''. Halley was at that time a Fellow and Council member of the [[Royal Society]] in London (positions that in 1686 he resigned to become the Society's paid Clerk).&lt;ref&gt;'Cook, 1998': A. Cook, ''Edmond Halley, Charting the Heavens and the Seas'', Oxford University Press 1998, at pp.147 and 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Halley's visit to Newton in Cambridge in 1684 probably occurred in August.&lt;ref&gt;As dated e.g. by D. T. Whiteside, in ''The Prehistory of the Principia from 1664 to 1686'', Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, 45 (1991) 11–61.&lt;/ref&gt; When Halley asked Newton's opinion on the problem of planetary motions discussed earlier that year between Halley, Hooke and Wren,&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 1998; at p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton surprised Halley by saying that he had already made the derivations some time ago; but that he could not find the papers. (Matching accounts of this meeting come from Halley and [[Abraham De Moivre]] to whom Newton confided.) Halley then had to wait for Newton to 'find' the results, but in November 1684 Newton sent Halley an amplified version of whatever previous work Newton had done on the subject. This took the form of a 9-page manuscript, ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'' (''Of the motion of bodies in an orbit''): the title is shown on some surviving copies, although the (lost) original may have been without title.

Newton's tract ''De motu corporum in gyrum'', which he sent to Halley in late 1684, derived what are now known as the three laws of Kepler, assuming an inverse square law of force, and generalised the result to conic sections. It also extended the methodology by adding the solution of a problem on the motion of a body through a resisting medium. The contents of ''De motu'' so excited Halley by their mathematical and physical originality and far-reaching implications for astronomical theory, that he immediately went to visit Newton again, in November 1684, to ask Newton to let the Royal Society have more of such work.&lt;ref&gt;'Westfall, 1980': R S Westfall, ''Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton'', Cambridge University Press 1980, at p.404.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of their meetings clearly helped to stimulate Newton with the enthusiasm needed to take his investigations of mathematical problems much further in this area of physical science, and he did so in a period of highly concentrated work that lasted at least until mid-1686.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 1998; at p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's single-minded attention to his work generally, and to his project during this time, is shown by later reminiscences from his secretary and copyist of the period, Humphrey Newton. His account tells of Isaac Newton's absorption in his studies, how he sometimes forgot his food, or his sleep, or the state of his clothes, and how when he took a walk in his garden he would sometimes rush back to his room with some new thought, not even waiting to sit before beginning to write it down.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, 1980; at p. 406, also pp. 191–2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other evidence also shows Newton's absorption in the ''Principia'': Newton for years kept up a regular programme of chemical or alchemical experiments, and he normally kept dated notes of them, but for a period from May 1684 to April 1686, Newton's chemical notebooks have no entries at all.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, 1980; at p.406, n.15.&lt;/ref&gt;  So it seems that Newton abandoned pursuits to which he was normally dedicated, and did very little else for well over a year and a half, but concentrated on developing and writing what became his great work.

The first of the three constituent books was sent to Halley for the printer in spring 1686, and the other two books somewhat later.  The complete work, published by Halley at his own financial risk,&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, 1980; at pp. 153–156.&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in July 1687.  Newton had also communicated ''De motu'' to Flamsteed, and during the period of composition he exchanged a few letters with Flamsteed about observational data on the planets, eventually acknowledging Flamsteed's contributions in the published version of the ''Principia'' of 1687.

===Preliminary version===
[[Image:NewtonsPrincipia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] own first edition copy of his ''Principia'', with handwritten corrections for the second edition.]]
The process of writing that first edition of the ''Principia'' went through several stages and drafts:  some parts of the preliminary materials still survive, while others are lost except for fragments and cross-references in other documents.&lt;ref&gt;The fundamental study of Newton's progress in writing the ''Principia'' is in I. Bernard Cohen's ''Introduction to Newton's 'Principia' '', (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1971), at part 2: "The writing and first publication of the 'Principia' ", pp.47–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving materials show that Newton (up to some time in 1685) conceived his book as a two-volume work. The first volume was to be titled ''De motu corporum, Liber primus'', with contents that later appeared in extended form as Book 1 of the ''Principia''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A fair-copy draft of Newton's planned second volume ''De motu corporum, Liber secundus'' survives, its completion dated to about the summer of 1685.  It covers the application of the results of ''Liber primus'' to the Earth, the Moon, the tides, the solar system, and the universe; in this respect it has much the same purpose as the final Book 3 of the ''Principia'', but it is written much less formally and is more easily read.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Manchester John Rylands Library Isaac Newton 16-10-2009 13-54-26.JPG|thumb|left|Titlepage and frontispiece of the third edition, London, 1726 ([[John Rylands Library]])]]
It is not known just why Newton changed his mind so radically about the final form of what had been a readable narrative in ''De motu corporum, Liber secundus'' of 1685, but he largely started afresh in a new, tighter, and less accessible mathematical style, eventually to produce Book 3 of the ''Principia'' as we know it. Newton frankly admitted that this change of style was deliberate when he wrote that he had (first) composed this book "in a popular method, that it might be read by many", but to "prevent the disputes" by readers who could not "lay aside the[ir] prejudices", he had "reduced" it "into the form of propositions (in the mathematical way) which should be read by those only, who had first made themselves masters of the principles established in the preceding books".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=200|chapter=Introduction to Book 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA200|title=The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume II|last1=Newton|first1=Sir Isaac|date=1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final Book 3 also contained in addition some further important quantitative results arrived at by Newton in the meantime, especially about the theory of the motions of comets, and some of the perturbations of the motions of the Moon.

The result was numbered Book 3 of the ''Principia'' rather than Book 2, because in the meantime, drafts of ''Liber primus'' had expanded and Newton had divided it into two books. The new and final Book 2 was concerned largely with the motions of bodies through resisting mediums.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

But the ''Liber secundus'' of 1685 can still be read today. Even after it was superseded by Book 3 of the ''Principia'', it survived complete, in more than one manuscript. After Newton's death in 1727, the relatively accessible character of its writing encouraged the publication of an English translation in 1728 (by persons still unknown, not authorised by Newton's heirs). It appeared under the English title ''A Treatise of the System of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEYUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR1|title=A Treatise of the System of the World|author1=Newton|first1=Isaac|date=1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had some amendments relative to Newton's manuscript of 1685, mostly to remove cross-references that used obsolete numbering to cite the propositions of an early draft of Book 1 of the ''Principia''. Newton's heirs shortly afterwards published the Latin version in their possession, also in 1728, under the (new) title ''De Mundi Systemate'', amended to update cross-references, citations and diagrams to those of the later editions of the ''Principia'', making it look superficially as if it had been written by Newton after the ''Principia'', rather than before.&lt;ref&gt;I. Bernard Cohen, ''Introduction'' to Newton's ''A Treatise of the System of the World'' (facsimile of second English edition of 1731), London (Dawsons of Pall Mall) 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''System of the World'' was sufficiently popular to stimulate two revisions (with similar changes as in the Latin printing), a second edition (1731), and a 'corrected' reprint&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02xbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP7|title=The System of the World: Demonstrated in an Easy and Popular Manner.

===Halley's role as publisher===
The text of the first of the three books of the ''Principia'' was presented to the [[Royal Society]] at the close of April 1686. Hooke made some priority claims (but failed to substantiate them), causing some delay. When Hooke's claim was made known to Newton, who hated disputes, Newton threatened to withdraw and suppress Book 3 altogether, but Halley, showing considerable diplomatic skills, tactfully persuaded Newton to withdraw his threat and let it go forward to publication. [[Samuel Pepys]], as President, gave his [[imprimatur]] on 30 June 1686, licensing the book for publication. The Society had just spent its book budget on a ''[[De Historia piscium|History of Fishes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Richard Westfall (1980), ''Never at Rest'', p. 453, {{ISBN|0-521-27435-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cost of publication was borne by [[Edmund Halley]] (who was also then acting as publisher of the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society''): the book appeared in summer 1687.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/archive/exhibits/pepys/pages/largeImage.asp?id=101&amp;size=3&amp;nav=none |title=Museum of London exhibit including facsimile of title page from John Flamsteed's copy of 1687 edition of Newton's '&amp;#39;Principia'&amp;#39; |publisher=Museumoflondon.org.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331192529/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/archive/exhibits/pepys/pages/largeImage.asp?id=101&amp;size=3&amp;nav=none |archivedate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings of the Scientific Revolution===
[[File:Nikolaus Kopernikus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473–1543) was the first person to formulate a comprehensive [[Heliocentricism|heliocentric]] (or [[Sun]]-centered) model of the universe]]
[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] had moved the Earth away from the center of the universe with the [[heliocentric]] theory for which he presented evidence in his book ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the revolutions of the heavenly spheres'') published in 1543. The structure was completed when [[Johannes Kepler]] wrote the book ''[[Astronomia nova]]'' (''A new astronomy'') in 1609, setting out the evidence that planets move in [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbits with the sun at one [[Focus (geometry)|focus]], and that planets do not move with constant speed along this orbit. Rather, their speed varies so that the line joining the centres of the sun and a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. To these two laws he added a third a decade later, in his book ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (''Harmonies of the world''). This law sets out a proportionality between the third power of the characteristic distance of a planet from the sun and the square of the length of its year.

[[File:Justus Sustermans - Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1636.jpg|thumb|Italian physicist [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642), a champion of the Copernican model of the universe and an enormously influential figure in the history of kinematics and classical mechanics]]The foundation of modern dynamics was set out in Galileo's book ''[[Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo]]'' (''Dialogue on the two main world systems'') where the notion of inertia was implicit and used. In addition, Galileo's experiments with inclined planes had yielded precise mathematical relations between elapsed time and acceleration, velocity or distance for uniform and uniformly accelerated motion of bodies.

Descartes' book of 1644 ''[[Principia philosophiae]]'' (''Principles of philosophy'') stated that bodies can act on each other only through contact: a principle that induced people, among them himself, to hypothesize a universal medium as the carrier of interactions such as light and gravity—the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]]. Newton was criticized for apparently introducing forces that acted at distance without any medium.&lt;ref name="Edelglass p. 54"/&gt; Not until the development of [[particle theory]] was Descartes' notion vindicated when it was possible to describe all interactions, like the [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]], and [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[fundamental interaction]]s, using mediating [[gauge boson]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Henryk Niewodniczanski Institute of Nuclear Physics|title=Particle Physics and Astrophysics Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gravity through hypothesized [[gravitons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Rovelli|first1=Carlo|title=Notes for a brief history of quantum gravity|eprint=gr-qc/0006061|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was mistaken in his treatment of circular motion, this effort was more fruitful in the short term when it led others to identify circular motion as a problem raised by the principle of inertia. [[Christiaan Huygens]] solved this problem in the 1650s and published it much later in 1673 in his book ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium|Horologium oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum]]''.

===Newton's role===
Newton had studied these books, or, in some cases, secondary sources based on them, and taken notes entitled ''[[Quaestiones quaedam philosophicae]]'' (''Questions about philosophy'') during his days as an undergraduate. During this period (1664–1666) he created the basis of calculus, and performed the first experiments in the optics of colour. At this time, his proof that white light was a combination of primary colours (found via prismatics) replaced the prevailing theory of colours and received an overwhelmingly favourable response, and occasioned bitter disputes with [[Robert Hooke]] and others, which forced him to sharpen his ideas to the point where he already composed sections of his later book ''[[Opticks]]'' by the 1670s in response. Work on calculus is shown in various papers and letters, including two to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. He became a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and the second [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] (succeeding [[Isaac Barrow]]) at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].

===Newton's early work on motion===
In the 1660s Newton studied the motion of colliding bodies, and deduced that the centre of mass of two colliding bodies remains in uniform motion. Surviving manuscripts of the 1660s also show Newton's interest in planetary motion and that by 1669 he had shown, for a circular case of planetary motion, that the force he called 'endeavour to recede' (now called [[centrifugal force]]) had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center.&lt;ref name="T Whiteside 1991 pages 11–61"/&gt; After his 1679–1680 correspondence with Hooke, described below, Newton adopted the language of inward or centripetal force. According to Newton scholar J Bruce Brackenridge, although much has been made of the change in language and difference of point of view, as between centrifugal or centripetal forces, the actual computations and proofs remained the same either way. They also involved the combination of tangential and radial displacements, which Newton was making in the 1660s. The difference between the centrifugal and centripetal points of view, though a significant change of perspective, did not change the analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See J. Bruce Brackenridge, "The key to Newton's dynamics: the Kepler problem and the Principia", (University of California Press, 1995), especially at [https://books.google.com/books?id=ovOTK7X_mMkC&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pages 20–21].&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also clearly expressed the concept of linear inertia in the 1660s: for this Newton was indebted to Descartes' work published 1644.&lt;ref name="dtw1970"/&gt;

===Controversy with Hooke===
[[File:13 Portrait of Robert Hooke.JPG|thumb|Artist's impression of English polymath [[Robert Hooke]] (1635–1703).]]
Hooke published [[Robert Hooke#Gravitation|his ideas about gravitation]] in the 1660s and again in 1674. He argued for an attracting principle of gravitation in ''[[Micrographia]]'' of 1665, in a 1666 Royal Society lecture ''On gravity'', and again in 1674, when he published his ideas about the ''System of the World'' in somewhat developed form, as an addition to ''An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations''.&lt;ref name="attempt"/&gt; Hooke clearly postulated mutual attractions between the Sun and planets, in a way that increased with nearness to the attracting body, along with a principle of linear inertia. Hooke's statements up to 1674 made no mention, however, that an inverse square law applies or might apply to these attractions. Hooke's gravitation was also not yet universal, though it approached universality more closely than previous hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;See page 239 in Curtis Wilson (1989), "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", ch.13 (pages 233–274) in "Planetary astronomy from the Renaissance to the rise of astrophysics: 2A: Tycho Brahe to Newton", CUP 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hooke also did not provide accompanying evidence or mathematical demonstration.  On these two aspects, Hooke stated in 1674: "Now what these several degrees [of gravitational attraction] are I have not yet experimentally verified" (indicating that he did not yet know what law the gravitation might follow); and as to his whole proposal: "This I only hint at present", "having my self many other things in hand which I would first compleat, and therefore cannot so well attend it" (i.e., "prosecuting this Inquiry").&lt;ref name=attempt /&gt;

In November 1679, Hooke began an exchange of letters with Newton, of which the full text is now published.&lt;ref name="167986letters"/&gt;  Hooke told Newton that Hooke had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence,&lt;ref&gt;'Correspondence' vol.2 already cited, at p.297.&lt;/ref&gt; and wished to hear from members about their researches, or their views about the researches of others;  and as if to whet Newton's interest, he asked what Newton thought about various matters, giving a whole list, mentioning "compounding the celestial motions of the planets of a direct motion by the tangent and an attractive motion towards the central body", and "my hypothesis of the lawes or causes of springinesse", and then a new hypothesis from Paris about planetary motions (which Hooke described at length), and then efforts to carry out or improve national surveys, the difference of latitude between London and Cambridge, and other items. Newton's reply offered "a fansy of my own" about a terrestrial experiment (not a proposal about celestial motions) which might detect the Earth's motion, by the use of a body first suspended in air and then dropped to let it fall.  The main point was to indicate how Newton thought the falling body could experimentally reveal the Earth's motion by its direction of deviation from the vertical, but he went on hypothetically to consider how its motion could continue if the solid Earth had not been in the way (on a spiral path to the centre). Hooke disagreed with Newton's idea of how the body would continue to move.&lt;ref&gt;Several commentators have followed Hooke in calling Newton's spiral path mistaken, or even a 'blunder', but there are also the following facts: (a) that Hooke left out of account Newton's specific statement that the motion resulted from dropping "a heavy body suspended in the Air" (i.e. a resisting medium), see Newton to Hooke, 28 November 1679, document #236 at page 301, 'Correspondence' vol.2 cited above, and compare Hooke's report to the Royal Society on 11 December 1679 where Hooke reported the matter "supposing no resistance", see D Gjertsen, 'Newton Handbook' (1986), at page 259); and (b) that Hooke's reply of 9 December 1679 to Newton considered the cases of motion both with and without air resistance: The resistance-free path was what Hooke called an 'elliptueid'; but a line in Hooke's diagram showing the path for his case of air resistance was, though elongated, also another inward-spiralling path ending at the Earth's centre: Hooke wrote "where the Medium ... has a power of impeding and destroying its motion the curve in wch it would move would be some what like the Line AIKLMNOP &amp;c and ... would terminate in the center C". Hooke's path including air resistance was therefore to this extent like Newton's (see 'Correspondence' vol.2, cited above, at pages 304–306, document #237, with accompanying figure). The diagrams are also available online: see Curtis Wilson, chapter 13 in "Planetary Astronomy from the Renaissance to the Rise of Astrophysics, Part A, Tycho Brahe to Newton", (Cambridge UP 1989), at page 241 showing [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA241 Newton's 1679 diagram] with spiral, and extract of his letter; also at page 242 showing [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA242 Hooke's 1679 diagram] including two paths, closed curve and spiral. Newton pointed out in his later correspondence over the priority claim that the descent in a spiral "is true in a resisting medium such as our air is", see 'Correspondence', vol.2 cited above, at page 433, document #286.&lt;/ref&gt; A short further correspondence developed, and towards the end of it Hooke, writing on 6 January 1680 to Newton, communicated his "supposition ... that the Attraction always is in a duplicate proportion to the Distance from the Center Reciprocall, and Consequently that the Velocity will be in a subduplicate proportion to the Attraction and Consequently as Kepler Supposes Reciprocall to the Distance."&lt;ref&gt;See page 309 in 'Correspondence of Isaac Newton', Vol 2 cited above, at document #239.&lt;/ref&gt; (Hooke's inference about the velocity was actually incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;See Curtis Wilson (1989) at page 244.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1686, when the first book of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''Principia'' was presented to the [[Royal Society]], Hooke claimed that Newton had obtained from him the "notion" of "the rule of the decrease of Gravity, being reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the Center". At the same time (according to [[Edmond Halley]]'s contemporary report) Hooke agreed that "the Demonstration of the Curves generated therby" was wholly Newton's.&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

A recent assessment about the early history of the inverse square law is that "by the late 1660s," the assumption of an "inverse proportion between gravity and the square of distance was rather common and had been advanced by a number of different people for different reasons".&lt;ref&gt;See "Meanest foundations and nobler superstructures: Hooke, Newton and the 'Compounding of the Celestiall Motions of the Planetts'", Ofer Gal, 2003 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0nKYlXxIemoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA9#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false at page 9].&lt;/ref&gt; Newton himself had shown in the 1660s that for planetary motion under a circular assumption, force in the radial direction had an inverse-square relation with distance from the center.&lt;ref name="T Whiteside 1991 pages 11–61"/&gt; Newton, faced in May 1686 with Hooke's claim on the inverse square law, denied that Hooke was to be credited as author of the idea, giving reasons including the citation of prior work by others before Hooke.&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt; Newton also firmly claimed that even if it had happened that he had first heard of the inverse square proportion from Hooke, which it had not, he would still have some rights to it in view of his mathematical developments and demonstrations, which enabled observations to be relied on as evidence of its accuracy, while Hooke, without mathematical demonstrations and evidence in favour of the supposition, could only guess (according to Newton) that it was approximately valid "at great distances from the center".&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;

The background described above shows there was basis for Newton to deny deriving the inverse square law from Hooke. On the other hand, Newton did accept and acknowledge, in all editions of the ''Principia'', that Hooke (but not exclusively Hooke) had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system. Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in the Scholium to Proposition 4 in Book 1.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 1729 English translation of the 'Principia', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA66 at page 66].&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also acknowledged to Halley that his correspondence with Hooke in 1679–80 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters, but that did not mean, according to Newton, that Hooke had told Newton anything new or original: "yet am I not beholden to him for any light into that business but only for the diversion he gave me from my other studies to think on these things &amp; for his dogmaticalness in writing as if he had found the motion in the Ellipsis, which inclined me to try it ...".&lt;ref name=167986letters /&gt;)   Newton's reawakening interest in astronomy received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680/1681, on which he corresponded with [[John Flamsteed]].&lt;ref&gt;R S Westfall, 'Never at Rest', 1980, at pages 391–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1759, decades after the deaths of both Newton and Hooke, [[Alexis Clairaut]], mathematical astronomer eminent in his own right in the field of gravitational studies, made his assessment after reviewing what Hooke had published on gravitation.  "One must not think that this idea ... of Hooke diminishes Newton's glory", Clairaut wrote; "The example of Hooke" serves "to show what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated".&lt;ref&gt;The second extract is quoted and translated in W.W. Rouse Ball, "An Essay on Newton's 'Principia'" (London and New York: Macmillan, 1893), at page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The original statements by Clairaut (in French) are found (with orthography here as in the original) in "Explication abregée du systême du monde, et explication des principaux phénomenes astronomiques tirée des Principes de M. Newton" (1759), at Introduction (section IX), page 6: "Il ne faut pas croire que cette idée ... de Hook diminue la gloire de M. Newton", [and] "L'exemple de Hook" [serves] "à faire voir quelle distance il y a entre une vérité entrevue &amp; une vérité démontrée".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later editions==
Two later editions were published by Newton:

===Second edition, 1713===
Newton had been urged to make a new edition of the ''Principia'' since the early 1690s, partly because copies of the first edition had already become very rare and expensive within a few years after 1687.&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol.4, Cambridge University Press 1967, at pp.519, n.2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Newton referred to his plans for a second edition in correspondence with Flamsteed in November 1694:&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol.4, Cambridge University press 1967, at p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also maintained annotated copies of the first edition specially bound up with interleaves on which he could note his revisions; two of these copies still survive:&lt;ref&gt;I Bernard Cohen, Introduction to the Principia, Cambridge 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; but he had not completed the revisions by 1708, and of two would-be editors, Newton had almost severed connections with one, [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]], and the other, [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]] seems not to have met with Newton's approval and was also terminally ill, dying later in 1708. Nevertheless, reasons were accumulating not to put off the new edition any longer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard S. Westfall]]. ''Never at Rest'': A Biography of Isaac Newton. Cambridge U. Press. 1980 {{ISBN|0-521-23143-4}}, at p.699.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Bentley]], master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], persuaded Newton to allow him to undertake a second edition, and in June 1708 Bentley wrote to Newton with a specimen print of the first sheet, at the same time expressing the (unfulfilled) hope that Newton had made progress towards finishing the revisions.&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol.4, Cambridge University press 1967, at pp.518–20.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Bentley then realised that the editorship was technically too difficult for him, and with Newton's consent he appointed [[Roger Cotes]], Plumian professor of astronomy at Trinity, to undertake the editorship for him as a kind of deputy (but Bentley still made the publishing arrangements and had the financial responsibility and profit). The correspondence of 1709–1713 shows Cotes reporting to two masters, Bentley and Newton, and managing (and often correcting) a large and important set of revisions to which Newton sometimes could not give his full attention.&lt;ref&gt;The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol.5, Cambridge University press 1975. Bentley's letter to Newton of October 1709 (at pp.&amp;nbsp;7–8) describes Cotes' perhaps unenviable position in relation to his master Bentley: "You need not be so shy of giving Mr. Cotes too much trouble: he has more esteem for you, and obligations to you, than to think that trouble too grievous: but however he does it at my Orders, to whom he owes more than that."&lt;/ref&gt; Under the weight of Cotes' efforts, but impeded by priority disputes between Newton and Leibniz,&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, pp.712–716.&lt;/ref&gt; and by troubles at the Mint,&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, pp.751–760.&lt;/ref&gt; Cotes was able to announce publication to Newton on 30 June 1713.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, p.750.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentley sent Newton only six presentation copies; Cotes was unpaid; Newton omitted any acknowledgement to Cotes.

Among those who gave Newton corrections for the Second Edition were: [[Firmin Abauzit]], Roger Cotes and David Gregory. However, Newton omitted acknowledgements to some because of the priority disputes. [[John Flamsteed]], the Astronomer Royal, suffered this especially.

The Second Edition was the basis of the first edition to be printed abroad, which appeared in Amsterdam in 1714.

===Third edition, 1726===
The third edition was published 25 March 1726, under the stewardship of ''[[Henry Pemberton]], M.D., a man of the greatest skill in these matters...''; Pemberton later said that this recognition was worth more to him than the two hundred guinea award from Newton.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, p.802&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annotated and other editions===
In 1739–42, two French priests, Pères Thomas LeSeur and [[François Jacquier]] (of the [[Minim (religious order)|Minim]] order, but sometimes erroneously identified as Jesuits), produced with the assistance of [[Jean-Louis Calandrini|J.-L. Calandrini]] an extensively annotated version of the ''Principia'' in the 3rd edition of 1726. Sometimes this is referred to as the ''Jesuit edition'': it was much used, and reprinted more than once in Scotland during the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Facsimile"/&gt;

[[Émilie du Châtelet]] also made a translation of Newton's Principia into French. Unlike LeSeur and Jacquier's edition, hers was a complete translation of Newton's three books and their prefaces. She also included a Commentary section where she fused the three books into a much clearer and easier to understand summary. She included an analytical section where she applied the new mathematics of calculus to Newton's most controversial theories. Previously, geometry was the standard mathematics used to analyse theories. Du Châtelet's translation is the only complete one to have been done in French and hers remains the standard French translation to this day.&lt;ref&gt;See "Translating Newton's 'Principia': The Marquise du Châtelet's Revisions and Additions for a French Audience." Author(s): Judith P. Zinsser Source: ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol. 55, No. 2 (May 2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;227–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English translations===
Two full English translations of Newton's ''Principia'' have appeared, both based on Newton's 3rd edition of 1726.

The first, from 1729, by Andrew Motte,&lt;ref name="Motte"/&gt; was described by Newton scholar [[I. Bernard Cohen]] (in 1968) as "still of enormous value in conveying to us the sense of Newton's words in their own time, and it is generally faithful to the original: clear, and well written".&lt;ref&gt;I Bernard Cohen (1968), "Introduction" (at page i) to (facsimile) reprint of 1729 English translation of Newton's "Principia" (London (1968), Dawsons of Pall Mall).&lt;/ref&gt; The 1729 version was the basis for several republications, often incorporating revisions, among them a widely used modernised English version of 1934, which appeared under the editorial name of Florian Cajori (though completed and published only some years after his death). Cohen pointed out ways in which the 18th-century terminology and punctuation of the 1729 translation might be confusing to modern readers, but he also made severe criticisms of the 1934 modernised English version, and showed that the revisions had been made without regard to the original, also demonstrating gross errors "that provided the final impetus to our decision to produce a wholly new translation".&lt;ref&gt;See pages 29–37 in [[I. Bernard Cohen]] (1999), "A Guide to Newton's Principia", published as an introduction to "Isaac Newton: The Principia, Mathematical principles of natural philosophy, a new translation" by I Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman, University of California Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second full English translation, into modern English, is the work that resulted from this decision by collaborating translators I. Bernard Cohen, Anne Whitman, and Julia Budenz; it was published in 1999 with a guide by way of introduction.&lt;ref&gt;''Isaac Newton: The Principia, Mathematical principles of natural philosophy, a new translation'' by I. Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman, preceded by "A Guide to Newton's Principia" by I. Bernard Cohen, University of California Press, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-520-08816-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-08817-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

William H. Donahue has published a translation of the work's central argument, published in 1996, along with expansion of included proofs and ample commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Densmore and William H. Donahue, ''Newton's Principia: The Central Argument: Translation, Notes, and Expanded Proofs'' (Green Lion Press; 3rd edition, 2003) {{ISBN|978-1-888009-23-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-888009-23-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was developed as a textbook for classes at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] and the aim of this translation is to be faithful to the Latin text.&lt;ref&gt;Densmore and Donahue, pp. xv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, British [[astronaut]] [[Tim Peake]] named his upcoming mission to the [[International Space Station]] ''Principia'' after the book, in "honour of Britain's greatest scientist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-28329097|title=Tim Peake mission name pays tribute to Isaac Newton|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Peake's ''Principia'' launched on December 15, 2015 aboard [[Soyuz TMA-19M]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2015/06/09/roscosmos-announces-new-soyuzprogress-launch-dates/?linkId=14819770|title=Roscosmos Announces New Soyuz/Progress Launch Dates|date=9 June 2015|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Registry of Research Data Repositories''' ('''re3data.org''') is an [[Open Science]] tool that offers researchers, funding organizations, libraries and publishers an overview of existing international [[data library|repositories]] for [[research data]].

== Background ==

re3data.org is a global registry of research data repositories from all academic disciplines. It provides an overview of existing research data repositories in order to help researchers to identify a suitable repository for their data and thus comply with requirements set out in data policies.&lt;ref name=Pampel2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pampel|first=Heinz|author2=Vierkant, Paul |author3=Scholze, Frank |author4=Bertelmann, Roland |author5=Kindling, Maxi |title=Making Research Data Repositories Visible: The re3data.org Registry|journal=PLoS ONE|date=4 November 2013|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e78080|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0078080|pmid=24223762|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0078080|accessdate=7 February 2014|bibcode=2013PLoSO...878080P|pmc=3817176|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The registry was officially launched in May 2013.&lt;ref name=Wellander2013&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sparceurope.org/registry-of-research-data-repositories-launched-re3data-org/ | title=Registry of Research Data Repositories launched – re3data.org | author=Wellander, Janna | date= 4 June 2013 | work=SPARC Europe | accessdate= 5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

In March 2014 the registry lists 634 research data repositories from around the world covering all academic disciplines. 586 of these are described in detail using the re3data.org schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=re3data.org – from Funding to Growing|url=http://www.re3data.org/2014/03/re3data-org-from-funding-to-growing/|work=re3data.org|accessdate=21 March 2014|date=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The project makes all metadata in the registry available for open use under the Creative Commons deed CC0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DataCite, re3data.org, and Databib Announce Collaboration|url=http://www.re3data.org/2014/03/datacite-re3data-org-databib-collaboration/|work=re3data|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DRYAD entry in re3data.org 2014-03-21.png|thumb|A screenshot of the DataDryad entry in re3data.org.]]

== Features ==

The majority of the listed research data repositories are described in detail by a comprehensive schema, namely the re3data.org Schema for the Description of Research Data Repositories.&lt;ref name=Vierkant&gt;{{cite web|last=Vierkant|first=Paul|title=Schema for the description of research data repositories|work=GFZ Helmholtz-Zentrum Potsdam|accessdate=7 February 2014|author2=Spier, Shaked |author3=Rücknagel, Jessika |author4= et. al. |url=http://gfzpublic.gfz-potsdam.de/pubman/faces/viewItemFullPage.jsp?itemId=escidoc:301641|doi=10.2312/re3.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Information icons support researchers to identify an adequate repository for the storage and reuse of their data.&lt;ref name=Wellander2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fenner|first=Martin|title=registry of research data repositories launched|url=http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2013/06/01/re3data-org-registry-of-research-data-repositories-launched/|work=PLOS Blog|publisher=Gobbledygook|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Journal.pone.0078080.g001.png|thumb|Aspects of a Research Data Repository with the corresponding icons used in re3data.org.]]

== Inclusion criteria ==

A repository is indexed when the minimum requirements for inclusion in re3data.org are met: the repository has to be run by a legal entity, such as a sustainable institution (e.g. library, university) and clearly state access conditions to the data and repository as well as the terms of use. Additionally, an English [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) plus a focus on research [[data]] is needed.&lt;ref name=Vierkant /&gt;

== Partners and Cooperation ==

re3data.org is a joint project of the [[Berlin School of Library and Information Science]], the [[GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences]] and the Library of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT). The project is funded by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]] (DFG).&lt;ref name=Pampel2013 /&gt;
The project cooperates with other Open Science initiatives like Databib,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kratz|first=John|title=Finding Disciplinary Data Repositories with DataBib and re3data|url=http://datapub.cdlib.org/2014/03/03/finding-disciplinary-data-repositories-with-databib-and-re3data/|work=Data Pub|accessdate=21 March 2014|author2=Nicholls, Natsuko |date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BioSharing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Databases|url=http://www.biosharing.org/biodbcore|work=biosharing|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DataCite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resources|url=http://www.datacite.org/resources|work=DataCite|accessdate=5 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095924/http://www.datacite.org/resources|archivedate=9 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and OpenAIRE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=re3data.org and OpenAIRE sign Memorandum of Understanding|url=https://www.openaire.eu/it/component/content/article/481-re3data-and-openaire-sign-memorandum-of-understanding|work=OpenAIRE|accessdate=5 February 2014|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several publishers, research institutions and funders refer to re3data.org in their Editorial Policies and guidelines as a tool for the identification of suitable data repositories, e.g. [[Nature (journal)|Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The paper trail|url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-paper-trail-1.13123|work=Nature|accessdate=5 February 2014|date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SpringerPlus - Editorial policies|url=http://www.springerplus.com/about#editorialpolicies|work=SpringerPlus|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines on Open Access to Scientific Publications and Research Data in Horizon 2020|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-pilot-guide_en.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6010">The '''Reproducibility Project: Psychology''' was a collaboration of 270 contributing authors to repeat 100 published experimental and correlational psychological studies. This project was led by the [[Center for Open Science]] and its co-founder, [[Brian Nosek]], who started the project in November 2011. The results of this collaboration were published in August 2015. [[Reproducibility]] is the ability to produce a copy or duplicate, in this case it is the ability to replicate the results of the original studies. The project has illustrated the growing problem of failed reproducibility in social science. This project has started a movement that has spread through the science world with the expanded testing of the reproducibility of published works.&lt;ref name=ResearchDigest2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jarrett|first1=Christian|title=This is what happened when psychologists tried to replicate 100 previously published findings|url=https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/|website=Research Digest|publisher=BPS Research Digest|accessdate=8 November 2016|date=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Nosek of [[University of Virginia]] and colleagues sought out to replicate 100 different studies that all were published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weir|first1=Kristen|title=A reproducibility crisis?|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/10/share-reproducibility.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project pulled these studies from three different journals'', [[Psychological Science]]'', the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'', and the ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition]]'',  published in 2008 to see if they could get the same results as the initial findings.  In their initial publications 97 of these 100 studies claimed to have significant results. To stay as true as they could the group went through extensive measures to remain true to the original studies, to the extent of consulting the original authors. Even with all the extra steps taken to ensure the same conditions of the original 97 studies only 35 of the studies replicated (36.1%), and if they did replicate their effects were smaller than the initial studies effects. The authors emphasized that the findings reflect a problem that affects all of science not just psychology, and that there is room to improve reproducibility in psychology.

== Statistical relevance ==
Failure to replicate can be caused by a few different reasons. The first is a [[type II error]], which is when you accept the null hypothesis when it is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/type+II+error|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=24 November 2016|title=type II error}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be classified as a false negative. A [[type I error]] is the rejection of a null hypothesis even if it is true, so this is considered a false positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/type%20I%20error|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=24 November 2016|title=type I error}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Center for Open Science ==
The [[Center for Open Science]] was founded by Brian Nosek and Jeff Spies in 2013 with a $5.25 million grant from the [[Laura and John Arnold Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Wired2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apple|first1=Sam|title=The Young Billionaire Behind the War on Bad Science|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/01/john-arnold-waging-war-on-bad-science/|work=Wired|date=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have built a team that today has about 50 individuals on it. The goal of the group is to help increase the openness, integrity and reproducibility of scientific research. The COS which is a rather small number of individuals oversee much larger groups that are helping with the COS's mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://centerforopenscience.org/about_mission/|title=COS {{!}} About Our Mission|last=Cohoon|first=Johanna|website=centerforopenscience.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is made up of multiple different kinds of scientists which include astronomers, biologists, chemists, computer scientists, education researchers, engineers, neuroscientists, and psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://centerforopenscience.org/about_team/|title=COS {{!}} About Our Team|last=Cohoon|first=Johanna|website=centerforopenscience.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2017 the Foundation had provided an additional $10 million in funding.&lt;ref name=Wired2017/&gt;

== Outcome and importance ==
There have been multiple implications of the Reproducibility Project. People all over have started to question the legitimacy of scientific studies that have been published in esteemed journals. Journals typically only publish articles with big [[effect sizes]] that reject the null hypothesis. Leading into the huge issue of people re-doing studies that have already found to fail, but not knowing because there is no record of the failed studies, which will lead to more false positives to be published. It is unknown if any of the original study authors committed fraud in publishing their projects, but some of the authors of the original studies are part of the 270 contributors of this project.

One earlier study found that around $28 billion worth of research per year in [[Medicine|medical]] fields is non-reproducible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002165|title=PLOS Biology|work=plos.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Research''' comprises "[[creativity|creative]] and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of [[knowledge]], including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications."&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2015), Frascati Manual 2015: Guidelines for Collecting and Reporting Data on Research and Experimental Development, The Measurement of Scientific, Technological and Innovation Activities, OECD Publishing, Paris. Retrieved on 27 October 2017 from [https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264239012-en].&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support [[theorem]]s, or develop new [[theory|theories]]. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports.  To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole.  The primary purposes of [[basic research]] (as opposed to [[applied research]]) are [[documentation]], [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]], [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]], or the [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on [[epistemology|epistemologies]], which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: [[scientific]], [[humanities]], [[artistic]], economic, [[social research|social]], business, [[marketing research|marketing]], [[practitioner research]], life, [[technological]], etc.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Aristotle]], (384–322 BC), one of the early figures in the development of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.pbs.org/saf/1307/features/knows.htm The Origins of Science]". ''[[Scientific American Frontiers]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The word ''research'' is derived from the [[French language|Middle French]] "''recherche''", which means "to go about seeking", the term itself being derived from the [[Old French]] term "''recerchier''" a compound word from "re-" + "cerchier", or "sercher", meaning 'search'.&lt;ref name="Merriam_webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/research|title=Research|author=|first=|date=|website=Merriam Webster (https://www.merriam-webster.com/)|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded use of the term was in 1577.&lt;ref name="Merriam_webster"/&gt;

== Definitions ==
Research has been defined in a number of different ways, and while there are similarities, there does not appear to be a single, all-encompassing definition that is embraced by all who engage in it.

One definition of research is used by the OECD, "Any creative systematic activity undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this knowledge to devise new applications."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2312|title=OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms - Research and development � UNESCO Definition|last=|first=|date=|website=stats.oecd.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219233912/http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2312|archive-date=2007-02-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of research is given by [[John W. Creswell]], who states that  "research is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue". It consists of three steps: pose a question, collect data to answer the question, and present an answer to the question.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. W. (2008). Educational Research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd ed.). Upper Saddle River: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines research in more detail as "studious inquiry or examination;  ''especially'' : investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts, revision of accepted theories or laws in the light of new facts, or practical application of such new or revised theories or laws"&lt;ref name="Merriam_webster"/&gt;

== Forms of research{{anchor|Original research}} ==

{{selfref|"Original research" redirects here. For the Wikipedia policy, see [[Wikipedia:No original research]]}}
'''Original research''' is research that is not exclusively based on a summary, review or synthesis of earlier publications on the subject of research. This material is of a [[primary source]] character. The purpose of the original research is to produce new [[knowledge]], rather than to present the existing knowledge in a new form (''e.g.'', summarized or classified).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Original Research?  Original research is considered a primary source|url=http://www.unf.edu/library/guides/originalresearch.html|publisher=Thomas G. Carpenter Library, University of North Florida|accessdate=9 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709085129/http://www.unf.edu/library/guides/originalresearch.html|archivedate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XlIH4R9Z_k8C&amp;pg=PT75|title=Schaum's Quick Guide to Writing Great Research Papers|first=Laurie|last=Rozakis|date=15 June 2007|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|via=Google Books|isbn=9780071511223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Original research can take a number of forms, depending on the discipline it pertains to. In experimental work, it typically involves direct or indirect observation of the researched subject(s), e.g., in the laboratory or in the field, documents the [[methodology]], results, and conclusions of an experiment or set of experiments, or offers a novel interpretation of previous results. In [[Scientific modelling|analytical]] work, there are typically some new (for example) mathematical results produced, or a new way of approaching an existing problem. In some subjects which do not typically carry out experimentation or analysis of this kind, the originality is in the particular way existing understanding is changed or re-interpreted based on the outcome of the work of the [[Academic authorship|researcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aare.edu.au/09pap/li091380.pdf |title=Early career researcher originality: Engaging Richard Florida's international competition for creative workers |first=Michael |last=Singh |author2=Li, Bingyi |date=6 October 2009 |publisher=Centre for Educational Research, University of Western Sydney |page=2 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64cuvN4SB?url=http://www.aare.edu.au/09pap/li091380.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2012 |deadurl=no |access-date=12 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of originality of the research is among major criteria for articles to be published in [[academic journal]]s and usually established by means of [[peer review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Callaham |first=Michael |last2=Wears|first2= Robert|last3=Weber|first3=Ellen L. |title=Journal Prestige, Publication Bias, and Other Characteristics Associated With Citation of Published Studies in Peer-Reviewed Journals |journal=Jama |volume=287 |issue=21 |pages=2847–50 |year=2002 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/287/21/2847.short |doi=10.1001/jama.287.21.2847|pmid=12038930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graduate student]]s are commonly required to perform original research as part of a [[dissertation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oFFWt5oyA3oC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=%22original+research%22&amp;cd=90#v=onepage&amp;q=%22original+research%22&amp;f=false|title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2006-2007 edition|first=The United States Department of|last=Labor|date=26 June 2006|publisher=Mcgraw-hill|via=Google Books|isbn=9780071472883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scientific research''' is a systematic way of gathering data and harnessing [[curiosity]]. This research provides [[science|scientific]] information and theories for the explanation of the [[nature]] and the properties of the world. It makes practical applications possible. Scientific research is funded by public authorities, by charitable organizations and by private groups, including many companies. Scientific research can be subdivided into different classifications according to their academic and application disciplines. Scientific research is a widely used criterion for judging the standing of an academic institution, but some argue that such is an inaccurate assessment of the institution, because the quality of research does not tell about the quality of teaching (these do not necessarily correlate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Business%20School%20Prestige.pdf | title = Business School Prestige: Research versus Teaching | author1 = J.

'''Research in the humanities''' involves different methods such as for example [[hermeneutics]] and [[semiotics]]. Humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a question, but instead, explore the issues and details that surround it. Context is always important, and context can be social, historical, political, cultural, or ethnic. An example of research in the humanities is historical research, which is embodied in [[historical method]]. Historians use [[primary sources]] and other [[evidence]] to systematically investigate a topic, and then to write histories in the form of accounts of the past. Other studies aim to merely examine the occurrence of behaviours in societies and communities, without particularly looking for reasons or motivations to explain these. These studies may be qualitative or quantitative, and can use a variety of approaches, such as queer theory or feminist theory.&lt;ref name="Roffee 4–22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roffee|first=James A|last2=Waling|first2=Andrea|date=18 August 2016|title=Resolving ethical challenges when researching with minority and vulnerable populations: LGBTIQ victims of violence, harassment and bullying|journal=Research Ethics|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=4–22|doi=10.1177/1747016116658693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artistic research''', also seen as 'practice-based research', can take form when creative works are considered both the research and the object of research itself. It is the debatable body of thought which offers an alternative to purely scientific methods in research in its search for knowledge and truth.

=== Scientific research ===

{{Main|Scientific method}}
[[File:Microscopy lab.jpg|thumb|right|Primary scientific research being carried out at the [[Electron microscope|Microscopy]] Laboratory of the [[Idaho National Laboratory]].]]

Generally, research is understood to follow a certain structural [[Process (science)|process]]. Though step order may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the following steps are usually part of most formal research, both basic and applied:
# [[Scientific method#Elements of the scientific method|Observations and formation of the topic]]: Consists of the subject area of one's interest and following that subject area to conduct subject related research. The subject area should not be randomly chosen since it requires reading a vast amount of literature on the topic to determine the gap in the literature the researcher intends to narrow. A keen interest in the chosen subject area is advisable. The research will have to be justified by linking its importance to already existing knowledge about the topic.
# [[Hypothesis]]: A testable prediction which designates the relationship between two or more variables.
# [[Conceptual definition]]: Description of a concept by relating it to other concepts.
# [[Operational definition]]:  Details in regards to defining the variables and how they will be measured/assessed in the study.
# [[Data collection|Gathering of data]]: Consists of identifying a population and selecting samples, gathering information from or about these samples by using specific research instruments. The instruments used for data collection must be valid and reliable.
# [[Data analysis|Analysis of data]]: Involves breaking down the individual pieces of data to draw conclusions about it.
# [[Data Interpretation]]: This can be represented through tables, figures, and pictures, and then described in words.
# [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|Test, revising of hypothesis]]
# [[Scientific method#Elements of the scientific method|Conclusion, reiteration if necessary]]

A common misconception is that a hypothesis will be proven (see, rather, [[null hypothesis]]). Generally, a hypothesis is used to make predictions that can be tested by observing the outcome of an experiment.  If the outcome is inconsistent with the hypothesis, then the hypothesis is rejected (see [[falsifiability]]). However, if the outcome is consistent with the hypothesis, the experiment is said to support the hypothesis. This careful language is used because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also be consistent with the observations. In this sense, a hypothesis can never be proven, but rather only supported by surviving rounds of scientific testing and, eventually, becoming widely thought of as true.

A useful hypothesis allows prediction and within the accuracy of observation of the time, the prediction will be verified. As the accuracy of observation improves with time, the hypothesis may no longer provide an accurate prediction. In this case, a new hypothesis will arise to challenge the old, and to the extent that the new hypothesis makes more accurate predictions than the old, the new will supplant it. Researchers can also use a null hypothesis, which states no relationship or difference between the independent or dependent variables.

=== Historical research ===
{{Main|Historical method}}
[[File:Leopold von Ranke 1868.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795–1886), considered to be one of the founders of modern source-based history.]]

The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use historical sources and other evidence to research and then to write history. There are various history guidelines that are commonly used by historians in their work, under the headings of external criticism, internal criticism, and synthesis. This includes [[lower criticism]] and sensual criticism. Though items may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the following concepts are part of most formal historical research:&lt;ref name="Garraghan  (1946)"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide to Historical Method |last=Garraghan |first=Gilbert J. |year=1946 |publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York  |isbn=978-0-8371-7132-6 |page=168 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artistic research ===
The controversial trend of artistic teaching becoming more academics-oriented is leading to artistic research being accepted as the primary mode of enquiry in art as in the case of other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lesage  |first1=Dieter |date=Spring 2009 |title=Who's Afraid of Artistic Research? On measuring artistic research output |journal=Art&amp;Research – A Journal of Ideas, Contexts and Methods  |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages= |url=http://www.artandresearch.org.uk/v2n2/pdfs/lesage.pdf |issn=1752-6388 |accessdate=14 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the characteristics of artistic research is that it must accept [[subjectivity]] as opposed to the classical scientific methods. As such, it is similar to the [[social science]]s in using [[qualitative research]] and [[intersubjectivity]] as tools to apply measurement and critical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Eisner | first1 = E. W. |title = On the Differences between Scientific and Artistic Approaches to Qualitative Research |journal = Educational Researcher |volume = 10 |issue = 4 |pages = 5–9 |doi = 10.2307/1175121 |year = 1981
| jstor = 1175121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic research has been defined by the [[University of Dance and Circus]] (Dans och Cirkushögskolan, DOCH), [[Stockholm]] in the following manner - "Artistic research is to investigate and test with the purpose of gaining knowledge within and for our artistic disciplines. It is based on artistic practices, methods, and criticality. Through presented documentation, the insights gained shall be placed in a context."&lt;ref name="DOCH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doch.se/web/Artistic_Research.aspx |title=Artistic research at DOCH |author=Unattributed |website=Dans och Cirkushögskolan (website) |publisher= |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic research aims to enhance knowledge and understanding with presentation of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, M. (2009). Draft Proposal. Journal for Artistic Research. Bern University of the Arts.&lt;/ref&gt; A more simple understanding by [[Julian Klein]] defines Artistic Research as any kind of research employing the artistic mode of perception.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, J. (2010). What is artistic research? Research Catalogue. {{cite web |url=http://www.jar-online.net/what-is-artistic-research/ |title=What is artistic research? |author=Julian Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a survey of the central problematics of today's Artistic Research, see [[Giaco Schiesser]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiesser, G.

Carayannis [= ARIS, Vol. 1]. Wien/New York: Springer 2015, pp. 197–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to artist [[Hakan Topal]], in artistic research, "perhaps more so than other disciplines, intuition is utilized as a method to identify a wide range of new and unexpected productive modalities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmuseum.org/blog/view/whose-terms-a-glossary-for-social-practice-research|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909042922/http://www.newmuseum.org/blog/view/whose-terms-a-glossary-for-social-practice-research|dead-url=no|archive-date=2014-09-09|title=Topal, H. (2014) Whose Terms? A Glossary for Social Practice: RESEARCH|author=|date=|website=newmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most writers, whether of fiction or non-fiction books, also have to do research to support their creative work. This may be factual, historical, or background research. Background research could include, for example, geographical or procedural research.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman A (2003) Research for Writers, pp 4–5. London: A&amp;C Black Publishers Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Society for Artistic Research (SAR)]] publishes the triannual ''Journal for Artistic Research'' (JAR),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swtr.ch/images/stories/pdf/en/kunstbericht_e.pdf Swiss Science and Technology Research Council (2011), ''Research Funding in the Arts''] [accessed 3 Feb 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borgdorff, Henk (2012), ''The Conflict of the Faculties.

== Steps in conducting research ==
Research is often conducted using the hourglass model structure of research.&lt;ref&gt;Trochim, W.M.K, (2006). Research Methods Knowledge Base.&lt;/ref&gt; The hourglass model starts with a broad spectrum for research, focusing in on the required information through the method of the project (like the neck of the hourglass), then expands the research in the form of discussion and results. The major steps in conducting research are:&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J.W. (2008). Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd).

Scientific method in practice. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-81689-0}} (page 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Most research begins with a general statement of the problem, or rather, the purpose for engaging in the study.&lt;ref&gt;Rocco, T.S., Hatcher, T., &amp; Creswell, J.W.

San Francisco, CA: John Wiley &amp; Sons. 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-470-39335-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literature review identifies flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study. Often, a [[literature review]] is conducted in a given subject area before a research question is identified.  A gap in the current literature, as identified by a researcher, then engenders a research question.  The research question may be parallel to the [[hypothesis]].  The hypothesis is the supposition to be tested.  The researcher(s) collects data to test the hypothesis. The researcher(s) then analyzes and interprets the data via a variety of statistical methods, engaging in what is known as [[empirical research]]. The results of the data analysis in rejecting or failing to reject the [[null hypothesis]] are then reported and evaluated. At the end, the researcher may discuss avenues for [[Further research is needed|further research]]. However, some researchers advocate for the reverse approach: starting with articulating findings and discussion of them, moving "up" to identification of a research problem that emerges in the findings and literature review. The reverse approach is justified by the transactional nature of the research endeavor where research inquiry, research questions, research method, relevant research literature, and so on are not fully known until the findings have fully emerged and been interpreted.

[[Rudolph Rummel]] says, "... no researcher should accept any one or two tests as definitive. It is only when a range of tests are consistent over many kinds of data, researchers, and methods can one have confidence in the results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/MTF.CHAP9.HTM|title=QUESTIONS ABOUT FREEDOM, DEMOCIDE, AND WAR|author=|date=|website=www.hawaii.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] in [[Meno]] talks about an inherent difficulty, if not a paradox, of doing research that can be paraphrased in the following way, "If you know what you're searching for, why do you search for it?! [i.e., you have already found it] If you don't know what you're searching for, what are you searching for?!"&lt;ref&gt;Plato, &amp; Bluck, R. S. (1962). Meno.

[[File:NYC Public Library Research Room Jan 2006-1- 3.jpg|thumb|The research room at the New York Public Library, an example of [[secondary research]] in progress.]]
[[File:Hilleman-Walter-Reed.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.55|[[Maurice Hilleman]] is credited with saving more lives than any other scientist of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sullivan P |date=13 April 2005 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48244-2005Apr12.html |title=Maurice R.

The goal of the research process is to produce new knowledge or deepen understanding of a topic or issue. This process takes three main forms (although, as previously discussed, the boundaries between them may be obscure):
* [[Exploratory research]], which helps to identify and define a problem or question.
* [[Constructive research]], which tests theories and proposes solutions to a problem or question.
* [[Empirical research]], which tests the feasibility of a solution using [[empirical evidence]].
There are two major types of empirical research design: qualitative research and quantitative research. Researchers choose qualitative or quantitative methods according to the nature of the research topic they want to investigate and the research questions they aim to answer:

;[[Qualitative research]]
:This involves understanding human behavior and the reasons that govern such behavior, by asking a broad question, collecting data in the form of words, images, video etc that is analyzed, and searching for themes. This type of research aims to investigate a question without attempting to quantifiably measure variables or look to potential relationships between variables. It is viewed as more restrictive in testing hypotheses because it can be expensive and time-consuming and typically limited to a single set of research subjects.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Qualitative research is often used as a method of exploratory research as a basis for later quantitative research hypotheses.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Qualitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of [[social constructionism]].

[[Social media]] posts are used for qualitative research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snelson|first1=Chareen L.|title=Qualitative and Mixed Methods Social Media Research|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Methods|date=March 2016|volume=15|issue=1|pages=160940691562457|doi=10.1177/1609406915624574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Quantitative research]]
:This involves systematic empirical investigation of quantitative properties and phenomena and their relationships, by asking a narrow question and collecting numerical data to analyze it utilizing [[Descriptive statistical technique|statistical]] methods. The quantitative research designs are experimental, correlational, and survey (or descriptive).&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. W. (2008). ''Educational Research:  Planning, Conducting, and Evaluating Quantitative and Qualitative Research.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ. Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics derived from quantitative research can be used to establish the existence of associative or causal relationships between variables.  Quantitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of [[positivism]].

The quantitative data collection methods rely on random sampling and structured data collection instruments that fit diverse experiences into predetermined response categories.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} These methods produce results that are easy to summarize, compare, and generalize.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Quantitative research is concerned with testing hypotheses derived from theory or being able to estimate the size of a phenomenon of interest.

If the research question is about people, participants may be randomly assigned to different treatments (this is the only way that a quantitative study can be considered a true experiment).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  If this is not feasible, the researcher may collect data on participant and situational characteristics to statistically control for their influence on the dependent, or outcome, variable. If the intent is to generalize from the research participants to a larger population, the researcher will employ probability sampling to select participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.uwec.edu/piercech/ResearchMethods/Data%20collection%20methods/DATA%20COLLECTION%20METHODS.htm|title=Data Collection Methods&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=uwec.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In either qualitative or quantitative research, the researcher(s) may collect primary or secondary data.  Primary data is data collected specifically for the research, such as through interviews or questionnaires.  Secondary data is data that already exists, such as census data, which can be re-used for the research.  It is good ethical research practice to use secondary data wherever possible.&lt;ref&gt;Kara H (2012) Research and Evaluation for Busy Practitioners: A Time-Saving Guide, p.102. Bristol: The Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixed-method research, i.e. research that includes qualitative and quantitative elements, using both primary and secondary data, is becoming more common.&lt;ref&gt;Kara H (2012) Research and Evaluation for Busy Practitioners: A Time-Saving Guide, p.114. Bristol: The Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This method has benefits that using one method alone cannot offer. For example, a researcher may choose to conduct a qualitative study and follow it up with a quantitative study to gain additional insights.&lt;ref name="Creswell Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Creswell|first1=John W.|title=Research design : qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches|date=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=978-1-4522-2609-5|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Big data]] has brought big impacts on research methods so that now many researchers do not put much effort into data collection; furthermore, methods to analyze easily available huge amounts of data have also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|date = 1 January 2015|isbn = 9781118900772|first = Alex|last = Liu|doi = 10.1002/9781118900772.etrds0325|title = Emerging Trends in the Social and Behavioral Sciences|pages = 1–15|chapter = Structural Equation Modeling and Latent Variable Approaches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Non-empirical research
Non-empirical ([[theory|theoretical]]) research is an approach that involves the development of theory as opposed to using observation and experimentation. As such, non-empirical research seeks solutions to problems using existing knowledge as its source. This, however, does not mean that new ideas and innovations cannot be found within the pool of existing and established knowledge. Non-empirical research is not an absolute alternative to empirical research because they may be used together to strengthen a research approach. Neither one is less effective than the other since they have their particular purpose in science. Typically empirical research produces observations that need to be explained; then theoretical research tries to explain them, and in so doing generates empirically testable hypotheses; these hypotheses are then tested empirically, giving more observations that may need further explanation; and so on. See [[Scientific method]].

A simple example of a non-empirical task is the prototyping of a new drug using a differentiated application of existing knowledge; another is the development of a business process in the form of a flow chart and texts where all the ingredients are from established knowledge. Much of [[cosmology|cosmological research]] is theoretical in nature. [[Mathematics]] research does not rely on externally available data; rather, it seeks to prove [[theorem]]s about [[mathematical object]]s.

== Research ethics&lt;!--'Research ethics' redirects here--&gt; ==
'''Research ethics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; involves the application of fundamental ethical principles to a variety of topics involving research, including [[scientific research]]. These principles include [[deontology]], [[consequentialism]], [[virtue ethics]] and [[value (ethics)]]. Ethical issues may arise in the design and implementation of research involving [[human experimentation]] or [[animal experimentation]], such as: various aspects of [[academic scandal]], including [[scientific misconduct]] (such as fraud, [[fabrication (science)|fabrication of data]] and [[plagiarism]]), [[whistleblowing]]; regulation of research, etc.  Research ethics is most developed as a concept in [[medical research]]. The key agreement here is the 1964 [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. The [[Nuremberg Code]] is a former agreement, but with many still important notes. Research in the [[Ethical research in social science|social sciences]] presents a different set of issues than those in medical research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to the Responsible Conduct of Research {{!}} On Being a Scientist: A Guide to Responsible Conduct in Research|date=2009|publisher=The National Academies Press|edition=Third|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/12192/chapter/2#2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can involve issues of researcher and participant safety, empowerment and access to justice.&lt;ref name="Roffee 4–22"/&gt;

When research involves human subjects, obtaining [[informed consent]] from them is essential.&lt;ref name="Creswell Book" /&gt;

== Problems in research ==

=== Methods of research ===
In many disciplines, Western methods of conducting research are predominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reverby|first=Susan M.|date=1 April 2012|title=Zachary M. Schrag. Ethical Imperialism: Institutional Review Boards and the Social Sciences, 1965–2009. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. 2010. Pp. xii, 245. $45.00|url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/117/2/484.2|journal=The American Historical Review|language=en|volume=117|issue=2|pages=484–485|doi=10.1086/ahr.117.2.484-a|issn=0002-8762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are overwhelmingly taught Western methods of data collection and study. The increasing participation of [[indigenous peoples]] as researchers has brought increased attention to the lacuna in culturally-sensitive methods of data collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples|url=https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/decolonizing-methodologies/|last=Smith|first=Linda Tuhiwai|publisher=Zed Books|year=2012|isbn=9781848139503|edition=2nd|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Western methods of data collection may not be the most accurate or relevant for research on non-Western societies. For example, "[[Hua Oranga]]" was created as a criterion for psychological evaluation in [[Māori people|Māori]] populations, and is based on dimensions of mental health important to the Māori people – "taha wairua (the spiritual dimension), taha hinengaro (the mental dimension), taha tinana (the physical dimension), and taha whanau (the family dimension)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Lisa|title=Commentary on Cultural Diversity Across the Pacific: The Dominance of Western Theories, Models, Research and Practice in Psychology|url=http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1834490912000013|journal=Journal of Pacific Rim Psychology|volume=6|issue=1|pages=27–31|doi=10.1017/prp.2012.1|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Linguicism ===
Periphery scholars face the challenges of exclusion and [[linguicism]] in research and academic publication. As the great majority of mainstream academic journals are written in English, multilingual periphery scholars often must translate their work to be accepted to elite Western-dominated journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canagarajah|first=A. Suresh|date=1 January 1996|title=From Critical Research Practice to Critical Research Reporting|jstor=3588146|journal=TESOL Quarterly|volume=30|issue=2|pages=321–331|doi=10.2307/3588146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multilingual scholars' influences from their native communicative styles can be assumed to be incompetence instead of difference.&lt;ref name="Canagarajah"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canagarajah|first=Suresh|date=October 1996|title="Nondiscursive" Requirements in Academic Publishing, Material Resources of Periphery Scholars, and the Politics of Knowledge Production|url=|journal=Written Communication|volume=13|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|via=SagePub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publication Peer Review ===
{{update|reason=This subsection's claims are potentially outdated in the "digital age" given that near-total penetration of Web access among scholars worldwide enables any scholar[s] to submit papers to any journal anywhere|date=May 2017}}
[[Peer review]] is a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field. Peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of quality, improve performance, and provide credibility. In academia, [[scholarly peer review]] is often used to determine an academic paper's suitability for publication. Usually, the peer review process involves experts in the same field who are consulted by editors to give a review of the scholarly works produced by a colleague of theirs from an unbiased and impartial point of view, and this is usually done free of charge. The tradition of peer reviews being done for free has however brought many pitfalls which are also indicative of why most peer reviewers decline many invitations to review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peerviewer.com/freelance-peer-review-scholarly-journals/|title=Peer Review of Scholarly Journal|website=www.PeerViewer.com|language=en-US|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was observed that publications from periphery countries rarely rise to the same elite status as those of North America and Europe, because limitations on the availability of resources including high-quality paper and sophisticated image-rendering software and printing tools render these publications less able to satisfy standards currently carrying formal or informal authority in the publishing industry.&lt;ref name="Canagarajah" /&gt; These limitations in turn result in the under-representation of scholars from periphery nations among the set of publications holding prestige status relative to the quantity and quality of those scholars' research efforts, and this under-representation in turn results in disproportionately reduced acceptance of the results of their efforts as contributions to the body of knowledge available worldwide.

=== Influence of the open-access movement ===
The open access movement assumes that all information generally deemed useful should be free and belongs to a "public domain", that of "humanity".&lt;ref name="Christen"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christen|first=Kimberly|date=2012|title=Does Information Really Want to be Free? Indigenous Knowledge Systems and the Question of Openness|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1618|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=6|issue=|doi=|pmid=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea gained prevalence as a result of Western colonial history and ignores alternative conceptions of knowledge circulation. For instance, most indigenous communities consider that access to certain information proper to the group should be determined by relationships.&lt;ref name="Christen" /&gt;

There is alleged to be a double standard in the Western knowledge system. On the one hand, "digital right management" used to restrict access to personal information on social networking platforms is celebrated as a protection of privacy, while simultaneously when similar functions are used by cultural groups (i.e. indigenous communities) this is denounced as "access control" and reprehended as censorship.&lt;ref name="Christen" /&gt;



=== Future perspectives ===
Even though Western dominance seems to be prominent in research, some scholars, such as Simon Marginson, argue for "the need [for] a plural university world".&lt;ref name="Marginson"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/sun-sets-on-western-dominance-as-east-asian-confucian-model-takes-lead/415300.article|title=Sun sets on Western dominance as East Asian Confucian model takes lead|date=24 February 2011|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marginson argues that the East Asian Confucian model could take over the Western model.

This could be due to changes in funding for research both in the East and the West. Focussed on emphasizing educational achievement, East Asian cultures, mainly in China and South Korea, have encouraged the increase of funding for research expansion.&lt;ref name="Marginson" /&gt; In contrast, in the Western academic world, notably in the United Kingdom as well as in some state governments in the United States, funding cuts for university research have occurred, which some {{who|date=February 2017}} say may lead to the future decline of Western dominance in research.

== Professionalisation {{anchor|Professionalization}} ==
{{globalize|section|date=January 2014}}
{{see also|Academic ranks|Academics|Scientists}}
In several national and private academic systems, the [[professionalisation]] of research has resulted in formal [[job title]]s.

=== In Russia ===
In present-day Russia, the former [[Soviet Union]] and in some [[post-Soviet states]] the term ''researcher'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Научный сотрудник}}, ''nauchny sotrudnik'') is both a generic term for a person who carried out scientific research, as well as a job position within the frameworks of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]], Soviet universities, and in other research-oriented establishments. The term is also sometimes translated as ''[[research fellow]]'', ''[[research associate]]'', etc.

The following ranks are known:

*Junior Researcher (Junior Research Associate)
*Researcher (Research Associate)
*Senior Researcher (Senior Research Associate)
*Leading Researcher (Leading Research Associate)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aup.ru/docs/d2/210.htm Job qualifications for Leading Researcher] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chief Researcher (Chief Research Associate)

== Publishing ==
[[File:Nature cover, November 4, 1869.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 4 November 1869.]]
[[Academic publishing]] is a system that is necessary for academic scholars to [[peer review]] the work and make it available for a wider audience. The system varies widely by field and is also always changing, if often slowly. Most academic work is published in journal article or book form. There is also a large body of research that exists in either a thesis or dissertation form. These forms of research can be found in databases explicitly for theses and dissertations. In publishing, STM publishing is an abbreviation for academic publications in science, technology, and medicine.
[https://fine-research-paper.com research paper guides]
Most established [[List of academic disciplines|academic fields]] have their own scientific journals and other outlets for publication, though many [[academic journal]]s are somewhat interdisciplinary, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. The kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary greatly between fields, from the print to the electronic format. A study suggests that researchers should not give great consideration to findings that are not replicated frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/Armstrong/Replications.pdf| title = Replication Research in Marketing Revisited: A Note on a Disturbing Trend| author = Heiner Evanschitzky, Carsten Baumgarth, Raymond Hubbard and J.

Since about the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, has been very common. Presently, a major trend, particularly with respect to scholarly journals, is [[Open access (publishing)|open access]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/Armstrong/MakingProgressinForecasting.pdf | title = Monetary Incentives in Mail Surveys | author1 = J.

== Research funding ==
{{Main|Funding of science}}
Most funding for scientific research comes from three major sources: [[Corporation|corporate]] [[research and development]] departments; [[private foundation]]s, for example, the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]; and government research councils such as the [[National Institutes of Health]] in the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH Reporter|url=http://report.nih.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] in the UK. These are managed primarily through universities and in some cases through military contractors. Many senior researchers (such as group leaders) spend a significant amount of their time applying for grants for research funds. These grants are necessary not only for researchers to carry out their research but also as a source of merit.

The [[Social Psychology Network]] provides a comprehensive list of U.S. Government and private foundation funding sources.

A '''research fellow''' is an academic [[research]] position at a [[university]] or a similar research institution, usually for [[Academic rank|academic staff or faculty members]]. A research fellow may act either as an independent investigator or under the supervision of a principal investigator.

In contrast to a [[research assistant]], the position of research fellow normally requires a [[Doctorate|doctoral degree]], or equivalent work experience for instance in industry and research centers. Some research fellows undertake [[postdoctoral research]] or have some moderate teaching responsibilities. Research fellow positions vary in different countries and academic institutions. In some cases, they are permanent with the possibility of promotion, while in other instances they are temporary.

==United Kingdom==
In many universities this position is a career grade of a ''Research Career Pathway'', following on from a postdoctoral position such as Research Associate, and may be open-ended, subject to normal probation regulations. Within such a path, the next two higher career grades are usually senior research fellow and professorial fellow. Although similar to the position of a research fellow, these two positions are research only posts, with the rise of the career grade there will normally be a formal requirement of a moderate amount of teaching and/or supervision (often at postgraduate level). These positions are for researchers with a proven track record of generating research income to fund themselves and producing high-quality research output that is internationally recognised.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In some universities, research career grades roughly correspond to the grades of the ''Teaching and Scholarship Career Pathways'' in the following way: research fellow—[[lecturer]], professorial fellow—[[professor]], whereas senior research fellow is somewhere between a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] and a senior lecturer. However, at some top universities, a senior research fellowship may be a position of comparable academic standing to a full professorship at these universities, without any teaching requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asc.ox.ac.uk/categories-fellowship |title=All Souls College Oxford: Categories of Fellowship|publisher=asc.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the term research fellow often referred to a junior researcher, who worked on a specific project on a temporary basis. Research fellows tended to be paid either from central university funds or by an outside organisation such as a charity or company, or through an external grant-awarding body such as a research council or a royal society, for example in the [[Royal Society University Research Fellowship]].&lt;ref name=urf&gt;{{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/university-research/|website=royalsociety.org|title=University Research Fellowship|author=Anon|year=2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203164426/https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/university-research/|archivedate=2016-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in [[Oxbridge]] style colleges, research fellows appointed as [[fellow]]s of a college tended to, or still do, partially receive remuneration in form of college housing and subsistence. Colleges may award junior research fellowships as the equivalent of [[post-doctoral research]] posts, lasting for three or four years. In contrast, senior research fellows tended to be established academics, often a professor on sabbatical from another institution, conducting temporally research elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==India==
In India, the position of research fellowship is provided to scholars from various streams like science, arts, literature, agriculture to reward their excellence {{Citation needed|reason=In Indian context they are Research Assistant positions and not Assistant Research fellows. There is a clear difference between the two as mentioned in the beginning of article)|date=August 2018}}. Research fellowship is funded by government academic and research institutes, and private companies as well. Research fellows research under the supervision of experienced faculty, professor, head of department, Dean on two different posts known as junior research fellow(JRF) and senior research fellow(SRF). Research organisations like ICAR, [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|CSIR]], UGC, ICMR, SERB recruit research fellows through [[National Eligibility Test]]. After the completion of pre-defined tenure, JRF can be considered for senior research fellowship based on research fellow's performance &amp; interview conducted by committee by research institute, research fellow is working with.

==Russian Federation==
In the [[Russian Federation]], the position and title research fellow is unknown; however, there is a broadly similar position of ({{lang-ru|Научный сотрудник|italic=yes}}, literally "scientific worker"). This position normally requires a degree of [[Candidate of Sciences]] approximately corresponding to the PhD. More senior positions normally require, in addition to the aforementioned degree, a track record of publications or certified inventions, as well as practical contributions to major research and development projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==South Africa==
Research fellows in South Africa are considered as the best asset to research organisations and universities. There are highly ranked universities like University of the Witwatersrand, University of Stellenbosch Business School, rhode university which offers fellowship to South Africa's nationals in a certain field of research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usb.ac.za/Pages/Visiting-research-fellowships.aspx "Research Fellowship in South Africa"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipient of research fellowship==

In some countries, the English term research fellow is sometimes used to refer to the ''holder'' of a ''research fellowship'' that funds research.

In Germany, institutions such as the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]] offer research fellowship for postdoctoral research and refer to the holder as research fellows, while the award holder may formally hold a specific title at his or her home institution (e.g., ''Privatdozent'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avh.de/web/884.html ''Ten Years' Growth - What Fruit Has the Georg Forster Programme Borne?''], Retrieved on 18 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5819">'''Retrodiction''' (also known as '''postdiction'''—although this should not be confused with the use of the term in criticisms of [[postdiction|parapsychological research]]) is the act of making a "[[prediction]]" about the past.

== Activity ==
[[File:Retrodiction or Postdiction.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of retrodiction or postdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of '''''retrodiction''''' (or '''''postdiction''''') involves moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the present into the speculated past to establish the ultimate cause of a specific event (for instance, in the case of [[reverse engineering]], [[forensics]], etc.).

Given that retrodiction is a process in which "past observations, events and data are used as evidence to infer the process(es) that produced them" and that [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] "involve[s] going from visible effects such as symptoms, signs and the like to their prior causes"&lt;ref&gt;Einhorn &amp; Hogarth (1982),p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; the essential balance between [[prediction]] and retrodiction could be characterized as:
::'''retrodiction : diagnosis :: prediction : prognosis'''&lt;ref&gt;That is, that '''retrodiction''' is to '''diagnosis''' in precisely the same way as '''prediction''' is to '''prognosis'''.&lt;/ref&gt;
regardless of whether the [[prognosis]] is of the course of the disease in the absence of treatment, or of the application of a specific treatment regimen to a specific disorder in a particular patient:
:"We consider diagnostic inference to be based on causal thinking, although in doing diagnosis one has to mentally reverse the time order in which events were thought to have occurred (hence the term "backward inference"). On the other hand, predictions involve forward inference; i.e., one goes forward in time from present causes to future effects. However, it is important to recognize the dependence of forward inference/prediction on backward inference/diagnosis. In particular, it seems likely that success in predicting the future depends to a considerable degree on making sense of the past. Therefore, people are continually engaged in shifting between forward and backward inference in both making and evaluating forecasts. Indeed, this can be eloquently summarized by Kierkegaard's observation that, "Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards".&lt;ref&gt;Einhorn &amp; Hogarth (1982), p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific method==
In scientific method, the terms ''retrodiction'' or ''postdiction'' are used in several senses.

One use refers to the act of evaluating a scientific theory by predicting known rather than new events. For example, a theory in physics that claims to extend or replace the [[standard model]] but that fails to predict the existence of known particles has not met the test of ''postdiction''.

Michael Clive Price has written: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A retrodiction occurs when already gathered data is accounted for by a later theoretical advance in a more convincing fashion. The advantage of a retrodiction over a prediction is that the already gathered data is more likely to be free of experimenter bias. An example of a retrodiction is the [[General relativity#Precession of apsides|perihelion shift of Mercury]] which Newtonian mechanics plus gravity was unable, totally, to account for whilst Einstein's general relativity made short work of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#retrodictions The Everett Interpretation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another use refers to a process by which one attempts to test a theory whose predictions are too long-term to be tested by waiting for a future event to occur. Instead, one speculates about uncertain events in the more distant past, and applies the theory to consider how it would have predicted a known event in the less distant past. This is useful in, for example, the fields of [[archaeology]], [[climatology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[financial analysis]], [[forensic science]], and [[physical cosmology|cosmology]].

==Sensory perception==
In the field of neuroscience, the term ''postdiction'' was introduced by [[David Eagleman]] to describe a perceptual process in which the brain collects information after an event before it retrospectively decides what happened at the time of the event (Eagleman and Sejnowski, 2000&lt;ref name=Eagleman_Sejnowski_2000&gt;{{cite journal | author=Eagleman DM, Sejnowski, TJ | title=Motion integration and postdiction in visual awareness | journal=Science | volume=287 | issue=5460 | pages=2036–8 | year=2000 | pmid=10720334 | doi=10.1126/science.287.5460.2036}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Some perceptual illusions in which the brain mistakenly perceives the location of moving stimuli may involve postdiction. Such illusions include the [[flash lag illusion]]&lt;ref name=Eagleman_Sejnowski_2000 /&gt; and the [[cutaneous rabbit illusion]].&lt;ref name="Goldreich_Tong_2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldreich|first=D|author2=Tong, J |title=Prediction, Postdiction, and Perceptual Length Contraction: A Bayesian Low-Speed Prior Captures the Cutaneous Rabbit and Related Illusions|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=10 May 2013|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Science Under Siege: The Politicians' War on Nature and Truth''''' is a 1998 book by journalist Todd Wilkinson. Wilkinson describes the careers of a variety of publicly employed [[scientist]]s who, in the course of their work for government agencies, found habitat degradation, threatened species, or other decline in availability of a [[natural resource]]. When they expressed their views that certain activities must be scaled back or areas protected, they met with poor job performance ratings, hostility from their supervisors, transfers out of the region, and in many cases a severely damaged career.  Science is "under siege" in these cases because many of the researchers were told to modify their scientific reports so that commercial uses or environmentally destructive activities could continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naep.org/Content/NavigationMenu/BookReviews/Science_Under_Siege.htm Science Under Siege: The Politicians' War on Nature and Truth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

West Sussex, UK:&amp;nbsp;Wiley Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This emerging movement is an inevitable and necessary corrective response to the inherent problems of what has been called "[[positive psychology|positive psychology as usual]]".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Limitations of positive psychology ==
[[Positive psychology|Positive psychology "as usual"]] has been presented as &lt;blockquote&gt;the branch of&amp;nbsp;psychology&amp;nbsp;that uses scientific understanding and effective intervention to aid in the achievement of a satisfactory life,&amp;nbsp;rather than treating mental illness. The focus of positive psychology is on personal growth rather than on pathology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It has been argued that this binary, dichotomous view has fuelled both positive psychology's success and decline.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The single-minded focus on positivity has resulted in persistent backlash (e.g., Frawley, 2015 for a recent review).&lt;ref&gt;Frawley, A. (2015). Happiness research: A review of critiques. ''Sociology Compass 9''(1), 62-77.&lt;/ref&gt; The following criticisms have been leveled against positive psychology by researchers both outside of and within the positive psychology community. These include the "tyranny" of positivity and the lack of balance between positives and negatives;&lt;ref&gt;Held, B. S. (2004). The negative side of positive psychology. ''Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 44''(1), 9-46. doi:10.1177/0022167803259645&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kashdan, T., &amp; Biswas-Diener, R. (2014). ''The upside of your dark side: Why being your whole self—not just your "good" self—drives success and fulfillment''.

Positive psychology: Past, present, and (possible) future.

A., Hirsch, J. K., &amp; Lin, N. J. (2016). ''Positive psychology in racial and ethnic groups: Theory, research, and practice''.

Keith (Ed.),&amp;nbsp;''Encyclopedia of cross-cultural psychology'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;1021-1026). Oxford, UK:&amp;nbsp;Wiley Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, various positive psychologists have proposed the need for a balanced perspective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Lomas, T., &amp; Ivtzan, I. (2015). Second wave positive psychology: Exploring the positive–negative dialectics of wellbeing. ''Journal of Happiness Studies, 17''(4), 1753–1768. doi:10.1007/s10902-015-9668-y&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, A. M., &amp; Joseph, S. (2010). The absence of positive psychological (eudemonic) well-being as a risk factor for depression: A ten year cohort study. ''Journal of Affective Disorders'', ''122''(3), 213-217.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Existential positive psychology ==
In order to correct the limitations of positive psychology, [[Paul T. P. Wong|Paul Wong]] has argued for the need to integrate [[positive psychology]] with [[Existential therapy|existential psychology]], resulting in "existential positive psychology" (EPP).&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2009). Existential positive psychology. In S. Lopez (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of positive psychology'' (Vol. 1, pp. 361-368). Oxford, UK: Wiley Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2010).&amp;nbsp;What is existential positive psychology?&amp;nbsp;''International Journal of Existential Psychology and Psychotherapy, 3''(1), 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach differs significantly from positive psychology "as usual" both in terms of epistemology and content.

EPP favors a pluralistic and holistic approach to research. It is open to insights and wisdoms from both the East and the West and research findings from all sources regardless of the paradigm of truth claims. In terms of content, it explores both people's [[Existential anxiety|existential anxieties]]&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Yalom, I. D. (2008). ''Staring at the sun: Overcoming the terror of death.'' San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; and their ultimate concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, R. A. (1999). ''The psychology of ultimate concerns: Motivation and spirituality in personality''. New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, EPP contributes to a broader and more comprehensive understanding of human experiences.

Both [[Existentialism|existential philosophers]] and psychologists see life as a series of paradoxes, predicaments, and problems. From this existential perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (in press). Existential theoretical framework.&amp;nbsp;In A. Wenzel (Ed.),&amp;nbsp;''The SAGE encyclopedia of abnormal and clinical psychology''. New York, NY: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; life is also full of striving and sense-making, tragedies and triumphs. The dynamic interplay between good and evil, negatives and positives is one of the hallmarks of EPP. Positives cannot exist apart from negatives, and authentic happiness grows from pain and suffering. This paradoxical view reflects [[Albert Camus]]' insight that "there is no joy of life without despair" (p.&amp;nbsp;56)&lt;ref&gt;Camus, A. (1968). ''Lyrical and critical essays'' (E. C. Kennedy, Trans.). New York: Knopf.
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rollo May]]'s observation that "the ultimate paradox is that negation becomes affirmation" (p.&amp;nbsp;164).&lt;ref&gt;May, R. (1981). ''Freedom and destiny''. New York, NY: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be argued that positive psychology is intrinsically existential because it is concerned with such fundamental questions about human existence as: What is the good life? What makes life worth living? How can one find happiness? Positive psychology research on these existential issues without taking into account the existential literature inevitably leads to superficiality or mischaracterization.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, N. J. L., &amp; Wong, P. T. P. (2015). Questionable measures are pretty meaningless: Comment on Heintzelman and King (2014). ''American Psychologist, 70''(6), 571-573. doi:10.1037/a0039308&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive positive psychology cannot be developed without taking into account the reality of [[death]], the only certainty for all living organisms. However, human beings alone are burdened with the cognitive capacity to be aware of their own mortality and to fear what may follow after one's own demise.&lt;ref&gt;Yalom, I. D. (1980). ''Existential therapy.'' New York, NY: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; However, death awareness may be essential to meaningful living; "though the physicality of death destroys us, the idea of death saves us" (p.&amp;nbsp;7).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Thus, awareness of our finality is indeed an important motivational factor for us to do something meaningful and significant with our lives.

Therefore, EPP advocates that the proper context of studying well-being and the meaningful life is the reality of suffering and death. Researchers who share this view include Bretherton and Ørner,&lt;ref&gt;Bretherton, R. and Ørner, R. J. (2004) Positive psychology and psychotherapy: An existential approach. P. A. Linley &amp; S. Joseph (Eds.), ''Positive psychology in practice'' (pp. 420-430). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Schneider,&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, K. J. (2010, November 29). Toward a humanistic positive psychology: Why can't we just get along? ''Psychology Today.'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/awakening-awe/201011/toward-humanistic-positive-psychology-why-cant-we-just-get-along&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Taheny.&lt;ref&gt;Taheny, M. (2015, May 4). Living existential positive psychology. ''New Existentialists:'' ''Saybrook University.'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.saybrook.edu/newexistentialists/posts/05-04-15/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, positive psychologists have recognized that positive psychology is rooted in [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic-existential psychology]], but in practice it continues to distance itself from its heritage because of the alleged lack of scientific research in humanistic psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M. E. P., &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, M. (2000). Positive psychology: An introduction. ''American Psychologist, 55''(1), 5-14. doi:10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Waterman, A. S. (2013). The humanistic-positive psychology divide: Contrasts in philosophical foundations. ''American Psychologist, 68,'' 124-133.&lt;/ref&gt; A mature positive psychology needs to return to its existential-humanistic roots, because it can both broaden and deepen positive psychology.

== Second wave positive psychology ==
Paul Wong extends EPP to second wave positive psychology (PP 2.0) by formally incorporating the dialectical principles of Chinese psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2009).&amp;nbsp;Chinese positive psychology. In S. J. Lopez (Ed.),&amp;nbsp;''Encyclopedia of positive psychology''&amp;nbsp;(Vol. 1, pp. 148-156). Oxford, UK:&amp;nbsp;Wiley Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; the bio-behavioral dual-system model of adaptation,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2012). Toward a dual-systems model of what makes life worth living. In P. T. P. Wong (Ed.), ''The human quest for meaning: Theories, research, and applications'' (2nd ed., pp. 3-22). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; and cross-cultural positive psychology.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Thus, PP 2.0 provides a big tent that allows for multiple [[Indigenous psychology|indigenous]] positive psychologies&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and a much broader list of variables that contribute to [[well-being]] and [[flourishing]].

PP 2.0 is necessary, because neither positive psychology nor humanistic-existential psychology can adequately understand such complex human phenomena as [[Meaning of life|meaning]], [[virtue]], and [[happiness]]. Such deep knowledge can only be achieved by an integrative and collaborative endeavor.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This calls for a humble science.&lt;ref&gt;Templeton, J. (1998). ''The humble approach: Scientists discover God.'' Radnor, PA: Templeton Foundation Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, PP 2.0 denies that the positivist paradigm is the only way to examine truth claims, especially when we research the profound questions of what makes life worth living.

=== Assumptions ===
# Human nature has the potentials for both good and evil; thus, self-control of selfish and destructive instincts is a necessary part of cultivating the "better angels of our nature."
# Dialectical principles can best integrate positive and negative factors in different contexts.
# Meaning offers both the best protection against adversities and existential concerns as well as the best pathway to achieve the good life of virtue, happiness, and significance.
# Just as physical health can only be maintained in recognition of the fact that we are living in an environment infected with bacteria and viruses, so the promotion of positive mental health and optimal human functioning must recognize the inevitable dark side of the human existence.
# Individual well-being is connected with the common good of humanity.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2016, September). Mapping the contours of positive psychology 2.0. ''Positive Living Newsletter''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mission ===
# To better the lives of all people and nurture their potentials, regardless of their circumstances and cultural backgrounds.
# To repair the worst and bring out the best, with a focus on the human potential for growth.
# To integrate negatives and positives to optimize well-being.
# To study how global beliefs and values affect people's eudemonic well-being and human functioning.
# To minimize or transform the downside of the bright side, and optimize or transform the upside of the dark side.
# To cultivate the capacity for meaning seeking and meaning making.
# To study how death awareness can contribute to personal transformation.
# To develop objective measures of both short-term and long-term well-being for individuals and society.
# To enhance well-being throughout the lifespan including the end-of-life stage.
# To identify and research a host of variables related to both [[yin and yang]].
# To contain and transform evil to serve the common good.
# To cultivate inner goodness and develop valid measures of goodness as an outcome.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Importance of dialectical thinking ===
[[Taoism|Taoist]] dialectical thinking permeates every aspect of Chinese psychology. Peng and Nisbett showed that Chinese thinking is dialectical rather than binary.&lt;ref&gt;Peng, K., &amp; Nisbett, R. E. (1999). Culture, dialectics, and reasoning about contradiction.&amp;nbsp;''American Psychologist'',&amp;nbsp;''54''(9), 741-754.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Sundararajan documents the dialectical co-existence of positive and negative emotions in Chinese people.&lt;ref&gt;Sundararajan, L.&amp;nbsp;(2014).&amp;nbsp;The function of negative emotions in the Confucian tradition.&amp;nbsp;In W. G. Parrott (Ed.),&amp;nbsp;''The positive side of negative emotions'' (pp.179-197). New York, NY:&amp;nbsp;Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Wong's research has also demonstrated that the wisdom of yin and yang operates in many situations. He has argued that Chinese people can hold external and internal loci of control simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P., &amp; Sproule, C. F. (1984). Attributional analysis of locus of control and the Trent Attribution Profile (TAP). In H. M. Lefcourt (Ed.), ''Research with the locus of control construct, Vol. 3: Limitations and extensions'' (pp. 309-360). New York, NY: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, their locus of control beliefs can only be a measured by a two-dimensional space with external and internal loci of control as two independent scales. However, dialectic thinking is not unique to Chinese culture. For example, pessimism and optimism can co-exist, resulting in tragic optimism.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2009). Viktor Frankl: Prophet of hope for the 21st century. In A. Batthyany &amp; J. Levinson (Eds.), ''Existential psychotherapy of meaning: Handbook of logotherapy and existential analysis''. Phoenix, AZ: Zeig, Tucker &amp; Theisen.&lt;/ref&gt; Death fear and death acceptance can also co-exist, resulting in the multidimensional Death Attitude Profile.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P., Reker, G. T., &amp; Gesser, G. (1994). Death Attitude Profile – Revised: A multidimensional measure of attitudes toward death. In R. A. Neimeyer (Ed''.''), ''Death anxiety handbook: Research, instrumentation, and application'' (pp. 121-148). Washington, DC: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; Resources and deficits co-exist, as conceptualized in the Resource-Congruence Model.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (1993). Effective management of life stress: The resource-congruence model. ''Stress Medicine, 9'', 51-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, family can be resources for effective coping, but intra-family conflict can also be a deficit or stressor.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P., &amp; Ujimoto, K. V. (1998). The elderly Asian Americans: Their stress, coping, and well-being. In L. C. Lee &amp; N. W. S. Zane (Eds''.''), ''Handbook of Asian American psychology'' (pp. 165-209). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong's Dual-Systems Model of approach and avoidance spells out the mechanisms whereby the good life can be achieved in the midst of adversities, not by accentuating the positive and avoiding the negative, but by embracing the dynamic and dialectic interaction between positive and negative experiences.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This general bio-behavioral model is also based on the dialectical principle. Dialectical thinking represents a simple but powerful conceptual framework, capable of integrating a great deal of the literature relevant to well-being. Yin represents not only the dark side of life, but also the conservative and passive modes of adaptation, such as acceptance, letting go, avoidance, withdrawal, disengagement, doing nothing, and self-transcendence. Yang represents not only the bright side of life, but also the energetic and active modes of adaptation, such as goal setting and goal striving, problem solving and controlling, and expanding and maintaining territories.

The dynamic balance between positive and negative forces is mediated through dialectical principles. For instance, Lomas and Ivtzan have identified three ways of restoring and maintaining the balance: (a) the principle of appraisal, (b) the principle of co-valence, and (c) the principle of complementarity.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Similarly, Wong identifies four principles of transforming the dark side: (a) becoming wiser and better through the synthesis of opposites, (b) becoming more balanced and flexible through the co-existence of opposites which complement or moderate each other, (c) becoming more aware and appreciative of the after-effects or contrast effect due to the opponent-process, and (d) becoming stronger and more spiritual through self-transcendence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Thus, the wisdom of achieving the golden mean or the middle way is through the dialectical interactions between yin and yang. These dialectical principles constitute the foundation of PP 2.0 and ensure that the dark side of life serves the adaptive functions of survival and flourishing.

=== Incorporating the dark side ===
The dark side refers to more than just challenging experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that trigger discomfort.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It also encompasses existential anxieties and the evitable sufferings in life.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Apart from existential concerns, the dark side also refers to our [[Achilles' heel]]. From [[Aristotle]] to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], the literature has always recognized the existence of [[tragic heroes]]—powerful and successful individuals who are eventually ruined by their own character flaws. As Aristotle said, "A man cannot become a hero until he can see the root of his own downfall." All one's talents, character strengths, and efforts will eventually come to null, with disastrous consequences to oneself and others, when one pays no attention to one's own Achilles heel.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== The meaning hypothesis ===
Paul Wong proposes that the meaning hypothesis&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2014).&amp;nbsp;From attunement to a meaning-centred good life: Book review of Daniel&amp;nbsp;Haybron's Happiness: A very short introduction.&amp;nbsp;''International Journal of Wellbeing, 4''(2), 100-105. doi:10.5502/ijw.v4i2.5&lt;/ref&gt; is an overarching conceptual framework for PP 2.0 because it is based on the universal human capacity for meaning making and meaning seeking and the vital role meaning plays in human experience and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Batthyany, A., &amp; Russo-Netzer, P. (Eds.). (2014). ''Meaning in positive and existential psychology''. New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, J. A., &amp; Routledge, C. (Eds.). (2013). ''The experience of meaning in life: Classical perspectives, emerging themes, and controversies.'' Dordrecht, NL: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (Ed.). (2012).&amp;nbsp;''The human quest for meaning: Theories, research, and applications''&amp;nbsp;(2nd ed.). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; It hypothesizes that meaning is the best possible end value for the good life and offers the best protection against existential anxieties and adversities.

[[File:The_Meaning_Mindset_vs._the_Success_Mindset_(Wong,_2012).png|thumb|Figure 1. This is figure contrasts the meaning mindset with the success mindset, as proposed by psychologist Paul T. P. Wong, PhD in his 2012 paper, "What is the meaning mindset?" in the ''International Journal of Existential Psychology and Psychotherapy'', Volume 4, Issue 1.|alt=The Meaning Mindset vs. the Success Mindset (Wong, 2012)|250x250px]]

The meaning hypothesis places more emphasis on a fundamental change in global beliefs and values than behavioral change. The "meaning mindset" affirms that life has unconditional meaning and it can be found in any situation.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2012c). The meaning mindset: Measurement and implications. ''International Journal of Existential Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy, 4''(1), 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 1 presents a schematic presentation of the meaning mindset.

If one chooses the meaning mindset, one can still find meaning and fulfillment even when failing to complete one's life mission. Thus, there is no failure when one pursues a virtuous and noble mission as one's life goal. A perspective shift to the meaning mindset helps eliminate one main source of human misery related to the striving to achieve material success or worldly fame. Cultivating a meaning mindset may yield better payoff than positive psychology exercises of enhancing happiness and character strengths because the perspective shift reorients one's focus away from egotistic pursuits to [[self-transcendence]] and [[altruism]], which benefit both the individual and society.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2016). Self-transcendence: A paradoxical way to become your best.&amp;nbsp;''International Journal of Existential Psychology and Psychotherapy,&amp;nbsp;6''(1). Retrieved from&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.drpaulwong.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Self-Transcendence_A-Paradoxical-Way-to-Become-Your-Best-2016-Aug-15.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2016d, June).&amp;nbsp;''Self-transcendence as the path to virtue, happiness and meaning''&amp;nbsp;Paper presented at the research working group meeting for&amp;nbsp;Virtue, Happiness, and the Meaning of Life Project, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.&amp;nbsp;(Funded by the John Templeton Foundation) (Abstract retrieved from&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://virtue.uchicago.edu/page/paul-t-p-wong-june-2016-working-group-meeting-topic&lt;/nowiki&gt;)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conclusion ===
Science is always self-corrective and progressive. PP 2.0 avoids many of the problems inherent in positive psychology "as usual"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and opens up new avenues of research and applications. The future of psychology can benefit from integrating three distinct movements—humanistic-existential psychology, positive psychology, and indigenous psychology.

The 21st century belongs to PP 2.0 because of its ability to integrate various sub-disciplines of [[Psychology|mainstream psychology]] and its humble science approach. PP 2.0 is willing to put aside dogmatic epistemological positions in the service of the greater good as some have recommended.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Meaning management of the dialectical principles is sensitive to individual and cultural contexts, but is, at the same time, also cognizant of the common good of humility and self-transcendence. This big picture perspective of PP 2.0 avoids many of the excesses associated with the egotistic pursuits of happiness and success in positive psychology as usual.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

== Leaders ==
PP 2.0 is spearheaded by Paul Wong from the International Network on Personal Meaning and [[Saybrook University]], and Itai Ivtzan and Tim Lomas from the [[University of East London]] (UEL). Wong is teaching a course on PP 2.0 at [[Saybrook University|Saybrook]]. Ivtzan is the program director along with Tim who is a lecturer &amp; program leader of the UEL Master of Applied Positive Psychology, which has a PP 2.0 orientation.

'''Socioscientific Issues (SSI)''' are controversial social issues which relate to science.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D.L. &amp; Keefer, M. (2003). The role of moral reasoning and the status of socioscientific issues in science education: Philosophical, psychological and pedagogical considerations. In D.L. Zeidler (Ed.), The role of moral reasoning on socioscientific issues and discourse in science education. The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Press. (pp. 7-38)&lt;/ref&gt; They are ill-structured, open-ended problems which have multiple solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T.D. (2004). Informal reasoning regarding socioscientific issues: A critical review of research. Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 41, 513-536&lt;/ref&gt;

SSI are utilized in [[science education]] in order to promote [[scientific literacy]], which emphasizes the ability to apply scientific and moral reasoning to real-world situations.  Some examples of SSI include issues such as [[genetic engineering]], [[climate change]], [[animal testing]] for medical purposes, oil drilling in national parks, and "fat taxes" on "unhealthy" foods, among many others.  Research studies have shown SSI to be effective at increasing students' understanding of science in various contexts, [[Argumentation theory|argumentation skills]], [[empathy]], and [[Moral philosophy|moral reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Zeidler, D. L. (2005). The significance of content knowledge for informal reasoning regarding socioscientific issues: Applying genetics knowledge to genetic engineering issues. Science Education, 89(1), 71-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D. L., &amp; Sadler, T. D. (2008). The role of moral reasoning in argumentation: Conscience, character and care. In S. Erduran &amp; M. Pilar Jimenez-Aleixandre (Eds.), Argumentation in science education: Perspectives from classroom-based research (pp. 201-216). The Netherlands: Springer Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals of SSI ==
Supporters of SSI argue that it can:
* 1) Cultivate a scientifically literate citizens who are able to apply evidence-based scientific content knowledge to real-world socioscientific scenarios;
* 2) Foster a collective [[social conscience]] whereby students consistently reflect upon the formation and implications of their own reasoning;
* 3) Encourage [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]] skills that are essential for thinking and reasoning processes and mirror the types of discourse utilized in real-world scientific deliberations;
* 4) Promote [[critical thinking]] skills, such as analysis, inference, explanation,
evaluation, interpretation, and self-regulation&lt;ref&gt;Facione, P. A. (2007). Critical thinking: What it is and why it counts (2007 update). Millbrae, CA: Insight Assessment/California Academic Press LLC. Retrieved April 28, 2009, from www.insightassessment.com/pdf_files/what&amp;why2006. pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Science educators often refer to all of these aspects together as,"functional scientific literacy."&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D. L., Sadler, T. D., Simmons, M. L., &amp; Howes, E. V. (2005). Beyond STS: A research-based framework for socioscientific issues education. Science Education, 89(3), 357-377.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical Context of SSI ==

=== Scientific Literacy - Vision I and II ===
Scientific literacy has been defined by two competing visions. A Vision I approach to scientific literacy is characterized by content-driven, decontextualized science knowledge.  A Vision II approach to scientific literacy is a context-driven, student-centered approach which seeks to prepare students for informed [[civic engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, D.A. (2007). Scientific literacy / science literacy. In S.K. Abell &amp; N.G. Lederman (Eds.), Handbook of research on science education (pp. 729-780). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  The SSI framework follows a Vision II approach as it is believed to provide an opportunity for contextualized learning of science content as well as an opportunity for moral development.

=== SSI Distinguished from Science, Technology, and Society (STS) ===
SSI is conceptually related to [[Science, technology and society|Science, Technology, and Society]] (STS) education.  However, while both approaches connect science to societal issues, SSI is distinguished from STS because of its emphasis on the development of character and virtue as well as content knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeidler|first=D.|author2=Sadler, T.D. |author3=Simmons, M.L. |author4=Howes, E.V. |title=Beyond STS: A Research-Based|journal=Science Education|year=2005|volume=89|issue=3|pages=357–377|doi=10.1002/sce.20048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SSI and Moral Reasoning ==
Research suggests that SSI creates [[cognitive dissonance]] by compelling students to consider claims that may be at odds with their own beliefs and values.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D.L. &amp; Nichols, B.H. (2009). Socioscientific Issues: Theory and Practice. Journal of Elementary Science Education, 21, 2, 49-58&lt;/ref&gt; Dissonance of this nature is believed by some to advance [[moral reasoning]] by ‘empowering students to consider how science based issues and the decisions made concerning them reflect, in part, the moral principles and qualities of [[virtue]] that encompass their own lives, as well as the physical and social world around them.'&lt;ref&gt;
Zeidler, D. L., Sadler, T. D., Simmons, M. L., &amp; Howes, E. V. (2005). Beyond STS: A research-based framework for socioscientific issues education. Science Education, 89(3), 357-377, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Supporting SSI ==
SSI education has been [[empirically]] investigated and linked to particular outcomes including:
• Promoting developmental changes in reflective judgment;&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D., Sadler, T., Applebaum, S., &amp; Callahan, B. (2009). Advancing reflective
judgment through socioscientific issues. Journal of Research in Science Teaching,

Zeidler (Ed.), The role of moral reasoning on socioscientific issues and discourse in science education. The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Press. (pp. 7-38)&lt;/ref&gt;

• Promote understanding of eco-justice and [[environmental awareness]];&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, M.P. &amp; Zeidler, D.L. (2010). Moral-ethical character and science education:

M., van Eijck &amp; Adams, J. (Eds), Cultural studies and environmentalism: The
confluence of ecojustice, place-based (science) education, and indigenous
knowledge systems (pp 105-128). New York: Springer&lt;/ref&gt; and
• Engage students’ interest in the [[Inquiry-based science|inquiry of science]].

More recently, SSI research has been focused on cross-cultural comparisons and research has reflected international partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, H.; Chang, H., Choi, K., Kim, S., Zeidler, D.L. (2011). "Developing Character and Values for Global Citizens: Analysis of pre-service science". International Journal of Science Education: 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hypothesized by some that more advanced stages of epistemological reasoning allows individuals to apply a kind of socioscientific reasoning (SSR)&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T.D., Barab, S.A. and Scott, B. 2006. What do students gain by engaging in socio‐scientific inquiry?. Research in Science Education, 37: 371–391.&lt;/ref&gt; akin to scientific habits of mind. SSR is a theoretical construct that entails the ability to tap key traits while negotiating SSI. These include [[skepticism]], [[complexity]], [[multiple perspective]] and [[inquiry]].

== SSI in the Classroom ==

Teachers utilize SSI to foster understanding of science content and consequences involved in everyday scientific issues.  For example, in a study of [[ecology]], an elementary class might consider whether pesticides confer more benefit or harm to our ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, C., &amp; Davis, E. A. (2008a). Exploring preservice elementary teachers’ critique and adaptation of science curriculum materials in respect to socioscientific issues. Science and Education, 17(8–9),829–854.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of analysis would require students to research the interractions between organisms in food webs and food chains, as well as the human impacts of pesticides. Students could make [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based decisions]] and discuss them through various means including whole-class discussions, [[debates]], [[discussion boards|online discussion boards]], etc... Similarly, older grades might consider issues such as whether [[genetic engineering]] should be used to treat genetic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Zeidler, D. L. (2004). Negotiating gene therapy controversies. The
American Biology Teacher, 66, 428–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of analysis would require extensive study of genetics and modern genetic engineering techniques, as well as the ethical issues involved in [[personal freedom]]s, religious prohibitions on intervention, and so on.  Advocates suggest that, through evidence-based [[discourse]], students learn to formulate their own informed decisions and understand those whose views differ from themselves.  An essential aspect of the implementation of SSI is that the teacher is not promoting any particular belief; rather, the teacher's role is to promote evidence-based critical thinking and argumentation.

'''Statistical alchemy''' was a term originated by [[John Maynard Keynes]] to describe [[econometrics]] in 1939. The phrase has subsequently been used by [[Alvan Feinstein]] to describe [[meta-analysis]]. It is generally regarded as a deprecatory term which undermines attempts to present such activities as meeting the rigorous standards of science.

==Econometrics==
Keynes (1939) wrote a review of [[Jan Tinbergen]]'s ''Statistical Testing of Business-Cycle Theories''. Although he praised Tinbergen for his objectivity, he however depicted his methodology as "black magic" which he regarded as essentially untrustworthy. He was unpersuaded that "this brand of ''statistical alchemy'' is ripe to become a branch of science" (emphasis in the original).&lt;ref name="Hendry"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hendry|first1=David|title=Econometrics-Alchemy or Science?|journal=Economica|date=1980|volume=47|issue=188|pages=387–406|doi=10.2307/2553385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often this metaphor is seen as a way of suggesting that econometricians were following a foolhardy pursuit comparable to the [[alchemy|alchemical quest]] of turning base metal into gold. However G. M. P. Swann points out that Keynes was well aware that such eminent early scientists as [[Isaac Newton]]. He rather proposes a more nuanced interpretation of the metaphor as referring to the [[Alkahest]], a universal solvent, which, it was claimed could turn stone into water. He claimed that by restricting econometrics to theory, mathematics and statistics, econometricians had discarded other important applied techniques. Although [[Ragnar Frisch]] had made warnings about this, these had been subsequently ignored by other econometricians who had ended up claiming that econometrics constituted a universal solvent.&lt;ref name="Swann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swann|first1=G. M. P.|title=Putting Econometrics in Its Place: A New Direction in Applied Economics|date=2006|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|location=Cheltenham|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

==Meta-analysis==
Feinstein (1995) published "Meta-analysis: statistical alchemy for the 21st century" where he claimed that in meta-analysis scientific requirements had been removed or destroyed, eliminating the scientific requirements of reproducibility and precision. This was equivalent to a ''free lunch'', comparable to the alchemical transmutation of base metals to gold. [[Detournement|Detourning]] the adage concerning the combination of [[apples and oranges]], Feinstein suggested that meta-analytic mixtures were so heterogeneous that they might be better described as "combining rotten fruits". He argues that meta-analysis violates the [[Bradford Hill criteria]] of consistency as inconsistencies are ignored or buried through the process of  agglomerating the data.

'''''The Republican War on Science''''' is a 2005 book by [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris C. Mooney]], an American [[journalist]] who focuses on the politics of [[science policy]]. In the book, Mooney discusses the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] leadership's stance on science, and in particular that of the [[George W. Bush administration]], with regard to issues such as [[global warming]], the [[creation–evolution controversy]], [[bioethics]], [[alternative medicine]], [[pollution]], [[separation of church and state]], and the government funding of education, research, and [[environmental protection]].  The book argues that the administration regularly distorted and/or suppressed scientific research to further its own political aims.

The book was reviewed in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[Nature Medicine]]'' as well as the popular press. It was featured on the cover of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' and selected as an "Editors' Choice" by ''[[The New York Times]]'' which described it as, "A frankly polemical survey of scientific findings and procedures in collision with political operations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Editors' Choice |department= Browsing Books |date= 25 December 2005 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/books/review/1225bb-hardcover.html |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= 2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker [[Morgan Spurlock]] (of ''[[Super Size Me]]'' fame) optioned the rights for the book to create a documentary film,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/16/AR2005121601711.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |title='Science' Scooped Up |date=December 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2008 announced that he had released the option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2008/04/see_morgan_thats_why_you_shoul.php |title=See Morgan?

== Reviews ==
===In scientific journals===
A review in ''Science'' by [[Naomi Oreskes]] states the author recounts the 20-year campaign by "influential Republicans—initially in Congress and now also in the White House—in concert with determined allies in private industry and fundamentalist Christian organizations" to systematically deny, disparage and misrepresent scientific information related to public policy. She gave the following list of topics, "acid rain, global warming, the efficacy of condoms in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, the health impacts of excess dietary sugar and fat, the alleged link between abortion and breast cancer, the status of endangered species, the efficacy of abstinence-only sex education programs, the therapeutic potential of adult stem cells, and more." Oreskes goes on to detail the tactics used in the attempt to mislead both the public and politicians, "misrepresenting real debates, exaggerating uncertainty, interfering with the activities of expert agencies, trumpeting the views of outlier scientists whose interpretations are rarely to be found in the refereed literature, and attacking the integrity of genuine experts." She states that Mooney points out that multiple misinformation campaigns have involved the same individuals and groups. Oreskes concludes, "Mooney's book makes it clear that when sensible people stand on the sidelines, a great deal of nonsense can be spread."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Oreskes |first= Naomi |authorlink= Naomi Oreskes |date= 7 October 2005 |title= Anti-realism in government |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume= 310 |issue= 5745 |doi=  10.1126/science.1115765 |page= 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Stebbins]] wrote in ''Nature Medicine'' that "This book should serve as a harsh wake-up call to the scientific community and the American public." He stated that Mooney "painstakingly documents the roots of the efforts to undercut the influence of science on national policy and the relentless politicization of US science policy by conservatives working on behalf of the Republican Party." He notes that the author clearly documents the "Bush administrations' attacks on the integrity of science information" listing examples that include some of those mentioned by Oreskes and "undercutting the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act, and stacking agencies and advisory committees with unqualified ideologues." Stebbins credits the book with providing context by detailing the tactics employed by "conservative Republicans" and establishing the roots of these undercutting techniques with examples from the last 40 years. He goes on to state, "Mooney's documentation of the willful manipulation of science on the part of conservatives to suit an agenda is well supported and nauseating." Stebbins addresses two criticisms of the book, the first, that it doesn't explain the science involved, which he explains is not the purpose of the book, and the second, that it doesn't detail the misuse of science by democrats and liberals, which he dismisses as untrue. He finds issue with the last chapter, which proposes solutions, stating, "His suggestions are sound and well thought out, but seem more of an afterthought than a real goal of the book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Stebbins |first= Michael |authorlink= Michael Stebbins |date= April 2006 |title= The wake-up call |journal= [[Nature Medicine]] |volume= 12 |issue= 4 |page= 381 |doi=10.1038/nm0406-381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Sarewitz panned the book in a review in ''[[Issues in Science and Technology]]'' describing it as a, "tiresome polemic masquerading as a defense of scientific purity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Daniel |last= Sarewitz |title= Scientizing politics |journal= [[Issues in Science and Technology]] |volume= 22 |issue= 2 |year= 2006 |pages= 91–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the popular press===
In a positive review in ''[[Scientific American]]'' Boyce Rensenberger described the book as, "a well-researched, closely argued and amply referenced indictment of the right wing's assault on science and scientists."&lt;ref name= "SciAm"&gt;{{cite news |last= Rensenberger |first= Boyce |date= 24 September 2005 |title= Science abuse |url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-abuse/ |magazine= [[Scientific American]] |accessdate= 2014-04-24 |type= book review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lisa Margonelli of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' wrote that Mooney, "juggled extensive research and sharp arguments [...] with precision and a showman’s wink that made his unpromising subject fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/books/review/Margonelli-t.html |title= Wild is the wind |last= Margonelli |first= Lisa |date= 1 July 2007 |newspaper= [[The New York Times Book Review]] |accessdate= 2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keay Davidson wrote in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that "Mooney's political heart is in the right place" but says "Mooney is like a judge who interprets a law one way to convict his enemies and another way to acquit his friends."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/15/AR2005091501881.html "Research and the Right", The republican war on science reviewed] by Keay Davidson, [[The Washington Post]] September 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''The New York Times'', [[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] said of the book that the [[prose]] was "often clunky and clichéd", but explains that Mooney "addresses a vitally important topic and gets it basically right." Horgan defends the book against another reviewer's criticism, saying "the journalist Keay Davidson faults Mooney for not acknowledging how hard it can be to distinguish good science from bad... But in many of the cases that [Mooney] examines, demarcation is easy, because one side has an a priori commitment to something other than the truth — God or money, to put it bluntly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/books/review/18horgan.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Political Science | first=John | last=Horgan |authorlink= John Horgan (American journalist) | date=18 December 2005 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuart Derbyshire, a [[senior lecturer]] at the [[University of Birmingham]] School of Psychology, praises Mooney and notes that he explained how [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] had manipulated the [[uncertainty]] in science "to ensure that Congress rarely hears any consensus opinion that may damage a Bush policy." Derbyshire agrees with Mooney's claim that there is Republican "flagrant twisting" of research findings and that it "violates the integrity of science."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/0000000CAE94.htm |title=Bush isn't the only one who's anti-science |date=28 November 2005 |work=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TTOs engage in a variety of commercial activities that are meant to facilitate the process of bringing research developments to market, often acting as a channel between academia and industry.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothaermel|first=F.

While TTOs are commonplace, many studies have questioned their financial benefit to the university.

== History ==
The history of technology transfer is intimately linked with the history of the [[science policy of the United States]].  The foundation for modern American science policy laid way out in [[Vannevar Bush]]'s letter in response to President Roosevelt's query about whether the US should maintain the high level of research funding it had been pouring into the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], which had coordinated large [[private-public partnership]] research projects as part of the war effort, including the [[Manhattan Project]].  Bush's answer was ''Science - the Endless Frontier''.&lt;ref name="Ehlers_science"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehlers|first=Vernon|title=The Future of U.S. Science Policy|journal=Science|date=16 January 1998|volume=279|pages=302a–302|doi=10.1126/science.279.5349.302a|issue=5349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frontier&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=Vannevar|title=Science the Endless Frontier|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm|publisher=National Science Foundation|date=July 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that letter, Bush advocated that the US should continue to fund [[basic research]] at high levels, arguing that while the US no longer had a geographic frontier, extending the boundaries of science would allow the creation of new technologies, which in turn would spur new industries, create jobs, generate wealth, and maintain US power.&lt;ref name=Frontier/&gt;  As the US worked out its approach to funding science in the 1950s, Congress decided that the federal government should maintain ownership of patents on inventions funded by the federal government.&lt;ref name="Ehlers_science"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Federal research funding drove the growth of the research university.  Many universities in the early 20th century did not engage in patenting and licensing, since the government owned most inventions, and out of fear of interfering with their missions of supporting the growth of knowledge and objective inquiry.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sampat|first=Bhaven N.|date=2006-07-01|title=Patenting and US academic research in the 20th century: The world before and after Bayh-Dole|url=|journal=Research Policy|series=Property and the pursuit of knowledge: IPR issues affecting scientific research|volume=35|issue=6|pages=772–789|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2006.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feldman|first=Maryann|last2=Desrochers|first2=Pierre|date=2003-03-01|title=Research Universities and Local Economic Development: Lessons from the History of the Johns Hopkins University|journal=Industry and Innovation|volume=10|issue=1|pages=5–24|doi=10.1080/1366271032000068078|issn=1366-2716}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the postwar period, universities relied mostly on external patent management organizations such as the [[Research Corporation]], while few set up their own research foundations that were independent from but affiliated to the university.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   Some universities, such as [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of Wisconsin]], had active licensing programs of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mowery|first=David C|last2=Nelson|first2=Richard R|last3=Sampat|first3=Bhaven N|last4=Ziedonis|first4=Arvids A|date=2001-01-01|title=The growth of patenting and licensing by U.S. universities: an assessment of the effects of the Bayh–Dole act of 1980|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=30|issue=1|pages=99–119|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00100-6|citeseerx=10.1.1.334.3228}}&lt;/ref&gt;   There was a shift in universities' approaches to technology transfer between 1970-1980.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During this period, universities began taking commercialization efforts into their own hands and setting up TTOs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The [[Bayh–Dole Act]] of 1980 led many US universities to set up tech transfer offices.  The Act was created to try to spur the stagnant US economy of the 1970s, harking back to Vannevar Bush's vision of the role of federal research funding in the US economy.  The Act decentralized ownership of inventions funded with federal grants, allowing universities that received federal grant funding to maintain ownership of such inventions, obligating them to try to patent and license the inventions to US companies, and requiring universities to share license income with inventors.&lt;ref name=Mowery&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mowery|first=David C.|last2=Sampat|first2=Bhaven N.|date=2004-12-01|title=The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 and University–Industry Technology Transfer: A Model for Other OECD Governments?|url=|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|language=en|volume=30|issue=1–2|pages=115–127|doi=10.1007/s10961-004-4361-z|issn=0892-9912|citeseerx=10.1.1.1025.6800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shapin/files/shapin_lrbivorytrade.pdf|title=Ivory Trade|last=Shapin|first=Steven|date=11 September 2003|website=Harvard.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==
While the broad goal of TTOs is to commercialize university research, they engage in numerous activities that not only bring these developments to market but also encourage and support faculty and students in the entire technology transfer process. Such encouragement may increase the chances of faculty and students creating research developments that can be commercialized. Some of the major functions of TTOs include:

=== Industry partnerships ===
An important task of many TTOs is to create and maintain industry partnerships that may be crucial for collaboration and bringing technologies to market.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Etzkowitz|first=Henry|date=1998-12-01|title=The norms of entrepreneurial science: cognitive effects of the new university–industry linkages|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=27|issue=8|pages=823–833|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(98)00093-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities such as MIT and Northwestern have separate offices for industry and corporate relations which typically work in conjunction with the TTO of the institution. In this case, TTOs often exploit the relationships developed by the corporate relations office, focusing more specifically on the technology transfer process itself. TTOs often employ two methods when engaging with industry partners: 1) the "pull" method, in which TTOs ''receive'' interest from industry partners in bringing specific technologies at the university to market, and 2) the "push" method, in which TTOs actively ''seek'' industry partners for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4438&amp;context=flr|title=Interface: The Push and Pull of Patents|last=Lee|first=Peter|date=2009|website=Fordham Law Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bayh-Dole Act obligated universities to seek [[patent]] protection, when appropriate, for inventions to which they elect title; after passage of the Bayh-Dole Act many US universities created intellectual property policies that obligated faculty to assign inventions to the university.&lt;ref name=Mowery/&gt; Universities typically [[License#Patent licensing|license]] the patent to a company that will invest money in developing the invention into a product, which it will then be able to sell at a premium, recouping its investment and making profit before the patent expires.&lt;ref name=Mowery/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegel|first=Donald S|last2=Waldman|first2=David|last3=Link|first3=Albert|date=2003-01-01|title=Assessing the impact of organizational practices on the relative productivity of university technology transfer offices: an exploratory study|url=|journal=Research Policy|volume=32|issue=1|pages=27–48|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(01)00196-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Counseling and incubation for startups ===

TTOs at many universities often provide general business and legal counseling to foster entrepreneurship among faculty and students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Shea|first=Rory P.|last2=Allen|first2=Thomas J.|last3=Chevalier|first3=Arnaud|last4=Roche|first4=Frank|date=2005-09-01|title=Entrepreneurial orientation, technology transfer and spinoff performance of U.S. universities|url=|journal=Research Policy|series=The Creation of Spin-off Firms at Public Research Institutions: Managerial and Policy Implcations|volume=34|issue=7|pages=994–1009|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2005.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By providing resources, funding, and connections to [[University spin-off|university spin-off companies]], TTOs attempt to increase the chances of [[startup company|startup]] success, which may result in financial gain if the university owns the intellectual property of the invention or has an equity stake in the company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hence, many TTOs establish [[business incubator]]s and programs for faculty and students in an attempt to enhance the entrepreneurial atmosphere among researchers at the university.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Rhonda G.|date=2002-08-01|title=Technology business incubators: how effective as technology transfer mechanisms?|url=|journal=Technology in Society|volume=24|issue=3|pages=299–316|doi=10.1016/S0160-791X(02)00010-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of such incubators and programs include the [[Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator]] as well as the [[Physical Sciences and Engineering Accelerator]] at [[Harvard University]], and [[Fab Lab MSI]], affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]]. Research has suggested that incubators at TTOs have not had a high incidence of technology transfer, despite this being one of the reasons they were established, and may even negatively impact the success of TTOs and technology transfer at the university.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolympiris|first=Christos|last2=Klein|first2=Peter G.|date=2017-06-01|title=The Effects of Academic Incubators on University Innovation|journal=Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|pages=145–170|doi=10.1002/sej.1242|issn=1932-443X|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/106979/1/WRAP-effects-academic-incubators-university-innovation-Kolympiris-2017.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and organization ==
The structure and organization of TTOs can affect its overall performance and can vary among universities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brescia|first=F.|last2=Colombo|first2=G.|last3=Landoni|first3=P.|title=Organizational structures of Knowledge Transfer Offices: an analysis of the world's top-ranked universities|url=|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|volume=41|issue=1|pages=132–151|doi=10.1007/s10961-014-9384-5|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since TTOs deal with both academic research and industry, they consist of a diverse set of individuals, including scientists, lawyers, analysts, licensing experts, and business managers. By having individuals (particularly different scientists, engineers, and analysts) with varying sets of expertise in research, TTOs attempt to more effectively assess, protect, and profit from the research developments taking place in  multiple disciplines throughout the university.

TTOs can by classified into three different types:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* ''internal:'' existing as an integrated part of the university and controlled by university administration
* ''external:'' existing as an independent company that does not operate under the control of university administration
* ''mixed:'' having components of both internal and external TTOs 
As of 2012 the "internal" type was most common in the US.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Strategies ==
TTOs attempt to capitalize on the research developments made at the university by employing strategies focused on providing the university with opportunities for financial gain and increased research impact. A common strategy that TTOs engage in is licensing their inventions, either to an industry partner or back to the university inventor if the inventor started a company (i.e. a university spin-off).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macho-Stadler|first=Inés|last2=Pérez-Castrillo|first2=David|last3=Veugelers|first3=Reinhilde|date=2007-06-01|title=Licensing of university inventions: The role of a technology transfer office|url=|journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization|volume=25|issue=3|pages=483–510|doi=10.1016/j.ijindorg.2006.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this approach, TTOs can bring university technologies to market without having to engage in production and distribution themselves. TTOs can also take an equity stake in the spin-off company rather than licensing the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lockett|first=Andy|last2=Wright|first2=Mike|last3=Franklin|first3=Stephen|title=Technology Transfer and Universities' Spin-Out Strategies|url=|journal=Small Business Economics|volume=20|issue=2|pages=185–200|doi=10.1023/a:1022220216972|via=|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has suggested that equity in spin-off companies may provide higher returns than licensing,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bray|first=Michael J|last2=Lee|first2=James N|date=2000-09-01|title=University revenues from technology transfer: Licensing fees vs. equity positions|url=|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=15|issue=5|pages=385–392|doi=10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00034-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this strategy seems to be more common with TTOs that are financially independent from the parent university (i.e. external TTO structure).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While these strategies vary greatly among TTOs at different universities, a majority of them employ some combination of licensing and equity stakes, with licensing being a more standard practice.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== International diffusion &amp; TTOs outside the US ==
As many major research universities across the US began to adopt TTOs, institutions outside the US became attracted to the idea of taking control of their commercialization activities as well. Prior to the 2000s, many German-speaking and Scandinavian countries had a policy of "professor's privilege", in which faculty retain the right to control the intellectual property of their inventions. In addition, in recent years many [[OECD]] and [[European Union|EU]] nations have created legislation that emulates Bayh-Dole, in an attempt to increase the commercialization activities and impact of their respective research universities.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geuna|first=Aldo|last2=Rossi|first2=Federica|date=2011-10-01|title=Changes to university IPR regulations in Europe and the impact on academic patenting|url=http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/3753/1/3753.pdf|journal=Research Policy|series=Special Issue: 30 Years After Bayh-Dole: Reassessing Academic Entrepreneurship|volume=40|issue=8|pages=1068–1076|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2011.05.008|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/industry-and-services/benchmarking-industry-science-relationships_9789264175105-en|title=Benchmarking Industry-Science Relationships|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oecd-ilibrary.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark was among the first to abolish professor's privilege, followed by Germany, Austria, Norway and Finland between 2000-2007.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Countries such as  France and the UK, which already had policies in place that grant intellectual property rights to universities during this period, began heavily encouraging and enforcing these institutional ownership rights.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; As of 2011, most European countries grant universities the rights to the intellectual property of inventions developed by faculty researchers, yet a few countries such as Italy and Sweden still employ professor's privilege.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farnstrand Damsgaard|first=E.|last2=Thursby|first2=M. C.|date=2013-02-01|title=University entrepreneurship and professor privilege|url=https://academic.oup.com/icc/article/22/1/183/882569/University-entrepreneurship-and-professor|journal=Industrial and Corporate Change|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=183–218|doi=10.1093/icc/dts047|issn=0960-6491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, there has been a marked increase in the commercialization activities of universities and creation of TTOs in Europe.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Several Asian countries such as Japan, China, and India have also shifted towards a Bayh-Dole type legislation, although some countries such as Malaysia have a shared ownership model.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen|first=Tina|date=2010|title=Asian Initiatives on Bayh-Dole, with Special Reference to India: How Do We Make It More "Asian?"|url=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1085&amp;context=ckjip|journal=Chicago-Kent Journal of Intellectual Property|volume=10|pages=44–64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mok|first=Ka Ho|title=The quest for an entrepreneurial university in East Asia: impact on academics and administrators in higher education|url=|journal=Asia Pacific Education Review|volume=14|issue=1|pages=11–22|doi=10.1007/s12564-013-9249-x|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there has been a general shift towards increased commercialization and the establishment of TTOs across higher education institutions in Asian countries. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Although universities created TTOs with hopes of financial gain, many TTOs have retained losses in their commercialization activities and have not generated significant local economic development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trune|first=Dennis R|last2=Goslin|first2=Lewis N|date=1998-03-01|title=University Technology Transfer Programs: A Profit/Loss Analysis|url=|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=57|issue=3|pages=197–204|doi=10.1016/S0040-1625(97)00165-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It has been argued that protecting intellectual property and patenting is a costly process, and of all the patents and licenses a university issues, there may be a limited number of inventions that actually yield enough revenue to cover or surpass these costs. Research has shown that larger, more established TTOs are sufficiently profitable, whereas many smaller, more recent TTOs are not, and that an estimated half of TTOs retain losses in their commercialization activities (of those that do not have losses, a majority do no better than to cover their costs).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Even the most profitable TTOs only produce revenue that amounts to 1-3% of the total research expenditures at the university.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moreover, less than 1% of licensed technologies actually yield over $1M in revenue.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Another criticism of TTOs is its role in the research atmosphere of the university, with many scholars arguing that its presence and purpose of engaging in commercialization activities conflicts with a university's mission of furthering knowledge and objective academic inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleischut|first=Peter M.|last2=Haas|first2=Scott|date=2005|title=University Technology Transfer Offices: A Status Report|journal=Biotechnology Healthcare|volume=2|issue=2|pages=48–53|issn=1554-169X|pmc=3564362|pmid=23393451|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebecca Eisenberg and [[Michael Heller (law professor)|Michael Heller]] have argued that the Bayh-Dole Act spurred university tech transfer offices to become too aggressive in patenting, creating [[patent thicket]]s and a [[tragedy of the anticommons]] especially in the field of [[biomedical research]].&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heller |first=M. A. |last2=Eisenberg |first2=R. |title=Can Patents Deter Innovation?

The '''William Phelps Ornithological Collection,''' also known as the Phelps Ornithological Museum, is a museum of [[Natural science|natural sciences]] dedicated to the study, exhibition and preservation of the [[Bird|birds]] of [[Venezuela]] and the rest of Latin America. The collection is located east of Caracas and in the geographic center of [[Metropolitan Region of Caracas|Greater Caracas]], in the heart of the [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande district]]. The William Phelps ornithological collection is the most important in [[Latin America]] and it is also the most important private collection in the world in its research area.&lt;ref name=":282"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H. PHELPS JR.|last=VUILLEUMIER|first=FRANCOIS|date=1990|journal=Department of Ornithology, The American Museum of Natural Histor|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In this private museum one will find important Phelps family study books, as well as 8000 scientific volumes in the library,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|author=Marcos Kirschstein y José Daniel Ramos|title=El bulevar de Sabana Grande esconde un misterio de ochenta años|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/videos/cultura/bulevar-sabana-grande-esconde-misterio-ochenta-anos_69876|date=2018-01-29|accessdate=2018-05-29|work=El Nacional|location=|page=|number=|Apellido 2=}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 83,000 anatomical specimens, more than 80,000 skins, etc.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;  For the year 1990, it was said that the William Phelps Ornithological Collection contained more than 76,300 skins and a small number of anatomical specimens, in the Gran Sabana Building of [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande]]. The Phelps library in 1990 already had 6,000 books, 800 journals and 5,500 reprints, mostly from natural sciences.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;
 
== History ==

The ornithological collection was born in 1938, although it did not have its own headquarters on the [[Boulevard of Sabana Grande]] until 1949. At the beginning of 2018, it celebrated its 80th anniversary in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the passing of time, the collection has been growing&lt;ref name=":282" /&gt; and still has great international scientific relevance. In 2005, an investigation was carried out on "plumage differences in four subspecies of golden warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in [[Venezuela]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.neotropicalbirdclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/C23-Restall.pdf|title=On plumage differences in four subspecies of Golden-crowned Warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in Venezuela|last=Restall|first=Robin|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Gustavo|date=2005|journal=Cotinga|number=23|pages=33–36|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=|last3=Lentino|first3=Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Importance ===
The Phelps Foundation has been recognized worldwide for its scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fundacionwhphelps.org/web/nosotros/|title=Nosotros – Colección Ornitológica Phelps|website=fundacionwhphelps.org|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1937, this foundation has dedicated to the study of the distribution of birds in Venezuela as well as to the dissemination of ornithology in Venezuela. Since 1949, it has expanded globally in its mission to discover, interpret and disseminate information about ornithology through a program of scientific research, education and dissemination in the natural sciences. The Foundation has had an important global trajectory for which it is recognized and is a regional compulsory study resource on tropical birds for experts who want to know more about this area. This museum has historically been connected to the American Museum of Natural History, thanks to the work of Billy Phelps.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H. PHELPS JR.|last=VUILLEUMIER|first=FRANCOIS|date=1990|journal=Department of Ornithology, The American Museum of Natural Histor|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ornithological collection has also been expanded thanks to the research carried out with Armando Dugand from [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.bdigital.unal.edu.co/33067/1/32820-121526-1-PB.pdf|title=AVES DE LA RIBERA COLOMBIANA DEL RIO NEGRO (FRONTERA DE COLOMBIA Y VENEZUELA)|last=Dugand|first=Armando|last2=Phelps|first2=William|authorlink2=|date=1948|journal=Libro|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the funds to carry out these investigations were collected by the Phelps Foundation.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;

=== Research ===
In March and April 1977, the Phelps Ornithological Collection, with the collaboration of the Venezuelan-Brazilian Border Commission, Demarcador de Limites, carried out a collection of birds at Cerro Urutaní (62 ° 05'W, 3 ° 40'N), which is a low altitude tepui on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border in the Sierra Pacaraima. A total of 511 specimens of birds were collected between 1150 and 1280 meters high s.n.m., representing 78 different species. Gilberto Pérez Chinchilla, Manuel Castro and Dickerman prepared the copies of the collection. A full report on these birds was published in the international press and was published in the Bulletin of the "American Museum of Natural History", [[New York City|New York]]. It was necessary to work in conjunction with the Boundary Directorate of [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/Phelps%20%26%20Dickerman%201980.pdf|title=CUATRO SUBESPECIES NUEVAS DE AVES (FURNARIIDAE, FORMICARIIDAE) DE LA REGION DE PANTEPUI, ESTADO BOLIVAR Y TERRITORIO AMAZONAS, VENEZUELA|last=Phelps|first=William|last2=Robert|first2=Dickerman|date=1980|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Venezolana de Ciencias Naturales|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
