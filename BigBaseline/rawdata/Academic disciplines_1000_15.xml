[[File:Marc, Franz - Pferde in Landschaft.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Franz Marc]]'s ''Pferde in Landschaft'', one of the artworks discovered in the Gurlitt collection (probably 1911, [[gouache]] on coloured paper).]]

In February 2012, the [[Prosecutor|District Prosecutor]] of Augsburg confiscated 121 framed and 1,285 unframed artworks found in an apartment in [[Schwabing]], [[Munich]] in the course of an investigation into possible tax evasion.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; The apartment was rented to  Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of celebrated art historian, dealer, and war profiteer, [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], and grandson of the art historian [[Cornelius Gurlitt (art historian)|Cornelius Gurlitt]].  Some of the paintings were immediately suspected of having been [[Nazi plunder|looted]] by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The collection is largely undamaged and of remarkable quality. It contains [[Old Masters]] as well as [[Impressionist]], [[Cubist]], and [[Expressionist]] paintings by artists including [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Otto Dix]], and [[Max Liebermann]], among many others. Although German authorities seized the entire collection, Gurlitt was not detained. Not until 3 November 2013 did the magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' report the find.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; News of the discovery was reported worldwide.&lt;ref name="Smale"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/design/trove-of-apparently-nazi-looted-art-found-in-munich-apartment.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 |title= Report of Nazi-Looted Trove Puts Art World in an Uproar |last=Smale |first=Alison |date=4 November 2013 |website= |publisher=''The New York Times'' |access-date= 18 March 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurlitt initially refused to cooperate with investigators. He retained several dozen additional suspect paintings, kept not in Munich but in his home in Salzburg, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26133532 |title=Nazi loot probe: More art found at Gurlitt Austria home, BBC News, 11 February 2014 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2014-02-11 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2014, an agreement was reached whereby the collection confiscated in Munich was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with a government-led task force charged with returning stolen pieces to the rightful owners.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dw.de/p/1BdMb |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=7 April 2014 |accessdate=16 April 2014 |last=R |first=D |title=Gurlitt reaches deal with German authorities over vast trove of art}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10811916/Cornelius-Gurlitt-obituary.html |title=Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary |publisher=Telegraph |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate= 28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His will bequeathed all his property to the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]], Switzerland, after all legitimate claims of ownership against it had been evaluated.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014"&gt;{{cite news|title='Nazi art' hoarder Gurlitt makes Swiss museum sole heir|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27306269|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.artnet.com/in-brief/will-germany-keep-gurlitts-trove-from-the-swiss-14647#.U2ujUaPvmMk.facebook |title=Artnet news, Alexander Forbes, '&amp;#39;Will Germany Keep Gurlitt’s Trove from the Swiss?'&amp;#39; |publisher=News.artnet.com |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 1930 art collector Hildebrand Gurlitt was removed as director of the museum in [[Zwickau]] because he exhibited contemporary artists. After the Nazis came to power, he was stripped of his new job as director of [[Kunstverein Hamburg]], because his grandmother was a Jew.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lichtblau |first=Eric |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/nazi_policies_toward_jews_and_minorities/ |title='&amp;#39;Nazi Policies Toward Jews and Minorities'&amp;#39;, NY Times, 18 November 2013 |publisher=Topics.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He moved the family to [[Dresden]] and built a prosperous business as an art dealer, specializing in modern art.&lt;ref name="Cornelius Gurlitt - obituary"/&gt;

Hildebrand was appointed as a dealer for the [[Führermuseum]] in [[Linz]], Austria.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Appointed when?  by whom?}}  On instructions from [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Hermann Göring]] personally appointed a Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art.{{Clarify|date=March 2016|reason= vague. Created when?}}  The Commission in turn appointed a series of dealers approved by the official Nazi confiscation service, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|ERR]], to handle the marketing of these art assets. Four men who had been dealing in modern art for years were chosen: Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Möller, Bernhard A. Böhmer and Hildebrand Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title= The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War| publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. |date = 1995 |accessdate=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were instructed to sell these artworks abroad for foreign currency.  Hildebrand's extensive network of European and North American art contacts were invaluable in this.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Göring used the funds raised to grow his personal art collection, though the four men did not always report to the Commission all proceeds of their sales.&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;{{cite web|last=Feliciano |first=Hector |url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/ |title=The Lost Museum |publisher=Bonjour Paris |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works of so-called "degenerate art" that the Commission sold off were many paintings stolen from noted French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]].

[[File:Sworn Statement Dr. H. Gurlitt 1945.pdf|thumb|1945 statement by [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]] to Allied authorities, describing his dealings before and during the war and listing art in his possession]]

In May 1940 the Reich Propaganda Ministry sold to Gurlitt 200 paintings, including Chagall's ''The Walk'', Picasso's ''Farming Family'', and Nolde's ''Hamburg Harbour,'' for the small sum of 4,000 Swiss francs.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt;  Hildebrand similarly acquired 115 additional works of "degenerate art" in 1941.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168/&gt; It is estimated that, at his height, he had a personal trading collection of more than 1500 art objects.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"/&gt;

Gurlitt used his position to sell art to domestic collectors, most notably to [[Bernhard Sprengel]], whose collection forms the core of the [[Sprengel Museum]] in Hannover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://derstandard.at/1216918696497/Entartete--Kunstgeschaefte | title=Entartete Kunstgeschäfte | work=Der Standard | date=6 August 2008 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captured with his wife and twenty boxes of art in Aschbach ([[Schlüsselfeld]]) in June 1945, Gurlitt claimed that the art was part of his personal collection, and that most of his collection and all of his records had been destroyed during the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945.&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/depot-mit-nazi-raubkunst-in-muenchen-der-verwerter-und-sein-sohn-1.1809631 | title=Depot mit Nazi-Raubkunst in München | work=Süddeutsche.de | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | author=Mazzoni, Ira |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He painted himself as a victim of Nazi persecution due to his Jewish heritage, and on those grounds he was released.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;
 
[[File:Liebermann, Max - Zwei Reiter am Strand - Gurlitt.jpg|thumb|[[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' in the Gurlitt collection and subject to a claim by the descendants of the original Jewish owner]]

Although suspicious of his story, in December 1950 US investigators returned 206 items to Gurlitt, including [[Max Liebermann]]'s ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'', [[Otto Dix]]'s self-portrait, an allegorical painting by [[Marc Chagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2493980/Nazi-art-loot-German-dealer-quizzed-U-S-military-just-war.html#ixzz2k9BmfvdM|title=How U.S. military quizzed German dealer of £1bn Nazi art loot just after the war|last=Enoch |first=Nick|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurlitt continued trading artworks until his death in 1956.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholas"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;printsec=frontcover | title=The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War | publisher=Random House LLC | author=Nicholas, Lynn H. | date=22 December 2009 | page=24 | isbn=9780307739728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelius Gurlitt (28 December 1932 – 6 May 2014) was a German [[Private collection|art collector]], son  of [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. He grew up in the [[Dammtor]] district of Hamburg with his sister Renate, who was born there in 1935. His great-grandmother was Jewish, which caused his father to be labelled as a "quarter-Jew" under the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nazi race laws]] in the ''Volkszählung vom 17. Mai 1939'', or so-called "German Minority Census" of 1939.&lt;ref&gt;This "German Minority Census" is available in digital form at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum Resource Center in Washington D.C. and at the German Federal Archives in Berlin-Lichterfelde. An unsourced copy of the database was published online by the [http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx Holocaust Era Assets and Restitution Taskforce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109175142/http://www.heartwebsite.org/ArchivalResearch.aspx |date=2013-11-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery by German customs authorities==
In 2010 German customs officers detained Cornelius Gurlitt entering Germany from Switzerland carrying €9,000 (£7,500; $13,000) in cash,&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; which he explained as the proceeds of a transaction with the Galerie Kornfeld in Bern. Gurlitt was allowed to go on his way, but he had aroused suspicions. Further investigation by the prosecutor's office, the federal police and the tax authorities uncovered a number of anomalies.&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Investigators discovered that Gurlitt had never been employed, had no obvious source of income, was not registered with the {{ill|Einwohnermeldeamt|de}} or with the tax authorities or social services, had never married, and had no pension or health insurance.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In late February 2012, the authorities searched his apartment, finding more than a thousand paintings valued at as much as €1 billion.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/kultur/kunst/1500-werke-von-picasso-bis-chagall-zollfahnder-entdecken-sensationellen-kunstschatz-in-muenchen_aid_1147066.html|title=Fahnder entdecken 1500 Werke von Picasso, Chagall und weiteren Künstlern|work=Focus|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24794970|title=Nazi looted art 'found in Munich'|publisher=BBC News|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAZ_Nov22&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-ein-dementi-weitere-meldungen-nuechterne-schaetzungen-12674903.html|title=Schwabinger Kunstfund: Ein Dementi, weitere Meldungen, nüchterne Schätzungen|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=22 November 2013|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' stated that at least 200 pieces were believed to have been lost during the Nazi era.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;
The paintings recovered included works by &lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt; [[Ernst Barlach]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Canaletto]], Marc Chagall, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Christoph|de}}, [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], Otto Dix, [[Albrecht Dürer]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Erich Fraaß|de}}, [[Conrad Felixmüller]], [[Bonaventura Genelli]], [[Ludwig Godenschweg]], [[Otto Griebel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Paul Klee]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernhard Kretzschmar|de}}, [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Wilhelm Lachnit]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz Maskos|de}}, [[Henri Matisse]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Théodore Rousseau]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]], [[Carl Spitzweg]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Christoph Voll]].

==Initial legal handling of the Gurlitt case==
On 5 November 2013, Reinhard Nemetz, the head of the prosecutors' office in [[Augsburg]], said that 121 framed and 1,258 unframed works had been seized from the apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt in early March 2012,&lt;ref name=BBC24818541/&gt; including unregistered works by Chagall, Dix, Liebermann, and Matisse.&lt;ref name=BBC24818541&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24818541|title=Nazi trove in Munich contains unknown works by masters|publisher=BBC News|date=5 November 2013|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian who first examined the collection, [[Meike Hoffmann]], claimed in print in 2010 that "not a single one" of these works was ever acquired by Hildebrand Gurlitt. Dr. Meike Hoffmann wishes to remark that this controversy derives from a misreading of her book on Bernhard A. Böhmer. In her book, the art historical term ‘Bildwerke’ is used. The term refers only to sculptures, which indeed Hildebrand Gurlitt did not take from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation. Of course, Meike Hoffmann has never questioned the fact that Hildebrandt Gurlitt dealt with other kinds of artworks from the ‘Degenerate Art’ Confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman's book (in German) ''Ein Händler "entarteter" Kunst: Bernhard A. Böhmer und sein Nachlass.'' Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-05-004498-9}}. (''Schriften der Forschungsstelle "Entartete Kunst"''),  p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; She stated to ''Focus'' that as many as 300 pieces had appeared in the 1937 Nazi [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]] in Munich.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC24794970/&gt; At the time of the interview with ''Focus'', she was trying to trace the original owners of the works and their surviving relatives.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Art historians asked that a complete list of the paintings be published in order that they be returned to their rightful owners.&lt;ref name=Telg10424957&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10424957/Art-experts-demand-Germany-releases-list-of-1-billion-Nazi-art-trove.html | title=Art experts demand Germany releases list of €1-billion Nazi art trove | work=The Telegraph | date=4 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Alexander, Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine in November 2013, Cornelius insisted that his father had obtained the works legally and stated that he would not voluntarily return any of them to previous owners.&lt;ref name=BBCSpiegel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24977814|title=Nazi-looted art: German collector says he owns pictures |date=17 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel interview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/spiegel-interview-with-cornelius-gurlitt-about-munich-art-find-a-933953.htm | title=Interview with a Phantom: Cornelius Gurlitt Shares the Secrets of His Pictures | work=Der Spiegel | date=17 November 2013 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Gezer, Õzlem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling threatened by the intense media attention, Gurlitt's brother-in-law offered 22 works in his possession to the police for safekeeping.&lt;ref name=Telg10439168&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10439168/Art-dealer-paid-Nazis-just-4000-Swiss-Francs-for-masterpieces.html|title=Art dealer paid Nazis just 4,000 Swiss Francs for masterpieces|last=Barnett |first=Louise|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 November 2013|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCStuttgart&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24910093|title=German police check new art haul near Stuttgart |date=12 November 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' revealed that they had received a letter from Gurlitt telling them that "the name Gurlitt may not appear in your magazine." Gurlitt then told two reporters from the ''[[Paris Match]]'', who confronted him in a Munich supermarket, that "Applause from the wrong side is the worst thing there is." ''Der Spiegel'' found this comment "puzzling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/cornelius-gurlitt-reporter-spueren-den-kunstsammler-in-muenchen-auf-a-932755.html ''Der Spiegel''], 11 November 2013 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portrait of a woman'' by [[Henri Matisse]] was directly traceable to the collection of [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], a Jewish art dealer from Paris who had represented [[Matisse]] and [[Picasso]] and who had been forced to leave his collection behind when he fled France.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Oltermann|first=Philip|title=German police recover 1,500 modernist masterpieces 'looted by Nazis'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police|accessdate=3 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When approached by ''Focus'', Rosenberg's granddaughter, French television presenter [[Anne Sinclair]], who had been fighting for decades for the return of the art dealer's paintings, stated that she knew nothing of the existence of the painting.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2486251/Discovered-Billion-pound-art-collection-seized-Nazis-ordered-destroyed-discovered-rotting-food-dishevelled-Munich-apartment.html#ixzz2jbOnohDE|title=£1billion art collection seized by Nazis found in shabby Munich apartment|author=Hall, Alan|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery efforts for ''Portrait of a woman'' were immediately undertaken on behalf of the Rosenberg heirs by [[Art Recovery Group|Christopher A.

It is believed the work was sold to a collector in Florida in 2002.

One of the last pieces that Cornelius Gurlitt sold was ''The Lion Tamer'' by Max Beckmann. After a settlement, initiated by the Lempertz auction house in Cologne, was reached between Gurlitt and the heirs of [[Alfred Flechtheim]], it was auctioned off for nearly £750,000.&lt;ref name=Focus1147066/&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2486251/&gt; Another work was reportedly sold in 1990 through the [[Bern]]-based gallery of [[Eberhard Kornfeld]].&lt;ref name="Suddeutsche"/&gt;

In March 2014, a BBC reporter was granted access to one of the locations where 238 of the seized works were stored. He viewed works such as [[Monet]]'s ''[[Waterloo Bridge (painting)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' (1903) and others by [[Picasso]], [[Cezanne]], [[Liebermann]], [[Renoir]], [[Courbet]], and [[Manet]].&lt;ref name="BBC 20140326"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26746697 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: One lonely man and his hoard of stolen Nazi art |last=Evans |first=Stephen |publisher=[[BBC News Magazine]] |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2014, a month before Gurlitt's death, an agreement was reached whereby the seized artwork was to be returned to Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with the government-led task force charged with determining which of the pieces was stolen and returning them to the rightful heirs.&lt;ref name="DWdr 20140407"/&gt;

===Schwabinger (Gurlitt) Art Trove Task Force===
An entity called the Schwabinger Kunstfund or Gurlitt Task Force was created to research the provenance of the paintings in the Gurlitt trove. However, after several years of operations under the direction of Ingeborg Berggreen-Merkel it was widely criticized for having few results and little visibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/task-force-investigating-art-trove-inherited-from-nazi-collector-achieved-embarrassing-results/a-18876659&lt;/ref&gt;

Berggreen-Merkel was accused of visiting the severely ill Gurlitt at his hospital bed and persuading him to sign over the ownership of his collection, allegedly as the only way to prevent Gurlitt from getting sued from various interest groups, Jewish or other. In early 2014 Gurlitt designated the Kunstmuseum as his sole heir. A few weeks earlier, Berggreen-Merkel had met with the President of the Museum's Foundation Council, Christoph Schäublin. One year later, her taskforce was dissolved. "We are disappointed," said Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taskforce-kunstfund.de/en/chronology.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/gurlitt-und-die-folgen-des-schwabinger-kunstfunds-kunstmuseum-bern-tritt-gurlitt-erbe-an/11021442.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/Laesst-sich-Bern-die-grosse-GurlittAusstellung-wegschnappen-/story/31357598&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Gurlitt, and after==
Cornelius Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Nazi art' hoarder Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27298832|work=BBC|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, written on his deathbed, Gurlitt named the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern]] in Switzerland as his sole heir.&lt;ref name="BBC 7 May 2014" /&gt;  People close to Gurlitt told an American newspaper that he decided to give the collection to a foreign institution because he felt that Germany had treated him and his father badly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/swiss-museum-close-to-accepting-nazi-era-art-bequest-1416443643 |title= Swiss Museum Close to Accepting Trove of Nazi Art|last1= Lane|first1= Mary M.|date= November 20, 2014|publisher= ''The Wall Street Journal'' |access-date= 13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy included the paintings Gurlitt had kept in Salzburg, paintings which German authorities had not confiscated because their remit did not extend to property held in Austria. Gurlitt's decision created further controversy over the appropriateness of the museum accepting this bequest. The will stipulated that the museum would be required to research the provenance of the paintings and make restitution as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. A12.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum decided to accept those works which are not legally the property of previous Nazi-era owners, or their heirs, and has entered into a joint-agreement with German and Swiss authorities about the handling of this bequest.

Gurlitt's family (cousins) also entered the discussion, raising questions about the legality of the will, based on his state of mind at the time. Gurlitt's cousin, Uta Werner, filed a claim of inheritance on the artwork. Werner's lawyer, Wolfgang Seybold, argued that Gurlitt's relatives were the rightful heirs. Seybold supported his argument with the opinion of psychiatrist and lawyer Helmut Hausner, who stated that Gurlitt suffered from [[schizoid personality disorder]], delusions, and dementia when he wrote the will bequeathing his collection to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die 'Causa Gurlitt': Leichtgradig Kompliziert|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/die-causa-gurlitt-leichtgradig-kompliziert-13273066.html|work=Franffurter Algemeine|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that a number of artworks will be returned to Gurlitt's estate, as he would have been considered the rightful owner unless the heirs of previous owners could prove that he obtained them through unlawful means.&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/kunst-und-architektur/article121499967/Wie-Picassos-in-einer-vermuellten-Wohnung-landeten.html | title=Wie Picassos in einer vermüllten Wohnung landeten | work=Die Welt | date=3 November 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Dittmar, Peter | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; German authorities estimate that around 590 pieces need further investigation to determine whether they were confiscated under the Nazi regime, and a further 380 have been definitively identified as confiscated by the Nazis as "degenerate art".&lt;ref name="Schwabing art trove"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.lostart.de/Content/02_Aktuelles/2013/13-11-15%20PM%20Taskforce_EN.html?nn=9848 | title=Schwabing art trove: Provenance of treasures to be researched alongside criminal proceedings – suspicious works being publicised at lostart.de | publisher=the Bavarian State Ministry of Justice, the Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art objects continued to surface after Gurlitt's death. In July 2014, a new discovery was made in his Munich apartment: two sculptures, possibly the work of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Edgar Degas|Degas]].&lt;ref name=sculptures&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28464629 |title=Possible Rodin and Degas works found at Gurlitt home |publisher=BBC |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, a landscape by Claude Monet was discovered in a suitcase Gurlitt had left in a hospital where he stayed.&lt;ref name=suitcase&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29085509 |title=Cornelius Gurlitt: Monet found in art hoarder's suitcase |publisher=BBC |date=5 September 2014 |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
German newspapers questioned the prosecutor's right to seize the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Voss |first=Julia |date=17 November 2013 |title=Münchner Kunstfund: Wo bleibt der Rechtsstaat? |newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunstmarkt/muenchner-kunstfund-wo-bleibt-der-rechtsstaat-12668607.html |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/der-fall-gurlitt/schwabinger-kunstfund-politische-strafjustiz-12678004.html ''Politische Strafjustiz''] (in German) in the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 25 November 2013, by Volker Rieble.&lt;/ref&gt; Property rights in cases of works of art acquired during the Nazi period are highly complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dittmar |first=Peter |date=7 November 2013 |title=Verbrechen lohnt sich |newspaper=Jüdische Allgemeine |url=http://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/article/view/id/17492 |language=de}}. This article refers in particular to works of ''[[degenerate art]]'', whose confiscation had been formalized by a Nazi law. ''Gesetz über Einziehung von Erzeugnissen entarteter Kunst'' (Act on the Confiscation of Works of Degenerate Art) of 31 May 1938&lt;/ref&gt; After the war the Nazi law legalizing possession of stolen works of ''[[degenerate art]]'' was deliberately upheld by the [[Allied Control Council]] in order that the trade in artworks could continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 Heuer, Carl-Heinz (undated). "Die eigentumsrechtliche Problematik der ''entarteten'' Kunst" – "The problems surrounding ownership rights to ''degenerate'' art"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235653/http://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/e/khi/forschung/entartete_kunst/dossier/Broschuere_Heuer.pdf?1347697442 |date=2 December 2013 }} (bilingual), on the website of the [[Free University of Berlin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in Austria,&lt;ref&gt;''Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998'' (''Art Return Law 1998'') See the [[:de:Restitution (Österreich)#Kunstrückgabegesetz 1998|German Wikipedia entry]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no law in effect in Germany requiring the return of Nazi-looted art, as long as the items in question can be proven to have been, at any point in time, legally acquired. As signatories of the [[Wiedergutmachung|1998 Washington Agreement]], Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries&lt;ref&gt;The [http://raubgut.zlb.de/index.php/About/Index_en Central and Regional Library of Berlin] is the only library in Germany to have full-time staff devoted to the search for Nazi-looted cultural goods.&lt;/ref&gt; have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement whatsoever to return Nazi-looted art. A failure on the part of the German government to return the rightful possessions of Cornelius Gurlitt might have been a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2013/48/gurlitt-kunstwerke-raubkunst/seite-1 ''Fluch des Schatzes''] (''Curse of the Treasure'') in ''Der Zeit'', 21 November 2013 (in German). ''“German museums are accordingly, albeit rather hesitantly, searching for looted art in their collections, and from time to time works are returned. This is cumbersome, mostly unspectacular and takes far too long, but it is still the right way. But Cornelius Gurlitt is a private person, and therefore the principles of the Washington Agreement do not apply to his artworks. He cannot be forced, and it appears the government wants to seize the works, which is hardly possible in the face of the constitution.”''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2013, prominent German art historian [[Sibylle Ehringhaus]], who was one of the first experts to view the artworks in the spring of 2012, gave an interview in the newspaper ''[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]'', demanding the immediate return of the complete collection to Gurlitt. However, she had looked at the works very briefly and had not researched their [[provenance]] because, as she stated in the interview, "Cornelius Gurlitt commissioned neither myself nor anyone else" to perform such research. Chief Prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz vehemently denied her appeal, yet apparently failed to cite any concrete legal grounds for the seizure.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Interview-Kunstexpertin-fordert-Rueckgabe-aller-Bilder-an-Gurlitt-id27983722.html Interview: Kunstexpertin fordert Rückgabe aller Bilder an Gurlitt], ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 4 December 2012 (in German) or a [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001010/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4590360/Ehringhaus_Gurlitt.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} of the article in English.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Augsburger-Staatsanwaltschaft-weist-Vorwuerfe-der-Kunstexpertin-zurueck-id27992202.html Augsburger Staatsanwaltschaft weist Vorwürfe der Kunstexpertin zurück] ''Augsburger Allgemeine'', 5 December 2012 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2014, the German jurist [[Jutta Limbach]], the head of the Limbach Commission on Nazi-looted art, confirmed the opinion of the German ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' newspaper that the Bavarian "State Prosecutor used an incorrect application of the tax liability law to seize" the artworks of Cornelius Gurlitt.&lt;ref&gt;''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', ''Ein Bild lässt sich abhangen, Schuld nicht'' (in German; English: "A picture may be taken down, but not the guilt"), interview by Heribert Prantl and Kia Vahland, 20 November 2014, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the artworks have been returned to the heirs of the legitimate owners, notably a portrait by Matisse restored to the heirs of French art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. Another major painting from the collection, ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' (1901), by [[Max Liebermann]], was returned to the heirs of the German-Jewish industrialist and art collector David Friedmann,&lt;ref&gt;Eddy, Melissa (May&amp;nbsp;15, 2015).

==Swiss museum's acceptance of Gurlitt's estate==
On 24 November 2014, the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Bern]] agreed to accept the Gurlitt estate.  Museum officials stated that no art looted by the Nazis would be permitted to enter the museum's collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious&gt;{{cite web| url = https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gurlitt-collection-arrives-kunstmuseum-bern-1018277| title = The Notorious Gurlitt Trove of Nazi-Tainted Art Makes Its First Appearance at Kunstmuseum Bern| author = Neuendorf, Henri| date = July 10, 2017| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = artmet.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 500 works were to remain in Germany until their rightful owners could be identified. Three pieces were singled out for immediate return: [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Femme Assise'' to the descendants of the Jewish art dealer [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], Max Liebermann's ''[[Two Riders on the Beach]]'' to the great-nephew of the industrialist and art collector [[David Friedmann]], and [[Carl Spitzweg]]'s ''Playing the Piano'' to the heirs of music publisher [[Henri Hinrichsen]], who was murdered at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30176190 |title=Swiss museum to accept Gurlitt 'Nazi art' |publisher=BBC News |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public display of the Gurlitt art trove took place at an exhibition curated by the Bern Fine Art Museum, running from November 2017 to March 2018, which featured 160 works from the controversial Gurlitt art collection.&lt;ref name =Notorious/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/culture/bern-fine-arts-museum_gurlitt-exhibition-attracts-droves-of-visitors/43793524| title = Gurlitt exhibition attracts droves of visitors| date = January 2, 2018| accessdate = February 12, 2018| publisher = Swissinfo.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Academy for Liberal Education''' ('''AALE''') is a [[United States]]-based [[educational accreditation]] organization with a focus on fostering [[liberal arts]] education, both in higher education and in earlier schooling.

AALE does not currently have [[U.S. Department of Education]] recognition as a higher education accreditor.&lt;ref name="current status"&gt;{{cite web |title = Accreditation &gt; Agency List|url = http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/Agencies.aspx|accessdate = 2016-02-19|archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fope.ed.gov%2Faccreditation%2FAgencies.aspx&amp;date=2016-02-19|archive-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
AALE was formed in 1992 with the stated purpose of "supporting and recognizing excellence in undergraduate liberal arts teaching and learning through accreditation."&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Department of Education Staff Report to the Senior Department Official on Recognition Compliance Issues: American Academy for Liberal Education", [http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/finalstaffreports.pdf U.S. Department of Education], 2010. 44 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Founders included [[Jacques Barzun]], retired philosophy professor from [[Columbia University]], [[E.O. Wilson]] of [[Harvard University]], historian [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]] of [[Emory University]], and [[Lynne Cheney]], former [[U.S. Secretary of Education]].&lt;ref name=HonanNYT1995&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/06/us/a-new-group-will-accredit-some-colleges.html |title=A New Group Will Accredit Some Colleges |first=William H. |last=Honan |author-link=William H. Honan |newspaper=New York Times |date=August 6, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/02/16/american_university_iraq/ |work=Salon.com |date=February 16, 2011 |title=The empire strikes again; Sex, oil, chaos and corruption at the American University of Iraq |first1= Russ |last1=Baker |first2=Kristina |last2=Borjesson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its initial focus was on undergraduate education, which Barzun said had become "confused, misdirected or not directed at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/03/education/traditionalist-scholars-plan-to-rate-liberal-arts-colleges.html |title=Traditionalist Scholars Plan To Rate Liberal Arts Colleges |last=DePalma |first=Anthony |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 3, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1995, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] granted AALE official recognition as an institutional accreditor for colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=HonanNYT1995/&gt; This recognition allowed AALE-accredited institutions in the United States to participate in student financial aid programs authorized under the [[Higher Education Act of 1965|Higher Education Act]] and other U.S. federal programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg8.html Accreditation in the United States: Specialized Accrediting Agencies], U.S. Department of Education website, accessed December 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2006, the U.S. Department of Education suspended AALE's authority to accredit new institutions and programs.&lt;ref name="standards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fears of Possible Federal Learning Standards Grow as Liberal-Arts Accreditor Is Penalized |url= http://chronicle.com/daily/2006/12/2006120601n.htm |work=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date= December 7, 2006}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i40/40a02202.htm |title=Accreditor Loses Certification Power |author=Paul Basken |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=June 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This restriction was lifted in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nas.org/polPressReleases.cfm?Doc_Id=5 NAS Expresses Pleasure and Relief at Advisory Panel's Recommendation on the AALE], National Association of Scholars press release, December 19, 2007 (accessed on NAS website, December 23, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In the ruling that lifted the restrictions for a period of three years (expiring in December, 2010), Education Secretary [[Margaret Spellings]] wrote of "continued concerns stemming from AALE's being cited consistently since 2001 for either not having clear standards with respect to measuring student outcomes or not collecting and reviewing data on how institutions it accredits measures student outcomes."&lt;ref name=Purgatory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/07/23/aale |title=A Break From Purgatory, Barely |work=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=July 23, 2008 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2010, AALE voluntarily withdrew its request for renewal of U.S. Department of Education recognition as a higher education accreditor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Meeting of the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/naciqi-dir/fall-2010-report.pdf|work=Department of Education|publisher=ed.gov|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For institutions accredited by AALE in 2010 or earlier, accreditation remained valid through July 1, 2012 for purposes of federal government financial aid to students under Title IV of the [[Higher Education Act of 1965|Higher Education Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aale.org/highered/domesticpubs.html |title=Domestic Standards, Applications, and Publications |publisher=American Academy for Liberal Education |accessdate=4 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406034332/http://www.aale.org/highered/domesticpubs.html |archive-date=2013-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==
AALE provides two types of accreditation for [[higher education]] institutions that offer general education programs in the [[liberal arts]]. It provides institutional accreditation for [[university|universities]] and [[college]]s that want AALE to be their sole accreditor and it provides program accreditation for liberal arts programs within higher education institutions that are institutionally accredited by another accreditor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aale.org/highered/us.html Accreditation process] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810044155/http://www.aale.org/highered/us.html |date=2009-08-10 }}, AALE website (accessed December 7, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; AALE accreditation activities are not limited to the United States; the organization works with institutions and programs worldwide that emphasize liberal education and the liberal arts.

The organization also is an accreditor of [[K–12]] [[charter schools]] and [[independent school]]s throughout the United States.

As of August 2009, AALE had accredited about 20 institutions within the United States,and another dozen members outside the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aale.org/highered/list.html Members and Applicants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307173211/http://www.aale.org/highered/list.html |date=2014-03-07 }}, AALE website, accessed August 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Several AALE-accredited institutions follow a "[[great books]]" approach.&lt;ref name="standards" /&gt;

==Leadership==
Since January 2011, AALE has been led by acting president Charles E. Butterworth, an emeritus professor of politics and government at the [[University of Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aale.org/newsletter.html |title=Current Events: AALE Announces New Acting President |publisher=American Academy for Liberal Education |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406035329/http://www.aale.org/newsletter.html |archive-date=2013-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33232">'''Children’s rights education''' (or children’s human rights education) is the teaching and practice of children’s rights in schools and educational institutions, as informed by and consistent with the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. When fully implemented, a children's rights education program consists of both a curriculum to teach children their human rights, and framework to operate the school in a manner that respects children's rights. Articles [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29 29] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42 42] of the Convention on the Rights of the Child require children to be educated about their rights.

In addition to meeting legal obligations of the Convention to spread awareness of children’s rights to children and to adults, teaching children about their rights has the benefits of improving their awareness of rights in general, making them more respectful of other people's rights, and empowering them to take action in support of other people's rights. Early programs to teach children about their rights, in Belgium, Canada, England and New Zealand have provided evidence of this.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt;&lt;ref name=dead /&gt;&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=belgium /&gt;&lt;ref name=wallberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp6 /&gt; Children's rights in schools were taught and practiced as an ethos of 'liberating the child' well before the UN Convention was written, and that this practice helped to inform the values and philosophy of the Convention, the IBE and UNESCO, though sadly these practices, and this history are not really acknowledged or built-upon by the UN. This is one reasons that children's rights have not become a foundation of schools despite 100 years of struggle.&lt;ref name="newman movement"&gt;Newman, Michael (2015) Children’s Rights in our Schools – the movement to liberate the child, an introduction to the New Ideals in Education Conferences 1914-1937, [https://www.academia.edu/14081708/Regaining_the_History_of_Childrens_Rights_in_Schools_Through_the_New_Ideals_in_Education_Conferences_1914-37 www.academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning of children’s human rights education==
Children’s human rights education refers to education and educational practices in schools and educational institutions that are consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.&lt;ref name=empower&gt;Howe, R.B. and Covell, K. (2007). ''Empowering Children: Children’s Rights Education as a Pathway to Citizenship''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krappman&gt;Krappman, L. (2006). "The rights of the child as a challenge to human rights education." ''Journal of Social Science Education.'' Retrieved from: http://www.jsse.org/2006-1/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=osler&gt;Osler, A., and Starkey, H. (2006). "Education for democratic citizenship: A review of research, policy and practice 1995-2005." ''Research Papers in Education,'' 21 (4), 433-466.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of education that takes seriously the view that children are bearers of human rights, that children are citizens in their own right, that schools and educational institutions are learning communities where children learn (or fail to learn) the values and practices of human rights and citizenship, and that educating children about their own basic human rights is a legal obligation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 

Children's rights education is education where the rights of the child, as described in the Convention, is taught and practiced in individual classrooms. But in its most developed form, children’s rights are taught and practiced in a systematic and comprehensive way across grade levels, across the school, and across school districts. With full-blown children’s rights education, children’s rights are not simply an addition to a particular subject or classroom. Rather, the rights of the child are incorporated into the school curricula, teaching practices, and teaching materials across subjects and grade levels and are the centerpiece of school mission statements, behavior codes, and school policies and practices.&lt;ref name=implement&gt;Covell, K., Howe, R.B., and McNeil, J.K. (2010). "Implementing children’s human rights education in schools." ''Improving Schools,'' 13 (2), 117-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully developed children’s rights education means that all members of the school community receive education on the rights of the child. The Convention serves as a values framework for the life and functioning of the school or educational institution and for efforts to promote a more positive school climate and school culture for learning.

A core belief in children’s rights education is that when children learn about their own basic human rights, this learning serves as an important foundation for their understanding and support of human rights more broadly.

==Education and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child==
The Convention on the Rights of the child has important implications for the education of children. Approved by the [[United Nations]] in 1989, the Convention is the most widely ratified and most quickly ratified country in world history. Only two countries – the [[United States]] and [[South Sudan]] – have yet to ratify the [[treaty]].&lt;ref name=CRIN&gt;Child Rights Information Network (2008).

(1999). ''A Commentary on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verhellen&gt;Verhellen, E. (1994).

Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the Convention, a legally binding treaty, states parties have the obligation to make their laws, policies, and practices consistent with the provisions of the Convention, if not immediately, then over time.

In the Convention are numerous articles that deal with education and with children’s rights education. Eugeen Verhellen has divided the Convention’s provisions on education along three tracks.&lt;ref name=verhellen2&gt;Verhellen, E. (1993). "Children’s rights and education." ''School Psychology International,'' 14 (3), 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt; First is the child’s right to education on the basis equal opportunity ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art28 article 28]). This includes the right to free primary education and to accessible secondary and higher education. Second are the child’s rights in education (articles [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art2 2], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art12 12], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art13 13], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art14 14], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art15 15], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art19 19]). This includes the right to non-discrimination, participation, protection from abuse and violence, and freedom of thought, expression, and religion. Third are the child’s rights through education (article [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art29 29] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm#art42 42]). This refers to education where children are able to know and understand their rights and to develop respect for human rights, including their own human rights.

This third track of education spells an obligation by countries and education authorities to provide for children’s human rights education. Article 29 of the Convention requires that 'the education of the child shall be directed to the development of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.' This presumes knowledge and understanding of rights. Article 42 requires that countries 'undertake to make the principles of the Convention widely known, by appropriate and active means, to adults and children alike.'

Mindful of this duty of disseminating knowledge and recognizing its importance, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the UN body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Convention, has repeatedly urged countries to incorporate children’s rights into the school curricula and ensure that children know and understand their rights on a systematic and comprehensive basis.&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=un&gt;United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (1991). ''General Guidelines Regarding the Form and Content of Initial Reports.'' CRC/C/5. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hodgkin&gt;Hodgkin, R., and Newell, P. (1998). ''Implementation handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child.'' New York: UNICEF.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value of children’s human rights education==
Children’s rights education in schools has value because it fulfills the obligations of countries to respect the rights of the child and implement the provisions of the Convention. But beyond the fulfillment of a legal obligation, children’s rights education has value for children. Felisa Tibbitts has suggested that child rights education can be expected to affect learners in three ways.&lt;ref name=tibbitts&gt;Tibbitts, F. (1997). ''An Annotated Primer for Selecting Democratic and Human Rights Education Teaching Materials.'' Amsterdam: Open Society Institute/Human Rights education Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  First is in the providing of basic information and knowledge on the nature of rights and the specific rights that children are to enjoy. Children can be expected to have a more accurate and deeper understanding of rights. Second is in attitudes, values, and behaviors consistent with the understanding of rights. Children can be expected to have greater respect for the rights of others as shown in their attitudes and behaviors. Third is in empowering children to take action in support of the rights of others. Tibbitts refers to this as the 'transformational model' of rights education. Children here are more likely to take a stand in preventing or redressing human rights abuses. An example would be to support a victim of [[bullying]] and stand up against a bully in the school playground.

Research by Katherine Covell and R. Brian Howe&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130405010253/http://www.cbu.ca/crc/ Katherine Covell and R. Brian Howe]&lt;/ref&gt; (see the section on evaluations of children’s human rights education) shows evidence of the above effects.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (1999). "The Impact of Children’s Rights Education: A Canadian study." ''International Journal of Children’s Rights,'' 7, 171-183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moral&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (2001).

"'If there’s a dead rat, don’t leave it.' Young children's understanding of their citizenship rights and responsibilities." ''Cambridge Journal of Education,'' 38 (3), 321-339.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to children who have not received children’s rights education, children who have received children's rights education are more likely to have an accurate and adult-like understanding of rights, to understand that rights and responsibilities are related, and to display socially responsible behaviors in support of the rights of others.

==Implementation of children’s human rights education==

===Early initiatives===
Including Janusz Korczak and his rights based Warsaw orphanage, Homer Lane and his Little Commonwealth (1913) of delinquent 'prisoners', A.S. Neill's Summerhill School (1921) there have been many schools and children's communities around the world that have been founded on the rights of children. Indeed, inspired by Montessori, Homer Lane and Harriet Finley Johnson, a community of teachers, educationalists, suffragists, politicians, inspectors and cultural contributors formed a community called the  New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/New-Ideals-in-Education-Conferences-386690128169894/?ref=bookmarks New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914-37)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newman movement"/&gt; Their founding value was 'the liberation of the child' and they sought, shared and celebrated examples of practice in schools, prisons and child communities. They contributed to the 'child centred' primary school.&lt;ref&gt;Selleck, R.J.W. (1972) English Primary Education and the Progressives, 1914-1939, p156 Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul London and Boston {{ISBN|0710072082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been an overlooked history of the culture of the rights of the child, one that needs to be shared and celebrated to help empower children and those adults who work with them. &lt;!-- (Commenting this out for now, as it's a non sequitur. If you can add some context as to why this is pertinent to the topic, please do. Thanks!) The autobiographical novel by A.S. Neill, ''[[A Dominie's Log]]'' (1915), is a diary of a headteacher trying to liberate his children as the First World War begins.--&gt;

Since the approval by the United Nations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989, various efforts have been made to provide children's rights education in schools.&lt;ref name=empower /&gt;&lt;ref name=educate&gt;Howe, R.B., and Covell, K. (2013). ''Education in the Best Interests of the Child: A Children’s Rights Perspective on Closing the Achievement Gap.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiatives have been undertaken mainly at the level of individual classrooms and schools. Among the earliest initiatives was one in a primary school in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=belgium&gt;DeCoene, J., and  De Cock, R. (1996). "The Children's Rights Project in the Primary School 'De vrijdagmarkt' in Bruges. In E. Verhellen (Ed.), ''Monitoring children’s rights.'' (pp. 627-636). The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a comprehensive child rights education project that was introduced in the early 1990s at De Vrijdagmarkt Primary School. It involved children ages 3 to 12 with the objective of educating them about the contents of the Convention, using democratic [[pedagogy]] and ensuring child participation in the learning process. Children were taught about their rights under the Convention through a variety of media including art and poetry. Art activities included newspaper collages representing examples of rights violations. Allowance was made for child-initiated and small group activities, role-play, and group discussion. Activities that were selected were ones of relevance and interest to the children. Younger children, for example, learned about the right to food by creating a very large doll with illustrations of food. Older children engaged in discussions and role-play regarding rights to [[adoption]], education, and family.

Further examples of early initiatives were in classrooms in [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]], [[Canada]], in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt; [[Curriculum]] materials based on the Convention were developed in collaboration with children and their teachers for three grade levels. At the grade 6 level (children aged 11 to 13 years), education focused on introducing child rights in terms of their relevance to the individual child. Issues included healthy living, personal safety, families and family life, drug use, and decision-making. For example, to learn about their right to protection from [[narcotics]], students role-played children and drug dealers and examined ways of dealing with pressure to try or sell drugs. At the grade 8 level (ages 13 to 15 years), the focus was on relationships of relevance to the child. The curriculum included units on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Youth justice in Canada|youth justice]], [[child abuse]], and exploitation. For example, students analyzed popular song lyrics to discuss how rights in sexuality are represented in music, and they completed cartoons that involved the competing considerations of freedom of speech and rights against [[discrimination]].  The grade 12 curriculum (for ages 17 to 19) expanded the sphere of children’s rights knowledge with application to global issues. These issues included war-affected children and [[child labor]]. At this level, activities included holding a mock UN Conference on war-affected children where small groups had responsibility for representing the players at the conference, and a [[sweatshop]] talk show in which groups researched child labor and then held a talk show to discuss their findings.

===Hampshire, England===
Writings about the initiative in Cape Breton schools inspired a major initiative in [[Hampshire|Hampshire County]], [[England]], called Rights, Respect and Responsibility or the RRR initiative. It is among the best known and most promising models of children’s human rights education to date.&lt;ref name=implement /&gt;&lt;ref name=rrr&gt;Covell, K., and Howe, R.B. (2008). "Rights, Respect and Responsibility: Final Report on the County of Hampshire Rights Education Initiative." Available at:  {{cite web |url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/education/childrensrights/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106212258/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/childrensrights/ |archivedate=2012-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an initiative that features not only individual classrooms and schools but a whole school district. The RRR initiative was impelled by the recognition among senior education administrators in Hampshire of the need for a shared values framework and positive school climate for improved learning and educational outcomes. They also were motivated by their reading of the success of the rights education project in Cape Breton.

After study leave in Cape Breton, a group of Hampshire administrators and teachers decided to pilot test and then launch their own version of child rights education in Hampshire. After successful pilot testing in 2002, they officially launched RRR in 2004.&lt;ref name=hants&gt;Hampshire Education Authority (2003). "The case for RRR." Available at: {{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/hias/childrensrights/rrrthecase.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121223170331/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/education/hias/childrensrights/rrrthecase.htm |archivedate=2012-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To put the objectives of RRR into effect, Hampshire authorities—with funding from the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]]—devised a three-year strategic plan of implementation. This included provisions for teacher training, development of resources, and monitoring of developments. The plan was that the initiative would first be introduced in infant, primary, and junior schools and then over time, as children went into higher grades, it would be introduced in secondary schools. By 2012, in varying degrees of implementation, the majority of Hampshire schools were participating in RRR.

The overall objective of RRR was to improve educational outcomes for children by transforming school cultures, building a shared values framework based on the Convention, and promoting educational practices consistent with the Convention. Knowledge and understanding of rights, respect, and social responsibility were to provide the values framework for all school policies, classroom practices, codes of conduct, mission statements, school regulations, and school curricula. The framework was to be put into effect across the whole school – across classrooms, across grade levels, across curricula, and across school practices. Of particular importance, consistent with children’s participation rights as described in article 12 of the Convention, behavior codes, rules, and regulations were to be developed in collaboration with the children, classroom teaching was to be democratic, and children were to be provided with numerous meaningful opportunities to participate in all aspects of school functioning.

===New Zealand===
Initiatives in Cape Breton and Hampshire have influenced developments in other schools, school districts, and even countries. Among the more ambitious developments have been seen in [[New Zealand]] where efforts are underway to make children’s human rights education a nationwide initiative. The context for the initiative is favorable. A strong human rights theme runs through New Zealand’s Education Act, national education goals, and national administrative guidelines.  In the early 2000s, initial discussions about incorporating children’s rights education into the New Zealand curriculum were given momentum by the evidence provided from the Cape Breton and Hampshire County initiatives.&lt;ref name=hrie&gt;HRiE., (2009).  "Human Rights in Education, 2009 Report." Available at: http://www.rightsined.org.nz {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029140555/http://www.rightsined.org.nz/ |date=2012-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like elsewhere, educators and human rights advocates in New Zealand had been concerned with poor achievement levels, bullying, and violent behaviors that are observed among a significant minority of children in schools. And also like elsewhere, teachers and administrators have been frustrated by the range of difficult demands in schools, the fragmentation of efforts to address common problems, and the disappointing results of those efforts. Learning about successes in the Cape Breton and Hampshire initiatives, the collaborative initiative Human Rights in Education/Mana Tika Tangata (HRiE) was formed. Its aim was to develop positive school cultures on the basis of the rights of the child and to improve achievement for all children through having schools and early childhood education centers become learning communities that know, promote, and live human rights and responsibilities.
 
To achieve this goal, HRiE has been following the Hampshire model in using children’s rights as an overarching and integrating values framework for teaching, learning, and school management and organization. All members of the school community – school leadership, teachers and other staff, students, boards of trustees, and parents – learn about children’s rights and the responsibilities that go with them. They recognize that every member of the school community has the right to be treated with dignity and to participate in effective education. Students are formally recognized as citizens of the school and country with explicit rights and responsibilities. They participate in decision-making across the school, and rights are embedded across the curriculum, school practices, and policies.

===Initiatives with preschool===
Children's rights education initiatives also have occurred at the preschool level. For example, Canadian educators Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn introduced rights education to an early childhood program group of 3 and 4 year-old children in [[British Columbia]] over a three-month period.&lt;ref name=wallberg&gt;Wallberg, P., and  Kahn, M. (2011). "The Rights Project: How rights education transformed a classroom." ''Canadian Children,'' 36 (1), 31-35.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of "The Rights Project" was motivated in large part by observations of the children’s self-focus and disregard for the feelings of their peers. Using a coloring book designed to teach very young children about their rights, the teachers hoped to shift the children’s focus from individual wants to community needs – to increase levels of cooperation, altruism, and empathy.

==Evaluations of children’s human rights education==
The earliest reported evaluation of a child rights education project was that of the initiative in Bruges.&lt;ref name=belgium /&gt; Involving children ages 3 to 12, the primary focus of the evaluation was on the students’ social behavior. Gains in social understanding, respectful behaviors, concern for others, and pro-social action were the key observed changes. For example, the children became more interested in social justice and rights-related issues such as peace, war, injustice, and hunger. And they wanted to discuss the rights of marginalized children – those living with disabilities, in institutions, and of ethnic minority status.

Similar outcomes were found in evaluations of the effects of children’s rights education in Cape Breton schools. Evaluations conducted on students in grades 6 and 8 (ages 12 and 14 years) showed improved [[classroom climate]], engagement, and behavior.&lt;ref name=impact /&gt;&lt;ref name=moral /&gt; At the grade 6 level differences were found in children’s understanding of rights, their acceptance of minority children, and their perceived levels of peer and teacher support. Teachers reported improved behavior and more positive classroom climate. In addition at the grade 8 level, children in rights-based classes showed increases in their self-esteem. Similar child-initiated projects to those reported from Bruges were seen also.  For example, at one school upon realizing that not every child in the area was assured their right to nutritious food, the students initiated a breakfast program by obtaining cooperation and donations from the local community. In a different school, the class decided to work at a local [[food bank]] to help children whose families were unable to provide sufficient nutritious food.

Anecdotal data from the teachers who used the grade 12 curriculum described how engaged their students were in the activities, and noted improvements in their students’ appreciation of global problems, and of the complexity and importance of respecting human rights. Students who had participated in the project completed a survey. The results showed them to be three times more likely than their peers to understand humanitarian assistance for children in difficult circumstances as a fundamental human right.

The most comprehensive evaluation data are of the Hampshire RRR initiative.&lt;ref name=dead /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp6&gt;Covell, K., McNeil, J.K, and  Howe, R.B. (2009). "Reducing teacher burnout by increasing student engagement." ''School Psychology International,'' 30 (3), 282-290.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=implement /&gt;&lt;ref name=comp1&gt;Covell, K., and  Howe, R.B. (2011) "Rights, Respect and Responsibility in Hampshire County RRR and Resilience Report." Available at http://www3.hants.gov.uk/hampshire-rrr-resilience-full-report-2011.doc{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp2&gt;Covell, K, Howe, R.B., and Polegato, J. (2011). "Children’s human rights education as a counter to social disadvantage: A case study from England." ''Educational Research,'' 53,(2), 193- 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp3&gt;Howe, R.B., and Covell, K., (2010). "Miseducating children about their rights." ''Education, Citizenship and Social Justice,'' 5 (2), 91-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comp5&gt;Covell, K. (2010). "School engagement and rights-respecting schools." ''Cambridge Journal of Education,'' 40 (1), 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Annual assessments over six years were conducted to assess the effects of the RRR. Included were children ages 4 – 14. Children and teachers in schools where RRR had been fully implemented were compared with those in demographically equivalent schools without RRR.  These comparisons showed the following effects of RRR. Across ages, children showed a greater understanding of rights and their relation to responsibilities, increased levels of self-regulation, confidence, effort and motivation, participation and engagement in school, and achievement. These cognitive and attitudinal changes were reflected in significant improvements in behaviors. Children were reported by both their classroom teachers and the school principal to be more respectful, cooperative, inclusive and sensitive to the needs of other children. Incidents of bullying were reduced dramatically with disagreements being resolved using the discourse of rights rather than through physical or verbal aggression.

Teaching in RRR schools also led to changes in the teachers. School administrators noted significant changes in teachers use of democratic teaching and positive classroom management, and in less confrontational dealings with their students. Teachers were listening to children and taking their views into account. And the greater the level of student engagement and participation, the more teachers showed gains in a sense of personal achievement and significant decreases in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.

Among all the positive findings of the evaluation of the RRR, the most intriguing was that at each time of measure the most disadvantaged school showed the greatest positive changes.&lt;ref name=comp2 /&gt; Improvements in engagement, behavior and academic achievement were remarkable, and have been attributed to how the RRR transformed the culture of the school. The evidence suggests that schools that are fully consistent with the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child can mediate the effects of a challenging environment of rearing and help close the achievement gap between disadvantaged children and their more advantaged peers.&lt;ref name=educate /&gt;

==Other evaluations==
Although no formal evaluation has yet been published on the New Zealand initiative, anecdotal evidence suggests the outcomes are comparable to those reported from Hampshire.&lt;ref name=hrie /&gt; Teachers report improved learning environments and decreased stress.  "Makes me think critically about some of the things I do in my classroom", a teacher reported, "especially some of the aspects of my behavior management." Another stressed that she has "had fabulous response from the children."

Evaluation data from Pamela Wallberg and Maria Kahn show that their preschool rights project was highly successful.&lt;ref name=wallberg /&gt; They found that teaching young children about their Convention rights in an age-appropriate way transformed the learning environment. As classroom rules were replaced with rights, less adult control was needed and group conversations changed from chaotic chatter to the respectful exchange of ideas. The children’s behavior toward each other changed markedly. Their interactions reflected an understanding of the universality of rights and the importance of protecting the rights of others. And even at this very young age, rights discourse replaced arguing; for example, "you are hurting my right to play" became an effective problem solver that replaced tears and fighting. Wallberg and Kahn conclude that the children’s recognition of the relationship between rights and responsibilities shifted their focus "from 'me' to 'we'."

'''Communication design''' is a mixed discipline between [[design]] and information-development which is concerned with how [[media (communication)|media]] intervention such as [[printing|printed]], [[craft]]ed, [[electronic media]] or [[presentations]] communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the [[message]] aside from the [[aesthetic]]s in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Some designers use [[graphic design]] and communication design interchangeably due to overlapping skills.

Communication design can also refer to a systems-based approach, in which the totality of media and messages within a culture or organization are designed as a single integrated process rather than a series of discrete efforts. This is done through communication channels that aim to inform and attract the attention of the people one are focusing one's skills on. Design skills must be tailored to fit to different cultures of people, while maintaining pleasurable visual design.

Within the discipline of Communication, a framework for Communication as Design has emerged that focuses on redesigning interactivity and shaping communication [[Affordance|affordances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aakhus|first=Mark|date=2007-03-01|title=Communication as Design|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637750701196383|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=74|issue=1|pages=112–117|doi=10.1080/03637750701196383|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software and applications create opportunities for and place constraints on communication. Recently, Guth and Brabham examined the way that ideas compete within a [[crowdsourcing]] platform, providing a model about the relationships among design ideas, communication, and platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guth|first=Kristen L.|last2=Brabham|first2=Daren C.|date=2017-08-04|title=Finding the diamond in the rough: Exploring communication and platform in crowdsourcing performance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637751.2017.1359748|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–24|doi=10.1080/03637751.2017.1359748|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors have interviewed technology company founders about the democratic ideals they build into the design of [[e-government]] applications and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brabham|first=Daren C.|last2=Guth|first2=Kristen L.|date=2017-08-01|title=The Deliberative Politics of the Consultative Layer: Participation Hopes and Communication as Design Values of Civic Tech Founders|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12316/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=67|issue=4|pages=445–475|doi=10.1111/jcom.12316|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the Communication as Design framework is growing among researchers. 

==Overview==
Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic [[business]] thinking, using [[market research]], [[creativity]], and [[problem-solving]]. Communications designers translate ideas and information through a variety of media. Their particular talent lies not only in the traditional skills of the hand, but also in their ability to think strategically in design and marketing terms, in order to establish credibility through the communication.

The term communication design is often used interchangeably with [[visual communication]], but has an alternative broader meaning that includes [[Auditory system|auditory]], vocal, touch and smell. Examples of communication design include [[information architecture]], [[editing]], [[typography]], [[illustration]], [[web design]], [[animation]], [[advertising]], [[ambient media]], [[Brand management|visual identity design]], [[performing arts]], [[copywriting]] and [[professional writing]] skills applied in the [[creative industries]].

==Education==
Students of communication design learn how to create visual messages and broadcast them to the world in new and meaningful ways. In the complex [[digital environment]] around us, communication design has become a powerful means of reaching out to the [[target audience]]. Students learn how to combine communication with [[art]] and [[technology]]. Communication Design discipline involves teaching how to design [[Web page|web pages]], [[Video game|video games]], [[animation]], [[motion graphics]] and more.

Communication Design has content as its main purpose. It must achieve a reaction, or get customer to see a product in a genuine way to attract sales or get across a message. Students of Communications Design are often Illustrators, Graphic Designers, Web designers, Advertising artists, Animators, Video Editors or Motion graphic artists, or even printmakers and conceptual artists. The term Communications Design is fairly general and practitioners work in various mediums to get a message across.

===Visual design===

'''Visual design''' is the [[design]] working in any media or support of [[visual communication]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno Munari|MUNARI, Bruno]]. '''Design and visual communication'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38110">'''Comprehensive sex education (CSE)''' is a [[sex education]] instruction method based on-curriculum that aims to give students the knowledge, attitudes, skills and values to make appropriate and healthy choices in their sexual lives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: an evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The intention is that this understanding will prevent students from contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] in the future, including [[HIV]] and [[HPV]]. CSE is also designed with the intention of reducing teenage and unwanted pregnancies, as well as lowering rates of domestic and [[sexual violence]], thus contributing to a healthier society, both physically and mentally.&lt;ref name="Loeber 2010 169–176"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeber|first=O.|author2=Reuter, S. |author3=Apter, van der Doef |author4=Lazdane, Pinter |title=Aspects of sexuality education in Europe – definitions, differences and developments|journal=European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care|date=June 2010|volume=15|issue=3|pages=169–176|pmid=20465399|doi=10.3109/13625181003797280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehensive sex education ultimately promotes [[sexual abstinence]] as the safest sexual choice for young people. However, CSE curriculums and teachers are still committed to teaching students about topics connected to future sexual activity, such as [[age of consent]], [[safe sex]], [[Birth control|contraception]] such as: [[birth control]], [[abortion]], and use of [[condoms]].&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubenstein|first=Rachel|date=January 1, 2017|title=Sex Education: Funding Facts, Not Fear|url=http://p8888-ucelinks.cdlib.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/sfx_local?genre=article&amp;atitle=Sex%20Education%3A%20Funding%20Facts%2C%20Not%20Fear%20%5Bnotes%5D&amp;title=Health%20Matrix:%20Journal%20of%20Law-Medicine&amp;issn=0748383X&amp;isbn=&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=&amp;date=20170101&amp;aulast=Rubenstein,%20Rachel&amp;spage=525&amp;pages=&amp;sid=EBSCO:HeinOnline:hein.journals.hmax27.19#|journal=Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine.|volume=27|pages=525–553|via=MasterFILE Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This also includes discussions which promote safe behaviors, such as communicating with partners and seeking testing for sexually transmitted infections. Additionally, comprehensive sex education curricula may include discussions surrounding pregnancy outcomes such as parenting, adoption, and abortion.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; The most widely agreed benefit of using comprehensive sex education over [[abstinence-only sex education]] is that CSE acknowledges the student population will be sexually active in their future. By acknowledging this, CSE can encourage students to plan ahead to make the healthiest possible sexual decisions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education|title=Comprehensive sexuality education|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unfpa.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology of arming students to most successfully survive their future sexual experiences underlies the majority of topics within CSE, including condoms, contraception, and refusal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclunc.org/docs/executive_summary_-_2003_statewide_school_district_survey.pdf|title=Sex Education in California Public Schools: Are Students Learning What They Need to Know?|last=Burlingame|first=Julianne|date=August 2003|website=www.aclu.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of CSE ==
Studies have found that comprehensive sex education is more effective than receiving no instruction and/or those who receive abstinence-only instruction.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Acknowledging that people may engage in premarital sex rather than ignoring it (which abstinence-only is often criticized for) allows educators to give the students the necessary information to safely navigate their future sexual lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|title=Comprehensive Sex Education: Research and Results|date=2010-12-08|website=advocatesforyouth.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208154235/http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|archive-date=December 8, 2010|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

CSE advocates argue that promoting abstinence without accompanied information regarding safe sex practices is a disregard of reality, and is ultimately putting the student at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|title=Comprehensive Sex Education and Academic Success|date=2015-02-26|website=www.futureofsexed.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226100613/http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|archive-date=February 26, 2015|deadurl=yes|access-date=2016-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, programs funded under AEGP are reviewed for compliance with the 8 standards (listed below in "Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements), but are not screened for medical accuracy. Therefore, critics believe that students under these educational programs are put at a disadvantage because it prevents them from making informed choices about their sexual health. Additionally, under these AEGP programs, health educators have referred to those that engage in sex, especially females, as "dirty" and "used." They have also used phrases such as "stay like a new toothbrush, wrapped up and unused"  and "chewed-up gum" to teach abstinence. Under a CSE model, language would be more sensitive.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

There is clear evidence that CSE has a positive impact on sexual and reproductive health (SRH), notably in contributing to reducing [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]], HIV and [[unintended pregnancy]]. Sexuality education does not hasten sexual activity but has a positive impact on safer sexual behaviours and can delay sexual debut.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2009. ''International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education: An Evidence-informed approach for schools, teachers and health educators''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001832/183281e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review of school-based sexuality education programmes has demonstrated increased HIV knowledge, increased self-efficacy related to condom use and refusing sex, increased contraception and condom use, a reduced number of sexual partners and later initiation of first sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Fonner et al. 2014. ''School based sex education and HIV prevention in low and middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis''. PLoS ONE 9(3): e89692. Doi: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal&lt;/nowiki&gt;. pone.0089692&lt;/ref&gt; A Cochrane review of 41 randomized controlled trials in Europe, the United States, Nigeria and Mexico also confirmed that CSE prevents unintended adolescent pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Oringanje, C. et al. 2009. ''Interventions for preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents''. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt; CSE is very beneficial in regards to teen pregnancy because studies show that, teen pregnancy and childbearing have a significant negative impact on high school success and completion, as well as future job prospects.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; A study in Kenya, involving more than 6,000 students who had received sexuality education led to delayed sexual initiation, and increased condom use among those who were sexually active once these students reached secondary school compared to more than 6,000 students who did not receive sexuality education.&lt;ref&gt;Maticka-Tyndale, E. 2010. A multi-level model of condom use among male and female upper primary school students in Nyanza, Kenya. Soc Sci Med, Aug 5, Vol. 71, No. 3, pp. 616–25. Epub 2010, May 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; CSE also reduces the frequency of sex and the number of partners which in turn also reduces the rates of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

[[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]] and the [[African Union]] have recognized CSE’s impact on increasing condom use, voluntary HIV testing and reducing pregnancy among adolescent girls and have included comprehensive, age-appropriate sexuality education as one of the key recommendations to fast track the HIV response and end the AIDS epidemic among young women and girls in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;UNAIDS and the African Union. 2015. ''Empower Young Women and Adolescent Girls: Fast tracking the end of the AIDS epidemic in Africa''. Geneva, UNAIDS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As the field of sexuality education develops, there is increasing focus on addressing gender, power relations and human rights in order to improve the impact on SRH outcomes. Integrating content on gender and rights makes sexuality education even more effective.&lt;ref&gt;UNFPA. 2014a. ''Operational Guidance for Comprehensive Sexuality Education: A focus on human rights and gender''. New York, UNFPA. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/&lt;/nowiki&gt; les/pub-pdf/UNFPA%20Operational%20Guidance%20for%20 CSE%20-Final%20WEB%20Version.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A review of 22 curriculum- based sexuality education programmes found that 80 per cent of programmes that addressed gender or power relations were associated with a significant decrease in pregnancy, childbearing or STIs. These programmes were five times as effective as those programmes that did not address gender or power.&lt;ref&gt;Haberland, N.A. 2015. The case for addressing gender and power in sexuality and HIV education: A comprehensive review of evaluation studies. ''International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health'', Vol. 41, No. 1, pp. 31–42. https:// www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4103115.html&lt;/ref&gt; CSE empowers young people to reflect critically on their environment and behaviours, and promotes gender equality and equitable social norms, which are important contributing factors for improving health outcomes, including HIV infection rates. The impact of CSE also increases when delivered together with efforts to expand access to a full range of high- quality, youth-friendly services and commodities, particularly in relation to contraceptive choice.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2011a. ''School-Based Sexuality Education Programmes. A cost and cost-effectiveness analysis in six countries''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/&lt;/nowiki&gt; leadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/pdf/CostingStudy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A global review of evidence in the education sector also found that teaching sexuality education builds confidence,&lt;ref&gt;Unterhalter, E., North, A., Arnot, M., Lloyd, C., Moletsane, L., Murphy-Graham, E., Parkes, J. and Saito, M. 2014. ''Interventions to enhance girls’ education and gender equality''. Education Rigorous Literature Review. London, Department for International Development. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://r4d.d&lt;/nowiki&gt; d.gov.uk/pdf/outputs/HumanDev_evidence/Girls_Education_Literature_ Review_2014_Unterhalter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a necessary skill for delaying the age that young people first engage in sexual intercourse, and for using contraception, including condoms. CSE has a demonstrated impact on improving knowledge, self-esteem, changing attitudes, gender and social norms, and building self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Criticism of CSE ==

=== How comprehensive is CSE ===
While CSE implementation is on the rise in the United States, it remains difficult for state officials to regulate what is and is not taught in the classroom. This is due in large part to the undefinability of CSE; CSE has the potential to comprise such a wide range of sexual information, and over-all focus varies widely between curriculums.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educators have also accused CSE as fundamentally operating as a form of "abstinence-plus," due to the reality that CSE often involves minimal body related information and excessive promotions of abstinence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Ed for Caring Schools Creating an Ethics-Based Curriculum|last=Lamb|first=Sharon|publisher=Teachers College Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "So-called Comprehensive Sex Ed" says Sharon Lamb, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, "has been made less comprehensive as curricula are revised to meet current federal, state, and local requirements."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== LGBTQIA+ community not included CSE ====
The term "comprehensive" is also often misleading because some comprehensive programs do not show the holistic picture of human sexuality.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curvino|first=Melissa and Meghan Grizzle Fischer|date=April 21, 2015|title=Claiming Comprehensive Sex Education is a Right Does Not Make it So|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=16&amp;sid=e0097ff0-d647-4666-83a3-1229b73b3d13%40sessionmgr120|journal=The New Bioethics|volume=20|issue=1|pages=72–98|via=Taylor and Francis Online|pmid=24979877}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT|LGBTQIA+]] advocates have long been critical of the ways in which comprehensive sex education generally promotes marriage as the end goal for students. Even when curriculums claim to be inclusive of LGBT experiences, they often promote heteronormative lifestyles as "normal." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erevelles|first=Nirmala|date=2011|title=Coming Out Crip in Inclusive Education|url=|journal=Teachers College Record|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusion of LGBT identities and health topics is necessary for LGBTQIA+ students to feel safe and seen in their sex ed classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Risky Lessons|last=Fields|first=Jessica|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these students do not have access to or an interest in marriage they are practically erased from the CSE narrative. 

A cross sectional study done in New York City analyzed the sexual behaviors of high school girls. Studies found that, "high school girls who identified as LGBTQIA+ were more likely to report substance use such as: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth, ecstasy and prescription drugs. They also had higher rates of contemplating and/or attempting suicide."&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobel M.D|first=Chanelle et. al|date=August 2017|title=Description of Sexual Orientation and Sexual Behaviors among High School Girls in New York City|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/science/article/pii/S1083318817300980?via%3Dihub|journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology|volume=30|issue=4|pages=460–465|via=Elsevier ScienceDirect|pmid=28279826|doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2017.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that "the LGBTQIA+ youth accesses health information online five times more than the [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] population, and these rates are even higher for LGBTQIA+ youth that identify as a person of color which stems from the fact that they lack health resources. &lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manduley|first=Aida, et al|date=February 8, 2018|title=The role of social media in sex education: Dispatches from queer, trans, and racialized communities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/abs/10.1177/0959353517717751|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|volume=28|pages=152–170|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0959353517717751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, as of May 2018, only 12 states require discussion of sexual orientation and of these, only 9 states require that discussion of sexual orientation be inclusive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education|title=State Laws and Policies Regarding Sex and HIV Education|last=|first=|date=2018-05-01|website=|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, several states have passed legislation that bans teachers from discussing gay and transgender issues, such as sexual health and HIV/AIDS awareness, in a positive light.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Furthermore, three states require that teachers only portray LGBTQIA+ people in a negative light.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a Canada, a federal report showed that LGBTQIA+ community has less access to health services and faces more comprehensive health challenges compared to the general population. As a result of lack of support for the LGBTQIA+ population, the Comprehensive Health Education Workers (CHEW) Project emerged in October 2014. Their goal is to educate the LGBTQIA+ community  about topics such  sexual and gender identity, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), healthy social relationships, and depression. They do this though workshops, arts‐based projects, and one‐on‐one meetings.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lévesque|first=Michel|date=November 29, 2017|title=The Comprehensive Health Education Workers Project and Caring Professionals as Asset‐Builders|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/full/10.1002/nha3.20200|journal=New Horizons in Adult Education and Human Resource Development|volume=29|issue=4|pages=51–55|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/nha3.20200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Who's role is it to deliver sexual education ===
Many people regard health education as a moral or religious issue, and therefore should be taught not in schools.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; "Before the late 1800s, delivering sex education in the United States and Canada was primarily seen as a parent’s responsibility.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Today, programs under the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) begin comprehensive sex education in pre-kindergarten, which many people believe is not age appropriate.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Many of those in favor of abstinence only education, usually fear any type of sexual education that encourages sexual behavior at a young age.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Is it necessary ===
Although CSE is seen as the polar opposite of abstinence only education, some critics believe that they are very similar. They both aim at preventing STIs and teen pregnancy. The only way in which they differ is through their primary goal. Abstinence only education aims at reducing premarital sex while comprehensive sex education acknowledges that premarital sex may happen and therefore seeks to reduce the unintended consequences of premarital sex through education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Studies in developing counties surrounding sex education have also shown that comprehensive sex education is not needed. General education, such as literacy skills, was seen to delay sexual initiation and reduced the likelihood of pregnancy. Therefore, some people believe general education is of more importance.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== Federal funding for sexual education ==
Although there is no federal mandate that requires states to teach sexual education, there is federal funding available to assist with sexual education programs.&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malone|first=Patrick and Monica Rodriguez|date=Spring 2011|title=Comprehensive Sex Education vs. Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage Programs|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/23032415|journal=Human Rights|volume=38|pages=5-22|via=JSTOR Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) ===
Historically, funding for abstinence education has always been favored over CSE. In 1996, during Bill Clinton's presidency, legislation was passed to promote abstinence in education programs. Under Title V Section 510 of the Social Security Act, the Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP), was passed. AEGP has always been renewed before its expiration date, and each time funds gradually increase from fifty million dollars per year to seventy-five and as high as $6.75 million per state grant in 2015. The way the funds are disbursed are based on the proportion of low-income children in each state. So far, thirty-six states have been given AEGP funds.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

==== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements ====
Part of Section 510(b) of Title V of the Social Security Act, contains the "A-H guidelines," which are the eight criteria that programs must abide by order to be eligible to receive federal funding.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; They are as follows:

A. Has as its exclusive purpose teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;

B. Teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school-age children;

C. Teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;&lt;p&gt;D. Teaches that a mutually faithful, monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of sexual activity;&lt;/p&gt;E. Teaches that sexual activity outside the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;

F. Teaches that bearing children out of wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, and society;&lt;p&gt;G. Teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increase vulnerability to sexual advances; and&lt;/p&gt;H. Teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

In addition to abiding by these 8 conditions, AGEP compliant programs cannot discuss contraception, STIs, or methods for protecting against STIs, except only when describing failure rates.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP) ===
More recently legislation has pushed for funding that goes beyond abstinence only education.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; In 2010, President Obama introduced the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP),  which provides a total of $114.5 million annually to sex education programs that are "medically accurate and age-appropriate."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; TPP falls under a subsection of United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") which is overseen by the Office of Adolescent Health. Funding for TPP is dispersed if "they emulate specific evidence-based programs promulgated under TPP."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; 

=== California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act ===
In January 2016, the California Healthy Youth Act, amended the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act to include minority groups and expand health education. Before it authorized schools to provide comprehensive sex education and required that all materials are made accessible to students with a variety of needs. It also focused solely on marital relationships. It now mandates that schools provide comprehensive sex education and states that "materials cannot be biased and must be appropriate for students of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as well as those with disabilities and English language learners." Additionally, education must now include "instruction about forming healthy and respectful committed relationships," regardless if marital status. Furthermore, it is now required to have discussions about all FDA-approved contraceptive methods in preventing pregnancy, including the morning after pill.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

In conclusion now requires that all sex education programs promulgated in the state should&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

*normalize sexuality as part of human development;
*ensure people receive integrated, comprehensive, accurate, and unbiased sexual health and HIV prevention and  instruction; and
*provide pupils with the knowledge and skills to have healthy, positive, and safe relationships.

== CSE as a human right ==
Some critics state that young people’s access to CSE is grounded in internationally recognized [[human rights]], which require governments to guarantee the overall protection of health, well-being and dignity, as per the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration on Human Rights]], and specifically to guarantee the provision of unbiased, scientifically accurate sexuality education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002431/243106e.pdf|title=Emerging evidence, lessons and practice in comprehensive sexuality education: A global review 2015|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100139-0|location=|pages=14, 15, 25, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights are protected by internationally ratified treaties, and lack of access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) education remains a barrier to complying with the obligations to ensure the rights to life, health, non-discrimination and information, a view that has been supported by the Statements of the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) Committee, and the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The commitment of individual states to realizing these rights has been reaffirmed by the international community, in particular the [[Commission on Population and Development]] (CPD), which – in its resolutions 2009/12 and 2012/13 – called on governments to provide young people with comprehensive education on human sexuality, SRH and [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other analysis show that comprehensive sex education is not an international right nor a human right because it not clearly stated in either a treaty nor custom. By international law, states are required to provide access to information and education about reproductive health, but this does not require a sex education curriculum. It may take different forms such as mandating that local school districts create a system for providing information to students, or mandating that health clinics and practitioners dispense information to patients.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== CSE in curricula ==

=== CSE teaching methods ===
As CSE gains momentum and interest at international, regional and national levels, governments are increasingly putting in place measures to scale-up their delivery of some form of life skills-based sexuality education, as well as seeking guidance on best practice, particularly regarding placement within the school [[curriculum]]. Sexuality education may be delivered as a stand-alone subject or integrated across relevant subjects within the school curricula. These options have direct implications for implementation, including teacher training, the ease of evaluating and revising curricula, the likelihood of curricula being delivered, and the methods through which it is delivered.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Within countries, choices about implementing integrated or stand-alone sexuality education are typically linked to national policies and overall organization of the curricula. The evidence base on the effectiveness of stand-alone vs. integrated sexuality education programming is still limited. However, there are discernible differences for policy-makers to consider when deciding the position of CSE within the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As a stand-alone subject, sexuality education is set apart from the rest of the curriculum, whether on its own or within a broader stand-alone health and life skills curriculum. This makes it more vulnerable to potentially being sacrificed due to time and budget constraints, since school curricula are typically overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

However, a stand-alone curriculum also presents opportunities for specialized teacher training pathways, and the use of non-formal teaching methodologies that aim to build learners’ critical thinking skills. The pedagogical approaches promoted through sexuality education – such as learner-centred methodologies, development of skills and values, group learning and peer engagement – are increasingly being recognized as transformative approaches that impact on learning and education more widely. As a standalone subject, it is also significantly easier to monitor, which is crucial in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of programming, and revising curricula where it is not delivering the desired learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

When sexuality education is integrated or infused, it is mainstreamed across a number of subject areas, such as biology, social studies, home economics or religious studies. While this model may reduce pressure on an overcrowded curriculum, it is difficult to monitor or evaluate, and may limit teaching methodologies to traditional approaches.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== CSE terminology ===
Apart from the different teaching methods, termiology also differs. Abortion, homosexuality, abstinence have connotations and definitions that vary state. For example, the word "abstinence" may refer to disengaging from all forms of sexual activities until marriage or may refer to only disengaging from sexual intercourse. Furthermore, the degree of sexual activity that "abstinence" connotates is often unclear, because sexual behavior that is not sexual intercourse may or may not be included in its definition. As a result, students are left confused about what activities are risky and teachers do not know what they can and cannot teach.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

The term "comprehensive," is also falls on spectrum, therefore can be considered an umbrella term. CSE means something radical for some institutions while it can mean something moderate and even conservative for others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sex Ed Debates|last=Kendall|first=Nancy|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Chicago and London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), the guidelines for comprehensive sexuality education are as follows:&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;appropriate to the age, developmental level, and cultural background of students;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;respects the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;complements and augments the sexuality education children receive from their families, religious and community groups, and healthcare professionals;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches not only about abstinence, but also contraception, including emergency contraception and reproductive choice;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) issues and questions issues;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches anatomy, development, puberty, and relationships;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches all of the other issues one would expect to be covered in a traditional sexuality education class; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;should be science-based and medically accurate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Sexual education exemption ===
Just as teaching methods and curricula vary by state,  excusal from sex education also varies by state. States may have with an opt out or opt in produce. In some states, students can opt out of receiving sexual education without specifying a particular reason. In other states, students can only opt out for religious or moral reasons. In an opt-in provision, parents must actively agree to allow their children to receive sex education prior to the start of the sexual education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

== Sexual content in the media  ==
Since 1997, the amount of sexual content on TV has nearly doubled in the United States.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skull|first=Tracie Marie et. al|date=2014|title=A Media Literacy Education Approach to Teaching Adolescents Comprehensive Sexual Health Education|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1043483|journal=Journal of Media Literacy Education|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–14|via=ERIC|pmid=27081579|pmc=4828968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study done in 2008 showed that nearly 40% of popular music lyrics contained sexual references which were often sexually degrading. These lyrics were also often accompanied with mentions of other risk behaviors, such as substance use and violence. &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Teens (ages 13-15) in the United States, use entertainment media as their top source for education in regards to sexuality and sexual health. Additionally, a study found that 15-19 year olds in the U.S use media far more than parents or schools to obtain information about birth control.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Some studies have found that, "very few teen television shows mention any of the responsibilities or risks (e.g., using contraception, pregnancy, STIs) associated with sex and almost none of the shows with sexual content include precaution, prevention, or negative outcomes as the primary theme." &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Television shows 16 and Pregnant and its spin-off, Teen Mom, which first aired on MTV in 2009 received major disapproval from some parents as they thought the shows glamorized teen pregnancy and motherhood. However, 16 and Pregnant actually led to a 4.3 percent reduction in teen pregnancy, mostly as a result of increased contraceptive use.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; In contrast, other data shows that exposure to high levels of sexual content on the television causes adolescents to have twice the risk of becoming pregnant in the following 3 years, compared to those who were exposed to low levels.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

The film Mean Girls, directed by Mark Waters shed light on the state sex education in some parts of the United States. In the film the health instructor states, "At your age, you're going to have a lot of urges. You're going to want to take off your clothes and touch each other. But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia and die." This line is meant to be satirical, but it illustrates common flaws within sex education in the U.S. It depicts simplistic descriptions of sexual activity and implementation of fear without any legitimate basis.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

Comprehensive sex education is the main topic in the documentary ''[[The Education of Shelby Knox]]'' released in 2005 about [[Lubbock, Texas]], which has one of the highest [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] rates in the nation. The "solution" to which is a strict [[abstinence-only sex education]] curriculum in the public schools and a conservative preacher who urges kids to pledge abstinence until marriage.

In 2013, ''[[How to Lose Your Virginity]]'' was released, a documentary that questioned the effectiveness of the [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only sex education movement]] and observed how [[sexuality]] continues to define a young woman's morality and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/06/24/how-to-lose-your-virginity-an-interview-with-therese-shechter/|title=How to Lose Your Virginity: An Interview with Therese Shechter|last=Dove-Viebahn|first=Aviva|date=June 24, 2010|publisher=Ms. Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/5548592/losing-your-virginity-is-harder-than-you-think|title=Losing Your Virginity Is Harder Than You Think|last=Stein|first=Sadie|date=May 26, 2010|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning and necessity of virginity as a [[social construct]] is also examined through narration and interviews with notable sexuality experts, such as former Surgeon General [[Joycelyn Elders|Dr. Joycelyn Elders]], "Scarleteen"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarleteen.com/about_scarleteen|title=About Scarleteen|website=www.scarleteen.com|accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; creator and editor [[Heather Corinna]], historian [[Hanne Blank]], author [[Jessica Valenti]], and [[sex education|comprehensive sex education]] advocate [[Shelby Knox]].

Not only have films portrayed sex education, but so has [[social media]].  Platforms such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], [[Vine (service)|Vine]], and others are used as a tool to uplift the narratives of marginalized communities such as [[Person of color|persons of color]]  and LGBTQIA+ persons in hopes to "strengthen sexual health equity for all."&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

As a result of the mass amount of sex content in media, media literacy education (MLE) has emerged. It was created to address the influence of unhealthy media messages on risky health decisions, such as intention to use substances, body image issues, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; A study analyzed the effectiveness of a teacher-led MLE program, called Media Aware Sexual Health (MASH), which provides students with accurate health information and teaches them how to apply that information to critical analysis of media messages. This comprehensive sex education resulted in increased intentions to talk to a parent, partner and medical professional prior to sexual activity, and intentions for condom use.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Due to knowledge gaps in most sex education curricula for teens, free online resources like [[Sex, Etc.]] and teensource.org&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teensource.org/content/about-us|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=teensource.org|publisher=TeenSource|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been created to promote comprehensive, inclusive sex education for teenagers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">The '''critical apparatus''' ({{lang-la|apparatus criticus}}) is the critical and [[primary source]] material that accompanies an edition of a text. A critical apparatus is often a by-product of [[textual criticism]].

Many editions employ a standard format for a critical apparatus, as illustrated by a line from ''[[Hamlet]]'', which the Oxford ''Complete Works'' (1988) prints as follows:&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''The Complete Works'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|{{sc|LAERTES}}. Alas, then is she drowned.}}

The apparatus for the line might be rendered as:&lt;ref&gt;Suggested by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, ''William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1997), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|4.7.156 Alas, then is she drowned.] {{sc|'''HIBBARD'''}}; Alas then, is she drown'd? '''F''';&lt;br&gt;Alas then is she drownd. '''Q3'''; Alas, then, she is drownd. '''Q2''';&lt;br/&gt;So, she is drownde: '''Q1'''.}}

The format of the apparatus has several parts:
* The location of the variant in the text (act, scene, line number)
* The ''lemma'', which is the portion of the text to which the note applies
* A right bracket (])
* The source from which the edition took its reading
* A list of variants, in each case followed by the source in which the variant is found, and set off with a semicolon.

To save space, frequently cited sources are usually assigned an abbreviation called a ''siglum''. In Shakespeare editions, '''F''' always signifies the [[First Folio]]; the second through fourth folios are referred to as '''F2''' through '''F4''' respectively. Similarly, '''Q1''' is the first [[quarto]], '''Q2''' the second quarto, and '''Q3''' the third.

In the example given, the first folio ('''F''') and the three early quartos ('''Q1''' to '''Q3''') each have a different reading of the line in question. The editors have concluded that all four early sources are corrupt, and instead have adopted a reading suggested by [[G. R. Hibbard]]. Other editors of the play may choose a different reading of the line. The apparatus summarizes all of the textual evidence, allowing readers to assess for themselves whether the editor has made the best choice. Sometimes the editor will add a commentary, defending the choice made, explaining why other readings were rejected, or discussing how other editors have treated the passage.

This format has been used for critical apparatuses of [[Shakespeare]] and many other authors. In [[variorum]] editions, the apparatus is often placed at the bottom of the page. Sometimes a three-part format is employed, with the main text at the top of the page, textual variants in the middle, and the editor's commentary at the bottom. This remains the most common format for Shakespeare editions, although the Oxford ''Complete Works'' breaks with tradition by putting its critical apparatus in a separately published volume.

In the United States, bibliographer [[Fredson Bowers]] established a tradition of putting the critical apparatus at the back of the book, leaving the edited text clear of apparatus. This has the advantage of leaving the main text uncluttered with editorial details that may not be of interest to the general reader. However, this format is a disadvantage to scholarly readers, who are not able to see all of the textual evidence in one place.

==Bible==
The first printed edition of the [[New Testament]] with ''critical apparatus'', noting variant readings among the manuscripts, was produced by the printer [[Robert Estienne]] of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' (Latin for "received text"), a name given to it in the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevier]] edition of 1633, which termed it as the text ''nunc ab omnibus receptum'' ("now received by all").

==Electronic representation==
The de facto standard for the representation of critical apparatus in digital scholarly editions is to follow the recommendations of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html&lt;/ref&gt; While other formats are also used in digital literary studies this has become the most accepted storage format.&lt;ref&gt; See also James Cummings, "[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&amp;chunk.id=ss1-6-6&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ss1-6-6&amp;brand=9781405148641_brand The Text Encoding Initiative and the Study of Literature]" in 'A Companion to Digital Literary Studies', ed.

{{Critical pedagogy}}
'''Curriculum studies''' ('''CS''') is a concentration within curriculum and instruction concerned with understanding [[curriculum|curricula]] as an active force of human educational experience.

==Overview==
Specific questions related to curriculum studies include the following: 
*What should be taught in [[school]]s? 
*Why should it be taught? To whom should it be taught? 
*What does it mean to be an educated person?

Components of CS also investigate the relationship between [[curriculum theory]] and educational practice and the relationship between school programs and the contours of the [[society]] and [[culture]] in which schools are located. There are [[#University programs|programs in the field of curriculum studies]] in several Colleges of Education around the world. Curriculum studies was also the first subdivision of the [[American Educational Research Association]], known as Division B.

Important CS books include ''The Curriculum: Perspective, Paradigm, and Possibility'' by William Schubert (New York: Macmillan, 1986; and ''Understanding Curriculum'' by [[William Pinar]], et al. (New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 1995).

Curriculum studies emerged as a distinctive field in the late 1960s and early 1970s from educationists focused on curriculum development. The shift from developing and evaluating curriculum to understanding curriculum is known as the "Reconceptualization" of the curriculum field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pacheco|first1=Jose, Augusto|title=Curriculum studies: What is the field today?|journal=Journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Curriculum Studies|date=2012|volume=8|pages=18|url=https://www.uwstout.edu/soe/jaaacs/upload/v8_What_Is_The_Field_Today.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A branch of curriculum studies that investigates how society transmits culture from generation to generation has been tagged with the term "[[hidden curriculum]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Mark, K|title=Curriculum theory and practice|url=http://infed.org/mobi/curriculum-theory-and-practice/|website=infed.org|publisher=The Encyclopaedia of Informal Education|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though much of what is studied is hiding in plain sight.  For instance, one of the 19th century founders of the discipline of [[sociology]], [[Émile Durkheim]], observed that more is taught and learned in schools than specified in the established curriculum of textbooks and teacher manuals.  In ''Moral Education'' Durkheim wrote:

:"In fact, there is a whole system of rules in the school that predetermine the child's conduct.  He must come to class regularly, he must arrive at a specified time and with an appropriate bearing and attitude.  He must not disrupt things in class.  He must have learned his lessons, done his homework, and have done so reasonably well, etc.  There are, therefore, a host of obligations that the child is required to shoulder.  Together they constitute the discipline of the school.  It is through the practice of school discipline that we can inculcate the spirit of discipline in the child. (Durkheim, Émile (1961 [1925]). ''Moral Education''. New York, The Free Press.p.&amp;nbsp;148)"

[[Phillip W. Jackson]] (1968) may have coined the term "hidden curriculum" in his book ''Life in Classrooms''.  He argued that [[primary school]] emphasized specific skills: learning to wait quietly, exercising restraint, trying, completing work, keeping busy, cooperating, showing allegiance to both teachers and peers, being neat and punctual, and so on (Jackson, Philip (1968). ''Life in Classrooms''.). The [[Structural functionalism|structural functional]] sociologist [[Robert Dreeben]] (1968 ''On What is Learned in School'') similarly concluded that the curriculum of schooling taught students to "form transient social relationships, submerge much of their personal identity, and accept the legitimacy of categorical treatment".  Dreeben argued that formal schooling indirectly conveyed to students values such as independence and achievement, essential for their later membership in society. 
 
Since then, curriculum studies researchers ranging across the spectrum of paradigms&amp;mdash;from conservative structural-[[Structural functionalism|functionalists]], to neo-[[Marxist]]s to narrative- and arts-based researchers&amp;mdash;have examined formal curricula, experienced curricula, and hidden curricula.  Progressive researchers like Paul Willis (1977, ''Learning to Labor: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''), Jean Anyon  (1980, "Social Class and the Hidden Curriculum of Work". ''Journal of Education'' 162), and [[Annette Lareau]] (1989. ''Home Advantage: Social Class, and Parental Intervention in Elementary Education'') have examined the ways that hidden and overt curricula reproduce [[social class]] position.  Narrative and arts-based researchers like Thomas Barone (2001, ''Touching Eternity: The Enduring Outcomes of Teaching'') have inquired about the long-term effects of curricula on student lives.

Critical theorists like [[Henry Giroux]] (1983 "Theories of Reproduction and Resistance in the New Sociology of Education: A critical analysis." ''Harvard Educational Review'' 53) began to examine the roles of students and teachers in resisting curricula both official and hidden.  So-called "resistance theorists" conceptualized students and teachers as active agents working to subvert, reject, or change curricula.  They noted that "curriculum" was not a unified structure but incoherent conflicting and contradictory messages. Other researchers have examined the interactions between racial and [[ethnic]] cultures and the dominant curricula of the school. For instance the anthropologist John Ogbu examined curricula established by [[African American]] students ([[Signithia Fordham]] and John Ogbu 1986 "Black Students' School Success: Coping with the Burden of 'Acting White.' ''The Urban Review'' 18).   [[Critical race theory|Critical race theorists]] like Daniel Solórzano examined how racial attitudes constitute another "hidden" curriculum in teacher education programs (1997, Images and Words that Wound: Critical Race Theory and Racial Stereotyping, and Teacher Education, ''Teacher Education Quarterly'', 24). Additionally, Judith Stacey proposed in the 1960s schools conveyed a hidden curriculum that perpetuated the "sexist beliefs, attitudes, and values" of the time period (1974 "And Jill Came Tumbling After Sexism in American Education").&lt;ref&gt;Stacey, Judith, et al. (eds.) (1974). And Jill Came Tumbling After: Sexism in American Education. New York: Dell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interest in curriculum studies is thus cross disciplinary and of increasing importance to [[educational research]] and to the [[philosophy of education]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1871">The '''economics of scientific knowledge''' ('''ESK''') is an approach to understanding science which is predicated on the need to understand scientific knowledge creation and dissemination in economic terms.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

The approach has been developed as a contrast to the [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK)]] which places scientists in their social context and examines their behavior using social theory. ESK typically involves thinking of scientists as having economic interests with these being thought of as utility maximisation and science as being a market process. Modelling strategies might use any of a variety of approaches including the neoclasscial, game theoretic, behavioural (bounded rationality) information theoretic and transaction costs. Boumans and Davis (2010) mention [[Partha Dasgupta|Dasgupta]] and [[Paul A. David|David]] (1994) as being an interesting early example of work in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Boumans, M. and Davis, John B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5405">'''Environmental biotechnology''' is [[biotechnology]] that is applied to and used to study the [[natural environment]].  Environmental biotechnology could also imply that one try to harness biological process for commercial uses and exploitation.  The [http://www3.inecol.edu.mx/iseb/ International Society for Environmental Biotechnology] defines environmental biotechnology as "the development, use and regulation of biological systems for remediation of contaminated environments ([[landform|land]], [[air]], [[water]]), and for [[natural environment|environment]]-friendly processes (green manufacturing technologies and [[sustainable development]])".&lt;ref&gt;Gerben J Zylstraa and Jerome J Kukor, ''What is environmental biotechnology?'' Current Opinion in Biotechnology 16(3):243-245, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental biotechnology can simply be described as "the optimal use of nature, in the form of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]] and [[algae]], to produce [[renewable energy]], [[food]] and [[nutrients]] in a [[synergistic]] integrated cycle of [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] making processes where the waste of each process becomes the feedstock for another process".&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Sagar. K, ''National Conference on Environmental Biotechnology'', Bangalore 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance towards agriculture, food security, climate change mitigation and adaptation and the MDGs==

[[Science]] through the [[International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development|IAASTD]] has called for the advancement of small-scale agro-ecological farming systems and technology in order to achieve food security, [[climate change mitigation]], [[climate change adaptation]] and the realisation of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Environmental biotechnology has been shown to play a significant role in [[agroecology]] in the form of [[zero waste agriculture]] and most significantly through the operation of over 15 million [[biogas digester]]s worldwide.

==Significance towards industrial biotechnology==

Consider an environment in which pollution of a particular type is maximum. Let us consider the effluents of a starch industry  which has mixed up with a local water body like a lake or pond.  We find huge deposits of starch which are not so easily taken up for degradation by micro-organisms except for a few exemptions.  we isolate a few micro-organisms from the polluted site and scan for any significant changes in their genome like mutations or evolutions.  The modified genes are then identified.  This is done because, the isolate would have adapted itself to degrade/utilize the starch better than other microbes of the same genus.  Thus, the resultant genes are cloned onto industrially significant micro-organisms and are used for more economically significant processes like in pharmaceutical industry, fermentations...etc.

Similar situations can be elucitated like in the case of oil spills in the oceans which require cleanup, microbes isolated from oil rich environments like oil wells, oil transfer pipelines...etc. have been found having the potential to degrade oil or use it as an energy source.  Thus they serve as a remedy to oil spills.

Still another elucidation would be in the case of microbes isolated from pesticide rich soils These would be capable of utilizing the pesticides as energy source and hence when mixed along with bio-fertilizers, would serve as excellent insurance against increased pesticide-toxicity levels in agricultural platform.

But the counter argument would be that whether these newly introduced microorganisms would create an imbalance in the environment concerned.The mutual harmony in which the organisms in that particular environment existed may have to face alteration and we should be extremely careful so as to not disturb the mutual relationships already existing in the environment of both the benefits and the disadvantages would pave way for an improvised version of environmental biotechnology. After all it is the environment that we strive to protect.

==Applications and Implications==

Humans have been manipulating genetic material for centuries. Although many benefits are provided by these manipulations, there can also be unexpected, negative health and environmental outcomes. Environmental biotechnology, then, is all about the balance between the applications that provide for these and the implications of manipulating genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel A. Vallero]], ''Environmental Biotechnology: A Biosystems Approach'', Academic Press, Amsterdam, NV; {{ISBN|978-0-12-375089-1}}; 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Textbooks address both the applications and implications. Environmental engineering texts addressing [[sewage treatment]] and biological principles are often now considered to be environmental biotechnology texts. These generally address the applications of biotechnologies, whereas the implications of these technologies are less often addressed; usually in books concerned with potential impacts and even catastrophic events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12073">{{For|the academic journal|Environmental Communication (journal)}}
'''Environmental communication''' refers to the study and practice of how individuals, institutions, societies, and cultures craft, distribute, receive, understand, and use messages about the [[Natural environment|environment]] and human interactions with the environment. This includes a wide range of possible interactions, from interpersonal communication to [[virtual communities]], participatory decision making, and environmental media coverage. And it also includes verbal communication.

From the perspective of practice, Alexander Flor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/181519/Environmental_Communication|title=Environmental Communication|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines environmental communication as the application of communication approaches, principles, strategies and techniques to environmental management and protection.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander. (2004). ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander_Flor/publication/276930253_Environmental_Communication_Principles_Approaches_and_Strategies_of_Communication_Applied_to_Environmental_Management/links/555c380908ae6aea081734c5/Environmental-Communication-Principles-Approaches-and-Strategies-of-Communication-Applied-to-Environmental-Management.pdf Environmental Communication]''. Diliman, Quezon City: University of the Philippines-Open University.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic field ==
As an academic field, environmental communication emerged from interdisciplinary work involving [[communication studies|communication]], [[environmental studies]], [[environmental science]], [[risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] and management, [[sociology]], and [[political ecology]].

Flor (2004) considers it as a significant element in the environmental sciences, which he believes to be a [[transdisciplinary|transdicipline]]. He begins his textbook on environmental communication with a declarative statement, "Environmentalism as we know it today began with environmental communication. The environmental movement was ignited by a spark from a writer’s pen, or more specifically and accurately, [[Rachel Carson]]’s typewriter." According to Flor, environmental communication has six essentials: knowledge of ecological laws; sensitivity to the cultural dimension; ability to network effectively; efficiency in using media for social agenda setting; appreciation and practice of environmental ethics; and conflict resolution, mediation and arbitration (Ibid). In an earlier book, Flor and Gomez (1993) explore the development of an environmental communication curriculum from the perspectives of practitioners from the government, the private sector and the academe.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander, and Gomez, Ely D., eds. (1993). ''Environmental Communication: Considerations in Curriculum and Delivery Systems Development''. Los Banos, Laguna: University of the Philippines Los Banos - Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change communications has historically focused on [[news]] coverage and [[dissemination|disseminating]] information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbet|first1=M. C.|title=Communicating climate change:  Why frames matter for public engagement|journal=Environment|date=2009|volume=51|issue=2|pages=14–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic fields such as [[psychology]], [[environmental sociology]], and [[risk communication]] have argued that public nonresponse to climate change is due to a lack of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norgaard|first1=K. M.|title=Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life|date=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262015448}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life,'' Norgaard's (2011) study of Bygdaby (a fictional name used for a real city in Norway) found that non-response was much more complex than just a lack of information. In fact, too much information can do the exact opposite because people tend to neglect [[global warming]] once they realize there is no easy solution. When people understand the complexity of the issue, they can feel overwhelmed and helpless which can lead to [[apathy]] or [[skepticism]]. [[Environmental skepticism]] is an increasing challenge for environmental rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacques|first1=P.|title=Environmental Skepticism: Ecology, Power and Public Life|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0754671022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolic action ==
Environmental communication is also a type of symbolic action that serves two functions. Those functions are [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] and [[wikt:constitutive|constitutive]]. Environmental human communication is pragmatic because it helps individuals and organizations to accomplish goals and literally do things through communication. Examples of this include educating, alerting, persuading and collaborating. Environmental human communication is constitutive because it helps to shape people's understandings of environmental issues, themselves, and Nature; it shapes the meanings we hold of these things. Examples of this include values, attitudes, and ideologies vis-à-vis Nature and environmental issues and problems.Environmental nature communication happens when plants actually communicate,within ecosystems:"A plant injured on one leaf by a nibbling insect can alert its other leaves to begin anticipatory defense responses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1112]&lt;/ref&gt; "When a leaf gets eaten, it warns other leaves by using some of the same signals as animals. Plant biologists are "starting to unravel a long-standing mystery about how different parts of a plant communicate with one another."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Communication Theory has one universal law, written by S. F. Scudder in the early 1900s, and later published in 1980. The Universal Communication Law states that, "All living entities, beings and creatures communicate."{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In an unpublished interview, Scudder clarified the concept - "All of the living communicate through movements, sounds, reactions, physical changes, gestures, languages, breath, color transformations, etc. Communication is a means of survival, existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge the communication exists. Examples - the cry of a child (communication that it is hungry, hurt, cold, etc.); the browning of a leaf,a leaf that becomes defensive as it's being consumed,"A plant injured on one leaf by a nibbling insect can alert its other leaves to begin anticipatory defense responses. Working in the model plant Arabidopsis, Toyota et al. show that this systemic signal begins with the release of glutamate, which is perceived by glutamate receptor–like ion channels (see the Perspective by Muday and Brown-Harding). The ion channels then set off a cascade of changes in calcium ion concentration that propagate through the phloem vasculature and through intercellular channels called plasmodesmata. This glutamate-based long-distance signaling is rapid: Within minutes, an undamaged leaf can respond to the fate of a distant leaf." &lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1112&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt; A leaf that communicates that it is being eaten); the cry of an animal (communicating that it is injured, hungry, angry, etc.)are examples that sit inside the universal law that Everything living communicates."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt;]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Scudder's thesis is aptly reinforced by General Systems Theory, which submits that one of the three critical functions of living systems is the exchange of information with its environment and with other living systems (the other two being the exchange of materials and the exchange of energy). In his book, Flor (2004, page 4) extends this argument by forwarding that, "All living systems, from the simplest to the most complex, are equipped to perform these critical functions. They are called ''critical'' because they are necessary for the survival of the living system. Communication is nothing more than the exchange of information. Hence, at its broadest sense, environmental communication is necessary for the survival of every living system, be it an organism, an ecosystem, or (even) a social system."

== Areas of study and practice ==
According to J. Robert Cox, the field of environmental communication is composed of seven major areas of study and practice:

# Environmental [[rhetoric]] and [[discourse]]
# [[News media|Media]] and [[environmental journalism]]
# [[Public participation]] in environmental decision making
# [[Social marketing]] and [[advocacy|advocacy campaigns]]
# Environmental [[collaboration]] and [[conflict resolution]]
# [[Risk communication]]
# Representations of Nature in [[popular culture]] and [[green marketing]]&lt;ref&gt;Cox, J. Robert. (2010). ''Environmental Communication And The Public Sphere''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, pp.??{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Epigraphy''' ({{lang-grc|ἐπιγραφή}}, "inscription") is the study of inscriptions or epigraphs as [[writing]]; it is the science of identifying [[grapheme]]s, clarifying their meanings, classifying their uses according to dates and cultural contexts, and drawing conclusions about the writing and the writers. Specifically excluded from epigraphy are the historical significance of an epigraph as a [[document]] and the artistic value of a [[literature|literary]] composition.

A person using the methods of epigraphy is called an ''epigrapher'' or ''epigraphist''. For example, the [[Behistun inscription]] is an official [[document]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] engraved on native rock at a location in [[Iran]]. Epigraphists are responsible for reconstructing, translating, and dating the trilingual inscription and finding any relevant circumstances. It is the work of [[historian]]s, however, to determine and interpret the events recorded by the inscription as document. Often, epigraphy and history are competences practised by the same person.

An epigraph is any sort of text, from a single grapheme (such as marks on a pot that abbreviate the name of the merchant who shipped commodities in the pot) to a lengthy document (such as a treatise, a work of literature, or a [[hagiography|hagiographic]] prescription). Epigraphy overlaps other competences such as [[numismatics]] or [[palaeography]]. When compared to books, most inscriptions are short. The media and the forms of the graphemes are diverse: [[engraving]]s in stone or metal, scratches on rock, impressions in wax, [[Repoussé and chasing|embossing]] on cast metal, [[cameo (carving)|cameo]] or [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] on precious stones, painting on [[ceramic]] or in [[fresco]]. Typically the material is durable, but the durability might be an accident of circumstance, such as the baking of a [[clay tablet]] in a conflagration.

==Scope==
Epigraphy is a primary tool of [[archaeology]] when dealing with literate cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://f-origin.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/31/files/2014/09/Open-Access-Epigraphy.pdf |title=OPEN-ACCESS EPIGRAPHY.

The study of ancient [[handwriting]], usually in ink, is a separate field, [[palaeography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://people.umass.edu/eng3/fcd/documents/Brown_WhatIsPalaeography.pdf |title=What is Palaeography? |first=Julian |last=Brown |access-date=21 September 2018 |publisher=[[UMassAmherst]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of the writing, the subject of epigraphy, is a matter quite separate from the nature of the text, which is studied in itself. Texts inscribed in stone are usually for public view and so they are essentially different from the written texts of each culture.  Not all inscribed texts are public, however: in [[Mycenaean Greece]] the deciphered texts of "[[Linear B]]" were revealed to be largely used for economic and administrative record keeping. Informal inscribed texts are "[[Graffito (archaeology)|graffiti]]" in its original sense.

==History==
[[File:Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|The high medieval [[Prüfening dedicatory inscription]], composed in [[Latin]] and stamped in [[Roman square capitals]]]]

The science of epigraphy has been developing steadily since the 16th century. Principles of epigraphy vary culture by culture, and the infant science in European hands concentrated on Latin inscriptions at first. Individual contributions have been made by epigraphers such as [[Georg Fabricius]] (1516–1571); [[Stefano Antonio Morcelli]] (1737–1822); [[August Wilhelm Zumpt]] (1815–1877); [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903); [[Emil Hübner]] (1834–1901); [[Franz Cumont]] (1868–1947); [[Louis Robert (historian)|Louis Robert]] (1904–1985).

The ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', begun by Mommsen and other scholars, has been published in Berlin since 1863, with wartime interruptions. It is the largest and most extensive collection of Latin inscriptions. New [[Book|fascicles]] are still produced as the recovery of inscriptions continues. The ''Corpus'' is arranged geographically: all inscriptions from Rome are contained in volume 6. This volume has the greatest number of inscriptions; volume 6, part 8, fascicle 3 was just recently published (2000). Specialists depend on such on-going series of volumes in which newly discovered inscriptions are published, often in Latin, not unlike the biologists' ''[[Zoological Record]]''— the raw material of history.

Greek epigraphy has unfolded in the hands of a different team, with different [[text corpus|corpora]]. There are two. The first is ''Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum'' of which four volumes came out, again at Berlin, 1825-1877. This marked a first attempt at a comprehensive publication of Greek inscriptions copied from all over the Greek-speaking world. Only advanced students still consult it, for better editions of the texts have superseded it. The second, modern corpus is ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' arranged geographically under categories: decrees, catalogues, honorary titles, funeral inscriptions, various, all presented in Latin, to preserve the international neutrality of the field of [[classics]].

Other such series include the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum]]'' (Etruscan inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Crucesignatorum Terrae Sanctae'' (Crusaders' inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Insularum Celticarum'' (Celtic inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Iranicarum'' (Iranian inscriptions), "Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia" and "Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period" (Sumerian and Akkadian inscriptions) and so forth.

Egyptian hieroglyphs were solved using the [[Rosetta Stone]], which was a multilingual stele in Classical Greek, Demotic Egyptian and Classical Egyptian hieroglyphs. The work was done by the French scholar, [[Jean-François Champollion]], and the British scientist [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]].

The interpretation of [[Maya hieroglyphs]] was lost as a result of the Spanish Conquest of Central America. However, recent work by Maya epigraphers and linguists has yielded a considerable amount of information on this complex writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael D.

====Materials====
Inscriptions were commonly incised on stone, marble, metal, [[terracotta]], or wood (though this last material has hardly ever survived, except in [[Egypt]]). In Egypt and [[Mesopotamia]] hard stones were frequently used for the purpose, and the inscriptions are therefore well preserved and easy to read. In [[Greece]] the favourite material, especially in [[Athens]], was white marble, which takes an admirably clear lettering, but is liable to weathering of the surface if exposed, and to wear if rebuilt into pavements or similar structures. Many other kinds of stone, both hard and soft, were often used, especially crystalline [[limestone]]s, which do not easily take a smooth surface, and which, therefore, are often difficult to decipher, owing to accidental marks or roughness of the material.&lt;ref name="EBr1"&gt;The following sections are based on specialist work consulted from the following sources: {{aut|[[Ernest Arthur Gardner]]}}'s article on "Epigraphy and Inscriptions", in Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

The metal most commonly used for inscriptions was [[bronze]]: flat tablets of this were often made for affixing to the walls of temples and other buildings. Occasionally such tablets were made of [[silver]] or [[gold]]; and inscriptions were often incised on vessels made of any of these metals. Inscriptions on metal were nearly always incised, not cast. An important class of inscriptions are the legends on coins; these were struck from the [[die (manufacturing)|die]]. (cf. [[numismatics]].) Clay was very extensively used for inscriptions in Mesopotamia and in [[Crete]]. In this case the symbols were incised or impressed on specially prepared tablets when the clay was soft, and it was subsequently hardened by fire. In Greece, many inscriptions on vases were painted before firing, in that case often having reference to the scenes represented, or incised after firing; potsherds (''[[ostraka]]'') were often used as a cheap writing material. Inscriptions were also often impressed from a mould upon wet clay before firing, in the case of tiles, [[amphora]] handles, etc., and in these cases often supply valuable information as to the buildings to which they belong or the place from which they took their origin.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

The ''tools'' used for making inscriptions varied with the material; most of them were some kind of [[chisel]], usually with a square blade; early inscriptions were sometimes made on hard rock by successive blows with a [[punch (tool)|punch]] or pointed [[hammer]]. Sometimes a circular punch was used for '''''O''''' or a letter of which ''O'' formed a part.

====Styles of cutting====
Early inscriptions, which are often amateur work, are frequently very irregular in their cutting. But in almost all examples of later work, the inscriptions are evidently cut by professionals, and there are definite styles and methods belonging to various places and periods. In Egypt, for instance, the [[hieroglyphs]] are carefully and delicately cut in early times, and in later periods become more careless and conventional. In Greece, the best work was done in the 5th and 4th centuries BC in Athens; the letters were all exact and regular in shape, with no adventitious ornaments, and were, especially in the 5th century, usually exactly aligned with the letters above and below, as well as those on each side. At that time all the strokes were made of equal thickness, but in the 4th century BC and later there came in the custom of holding the chisel obliquely to the surface, thus producing a wedge-shaped stroke. A similar custom in Mesopotamia gave rise to the so-called ''[[cuneiform]]'' system. On metal inscriptions in Greece this same effect appears earlier than stone or marble. In the 3rd century and later it becomes common to introduce ''[[Apex (diacritic)|apices]]'' or ornamental ends to the strokes, a custom which prevails to the present day in our ordinary capital letters. The custom of making different strokes and different parts of curves of varying thickness became common in [[Latin Inscriptions|Roman inscriptions]], which developed a monumental style of their own, varying from period to period. Inscriptions can often be approximately dated by the style of the cutting as well as by the shapes of the letters; skill in doing this can only be acquired by a careful and minute study of originals and facsimiles. (cf. [[dating methodologies in archaeology]].)

Inscriptions vary greatly in size according to the position where they were intended to be read, their purpose, and the skill of the cutter. Some inscriptions are of great length, the longest, a statement of accounts of the temple at [[Delos]], under Athenian administration, being nearly half as long as a book of [[Thucydides]]; and many other inscriptions approach this in length.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Symbols and forms of writing===
{{SpecialChars}}
{{see also|History of writing}}
Most of the forms of writing known to us originated in some system of picture-writing (cf. also [[pictography]], which developed into a hieroglyphic system. Such systems appear to have originated independently in different parts of the world — in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Crete]], among the [[Hittites]] and in [[China]] and [[Americas|America]]. The evidence for all of these is mainly to be found in inscriptions. The development from [[Ideographs]] (or direct representation of an object or idea) to symbols of phonetic value, and so to [[syllabaries]] or alphabets, took place in many different systems to various degrees. But the first people to invent a completely alphabetic system of writing were the [[Phoenicians]], from whom the [[Greeks]] borrowed (some scholars believe, but with no proving) it with certain modifications and improvements. From the Greeks was derived the [[Latin language|Latin]], and from the two all the alphabets of European peoples. It is still a matter of dispute whether the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] was derived from the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]].

[[File:Rökstenen 1.JPG|thumb|An inscription using [[cipher runes]], the [[Elder Futhark]], and the [[Younger Futhark]], on the 9th-century [[Rök Runestone]] in Sweden]]
The hieroglyphic symbols naturally tended to be conventionalised and simplified for convenience of cutting, in accordance with the materials and tools employed. In many cases they developed from a pictorial to a linear form. It is possible that some of these linear forms may not be derived from hieroglyphs, but from purely conventional geometrical forms. such as widely used at all periods and places as owners' or [[Stone mason|masons]]' marks. The tendency of linear forms to become wedge-shaped is most conspicuous in [[cuneiform]], but as has been noticed, the same tendency occurs in Greek inscriptions incised on bronze.

In the north of [[Europe]] the [[Ogham]] [[Ogham inscription|inscriptions]] are alphabetic, and are apparently an independent invention on arbitrary lines, like the [[Morse code]]; but [[Runes]], which were extensively used in the same region, are derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] or the [[Latin alphabet]]s.

In most alphabetic systems there are also found in inscriptions certain symbols which are not strictly alphabetic or phonetic in character. The commonest of these are the various systems of numerals that are used in different times and places. It is impossible here to give any full description of these different systems; but a brief account may be given of the principles underlying them. Most of them are based upon a [[decimal|decimal system]], doubtless owing to the habit of counting on the fingers. In some cases the symbols are simple and obvious, as in the Cretan script, where circles (or ''rhombi''), dots and lines are used for hundreds, tens and units, each being repeated as often as necessary; and a similar system for the lower denominations is used at [[Epidaurus]] in the 4th century BC. In [[Athens]] the usual system was to indicate each denomination by its initial, '''M''' for Μύριοι (10,000), '''X''' for χίλιοι (1,000), '''H''' for εκατόν (100), '''Δ''' for δέκα (10), '''π''' for πεντε (5) and '''I''' for units. The other Greek system followed that derived from the Phoenicians, using the letters of the alphabet in their conventional order from one to nine, 10 to 90 and 100 to 900; in this arrangement obsolete letters were retained in their original places so as to give the requisite number of 27 symbols. The [[Roman numeral|Roman]] system of numerals — M, D, C, L, X, V, I (for 1,000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 5 and 1) is generally supposed to have arisen from the adaptation of those symbols in the Greek alphabet which the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] did not want; an alternative theory is that it is simplified from a series of [[ideograph]]s representing the spread hand, the fingers and so on.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

[[File:Crete - law of Gortyn - boustrophedon.JPG|thumb&lt;!--autosize to fit handheld devices--&gt;|left|Ancient Greek [[boustrophedon]] inscription, [[Gortyn code]], Crete, 5th century BC]]

Apart from numerals, the use of initials in the place of complete words was not common in early times. It became, however, very frequent in Roman inscriptions, which sometimes are made up almost entirely of such abbreviations and can only be understood by those familiar with the formulae. A list of the commonest of these will be found under [[list of classical abbreviations]]. [[Compendia]] or [[monogram]]s also occur in later Greek and Roman times, and become very common and very difficult to interpret in early [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Byzantine]] inscriptions.

Some kind of punctuation is often found in inscriptions of all kinds. In Greek inscriptions a vertical line or a dot, or dots, sometimes indicates the separation between sentences or words, but words are seldom separated by spaces as in modern printing, so that the text is continuous and no division of words exists.This is particularly the case with Greek inscriptions of the best period. In Roman inscriptions it was usual to separate the words by dots. In certain inscriptions a cross ([[File:Greek cross.svg|15px]]) was used to indicate the beginning of an inscription, especially when its direction was erratic. Christian inscriptions sometimes begin with a cross, which doubtless had a symbolic meaning; and a leaf or other device was often placed at the end.

The direction of the writing varies greatly in different places and times. The letters or symbols may be arranged vertically below one another, and read from top to bottom, or horizontally, either from right to left or from left to right; they may also be arranged in a kind of pattern — in which case their order may be indeterminate, or in a wandering or curved line, or left to right and right to left alternately (''[[boustrophedon]]'', or as an [[ox]] in [[ploughing]]). Most [[Semitic alphabets]], including Phoenician, read from right to left; and the earliest Greek inscriptions follow the same direction. But the direction from left to right became regular in Greece after the 6th century BC, and consequently is adopted by the Romans and in all European systems. The individual letters or symbols usually face in the same direction as the writing, as a whole.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Position or place===

The position or place of inscriptions depends greatly upon their purpose or intention. When they have a direct relation to the sculptures, reliefs or paintings with which they are associated, they often form a kind of pattern to fill the background or vacant spaces between the figures; but sometimes, especially in Mesopotamian statues or reliefs, they are cut right across the figures without any regard to the artistic effect. In late Greek or Roman work it is usual to cut any inscription relative to a statue or relief upon the basis on which this is mounted; but short inscriptions such as dedications or artists' signatures are often placed in some inconspicuous position upon the work itself. In the case of painted vases, the inscriptions relative to the subject represented are usually painted; but dedications and other inscriptions are often incised after the vase has been fired.

In Egypt, inscriptions were often inscribed or painted upon inner walls of tombs, whether they referred to religious belief or ritual, or to the honours and possessions of the deceased; they were intended for his benefit and convenience rather than for the information of others, so as to perpetuate his familiar surroundings, not to make him live in the memory of his successors. The information which we derive from such inscriptions is invaluable to us; but such was not the intention with which they were made. On the other hand, inscriptions which were intended to be seen by the public and to perpetuate a record of events, or to supply useful information, were usually placed in places of common resort, above all in temples and sacred precincts. Sometimes they were cut on convenient rock faces, sometimes upon the walls of temples or other buildings. Most frequently the slabs of marble (''[[stelae]]''), stone metal or other material upon which the inscriptions were incised were set up in convenient positions to be read, in any places of public resort. This was the method of publication of all laws, decrees and official notices, of treaties and contracts, of honours to officials or private citizens, of religious dedications and prescriptions of ritual. Inscribed [[tombstone]]s were set up over graves, which were usually placed along the chief roads leading out of a town, the most familiar example being the sacred way from Athens to [[Eleusis]]. Inscriptions commemorative of victories or other great events were only in exceptional cases erected upon the spot; more often such memorials were set up in some great religious centre such as [[Delphi]] or [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. But boundary stones were necessarily placed on the line which they defined.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Chief periods and nationalities===
[[File:Cypriot syllabic inscription 600-500BC.jpg|thumb]]
The study of inscriptions supplies an important contribution to the history of many lands and peoples. In some cases, as in Egypt and Mesopotamia, it forms almost the only source of information in the absence of literary records; in others, as in Greece and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], it offers a most valuable supplement and comment to what is otherwise recorded.

Both Egyptian and Mesopotamian inscriptions go back to an extremely early date; it is at present uncertain which is the earlier, but both show, before 3500 BC and possibly much earlier, a complete, organised system of writing which implies many centuries of development behind it. The Egyptian hieroglyphic system, as used in inscriptions, continued without any essential change of character until Roman times, though various systems of [[hieratic]] modification were used at different times. On the famous [[Rosetta Stone]], in the [[British Museum]], which first gave the clue to the interpretation of Egyptian writing, hieroglyphic, hieratic and Greek versions of the same decree are given side by side. Its date is 195 BC. The Mesopotamian linear symbols developed mainly for technical reasons, into a wedge-shaped or cuneiform system, which was adopted in modified forms and applied to different languages through some thousands of years, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], [[Assyria]]n and [[Old Persian|Persian]], until it was superseded, after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], by Greek. An independent hieroglyphic system, which also developed into various linear scripts, existed in Crete during the [[Middle Minoan|Middle]] and [[Late Minoan]] periods, from about 3000, probably, to the fall of [[Knossos]], about 1500 BC. The Hittite hieroglyphs correspond to the period of the Hittite empire in northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Asia Minor]] from about 2000 to 800 BC; from it, according to one theory, arose the [[Cypriot syllabary]], which continued in use until the 4th century BC or later.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

The earliest Phoenician inscriptions known date from about the 10th century BC, and the alphabet remained in use down to the 3rd century BC. Some believe this  was modified and adopted by the Greeks at an uncertain date; the earliest Greek inscriptions are generally dated in the 7th century BC.

In early times each Greek State had its own alphabet; but in the year 403 BC (the [[archon]]ship of [[Eucleides]]) the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian alphabet]], which is the one used now for Greek capital letters, was officially adopted by [[Athens]], and soon became universal in Greece. From the various Greek alphabets the different local [[Italian alphabet]]s, including the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], were derived with various modifications. The [[Roman alphabet]] was among these, being based on the [[Archaic Greek alphabets|alphabet]] of [[Caere]], a [[Chalcis|Chalcidian]] colony. There are a few very early Roman inscriptions; but they do not become common until the 3rd century BC; from that time the letters took much the same forms as they preserve to the present day.

The custom of putting inscriptions in Greek and in Latin on buildings and other monuments continued through [[medieval]] times, and is still customary, classical forms being frequently imitated. The latest dated inscription in the ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae|Greek Corpus]]'' records the building of a bridge in [[Sicily]] in AD 1121. The series of Byzantine inscriptions continues practically without interruption to the present day; and Latin retains its use as a universal language in religious, public and private inscriptions.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Methods of dating===
{{main article|Dating methodologies in archaeology}}
It is often possible to date an inscription approximately by the style of the lettering, or even by the alphabet used. Thus at Athens the [[Ionic alphabet]] was adopted in place of the early [[Attic Greek|Attic alphabet]] in the archonship of [[Eucleides]], 403 BC, according to a decree proposed by [[Archinus]].{{r|fragment}} But the change was already in process in private inscriptions, and even in official documents Ionic forms are sometimes found earlier. Inscriptions are dated in various ways, mostly by giving the name of a king, magistrate or priest. In the case of kings, they only give an approximate date, unless the year of his reign is given also. But in the case of most independent cities, the date is given by the name of an annual magistrate, and thus the year is precisely indicated. At Athens, the name used was that of the [[Eponymous]] [[Archon]], and as an almost complete list of these has been drawn up from inscriptions and other sources, this means of dating is quite satisfactory. The custom of dating by [[Olympiads]], which is familiar to us from later Greek and Roman writers, was rarely used in early Greece, except in connection with athletic victories. Many inscriptions are dated from various local eras, often based upon historical events, such as the foundation of a town or festival, the organisation of a province, or even a visit of an [[emperor]]. The number of these eras in later times, especially in Asia Minor, becomes very bewildering. In Attic decrees, and some others, it was also usual to give the day of the month.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

In Greek inscription of the Roman period the year of the emperor is defined by the number of his [[consulate]], or other indications or titles, as in the corresponding Latin inscriptions. In later times, the dating is commonly by "Indiction"; but as this only gives the number of the year within the 15-year period, but leaves that period undefined, such dating is very inconvenient except for merely temporary use. In the [[Eastern Empire]] the date from the creation of the world (5509 BC) is sometimes given; but the date of the Christian era is hardly ever used.

[[File:Roman-mosaic-know-thyself.jpg|thumb| Inscription on a Roman [[mosaic]] from excavations in the [[Appian Way]], [[Rome]]. The Greek motto ''gnōthi sauton'' ("know thyself", ''nosce te ipsum'') combines with the image to convey the famous warning: ''Respice post te; hominem te esse memento; [[memento mori]]'' (Look behind; remember that you are mortal; remember death)]]

===Purpose of inscriptions===
Inscriptions may be roughly divided into two main classes: those in which the inscription was subservient to the use or purpose of the object on which it was inscribed, or at any rate had a direct relation to that object — for example, the name of the owner or the record of dedication to a god — and those in which the inscription existed independently for its own sake, or for the sake of the information which it recorded, and the object on which it was inscribed was either made for the purpose, as a slab of marble or plate of bronze, or was made use of, as in the case of a convenient wall or the surface of a rock, or even a [[potsherd]]. The walls of buildings are often covered with such inscriptions, especially if they are in a conspicuous or convenient position, and so offer an obvious means of publicity.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

For us, accustomed as we are to a vast mass of books, newspapers and other printed or digital documents, it is difficult to realise the extensive use and great convenience assigned to inscriptions in ancient times. Not only were public announcements of all sorts, such as we should make known by [[advertisements]] or [[posters]], thus placed before the public, but all kinds of records and enactments — [[codes of law]] and political decrees; regulations for all matters, civil and religious; accounts and contracts, public and private; treaties between states; records of public and private benefactions and dedications, and all matters of administration; honours to the living and to the memory of the dead. Many of these were intended to preserve for all time the records which they contained; but others must have been of only temporary interest. It seems, therefore, the more remarkable that they should have been incised on permanent material such as bronze, marble or stone — and incised in the first instance, with a care and perfection of technique which have led to their survival to the present day, so as to preserve for us invaluable evidence as to the life and institutions of the people who made them. Temporary and permanent value are therefore often combined in the same inscription. For instance, any Athenian citizen, visiting the [[Acropolis]] or the [[Agora]], could satisfy themselves at first hand as to treaties or decrees of the people, public accounts or state income and expenditure. And at the same time these documents preserved for all time much history, both social and political.&lt;ref name=InternationalDictionary&gt;{{cite book |author1=Trudy, Robert |author2=Sharon, Ring |author3=Salkin, Boda |year=1996 |title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe |location= |publisher=Routledge |pages= 66 |isbn=978-1-884964-02-2 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative inscriptions===
[[File:Periander Pio-Clementino Inv276.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bust of [[Periander]] bearing the inscription "Periander, son of [[Cypselus]], [[Corinth]]ian". Marble, Roman copy after a Greek original by [[Kresilas]], 4th century]]
Inscriptions having a direct relation to the object, or representation, on which they are inscribed, vary greatly in their contents. Those relating to [[picture]] or [[relief]] chronicles of the victories or exploits of kings, as in Egypt and Mesopotamia, serve as a record of the events, and help to interpret the scenes. Such inscriptions are not common in Greek or Roman work; but frequently, especially in early Greek times, and on vases, the names of persons and even of objects are written beside them for the purpose of identification, and sometimes a speech issues from the mouth of the figure. On the carved wooden chest of [[Cypselus]], of about 600 BC [[hexameter]] verses were written, curving about among figures, and giving a description of each scene. The bases of statues and reliefs often had inscriptions cut upon them for identification and record. This was particularly the case with honorary statues and tombstones. In other cases, where there is an evident relation between the artistic representation and the inscription, the figures are subordinate and seem merely to illustrate the text, as when a treaty between Athens and [[Samos]] has a relief at its head representing the [[goddess]] [[Athena]] and [[Hera]] clasping hands, as representatives of their respective cities. In other cases, the arms or device of a city is carved on an inscription, almost like a seal on a document. In all these cases the figures and the inscription are part of a common design, whether carried out by the same hand or not. But in the case of owners' marks or names cut on vases or other objects, or of the dedication of such objects, the inscription is not necessarily contemporary; it may indeed be misleading, as in the case, mentioned with disapproval by [[Cicero]], of using again old Greek statues and placing new dedicatory inscriptions on them in Roman times, a sort of "recycling": for instance, one of the statues of Athenian knights of the 5th century BC placed at the entrance of the Acropolis, had a later inscription cut on its base to make it serve as an equestrian statue of [[Germanicus]], probably in 18 AD when he visited Athens. In Egypt and Mesopotamia also it is not unusual to find the name of a later king of official cut upon an earlier work.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the [[Cicero]] reference cf. {{cite book |author=Margherita Guarducci   |authorlink=Margherita Guarducci |year=1995 |title=Epigrafia greca |location=Rome |publisher=Ist. Poligrafico dello Stato |pages= 87ff |isbn= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent inscriptions===
The majority of inscriptions are of independent value and interest, the object on which they are cut being either provided for the purpose or utilised as convenient and suitable. Such inscriptions may be classified as ''(a) Religious'' and ''(b) Political and Social''. The distinction between the two is not always easy to draw; for in almost all ancient civilisations religion was a part of the established service of the State, and was under public control, or at least was closely bound up with political administration. It follows that many inscriptions relating to religious matters take the form of political decrees or state documents, and therefore might, especially as far as form is concerned, be included in either category; but it is usually possible to classify them according to their contents and intention.

====Temples, their foundation and administration====
A [[temple]] was often a kind of religious corporation under the control of the State; and its accounts and details of administration were made public at frequent intervals, usually annually, by means of inscriptions, exhibited to public view in its precinct. Many such inscriptions have been found, and supply a great deal of information that can be obtained from no other source. Some great temples, such as that of [[Apollo]] on the island of [[Delos]], held great amounts of property, both real and portable, the latter taking the form either of more or less precious offerings dedicated in the temple and its surrounding buildings, or of coined money. The inscriptions accordingly record gifts and acquisitions of landed property, leases and assignments, payments of rent and fines for default, loans and interest and many other business transactions suitable to a great landed proprietor or to a bank. They therefore throw much light upon the social and economic conditions of ancient life, such as are nowhere else recorded. Again, the lists of offerings dedicated in the temple and other buildings enable us to realise almost visually the appearance of their contents. These are described as being on the floor, on the walls, on shelves or in cases; they consisted of vases and other objects suitable for use in the temple service; ornaments and jewels; statuettes, mostly in gold and silver; weapons and tools; coined money; and [[bullion]], mostly melted down from old offerings. The detailed care that was taken in this last case, to ensure that the full weight of these objects was preserved, whether made into a new vessel or not, is recorded in other inscriptions. These elaborate inventories were checked and revised by each successive board of administrators, and gave the best possible security against any robbery or [[peculation]]. In addition to such general lists, there are also innumerable records of various gifts and acquisitions, whether of land and houses, or of movable property of all sorts. Buildings and repairs are also recorded, sometimes by the State, sometimes by individuals, whose piety and generosity are suitably honoured. In form, these are often hardly to be distinguished from public works of a secular character, which must be mentioned later.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"/&gt;

The inscriptions on or belonging to special dedications are often of great historical interest — there need only be quoted the inscription on the famous [[Serpent Column]], once at [[Delphi]] and now in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], with the list of the Greek States which took part in the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]]; and that relating to the Roman arms dedicated by [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] at [[Dodona]] after his victories. Most of the great temples being of immemorial sanctity, it is hardly to be expected that any records of their foundation should be found in inscriptions. But on the other hand we have many accounts of the dedication of new temples, either by states or communities or by private individuals. In almost all such cases it was necessary to obtain sanction for the foundation from the State; thus the inscription often takes the form of a decree of the people authorising the foundation of the temple and often giving some privileges to the founder or founders.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Priests and other officials====
[[File:KaranisSouthTempleGreekInscr.jpg|thumb|Greek inscription at the south temple, [[Karanis|Kom Aushim (Karanis)]], [[Faiyum]], [[Egypt]]]]
Inscriptions give much information as to priests and other religious officials. There are in the first place lists of priests, some of them covering long periods and even going back to mythical times; there are also lists of treasures and administrators, who were usually lay officials appointed for the purpose, either by election or by lot. The duties and privileges of priests are recorded in many inscriptions, and vary considerably from place to place. It is recorded, for instance, what portions of a victim at any sacrifice were to be received by the priest. In any important temple this must evidently have been far more than the priest or his family could consume, and accordingly it must have been sold, and so constituted a considerable source of income. Consequently, a [[priesthood]] was an office well paid and much sought after; and we actually find in later Greek times, especially in Asia Minor, that priesthoods were frequently sold, under proper guarantees and with due sureties as to the duties being carried out. Sometimes a fee to the priest had to be paid in cash; in some cases a priest or priestess was allowed to take up a collection on certain days. On the other hand, the duties of a priest are often recorded; he had to see to the cleaning and care of the temple and its contents, to provide flowers and garlands for decorations and to supply the regular daily service. Sacrifices on great occasions were usually provided by the State, as also were important repairs; but in some cases a priest undertook these on his own account, and was honoured accordingly — for instance, by being allowed to inscribe his name in the restored temple.

Besides priests, we find many other officials of various ranks attached to temples and recorded in inscriptions. Some of these, especially those who were concerned with buildings or constructions, or with the inventories of temple treasures and the accounts of administration, were lay officials appointed by the State, as in the case of political officers. But many others had specialised sacerdotal functions; for instance, in many places there were ''[[manteis]]'' or prophets, often of special families with hereditary skills in [[divination]]; at [[Eleusis]] we find records of the [[hierophant]], the torch-bearer, and others who took part in the celebration of the mysteries. At Olympia, in later Greek times, we find a remarkable list of officials, that is: three priests, three libation pourers, two prophets, three custodians (of keys), a flute-player, an interpreter, a priest for the daily sacrifice, a secretary, a wine-pourer, three dancers at libations, a woodman (to supply wood for the sacrifices), and a steward and cook — the last no sinecure, in view of the numerous sacrificial feasts.

There were also many more menial offices in the service of temples which were carried out by slaves. Such slaves were often presented to the temple or acquired in some other way. There is a whole class of inscriptions, found on many sites, in which the sale of slaves to a temple or to the god of a temple is recorded. It is often difficult to know whether such slaves were intended for the service of a temple, or, on the other hand, such service was either purely formal or was not required at all, the sale to the temple being intended as fictitious, so as to enable a slave to acquire his own freedom and at the same time to secure the protection of the god in his free status.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Ritual====
[[File:Votive relief Asklepios BM809.jpg|thumb|Votive relief for the cure of a bad leg, inscription from the shrine of [[Asclepius]] at [[Milos]], [[Ægean Sea]].]]

The ritual appropriate to different divinities and temples varied greatly from place to place; and it was, therefore, necessary or desirable to set up notices in all public places of worship for the information and guidance of worshippers. The commonest and most essential act of worship was sacrifice; an example of the simplest form of prescription is to be seen in the inscription on the relief from [[Thasos]] in the [[Louvre]]:— "To the [[Nymphs]] and to Apollo the leader of the Nymphs, the worshipper may, if he so choose, sacrifice a male and a female victim. It is not permissible to offer a sheep or a pig. No [[paean]] is sung. To the [[Graces]] it is not permissible to offer a goat or a pig."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Louvre%20Ma%20696&amp;object=Sculpture Louvre Ma 696 (Sculpture)], ''Relief Plaques from Thasos''; see also classification on [http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/4DLink3/4DACTION/LSAGwebDisplayInscription?searchTerm=Relief&amp;searchType=browse&amp;searchField=object&amp;returnList=0&amp;sequence=0&amp;thisListPosition=8 Poinikastas:"Thasos, inscriptions"] - IG vol. xii.8 no. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is to be noticed that this order of service contains a prohibition as well as a prescription. Such prohibitions are frequent, and often relate to the need of ceremonial purity in all worshippers entering a sacred precinct. They must for a certain time have abstained from certain prescribed means of pollution, varying from place to place. The officials are sometimes ordered to erect notices giving information on this point; for instance, at the precinct of [[Alectrona]] at [[Ialysus]], it was prescribed that "no horse, ass, mule, nor any other animal with a bushy tail should enter, and that nobody should bring such animals in or wear shoes or any article produced from pigs. There is also a fine for driving in sheep."&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt; Other precincts were protected in a more general manner from any invasion or violation. It was prohibited to cut wood or to remove earth and stones, or to drive any beasts into some precincts; the right of erecting booths was either restricted or denied altogether. Sometimes more detailed prescriptions are given for the whole organisation of a festival; thus, at [[Andania]], in [[Messenia]], the arrangements for the celebration of the local [[Eleusinia]], the dress of the participants, the officials and policing, are very fully described. Similarly, in the Hall of the Iobacchi, at Athens, the order of proceedings, the officers and the characters in the sacred play, and various administrative details are ordered.&lt;ref name="GEpi"&gt;Cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ECc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=hall+of+the+Iobacchi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bUASHSU5ET&amp;sig=7bVtQ6GblyM1sojunQokSFuWsp0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bddVUd6wKafI0QWx2YGABA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hall%20of%20the%20Iobacchi&amp;f=false ''An Introduction to Greek Epigraphy''], Cambridge University Press - (undated, no author cited)Googlebook; see also [https://books.google.com/books?id=tTUFC3S-7r4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=hall+of+the+Iobacchi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LWja_v4xvP&amp;sig=d2eJ6F9VifPiDz35NlU7PXqzFbg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bddVUd6wKafI0QWx2YGABA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hall%20of%20the%20Iobacchi&amp;f=false ''Ancient Athens''], Haskell House Publ., 1902 (no author cited) Googlebook&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is any doubt about any ritual or procedure, divination is often resorted to, and the results of such divination are recorded in inscriptions as a guidance for the future; it was also a common practice to consult Delphi or some other [[oracle]] in doubtful or difficult cases; there the exact method of procedure is sometimes recorded, as well as the response of the oracle. Forms of worship are often prescribed or recorded, especially hymns, which are sometimes inscribed together with their musical notation. The performance of songs or hymns and dances are also matters of constant reference, especially in connection with lyrical or musical contests; the victorious band or performer often dedicated the prize in honour of the god. A special form of contest was that in dramatic performances, of which many records have survived, both from Athens and from many other parts of the Greek world. The regulation of athletic festivals, and the records of victors in their contests, also form a numerous class of inscriptions. As regards mysteries, though there are numerous regulations affecting the arrangement of celebrations and the conduct of those participating, there is, as was to be expected, very little concerning the actual performances.

Another interesting phase of Greek religion known to us mainly from inscriptions is offered by the shrines of healing. The most notable of these is the precinct of [[Asclepius]] at [[Epidaurus]]. Here have been found, on large slabs of inscription, compiled, in all probability, from earlier documents, lists of the cures effected by Apollo and Asclepius. The cures are of the most varied kinds, from painful diseases or surgical cases to a lost boy and a broken cup. The formula is in almost all cases the same: the consultant come to Epidaurus, sleeps in the ''[[Epidaurus|abaton]]'', has dreams or sees visions, and comes out whole. In later times, when such faith-healing had probably become less efficacious, elaborate prescriptions of diet and hygiene are recorded.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"/&gt;

A special form of prayer consists of curses, which were often buried in the ground, probably with the intent to reach the infernal gods. Such curses often give the reason for their being made, usually some injury done to the author of the curse; sometimes they devote the offender to the infernal gods.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Private associations for religious purposes====
Another elements in Greek religion which is known to us almost exclusively by means of inscriptions, is to be found in the religious associations that existed in many Greek cities, apart from the organisation of state religion, though sometimes recognised by it. These associations had each its own regulations, which were duly recorded in inscriptions; they varied greatly both in purpose and in character. Many of them had a definitely religious purpose, in the worship of certain gods; sometimes an alien community was given special permission to worship its own god or gods in its own way. Other associations were more social in character and served as clubs, or as burial societies. A remarkable feature about such associations is that the lists of members of many of them include the names of women and of slaves, thus contrasting with the civic basis of established religion in Greece, and anticipating a religion in which "there can be neither [[Jew]] nor [[Greek people|Greek]], there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female."&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#3:28|Galatians 3:28]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and social===

====Codes of law and regulations====
Ancient writers state that the earliest laws of Athens were inscribed upon tablets of wood, put together in a pyramidal shape. These, owing to their material, have perished; but we have some very early [[codes of law]] preserved on stone, notably at [[Gortyna]] in Crete. Here an inscription of great length is incised on the slabs of a theatre-shaped structure in 12 columns of 50 lines each; it is mainly concerned with the law of inheritance, adoption, etc. Doubtless similar inscriptions were set up in many places in Greece. An interesting series of inscriptions deals with the conditions under which colonists were sent out from various cities, and the measures that were taken to secure their rights as citizens. A bronze tablet records in some detail the arrangements of this sort made when [[Locrians]] established a colony in [[Naupactus]]; another inscription relates to the Athenian colonisation of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], in the 6th century BC.

====Decrees of people and rulers, later of kings and emperors====
A very large number of inscriptions are in the form of decrees of various cities and peoples, even when their subject matter suggests that they should be classified under other headings. Almost all legislative and many administrative measures take this form; often a decree prescribes how and where the inscription should be set up. The formulae and preambles of such decrees vary considerably from place to place, and from period to period. Those of Athens are by far the most exactly known, owing to the immense number that have been discovered; and they are so strictly stereotyped that can be classified with the precision of algebraic formulae, and often dated to within a few years by this test alone. Very full lists for this purpose have been drawn up by epigraphist Wilhelm Larfeld, in his work on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. his classic work (downloadable) [https://archive.org/details/griechischeepigr00larf ''Griechische Epigraphik'' (1914)] at [[University of Toronto]] - Robarts Library, eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usual to record the year (by the name of the eponymous archon), the day of the month and of the [[prytany]] (or presiding commission according to tribes), various secretaries, the presiding officials and the proposer of the decree. It is also stated whether the resolution is passed by the senate ([[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule]]) or the assembly of the people ([[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]]), or both. The circumstances or the reason of the resolution are then given, and finally the decision itself. Some other cities followed Athens in the form of their decrees, with such local variations as were required; others were more independent in their development, and different magistracies or forms of government had various results. In the [[Hellenistic Age]], and later, the forms of independent government were, to a great extent, kept up, though little real power remained with the people. On the other hand, it is common thing to find letters from kings, and later from [[Roman emperors]], inscribed and set up in public places.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Public accounts, treasure lists, building inscriptions====
It was customary to inscribe on stone all records of the receipt, custody and expenditure of public money or treasure, so that citizens could verify for themselves the safety and due control of the State in all financial matters. As in the case of temple accounts, it was usual for each temporary board of officials to render to their successors an account of their stewardship, and of the resources and treasures which they handed over. In all cases of public works, the expenditure was ordered by the State, and detailed reports were drawn up and inscribed on stone at intervals while the work was being carried out. In many cases there is a detailed specification of building work which makes it possible, not only to realise all the technical details and processes employed, but also the whole plan and structure of a building. A notable instance is the [[arsenal]] of [[Philon]] at the [[Peiraeus]] which has been completely reconstructed on paper by architects from the building specification.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phil"&gt;Built under the administration of [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]], {{cite book|author=Smith, Sir William, ed.|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology|chapter=Philon, A very eminent architect at Athens|year=1859|volume=vol. III|location=Boston|publisher=Little, Brown, and Company|page= 314|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314}}. E. A. Gardner, ''op.cit.'' p. 557, observes that it "is perhaps known to us more in detail than any other lost monument of antiquity." It was to hold the rigging of the [[galley]]s; and was so contrived that all its contents were visible from a central hall, and so liable to the inspection of the Athenian [[democracy]]. Philon's arsenal was destroyed by the forces of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in the [[First Mithridatic War#Sulla's siege of Athens, summer 87-early 86 BC|Roman conquest of Athens in 86 BC]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the [[Erechtheum]], we have not only a detailed report on the unfinished state of the building in 409 BC, but also accounts of the expenditure and payments to the workmen employed in finishing it. Similar accounts have been preserved of the building of the [[Parthenon]], spread over 15 years; in the case of both the Parthenon and the Erechtheum, there are included the payments made to those who made the sculptures.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Jenkins   |title=Greek Architecture And Its Sculpture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLego4eAgZUC|accessdate=29 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02388-8|pages=118–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jeffrey M. Hurwit   |title=The Athenian Acropolis: History, Mythology, and Archeology from the Neolithic Era to the Present |year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-42834-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval and military expenditure is also fully accounted for; among other information there are records of the [[galley]]-slips at the different harbours of the Piraeus, and of the ships of the Athenian navy, with their names and condition. In short, there is no department of state economy and financial administration that is not abundantly illustrated by the record of inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Phil"/&gt; A set of records of high historical value are the ''"tribute lists"'', recording the quota paid to Athens by her [[Members of the Delian League|subject allies]] during the 5th century BC. These throw much light on her relations with them at various periods.(Cf. [[Delian League]]).

[[File:Stele with an ephebic list NAMA 1484 (DerHexer).JPG|thumb|[[Stele]] with an [[ephebos|ephebic]] list, Athens, 4th century BC]]

====Ephebic inscriptions====
An institution as to which our knowledge is mainly derived from inscriptions is the [[ephebos|ephebic system]] at Athens. There are not only records of lists of [[ephebos|ephebi]] and of their guardians and instructors, but also decrees in honour of their services, especially in taking their due part in religious and other ceremonies, and resolutions of the ephebi themselves in honour of their officials. It is possible to trace in the inscriptions, which range over several centuries, how what was originally a system of physical and military training for Athenian youths from age of 18 to 20, with outpost and police duties, was gradually transformed. In later times there were added to the instructors in military exercises others who gave lectures on what we should now call arts and science subjects; so that in the Hellenistic and Roman times, when youths from all parts of the civilised world flocked to Athens as an intellectual centre, the ephebic system became a kind of cosmopolitan university.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=O. W. Reinmuth   |title=The Ephebic Inscriptions of the Fourth Century B.C. |url= |accessdate= |year=1971 |publisher=Leiden Brill |isbn= |pages= ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treaties and political and commercial agreements; arbitration, etc.====
In addition to inscriptions which are concerned with the internal affairs of various cities, there are many others recording treaties or other agreements of an international character between various cities and states. These were incised on bronze or stone, and set up in places of public resort in the cities concerned, or in common religious centres such as Olympia and Delphi. The simplest form of treaty is merely an alliance for a certain term of years, usually with some penalty for any breach of the conditions. Often an oath was prescribed, to be taken by representatives on each side; it was also not unusual to appeal to the god in whose temple the treaty was exhibited. In other cases a list of gods by whom the two parties must swear is prescribed. Commercial clauses were sometimes added to treaties of alliance, and commercial treaties are also found, agreeing as to the export and import of merchandise and other things. In later days, especially in the time of the Hellenistic kings, treaties tend to become more complicated and detailed in their provisions.&lt;ref name="GEpi"/&gt;

Another series of records of great historical interest is concerned with arbitration between various states on various questions, mainly concerned with frontiers. In cases of dispute it was not uncommon for the two disputants to appoint a third party as arbitrator. Sometimes this third party was another State, sometimes a specified number of individuals. Thus, in a frontier dispute between Corinth and [[Epidaurus]], 151 citizens of [[Megara]] were appointed by name to arbitrate, and when the decision was disputed, 31 from among them revised and confirmed it. In all such cases it was the custom for a full record to be preserved on stone and set up in the places concerned. In this case the initiative in referring the matter to arbitration came from the [[Achaean League]].&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Proxenia decrees====
A very large class of inscriptions deals with the institution of ''[[proxenia]]''. According to this a citizen of any State might be appointed ''proxenos'' of another State; his duties would then be to offer help and hospitality to any citizen of that other State who might be visiting his city, and to assist him in any dispute or in securing his legal rights. The office has been compared to the modern appointment of [[consul (representative)|consul]]s, with the essential difference that the ''proxenos'' is always a citizen of the state in which he resides, not of that whose citizens and interests he assists. The decrees upon this matter frequently record the appointment of a ''proxenos'', and the conferring on him of certain benefits and privileges in return for his services; they also contain resolutions of thanks from the city served by the ''proxenos'', and record honours consequently conferred upon him.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=Enrica Culasso Gastaldi   |title=Le prossenie ateniesi del IV secolo a.C.: gli onorati asiatici (Fonti e studi di storia antica, 10) |url= |accessdate= |year=2004 |location=Alessandria |publisher=Edizioni dell'Orso |isbn= |pages= ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Honours and privileges given to individuals====
This class of inscription is in form not unlike the last, except that honours recorded are given for all sorts of services, private and public, to the State and to individuals. A frequent addition is an invitation to dine in the [[Prytaneum]] at Athens. Some are inscribed on the bases of statues set up to the recipient. In early times these inscriptions are usually brief and simple. The bust of [[Pericles]] on the Acropolis held nothing but the names of Pericles himself and of the sculptor [[Kresilas]]. Later it became usual to give, in some detail, the reasons for the honours awarded; and in Hellenistic and Roman times, these became more and more detailed and fulsome in laudatory detail.

====Signatures of artists====
[[File:Sophilos me grafsen inscription Lebes BM 1971.11-1.1.jpg|thumb|Black-figure [[dinos]] with stand, Attic, c. 570 BC. Signed by [[Sophilos]]: ΣΟΦΙΛΟΣ [...] ΜΕΓΡΑΦΣΕΝ, "Sophilos drew me"]]

These inscriptions are of special interest as throwing much light upon the history of art. The artist's name was usually, especially in earlier times, carved upon the base of the pedestal of a statue, and consequently was easily separated from it if the statue was carried off or destroyed. A case where both statue and pedestal are preserved is offered by the ''[[Victory]]'', signed on its pedestal by [[Paeonius]] at Olympia. Occasionally, and more frequently in later times, the artist's signature was carved upon some portion of the statue itself. But in later copies of well-known works, it has to be considered whether the name is that of the original artist or of the copyist who reproduced his work. (see for example, [[#FN1|the statue of Hercules/Heracles]] below)

A special class of artists' signatures is offered by the names signed by [[Attic vase|Attic]] and other vase painters upon their vases. These have been made the basis of a minute [[Pottery of ancient Greece|historical and stylistic study]] of the work of these painters, and unsigned vases also have been grouped with the signed ones, so as to make an exact and detailed record of this branch of Greek artistic production.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'', {{cite book|author=Joseph Veach Noble   |title=The Techniques of Painted Attic Pottery |url= |accessdate= |year=1988 |location=New York |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0500050477 |pages=}}; {{cite book|author=Martin Robinson   |title=The Art of Vase-Painting in Classical Athens |url= |accessdate= |year=1992 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521338813 |pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical records====
The great majority of these fall into one of the classes already referred to. But there are some instances in which an inscription is set up merely as a record. For instance, a victor in athletic or other contests may set up a list of his victories. The most famous historical record is the [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|autobiographical account of the deeds and administration]] of [[Augustus]], which was reproduced and set up in many places; it is generally known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]], because the most complete copy of it was found at [[Ancyra]]. The [[Marmor Parium]] at [[Oxford]], found in [[Paros]], is a chronological record of Greek history, probably made for educational purposes, and valuable as giving the traditional dates of events from the earliest time down.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author1=P. Botteri |author2=G. Fangi |title=The Ancyra Project: the Temple of Augustus and Rome |url= |accessdate= |year=2003 |location=Ankara |publisher=ISPRS Archives, volume XXXIV part 5/W12 Commission V |isbn= |pages=84–88}}; see also ''[https://archive.org/details/parianchronicle00robegoog The Parian chronicle, or The chronicle of the Arundelian marbles; with a dissertation concerning its authenticity]'' by [[Joseph Robertson (clergyman)|Joseph Robertson]] 1788, from the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tombs and epitaphs====
This is by far the most numerous class of inscriptions, both Greek and Latin. In early times there is often no record beyond the name of the deceased in Athens, often with the name of his father and his [[deme]]. Sometimes a word or two of conventional praise is added, such as "a good and wise man". Occasionally the circumstances of death are alluded to, especially if it took place in battle or at sea. Such [[epitaph]]s were frequently in [[metrical form]], usually either [[hexameter]] or [[elegiacs]]. Many of them have been collected, and they form an interesting addition to the Greek anthology. In later times it becomes usual to give more elaborate praise of the deceased; but this is hardly ever so detailed and fulsome as on more modern tombstones. The age and other facts about the deceased are occasionally given, but not nearly so often as on Latin tombstones, which offer valuable statistical information in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'' the interesting ''[[Epitaph of Seikilos]]'' by C. V. Palisca &amp; J. P. Burkholder, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin inscriptions==
{{See also|Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|List of classical abbreviations}}
[[File:Aquileia Basilica - Ausgrabungen Mosaik 5.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of Aquileia]], 4th-century mosaic with Latin inscription: ''IANUARI DEDEI DONO P * DCCCLXX'' (Januarius paid for 870 square feet of mosaic)]]

[[Latin language|Latin]] inscriptions may be classified on much the same lines as Greek; but certain broad distinctions may be drawn at the outset. They are generally more standardised as to form and as to content, not only in Rome and Italy, but also throughout the [[provinces of the Roman Empire]]. One of the chief difficulties in deciphering [[Latin Inscriptions]] lies in the very extensive use of [[List of classical abbreviations|initials and abbreviations]]. These are of great number and variety, and while some of them can be easily interpreted as belonging to well-known formulae, others offer considerable difficulty, especially to the inexperienced student.&lt;ref&gt;A mere list of such initials and abbreviations occupies 68 pages in [[René Cagnat]]'s ''Cours d'épigraphie Latine'' (repr. 1923). A selection is included in [[Wikipedia]]'s "[[List of classical abbreviations]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Often the same initial may have many different meanings according to the context. Some common formulae such as '''V.S.L.M.''' (''votum solvit libens merito''), or '''H.M.H.N.S.''' (''hoc monumentum heredem non sequetur'') offer little difficulty, but there are many which are not so obvious and leave room for conjecture. Often the only way to determine the meaning is to search through a list of initials, such as those given by modern Latin epigraphists, until a formula is found which fits the context.

Most of what has been said about Greek inscriptions applies to Roman also. The commonest materials in this case also are stone, marble and bronze; but a more extensive use is made of stamped bricks and tiles, which are often of historical value as identifying and dating a building or other construction. The same applies to leaden water pipes which frequently bear dates and names of officials. Terracotta lamps also frequently have their makers' names and other information stamped upon them. Arms, and especially shields, sometimes bear the name and corps of their owners. Leaden discs were also used to serve the same purpose as modern identification discs. Inscriptions are also found on sling bullets — Roman as well as Greek; there are also numerous classes of ''[[tesserae]]'' or tickets of admission to theatres or other shows.

As regards the contents of inscriptions, there must evidently be a considerable difference between records of a number of independent city states and an empire including almost all the civilised world; but municipalities maintained much of their independent traditions in Roman times, and consequently their inscriptions often follow the old formulas.

The classification of Roman inscriptions may, therefore, follow the same lines as the Greek, except that certain categories are absent, and that some others, not found in Greek, are of considerable importance.

These are very numerous; and the custom of placing the name of the dedicator in a conspicuous place on the building was prevalent, especially in the case of dedications by emperors or officials, or by public bodies. Restoration or repair was often recorded in the same manner. In the case of small objects the dedication is usually simple in form; it usually contains the name of the god or other recipient and of the donor, and a common formula is '''D.D.''' (''dedit, donavit'') often with additions such as '''L.M.''' (''libens merito''). Such dedications are often the result of a vow, and '''V.S.''' (''votum solvit'') is therefore often added. Bequests made under the wills of rich citizens are frequently recorded by inscriptions; these might either be for religious or for social purposes.

====Priests and officials====
A priesthood was frequently a political office and consequently is mentioned along with political honours in the list of a man's distinctions. The priesthoods that a man had held are usually mentioned first in inscriptions before his civil offices and distinctions. Religious offices, as well as civil, were restricted to certain classes, the highest to those of senatorial rank, the next to those of [[Equestrian order|equestrian status]]; many minor offices, both in Rome and in the provinces, are enumerated in their due order.

====Regulations as to religion and cult====
Among the most interesting of these is the ancient song and accompanying dance performed by the priests known as the [[Arval Brothers]]. This is, however, not in the form of a ritual prescription, but a detailed record of the due performance of the rite. An important class of documents is the series of calendars that have been found in Rome and in the various Italian towns. These give notice of religious festivals and anniversaries, and also of the days available for various purposes.

====Colleges====
The various collegese for religious purposes were very numerous. Many of them, both in Rome and Italy, and in provincial municipalities, were of the nature of priesthoods. Some were regarded as offices of high distinction and were open only to men of senatorial rank; among these were the [[Augurs]], the [[Fetiales]], the [[Salii]]; also the [[Sodales Augustales|Sodales Divorum Augustorum]] in imperial times. The records of these colleges sometimes give no information beyond the names of members, but these are often of considerable interest. [[Haruspices]] and [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#Luperci|Luperci]] were of equestrian rank.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Political and social===

====Codes of law and regulations====
Our information as to these is not mainly drawn from inscriptions and, therefore, they need not here be considered. On the other hand, the word ''lex'' (law) is usually applied to all decrees of the senate or other bodies, whether of legislative or of administrative character. It is therefore, best to consider all together under the heading of public decrees.

====Laws and plebiscites, senatus consulta, decrees of magistrates or later of emperors====
A certain number of these dating from republican times are of considerable interest. One of the earliest relates to the prohibition of [[Bacchanalia|bacchanalian orgies]] in Italy; it takes the form of a message from the magistrates, stating the authority on which they acted. Laws all follow a fixed formula, according to the body which has passed them. First there is a statement that the legislative body was consulted by the appropriate magistrate in due form; then follows the text of the law; and finally the sanction, the statement that the law was passed. In decrees of the senate the formula differs somewhat. They begin with a preamble giving the names of the consulting magistrates, the place and conditions of the meeting; then comes the subject submitted for decision, ending with the formula '''QDERFP''' (''quid de ea re fieri placeret''); then comes the decision of the senate, opening with '''DERIC''' (''de ea re ita censuerunt''). '''C.''' is added at the end, to indicate that the decree was passed. In imperial times, the emperor sometimes addressed a speech to the senate, advising them to pass certain resolutions, or else, especially in later times, gave orders or instructions directly, either on his own initiative or in response to questions or references. The number and variety of such orders is such that no classification of them can be given here. One of the most famous is the edict of [[Diocletian]], [[Edict on Maximum Prices|fixing the prices of all commodities]]. Copies of this in Greek as well as in Latin have been found in various parts of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=E.R. Graser   |title=An Economic Survey of Ancient Rome Volume V: Rome and Italy of the Empire |editor=T. Frank |url= |accessdate= |year=1940 |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press — esp. "A text and translation of the Edict of Diocletian" |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Records of buildings, etc.====
[[File:Hans lutz Pfk bozen.jpg|thumb|German inscription recording the building of [[Bozen]]-Bolzano's Parish Church ([[South Tyrol]]) by Hans Lutz of Schussenried, from the early 16th century (1501–1519)]]
A very large number of inscriptions record the construction or repair of public buildings by private individuals, by magistrates, Roman or provincial, and by emperors. In addition to the dedication of temples, we find inscriptions recording the construction of [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]]s, roads, especially on [[milestone]]s, baths, [[basilica]]s, [[portico]]s and many other works of public utility. In inscriptions of early period often nothing is given but the name of the person who built or restored the edifice and a statement that he had done so. But later it was usual to give more detail as to the motive of the building, the name of the emperor or a magistrate giving the date, the authority for the building and the names and distinctions of the builders; then follows a description of the building, the source of the expenditure (e.g., '''S.P.''', ''sua pecunia'') and finally the appropriate verb for the work done, whether building, restoring, enlarging or otherwise improving. Other details are sometimes added, such as the name of the man under whose direction the work was done.

====Military documents====
[[File:AMG - Ziegel Cohors III.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Brick stamp with military record: "C(ohors) III BR(acaraugustanorum)", from [[Bavaria]].]]

These vary greatly in content, and are among the most important documents concerning the administration of the Roman Empire. "They are numerous and of all sorts — tombstones of every degree, lists of soldiers' burial clubs, certificates of discharge from service, schedules of time-expired men, dedications of altars, records of building or of engineering works accomplished. The facts directly commemorated are rarely important."&lt;ref name="Haverf"&gt;{{aut|Francis Haverfield}}, "Roman Authority" in {{aut|S. R. Driver, D. G. Hogarth, F. L. Griffith}}, ''et al.'' ''Authority and Archaeology, Sacred and Profane: Essays On the Relation of Monuments to Biblical and Classical Literature'', Ulan Press (repr. 2012), p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; But when the information from hundreds of such inscriptions is collected together, "you can trace the whole policy of the Imperial Government in the matter of recruiting, to what extent and till what date legionaries were raised in Italy; what contingents for various branches of the service were drawn from the provinces, and which provinces provided most; how far provincials garrisoned their own countries, and which of them, like the British recruits, were sent as a measure of precaution to serve elsewhere; or, finally, at what epoch the empire grew weak enough to require the enlistment of barbarians from beyond its frontiers."&lt;ref name="Haverf"/&gt;

====Treaties and agreements====
There were many treaties between Rome and other states in [[Roman Republic|republican times]]; but we do not, as a rule, owe our knowledge of these to inscriptions, which are very rare in this earlier period. In imperial times, to which most Latin inscriptions belong, international relations were subject to the universal domination of Rome, and consequently the documents relating to them are concerned with reference to the central authority, and often take the form of orders from the emperor.

====Proxeny====
{{See also|Patronage in ancient Rome}}
This custom belonged to Greece. What most nearly corresponded to it in Roman times was the adoption of some distinguished Roman as its ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]]'', by a city or state. The relation was then recorded, usually on a bronze tablet placed in some conspicuous position in the town concerned. The patron probably also kept a copy in his house, or had a portable tablet which would ensure his recognition and reception.

====Honorary====
Honorary inscriptions are extremely common in all parts of the Roman world. Sometimes they are placed on the bases of statues, sometimes in documents set up to record some particular benefaction or the construction of some public work. The offices held by the person commemorated, and the distinctions conferred upon him are enumerated in a regularly established order (''[[cursus honorum]]''), either beginning with the lower and proceeding step by step to the higher, or in reverse order with the highest first. Religious and priestly offices are usually mentioned before civil and political ones. These might be exercised either in Rome itself, or in the various municipalities of the empire. There was also a distinction drawn between offices that might be held only by persons of senatorial rank, those that were assigned to persons of equestrian rank, and those of a less distinguished kind. It follows that when only a portion of an inscription has been found, it is often possible to restore the whole in accordance with the accepted order.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Signatures of artists====
When these are attached to statues, it is sometimes doubtful whether the name is that of the man who actually made the statue, or of the master whose work it reproduces. Thus there are two well-known copies of a statue of [[Hercules]] by [[Lysippus]], of which one is said to be the work of Lysippus, and the other states that it was [[#FN1|made by Glycon (see images)]]. Another kind of artist's or artificer's signature that is commoner in Roman times is to be found in the signatures of potters upon lamps and various kinds of vessels; they are usually impressed on the mould and stand out in relief on the terracotta or other material. These are of interest as giving much information as to the commercial spread of various kinds of handicrafts, and also as to the conditions under which they were manufactured.

====Historical records====
Many of these inscriptions might well be assigned to one of the categories already considered. But there are some which were expressly made to commemorate an important event, or to preserve a record. Among the most interesting is the inscription of the ''[[Rostral column|Columna Rostrata]]'' in Rome, which records the great naval victory of [[Gaius Duilius]] over the [[Carthaginians]]; this, however, is not the original, but a later and somewhat modified version. A document of high importance is a summary of the life and achievements of Augustus, already mentioned, and known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]]. The various sets of [[Fasti]] constituted a record of the names of consuls, and other magistrates or high officials, and also of the triumphs accorded to conquering generals.

====Inscriptions on tombs====
[[Image:Scipio-tomb.jpg|thumb|left|The [[tomb]] of [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]], erected around 150 BC, contains an [[Old Latin]] inscription in [[Saturnian Metre]].]]
These are probably the most numerous of all classes of inscriptions; and though many of them are of no great individual interest, they convey, when taken collectively, much valuable information as to the distribution and transference of population, as to trades and professions, as to health and longevity, and as to many other conditions of ancient life. The most interesting early series is that on the tombs of the [[Scipio (cognomen)|Scipios]] at Rome, recording, mostly in [[Saturnian Metre]], the exploits and distinctions of the various members of that family.&lt;ref name="Cour"&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=Edward Courtney   |title=MUSA LAPIDARIA: A Selection of Latin Verse Inscriptions |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |location=Atlanta |publisher=Scholars Press |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the end of the republic and the beginning of the empire, it became customary to head a tombstone with the letters '''D.M.''' or '''D.M.S.''' (''Dis Manibus sacrum''), thus consecrating the tomb to the deceased as having become members of the [[Manes|body of ghosts or spirits of the dead]]. These are followed by the name of the deceased, usually with his father's name and his tribe, by his honours and distinctions, sometimes by a record of his age. The inscription often concludes with '''H.I.''' (''Hic iacet''), or some similar formula, and also, frequently, with a statement of boundaries and a prohibition of violation or further use — for instance, '''H.M.H.N.S.''' (''hoc monumentum heredem non sequetur'', this monument is not to pass to the heir). The person who has erected the monument and his relation to the deceased are often stated; or if a man has prepared the tomb in his lifetime, this also may be stated, '''V.S.F.''' (''vivus sibi fecit''). But there is an immense variety in the information that either a man himself or his friend may wish to record.&lt;ref name="Cour"/&gt;

====Milestones and boundaries====
Milestones (''[[Miliarium#Milestones and markers|miliaria]]'') have already been referred to, and may be regarded as records of the building of roads. Boundary stones (''[[Boundary marker|termini]]'') are frequently found, both of public and private property. A well-known instance is offered by those set up by the commissioners called '''III. viri A.I.A.''' (''agris iudicandis adsignandis'') in the time of the [[Gracchi]].&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

Latin inscriptions are the meeting point of [[Roman history]] and several arts. These are arts of expression or composition, writing in the strictly physical sense, and design or arrangement. The history is [[Roman history]] in its largest sense, involving men and women in many of their affairs, such as life and death, government, law, religious worship — all as illustrated above. The related fields one has to enter in order to fully appreciate the epigraphical study, are many: beside all aspects of Roman history, such more restricted but still large fields as ancient jewelry, [[Etruscology]], Italic and Latin [[philology]], ancient pottery, comparative [[palaeography]], Roman nomenclature, [[Latin verse]], [[lexicography]] (including inconsistencies of spelling, the early lack of a standard orthography0, Roman architecture and [[prosopography]], and the pronunciation of Greek as revealed by the rendering of Greek words in Latin inscriptions and of Latin words in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Arthur E. Gordon, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ywI6SDUggk4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''Latin Epigraphy''], [[University of California Press]], 1983, Introd., pp.3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Euthalian Apparatus''' is a collection of additional editorial material, such as divisions of text, lists, and summaries, to the [[New Testament]]'s [[Book of Acts]], [[Catholic epistles]], and [[Pauline epistles]]. This additional material appears at the beginnings of books, in the margin of the text, and at the ends of books, as well as in line and paragraph separations. This material is traditionally associated with the name of [[Euthalius]].

== Description ==
Euthalius divided the text of the Acts and Catholic epistles into chapters, with a summary of contents at the top of each chapter. To Euthalius were also referred a division of the Acts into 16 αναγνωσεις (''lessons'') and of the Pauline epistles into 31 sections. But these lessons are quite different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=F. H. A.|last= Scrivener|authorlink= Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener|title=[[A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament]]|publisher=[[George Bell &amp; Sons]]|location=London|year=1894|volume=1|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2013}} Euthalius prepared also the text of the Acts and Epistles in which text is written [[Stichometry|stichometrically]].&lt;ref name = Waltz&gt;Robert Waltz, [http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/Divisions.html#Euth ''Euthalian Apparatus'', in: ''Encyclopedia of Textual Criticism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

To the Euthalian Apparatus belong: a chronology of the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]], the martyrdom of Paul, a list of places at which the Epistles were thought to be written, and the names associated with Paul in the headings to the Epistles.&lt;ref name = Ehrman&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]] &amp; [[Bart D. Ehrman]], ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The quotations from the Old Testament cited in the Pauline epistles are numbered and catalogued in a list.&lt;ref name = Waltz/&gt; Overall, the Apparatus is a collection of varied aids for the reader.&lt;ref name = Ehrman/&gt;

The Euthalian Apparatus is contained in numerous manuscripts: [[Codex Mutinensis]], [[Codex Basilensis A. N. IV. 2]], [[Codex Argenteus]], [[Minuscule 3]], [[Minuscule 5|5]], [[Minuscule 6|6]], [[Minuscule 35|35]], [[Minuscule 38|38]], and many other medieval manuscripts of the New Testament.

== Dating ==
The Euthalian apparatus has variously been dated to between the 4th and 7th centuries.&lt;ref name = Marchand&gt;Marchand, James, 1956. "The Gothic Evidence for 'Euthalian Matter,'" in ''Harvard Theological Review'', vol. 49 no. 3, pp. 159-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Marchand]] argued that the Euthalian apparatus probably dated to the first half of the 4th century, arguing that the original must precede its incorporation into [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translations.&lt;ref name = Marchand/&gt;

The Greek texts do not include the Euthalian apparatus until relatively late, but Armenian and Syriac texts incorporated it by the late 5th or early 6th century, with Gothic texts including it by the early/mid 6th century.&lt;ref name = Marchand/&gt; The Greek [[Codex Coislinianus]] includes it in the 6th century. James Marchand argued that either [[Ulfilas|Wulfila/Ulfilas]] had incorporated the Euthalian matter into the Gothic text in the mid 4th century, or Sunnia and Frethela had done so in the early 5th century, with Wulfila/Ulfilas being more likely.&lt;ref name = Marchand/&gt;

== Authorship ==
The authorship usually is attributed to one Euthalius. He was identified as Bishop of Sulci in [[Sardinia]], but according to [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles|Tregelles]] he was a Bishop of Sulca in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Tregelles, ''An Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament'', London 1856, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[William Wake|Wake]] and L. A. Zacagni Euthalius was a Bishop of Sulce, near [[Aswan|Syene]].&lt;ref name = Bleek&gt;{{cite book|first=F. H. A.|last= Scrivener|authorlink= Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener|title=[[A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament]]|publisher=George Bell &amp; Sons|location=London|year=1894|volume=1|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was suggested{{by whom|date=March 2013}} that the name of the real author of the Apparatus was Evagrius.

[[Image:Fabaxo1.jpg|thumb|300px|Fab Tree Hab, a "Local Biota Living Graft Structure"&lt;ref name="TerreformOne" /&gt;]]

The '''Fab Tree Hab''' is a hypothetical ecological home design developed at [[MIT]] by [[Mitchell Joachim]], Javier Arbona and Lara Greden. With the idea of easing the burden Humanity places on the environment with conventional housing by growing "living, breathing" [[tree house|tree homes]].&lt;ref name=CanadaFab&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|title=Grow your own home: 'Fab tree hab'|publisher=|accessdate=2015-11-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115053717/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|archivedate=2016-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be built by allowing native trees to grow over a computer-designed ([[CNC]]) removable [[plywood]] [[scaffold]]. Once the plants are interconnected and stable,&lt;ref name="TerreformOne"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Mitchell Joachim |title=Terreform One |url=http://www.archinode.com/bienal.html |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plywood would be removed and reused. MIT is experimenting with [[trees]] that grow quickly and develop an interwoven root structure that's soft enough to "train" over the scaffold, but then hardens into a more durable structure. The inside walls would be conventional [[clay]] and [[plaster]].

An old methodology new to buildings is introduced in this design - [[pleaching]]. Pleaching is a method of weaving together tree branches to form living [[arch]]ways, [[latticework|lattice]]s, or screens.&lt;ref name=Technologyreview&gt;{{Cite web|author = Tracy Staedter |title=Architects design a living home|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17102|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the technique is also named "[[Tree shaping#Aeroponic culture|Aeroponic culture]]". The load-bearing part of the structure uses trees that self-graft or inosculate such as [[Live oak|Live Oak]], [[Elm]] and [[Dogwood]]. The lattice frame for the walls and roof are created with the branches of the trees. Vines create a dense protective layer woven along the exterior, interspersed with soil pockets and growing plants.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

The Fab Tree Hab is an experiment that would develop over time.  Extra operating costs required over the life-time of the home include pest management with organic pesticides and maintenance of the [[living machine]]'s water treatment system.  Technical demonstration and innovation is still needed for certain components, primarily the bioplastic windows that accept growth of the structure and the management of flows across the wall section to assure that the interior remains dry and animal-free.  All in all, the elapsed time to reach livability is greater than the traditional sense, but so should be the health and longevity of the home and family.  Above all, building this home could be achieved at a minimal price. Depending on the surrounding climate the house is to be grown in, the team expect it will take a minimum of five years to complete its structure.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt; Realization of these homes will begin as an experiment, and it is envisioned that thereafter, the concept of renewal will take on a new architectural form - one of inter-dependency between nature and people.

As of May 2007 Mitchell Joachim stated that there is a "50 per cent" organic project in California, combining natural elements and traditional construction.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;

==Trees==
Main trees suggested to be used are [[elm]]s and [[oak]]s. The teams hopes the homes can be grown using mainly native trees.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

In [[architecture]], '''functionalism''' is the principle that buildings should be designed based solely on the purpose and function of the building. This principle is less self-evident than it first appears, and is a matter of confusion and controversy within the profession, particularly in regard to [[modern architecture]].

The theoretical articulation of functionalism in buildings can be traced back to the [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] triad, where 'utilitas' (variously translated as 'commodity', 'convenience', or 'utility') stands alongside 'venustas' (beauty) and 'firmitas' (firmness) as one of three classic goals of architecture. Functionalist views were typical of some [[Gothic Revival architecture|gothic revival]] architects. In particular, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]] wrote that ''"there should be no features about a building which are not necessary for convenience, construction, or propriety"'' and ''"all ornament should consist of enrichment of the essential construction of the building"''.&lt;ref&gt;A.W.N.Pugin, The true principles of pointed or Christian architecture : set forth in two lectures delivered at St. Marie's, Oscott.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate about functionalism and [[aesthetics]] is often framed as a mutually exclusive choice, when in fact there are architects, like [[Will Bruder]], [[James Polshek]] and [[Ken Yeang]], who attempt to satisfy all three Vitruvian goals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

In the wake of [[World War I]], an international functionalist architecture movement emerged as part of the wave of [[Modernism]]. The ideas were largely inspired by the need to build a new and better world for the people, as broadly and strongly expressed by the social and political movements of Europe after the extremely devastating world war. In this respect, functionalist architecture is often linked with the ideas of [[socialism]] and modern [[humanism]]. A new slight addition to this new wave of functionalism was that not only should buildings and houses be designed around the purpose of functionality, architecture should also be used as a means to physically create a better world and a better life for people in the broadest sense. This new functionalist architecture had the strongest impact in [[Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[USSR]] and the [[Netherlands]], and from the 1930s also in [[Scandinavia]] and [[Finland]].

== History of functionalism ==
{{expand section|reason=Needs to include the philosophical, social and political ideas in Functionalism, which are all very prominent and in many cases defining|date=January 2018}}
In 1896, Chicago architect Louis Sullivan coined the phrase 'form ever follows function', however this aphorism does not relate to a contemporary understanding of the term ‘function’ as utility or the satisfaction of user needs; it was instead based in metaphysics, as the expression of organic essence and could be paraphrased as meaning 'destiny'. &lt;ref&gt;Forty, A. ‘Words &amp; Buildings: Function’, pp 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1930s, functionalism began to be discussed as an aesthetic approach rather than a matter of design integrity (use). The idea of functionalism was conflated with lack of ornamentation, which is a different matter. It became a pejorative term associated with the most bald and brutal ways to cover space, like cheap commercial buildings and sheds, then finally used, for example in academic criticism of Buckminster Fuller's geodesic domes, simply as a synonym for 'gauche'.

For 70 years the influential American architect Philip Johnson held that the profession has no functional responsibility whatsoever, and this is one of the many views today. Johnson said, "Where form comes from I don’t know, but it has nothing at all to do with the functional or sociological aspects of our architecture".[2] The position of postmodern architect Peter Eisenman is based on a user-hostile theoretical basis and even more extreme: "I don't do function."{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Modernism ==
{{Main|Modern architecture}}
Popular notions of [[modern architecture]] are heavily influenced by the work of the Franco-Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]] and the German architect [[Mies van der Rohe]]. Both were functionalists at least to the extent that their buildings were radical simplifications of previous styles. In 1923 Mies van der Rohe was working in [[Weimar culture|Weimar]] Germany, and had begun his career of producing radically simplified, lovingly detailed structures that achieved Sullivan's goal of inherent architectural beauty.  [[Le Corbusier]] famously said "a house is a machine for living in"; his 1923 book ''[[Vers une architecture]]'' was, and still is, very influential, and his early built work such as the [[Villa Savoye]] in [[Poissy]], [[France]], is thought of as prototypically function.

== Czechoslovak Functionalism ==
[[File:Narodni Technicke Museum 2012 01.jpg|thumb|right|National Technical Museum (Prague) 1942 by Milan Babouska]]
Functionalism was a dominant architectonic style in former [[Czechoslovakia]] in the period of 1928-1970 (with an exception of the occupation and a [[Stalinist architecture]] in 1950s). It was a result of fascination first by industrial development and later by an effort "to create a new man and new society" during the period of the socialism (1948–89). Its "program" was formulated by the Club of architects in [[Prague]] in 1924. In 1930s and then in 1960s and 1970s the position of functionalism was dominant and almost exclusive.

== Nordic "funkis" ==
[[File:Kansankatu 47 Oulu 20100321.jpg|thumb|left|Typical railing, flat roof, stucco and colour detail in Nordic funkis (SOK warehouse and offices, Finland)]]
In Scandinavia (including Finland), the international movement and ideas of modernist architecture became widely known among architects at the [[Stockholm Exhibition (1930)|1930 Stockholm Exhibition]], under the guidance of director and Swedish architect [[Gunnar Asplund]]. Enthusiastic architects collected their ideas and inspirations in the manifesto ''[[Acceptera|acceptera!]]'' and in the years thereafter, a functionalist architecture emerged throughout Scandinavia. The genre involves some peculiar features unique to Scandinavia and it is often referred to as "funkis", to distinguish it from functionalism in general. Some of the common features are flat roofing, [[stucco]]ed walls, [[Architectural glass|architectural glazing]] and well-lit rooms, an industrial expression and nautical inspired details, including round windows.&lt;ref&gt;William C Miller (2016): ''Nordic Modernism: Scandinavian Architecture 1890-2017'', The Crowood Press Ltd., {{ISBN|978 1 78500 237 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global stock market crisis and [[1929 economic crisis|economic meltdown in 1929]], instigated the needs to use affordable materials, such as brick and concrete, and to build quickly and efficiently. These needs became another signature of the Nordic version of functionalist architecture, in particular in buildings from the 1930s, and carried over into modernist architecture when industrial serial production became much more prevalent after World War II.&lt;ref name=Connah/&gt;

As most architectural styles, Nordic funkis was international in its scope and several architects designed Nordic funkis buildings throughout the region. Some of the most active architects working internationally with this style, includes [[Edvard Heiberg]], [[Arne Jacobsen]] and [[Alvar Aalto]]. Nordic funkis features prominently in Scandinavian urban architecture, as the need for urban housing and new institutions for the growing [[welfare state]]s exploded after World War II. Funkis had its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s, but functionalist architecture continued to be built long into the 1960s. These later structures, however, tends to be categorized as modernism in a Nordic context.

=== Denmark ===
[[Vilhelm Lauritzen]], [[Arne Jacobsen]] and [[C.F. Møller]] were among the most active and influential Danish architects of the new functionalist ideas and Arne Jacobsen, [[Poul Kjærholm]], [[Kaare Klint]], and others, extended the new approach to design in general, most notably furniture which evolved to become [[Danish modern]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hollingsworth, [[Danish Modern]], 2008, Gibbs Smith, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Danish designers and artists who did not work as architects are sometimes also included in the Danish functionalist movement, such as [[Finn Juhl]], [[Louis Poulsen]] and [[Poul Henningsen]]. In Denmark, bricks were largely preferred over reinforced concrete as construction material, and this included funkis buildings. Apart from institutions and apartment blocks, more than 100,000 single-family funkis houses were built in the years 1925-1945. However, the truly dedicated funkis design was often approached with caution and many residential buildings only included some signature funkis elements such as round windows, corner windows or architectural glazing to signal modernity while not provoking conservative traditionalists too much. This branch of restrained approach to the funkis design created the Danish version of the [[bungalow]] building.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne Brüel (2014): "''Funkishuset - en bevaringsguide''", {{da icon}} Bygningskultur Danmark&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johan Hage: [https://issuu.com/johanhage/docs/web_funkishuset Funkishuset] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine examples of Danish functionalist architecture are the now listed [[Kastrup Airport]] 1939 terminal by Vilhelm Lauritzen, [[Aarhus University]] (by C. F. Møller et al.) and [[Aarhus City Hall]] (by Arne Jacobsen et al.), all including furniture and lamps specially designed in the functionalist spirit. The largest functionalist complex in the Nordic countries is the 30,000 sq. m. residential compound of [[Hostrups Have]] in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;Niels-Ole Lund (2008): ''Nordic Architecture'', Arkitektens Forlag, {{ISBN|9788774072584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Finland ===
Some of the most prolific and notable architects in Finland, working in the funkis style, includes Alvar Aalto and [[Erik Bryggman]] who were both engaged from the very start in the 1930s. The [[Turku]] region pioneered this new style and the journal ''[[Arkkitehti]]'' mediated and discussed functionalism in a Finnish context. Many of the first buildings in the funkis style were industrial structures, institutions and offices but spread to other kinds of structures such as residential buildings, individual housing and churches. The functionalist design also spread to interior designs and furnitures as exemplified by the iconic [[Paimio Sanatorium]], designed in 1929 and built in 1933.&lt;ref name=yit&gt;YIT: [https://www.yitgroup.com/en/news-repository/news/functionalism-is-a-finnish-thing Functionalism is a Finnish thing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Connah&gt;{{cite book|title=Finland: Modern Architectures in History|author=Roger Connah|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Finnish Architecture and the Modernist Tradition|author=Malcolm Quantrill|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aalto introduced standardised, precast concrete elements as early as the late 1920s, when he designed residential buildings in Turku. This technique became a cornerstone of later developments in modernist architecture after World War II, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. He also introduced serial produced wooden housing.&lt;ref name=yit/&gt;

===Södra Ängby, Sweden===
The [[residential area]] of [[Södra Ängby]] in western [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], blended a functionalist or [[International style (architecture)|international]] style with [[Garden city movement|garden city]] ideals. Encompassing more than 500 buildings, it remains the largest coherent functionalistic [[villa]] area in Sweden and possibly the world, still well-preserved more than a half-century after its construction 1933–40 and protected as a [[listed buildings in Sweden|national cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;Detailed references listed in the article on [[Södra Ängby]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zlín, Czech Republic===
[[File:Zlin-Areal Svit.JPG|thumb|[[Zlín]] in Czech republic.]]

[[Zlín]] is a city in Czech republic which was in 1930s completely reconstructed on principles of functionalism. In that time the city was a headquarters of  [[Bata Shoes]] company and Tomáš Baťa initiated a complex reconstruction of the city which was inspired by functionalism and the [[Garden city movement]].

Zlín's distinctive architecture was guided by principles that were strictly observed during its whole inter-war development. Its central theme was the derivation of all architectural elements from the factory buildings. The central position of the industrial production in the life of all Zlín inhabitants was to be highlighted. Hence the same building materials (red bricks, glass, reinforced concrete) were used for the construction of all public (and most private) edifices. The common structural element of Zlín architecture is a square bay of 20x20 feet (6.15x6.15 m). Although modified by several variations, this high modernist style leads to a high degree of uniformity of all buildings. It highlights the central and unique idea of an industrial garden city at the same time. Architectural and urban functionalism was to serve the demands of a modern city. The simplicity of its buildings which also translated into its functional adaptability was to prescribe (and also react to) the needs of everyday life.

The urban plan of Zlín was the creation of [[František Lydie Gahura]], a student at Le Corbusier's atelier in Paris. Architectural highlights of the city are e.g. the Villa of Tomáš Baťa, Baťa’s Hospital, The Grand Cinema or [[Baťa's Skyscraper]].

===Khrushchyovka===
{{see also|Khrushchyovka}}
[[Image:Panel Khrushchev house in Tomsk.jpg|thumb|Panel khrushchovka in [[Tomsk]].]]

Khrushchyovka ({{lang-rus|хрущёвка|p=xrʊˈɕːɵfkə}}) is an unofficial name of type of low-cost, concrete-[[Panel building|paneled]] or brick three- to five-storied [[apartment building]] which was developed in the [[Soviet Union]] during the early 1960s, during the time its namesake [[Nikita Khrushchev]] directed the Soviet government. The apartment buildings also went by the name of "Khruschoba" (Хрущёв+трущоба, Khrushchev-slum).

==Functionalism in landscape architecture==

The development of functionalism in [[landscape architecture]] paralleled its development in building architecture. At the residential scale, designers like [[Christopher Tunnard]], [[James C. Rose|James Rose]], and [[Garrett Eckbo]] advocated a design philosophy based on the creation of spaces for outdoor living and the integration of house and garden.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Elizabeth Barlow.  ''Landscape Design: A Cultural and Architectural History''.  New York: Abrams, 2001.  p.23, 454-5&lt;/ref&gt;  At a larger scale, the German landscape architect and planner [[Leberecht Migge]] advocated the use of edible gardens in social housing projects as a way to counteract hunger and increase self-sufficiency of families.  
At a larger scale, the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] advocated for urban design strategies based on human proportions and in support of four functions of human settlement: housing, work, play, and transport.

'''Gary A. Rendsburg''' (born 1954) is a professor of biblical studies, Hebrew language, and ancient Judaism at [[Rutgers University – New Brunswick|Rutgers University]] in New Brunswick, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/people/core-faculty/gary-a-rendsburg|title=Gary A. Rendsburg homepage|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds the rank of Distinguished Professor and serves as the Blanche and Irving Laurie Chair of Jewish History at Rutgers University (2004–present), with positions in the Department of Jewish Studies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/|title=Rutgers University, Department of Jewish Studies|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of History.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.rutgers.edu/|title=Rutgers University, Department of History|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to teaching at Rutgers, Rendsburg taught for 18 years at [[Cornell University]] in Ithaca, N.Y. (1986-2004) and for six years at [[Canisius College]] in Buffalo, N.Y. (1980-1986).

==Education==
Rendsburg received his B.A. degree in English and Journalism from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (1975), and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Hebrew Studies from [[New York University]] (1977, 1980).

==Career==

===Research interests===

Rendsburg's main research interests are the literature of the Bible, the history of ancient Israel, the historical development of the Hebrew language, the relationship between ancient Egypt and ancient Israel, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and medieval Hebrew manuscripts. He also teaches courses and offers lectures on the whole breadth of Jewish history and religion, with a special focus on the development of Judaism in the post-biblical period.

====Hebrew dialects====

Rendsburg is best known for his work on [[Israelian Hebrew]], the dialect of ancient Hebrew used in the northern part of Israel (more or less contiguous with the territory of the kingdom of Israel, which existed 930-721 B.C.E.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/329-rendsburg-orient-comp-guide-ih/file|title=A Comprehensive Guide to Israelian Hebrew: Grammar and Lexicon|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jens Bruun Kofoed, ''Text and History: Historiography and the Study of the Biblical Text'' (Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 2005), pp. 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aaron D. Hornkohl, ''Ancient Hebrew Periodization and the Language of the Book of Jeremiah: The Case for a Sixth-Century Date of Composition'' (Leiden: Brill, 2013), pp. 17-22.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William M. Schniedewind, ''A Social History of Hebrew: Its Origins through the Rabbinic Period'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013), pp. 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The dialect stands in contrast to Judahite Hebrew, the dialect used in the southern part of the country (in Judah in general and in Jerusalem in particular), in which the vast majority of the biblical books are composed. While earlier scholars had postulated the existence of a northern Hebrew dialect, and had offered a few lexical and grammatical features as evidence thereto, Rendsburg greatly expanded our knowledge of Israelian Hebrew by identifying sections of the Bible written in the dialect and by creating a much longer list of linguistic traits specific to this dialect. He built his case based both on internal biblical evidence and on the fact that many Israelian Hebrew features occur in Phoenician, Moabite, and Aramaic, dialects and languages which border the territory of northern (and Transjordanian) Israel, but not Judah in the south.

Rendsburg further proposed that [[Mishnaic Hebrew]], a Hebrew dialect used in post-biblical times, especially for the composition of early rabbinic texts, was also a northern dialect of ancient Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/328-rendsburg-orient-mh-lexicon/file|title=The Geographical and Historical Background of the Mishnaic Hebrew Lexicon|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shawn Zelig Aster, "Mishnah Baba Metsia 7:7 and the Relationship of Mishnaic Hebrew to Northern Biblical Hebrew," in Steven Fine and Aaron Koller, eds., ''Talmuda de-Eretz Israel: Archaeology and the Rabbis in Late Antique Palestine'' (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2014), pp. 1-18, esp. pp. 2-4.
&lt;/ref&gt;  He noted that many Israelian Hebrew features continue in Mishnaic Hebrew; and he further observed that the [[Mishnah]] and related texts were compiled in [[Sepphoris]] or elsewhere in the [[Galilee]], so that the geography makes sense as well.

In his earlier work Rendsburg also addressed the question of [[diglossia]] in ancient Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eisenbrauns.com/item/RENDIGLOS|title=Diglossia in Ancient Hebrew|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scobie P. Smith, "The Question of Diglossia in Ancient Hebrew," in Stanley E. Porter, ed., ''Diglossia and Other Topics in New Testament Linguistics'' (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 2000), pp. 35-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William M. Schniedewind, ''A Social History of Hebrew: Its Origins through the Rabbinic Period'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013), pp. 19, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aaron D. Hornkohl, ''Ancient Hebrew Periodization and the Language of the Book of Jeremiah: The Case for a Sixth-Century Date of Composition'' (Leiden: Brill, 2013), pp. 22-25.
&lt;/ref&gt; To his mind, Biblical Hebrew is essentially a literary dialect, used for the composition of texts, whereas spoken Hebrew in ancient Israel diverged in its morphology and syntax. Rendsburg used departures from the grammatical norm found in the Bible, along with parallels from other spoken Semitic languages (especially Arabic, but also Ethiopian), to reconstruct the spoken dialect of ancient Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/75-parallel-developments-in-mishnaic-hebrew-colloquial-arabic-and-other-varieties-of-spoken-semitic/file|title=Parallel Developments in Mishnaic Hebrew, Colloquial Arabic, and Other Varieties of Spoken Semitic|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rendsburg also has contributed to the issue of diachrony in ancient Hebrew, with special attention to the differences between Standard Biblical Hebrew (of the pre-exilic period) and Late Biblical Hebrew (of the post-exilic period).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/45-late-biblical-hebrew-and-the-date-of-p/file|title=Late Biblical Hebrew and the Date of 'P'|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/500-lbh-haggai-huerhnergard-fs/file|title=Late Biblical Hebrew in the Book of Haggai|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jens Bruun Kofoed, ''Text and History: Historiography and the Study of the Biblical Text'' (Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 2005), pp. 143-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rendsburg's work on Qumran Hebrew accepts the theory advanced by [[William Schniedewind]], which holds that the main dialect of the Dead Sea Scrolls constitutes an [[anti-language]], a somewhat artificial construct used to distinguish the Essenes' Hebrew from that of other Jewish groups of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/396-qumran-hebrew-studies-on-the-texts-of-the-desert-of-judah/file|title=Qumran Hebrew (with a Trial Cut [1QS])|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/641-pesher-habakkuk-std-114/file|title=The Nature of Qumran Hebrew as Revealed through Pesher Habakkuk|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moshe J. Bernstein and Aaron Koller, "The Aramaic texts and Hebrew and Aramaic languages at Qumran: the North American contributions," in Devorah Dimant, ed., ''The Dead Sea Scrolls in Scholarly Perspective: A History of Its Research'' (Leiden: Brill, 2012), pp. 155-195, esp. pp. 190-191.&lt;/ref&gt;

====A Challenge to the Documentary Hypothesis====

While Rendsburg accepts the obvious distinctions between the Priestly and Deuteronomic legal-cultic material in the Torah, he has argued for viewing the prose stories in the Torah as emanating from a single voice. In his view, the manifold interconnections between and among various passages within the prose accounts (for example, in the book of Genesis and in the Exodus account) bespeak a single narrative voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eisenbrauns.com/item/RENREDACTP|title=The Redaction of Genesis|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/649-literaryunityoftheexodusnarrative/file|title=The Literary Unity of the Exodus Narrative|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor P. Hamilton, ''The Book of Genesis: Chapters 1-17'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1990), pp. 30-32; and Victor P. Hamilton, ''The Book of Genesis: Chapters 18-50'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1995), passim.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon J. Wenham, "Pondering the Pentateuch: The Search for a New Paradigm," in David W. Baker and Bill T. Arnold, ''The Face of Old Testament Studies: A Survey of Contemporary Approaches'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Books, 1999), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach stands in contrast to the adherents of the [[Documentary hypothesis|Documentary Hypothesis]] (JEDP Theory), which holds that different passages in the narratives are to be ascribed to different sources (especially ''J'', ''E'' and ''P'').&lt;ref&gt;S. David Sperling, ''Students of the Covenant: A History of Jewish Biblical Scholarship in North America'' (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1992), pp. 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hebrew stylistics====

Rendsburg has written widely on a host of ancient Hebrew literary and stylistic devices, including wordplay,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/216-word-play-in-bh/file|title=Word Play in Biblical Hebrew: An Eclectic Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred G. E. Watson, ''Classical Hebrew Poetry: A Guide to Its Techniques'' (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 2001), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; [[alliteration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/305-alliteration-shalom-paul-fs/file|title=Alliteration in the Exodus Narrative|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/654-alliteration-in-genesis/file|title=Alliteration in the Book of Genesis|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shani Tzoref, "Israel's Development as a Nation: Form, Storm, Norm, Perform – How The Words נשא and נסע Structure the Book of Numbers," online at

====Egypt and Israel====

Rendsburg has contributed in two ways in this arena. First, he has addressed the question of the evidence for the Sojourn-Slavery-Exodus account, presented at the end of the book of Genesis and the beginning of the book of Exodus, and the dates thereof;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/80-the-date-of-the-exodus-and-the-conquest-settlement/file|title=The Date of the Exodus and the Conquest/Settlement: The Case for the 1100's|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/94-the-early-history-of-israel/file|title=The Early History of Israel|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark W. Chavalas and Murray R. Adamthwaite, "Archaeological Light on the Old Testament," in David W. Baker and Bill T. Arnold, ''The Face of Old Testament Studies: A Survey of Contemporary Approaches'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Books, 1999), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Davies, "Was There an Exodus?" in John Day, ed., ''In Search of Pre-Exilic Israel'' (London: T&amp;T Clark, 2004), pp. 36, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence T. Geraty, "Exodus Dates and Theories," in Thomas E. Levy, et al., eds., ''Israel's Exodus in Transdisciplinary Perspective'' (Berlin: Springer, 2015), pp. 62, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and secondly, he has shown how Egyptian literary, religious, and magical topoi resonate within the Moses story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstudies.rutgers.edu/docman/rendsburg/118-moses-as-equal-to-pharaoh/file|title=Moses as Equal to Pharaoh|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-04768-3|title=Moses the Magician|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brad C. Sparks, "Egyptian Texts relating to the Exodus: Discussions of Exodus Parallels in the Egyptology Literature," in Thomas E. Levy, et al., eds., ''Israel's Exodus in Transdisciplinary Perspective'' (Berlin: Springer, 2015), pp. 259-281.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval Hebrew manuscripts====

Rendsburg has developed three websites devoted to medieval Hebrew manuscripts:

The first (developed with Jacob Binstein) is devoted to the book of [[Sirach|Ben Sira]], whose documentary evidence ranges from [[Qumran]] and [[Masada]] in antiquity to the [[Cairo Genizah]] in the medieval period, and whose manuscripts are found in Cambridge, Oxford, London, Paris, Jerusalem, New York, and Los Angeles. Rendsburg and Binstein aggregated all of this material at a single website,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bensira.org/|title=bensira.org|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that scholars now may inspect the diverse manuscripts more readily.&lt;ref&gt;Eric D. Reymond, "New Hebrew Text of Ben Sira Chapter 1 in MS A (T-S 12.863)," ''Revue de Qumran'' 27 (2015), pp. 83-98, esp. p. 84 and p. 85, n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second (developed with Joshua Blachorsky) presents to the public an incomplete yet very valuable manuscript of the [[Mishnah]], known as JTS MS R1622.1,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jts-ms-r1622-1.org/|title=jts-ms-r1622-1.org|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; housed in the Library of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]]. Until the development of the website, the manuscript remained unpublished, though now scholars from around the world may access it via the internet.

The third (developed with Peter Shamah) reunites all of the documentary evidence from the [[Cairo Geniza]]h relevant to the life of [[Obadiah the Proselyte|Johannes of Oppido = Obadiah the Proselyte]] at a single website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://johannes-obadiah.org/|title=Johannes of Oppido {{!}} Home|website=johannes-obadiah.org|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The documents include the Obadiah Memoir, the Epistle of R. Barukh of Aleppo, the Siddur that Obadiah wrote for himself, and his musical compositions (Hebrew prayers set to Gregorian chant).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2179">The so-called '''Hamburg School of Art History''' (''Hamburger Schule der Kunstgeschichte'') was a school of art historians primarily teaching at the [[University of Hamburg]], who were closely connected with the ''Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek Warburg'' (KBW) at the [[Warburg Haus, Hamburg]]. Its main members were scholars such as [[Aby Warburg]], [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Fritz Saxl]] and [[Ernst Cassirer]], who had been schooled to see images as cultural documents and inculcated in the investigation of pictorial types.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Sears, "American Iconography: Assessing FSA Photographs, 1945", ''Visual Resources: An International Journal of Documentation'', Volume 30, Issue 3, 2014, pp. 239-254.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Hamburg School of Art History is celebrated for the theoretical interpretations of subject matter known as [[iconography]] and [[iconology]]. It was soon established and attracted brilliant students such as [[Edgar Wind]], [[Hugo Buchthal]], [[Adolf Katzenellenbogen]], [[Walter Horn]], [[Charles de Tolnay]], [[Ludwig Heinrich Heydenreich]], [[Lotte Brand Philip]], [[William S. Heckscher]], [[Klaus Hinrichsen]], [[Liselotte Müller]] and [[H. W. Janson]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Symposium on Erwin Panofsky", ''The Burlington Magazine'', Volume 134, No. 1073 (1992), pp. 547-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://dictionaryofarthistorians.org/jansonh.html Dictionary of Art Historians: Janson, H(orst) W(oldemar)].&lt;/ref&gt; The School had also an influence on [[Ernst Kris]]'s psychological interests.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Roeske, "Traces of Psychology: The Art Historical Writings of Ernst Kris", ''American Imago'', Vol. 58, No. 1 (2001), pp. 463-477.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health communication''' is the study and practice of communicating [[Health promotion|promotional health information]], such as in [[public health]] campaigns, [[health education]], and between doctor and patient.&lt;ref name="What is Communication?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Communication? |url=http://www.natcom.org/Tertiary.aspx?id=236&amp;terms=health%20communication |publisher=[[National Communication Association]] |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of disseminating health information is to influence personal health choices by improving [[health literacy]].

Because effective health communication must be tailored for the audience and the situation,&lt;ref name=EHS&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beato |first=Ricardo R. |author2=Jana Telfer |title=Communication as an Essential Component of Environmental Health Science |journal=Journal of Environmental Health |date=July–August 2010 |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=24–25 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/Docs/JEH/2010/July-Aug_Beato_Telfer.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; research into health communication seeks to refine communication strategies to inform people about ways to enhance health or to avoid specific health risks.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|title=Health Communication Basics|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/healthbasics/whatishc.html|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academically, health communication is a discipline within [[communication studies]].&lt;ref name="What is Communication?"/&gt;

Health communication may variously seek to:
* increase audience knowledge and awareness of a health issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gwyn|first1=Richard|title=Communicating health and illness|date=2002|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd|location=London|isbn=0761964754}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* influence behaviors and attitudes towards a health issue
* demonstrate healthy practices
* demonstrate the benefits of behavior changes to [[public health]] outcomes
* advocate a position on a health issue or policy
* increase demand or support for health services
* argue against misconceptions about health&lt;ref name=HD&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freimuth|first=Vicki S.|author2=Sandra Crouse Quinn|title=The Contributions of Health Communication to Eliminating Health Disparities|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=December 2004|volume=94|issue=12|pages=2053–2055|doi=10.2105/ajph.94.12.2053|pmc=1448587}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
The term was generated when members of an ICA, [[International Communication Association]], interest group adopted the term. Interdisciplinary marriage between health and communication was certainly a common-law relationship long before the term "health communication" was introduced. (Stacks &amp; Salween, page 489)
The research of health communication surrounds the development of effective messages about health, the dissemination of health-related information through broadcast, print, and electronic media, and the role of inter personal relationships in health communities. At the core of all of the communication is the idea of health and the emphasis of health. The goal of health communication research is to identify and provide better and more effective communication strategies that will improve the overall health of society. (Stacks &amp; Salween, page 489)

==Research==
There are many purposes and reasons why health communication research is important and how it betters the health care field. The training programs of Health Care Professionals, or HCP, can be adapted and developed based on health communication research. (Stacks &amp; Salween, 495) Due to there being a diverse culture that makes up the group of patients within the health care field, communication to other cultures has been taught and has been made a focus in health care training classes. Research suggests that nonverbal and verbal communication between health care professionals and patient can lead to improved patient outcomes. According to Stacks and Salween on page 496 some health care facilities, like hospitals are providing training and education materials to patients. The goal of hospitals doing this is to allow for patients to have a better outcome due to better communication skills.
Over the years, there has been much research done on health communication. For example, researchers want to know if people are more effectively motivated by a positive message versus a negative message. Researchers examine ideas like, are people better motivated by ideas of wealth and safety or an idea of illness and death. Researchers are examining which dimensions of persuasive incentives are most influential: physical health versus economic, versus psychological, versus moral, versus social. (Stacks &amp; Salween, 497)
Impact of the Health Campaign-After research has been conducted and analyzed on the effects of health communication, it can be concluded that a health communication campaign that is requiring a behavior change causes the desired behavior change in about 7%-10%  or more in the people who are in the campaign site than those who are in the control group. Also, the effects are stronger for adoption of a new behavior than cessation of a current behavior, about 12% higher.

When assessing how affective a health campaign is, the key determinant is the degree of audience reception, the quality and quantity of the message, the dissemination channels, and the larger communication environment. It is possible that an audience can be more receptive to some messages than others. The media channel and how the message is reached by the audience can affect the effectiveness of the health campaign. (Stacks &amp; Salween page 498)

The efforts and effects of health messages and communication are often counter affected by alcohol and tobacco commercials. The advertisement for these items is often made to be glamorous and will contradict what was said in the health campaign. This can lead to the efforts of the health communication seem to be pointless.

==Training==
Health communication professionals are specifically trained in methods and strategies for effective communication of [[public health]] messages, with qualifications in research, strategic development, and evaluating effectiveness.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt; Health communication is taught in [[Master's degree|master's]] and doctoral programs.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=Timothy|author2=James N. Hyde|title=An Alumni-Based Evaluation of Graduate Training in Health Communication: Results of a Survey on Careers, Salaries, Competencies, and Emerging Trends|journal=Journal of Health Communication|date=November 2004|pages=5–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition for Health Communication maintains a list of such programs.&lt;ref name=CHC&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Programs in Health Communication|url=http://www.healthcommunication.net/CHC/gradprograms/grad%20programs.htm|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and practitioners in health communication are often trained in disciplines such as [[communication studies]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[public health]], or [[medicine]] and then focus within their field on either health or communication. Practitioners are pragmatic and draw from social-scientific scholarship, theories from the humanities, and professional fields such as education, management, law and marketing (Maibach 2008). Professionals trained in health communication encounter a wide range of employment opportunities spanning between the public, private, and volunteer sectors and have the opportunity for a large amount of career mobility.&lt;ref name="TE"/&gt; Examples of jobs in each of these categories include federal, state, and local health departments in the public sector, Pharmaceutical companies and large corporations in the private sector, and various non-profit organizations such as the [[American Cancer Society]] and the [[American Heart Association]] in the volunteer sector.

==Overview==
[[International Communication Association]] officially recognized health communication in 1975; in 1997, the [[American Public Health Association]] categorised health communication as a discipline of [[Public Health]] Education and Health Promotion.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;

Careers in the field of health communication range widely between the public, private, and volunteer sectors and professionals of health communication are distinctively trained to conduct communication research, develop successful and repeatable campaigns for health promotion and advocacy, and to evaluate how effective these strategies have been for future campaigns.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt;

Clear communication is essential to successful [[public health]] practice at every level of the [[ecological model]]: intrapersonal, interpersonal, group, organizational, and societal. In each instance of health communication, there must be careful deliberation concerning the appropriate channel for messages to best reach the target audience, ranging from face-to-face interactions to television, Internet, and other forms of [[mass media]].&lt;ref name=HTB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parvis|first=Leo|title=How to Benefit From Health Communication|journal=Journal of Environmental Health|date=Jul–Aug 2002|volume=65|issue=1|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent explosion of new [[Internet]] communication technologies, particularly through the development of health websites (such as [[MedlinePlus]], Healthfinder, and [[WebMD]]), online support groups (such as the Association for Cancer Online Resources), web portals, tailored information systems, telehealth programs, electronic health records, [[social networking]], and [[mobile devices]] (cell phones, PDAs, etc.) means that the potential media are ever changing.

The social and cultural contexts in which health communication occurs are also widely diverse and can include (but are not limited to) homes, schools, doctor’s offices, and workplaces, and messages must consider the variant levels of health literacy and education of their audience, as well as demographics, values, socioeconomic issues, and many other factors that may influence effective communication.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt;

=== Critical Health Communication ===
Critical Health Communication refers to scholarship that interrogates "how meanings and enactments of health are tied to issues of power through the systematic construction and maintenance of inequalities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7691/doing-critical-health-communication-a-forum-on-methods|title=“Doing” Critical Health Communication. A Forum on Methods {{!}} Frontiers Research Topic|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It examines links with culture, resources, and other social structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7691/doing-critical-health-communication-a-forum-on-methods|title=“Doing” Critical Health Communication. A Forum on Methods {{!}} Frontiers Research Topic|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from mainstream Health Communication in its emphasis on qualitative and interpretive methods, and its attention to the ideological processes that underpin shared understandings of health. Unlike much mainstream Health Communication, most Critical Health Communication holds that simply circulating better quality, or more visible message about health is not enough to meaningfully influence health outcomes or correct health care disparities. The first comprehensive review of Critical Health Communication was published in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zoller|first=Heather M.|last2=Kline|first2=Kimberly N.|date=January 2008|title=Theoretical Contributions of Interpretive and Critical Research in Health Communication|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23808985.2008.11679076|journal=Annals of the International Communication Association|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=89–135|doi=10.1080/23808985.2008.11679076|issn=2380-8985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then the volume of Health Communication research taking a critical approach has steadily increased.

==Strategies and methods==
Tailoring a health message is one strategy for persuasive health communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noar|first=Seth M. |author2=Christina N. Benac |author3=Melissa S. Harris|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2007|volume=133|issue=4|pages=673–693|pmid=17592961|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.4.673|title=Does tailoring matter? Meta-analytic review of tailored print health behavior change interventions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For messages of health communication to reach selected audiences accurately and quickly, health communication professionals must assemble a collection of superior and audience appropriate information that target population segments. Understanding the audience for the information is critical to effective delivery.

Communication is an enigma that is detrimental to the healthcare world and to the resulting health of a patient. Communication is an activity that involves oral speech, voice, tone, nonverbal body language, listening and more. It is a process for a mutual understanding to come at hand during interpersonal connections. A patient’s communication with their healthcare team and vice versa, affects the outcome of their health. Strong, clear, and positive relationships with physicians can chronically improve and increase the condition of a certain patient. Through two approaches, the biomedical model and the biopsychosocial model; this can be successfully achieved. Evidence has shown that communication and its traditions have altered throughout the years. With the use of many new discoveries and the changes within our technology market, communication has severely improved and become instantaneous.

Communicators need to continually synthesize knowledge from a range of other scholarly disciplines including marketing, psychology, and behavioural sciences.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt; Once this information has been collected, professionals can choose from a variety of methods and strategies of communication that they believe would best convey their message. These methods include [[Advocacy|campaigns]], entertainment advocacy, media advocacy, new technologies, and interpersonal communication.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;

===Campaigns===
Health Communication campaigns are arguably the most utilized and effective method for spreading [[public health]] messages, especially in endorsing disease prevention (e.g. [[cancer]], [[HIV/AIDS]]) and in general health promotion and wellness (e.g. [[family planning]], [[reproductive health]]).&lt;ref name="HTB"/&gt; The [[Institute of Medicine]] argues that health communication campaigns tend to organize their message for a diverse audience in one of three ways:&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;
* By catering to the common denominator within the audience
* By creating one central message and then later making systematic alterations in order to better reach a certain audience segment, while retaining the same central message
* By creating distinctly different messages for different audience segments
Both the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and scholars of health communication emphasize the importance of [[strategic planning]] throughout a campaign.  This includes a variety of steps to ensure a well-developed message is being communicated:&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;
* Reviewing background information to define what the problem is and who is affected by the problem
* Setting communication objectives and proposing a plan to meet the wanted outcome
* Analyze the target audience by determining interests, attitudes, behaviors, benefits, and barriers
* Select channels and materials for communication in relation to what will most effectively reach audiences
* Develop and pretest message concepts to determine understanding, acceptance, and reaction to the message
* Implement communication with selected audience and monitor exposures and reactions to the message
* Assess the outcome and evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the campaign, noting if changes need to be made

====Historical campaigns====

=====American smallpox epidemic=====
In 1721, health communication was used to mitigate the smallpox epidemic in Boston. Cotton Mather, a political leader, used pamphlets and speeches to promote inoculation of smallpox.Alcohol abuse has been a problem within society for about as long as alcohol has been around. In the 19th century, the Women’s Christian Temperance Union led a movement against alcohol abuse. They utilized mass communication to communicate the desired message. News papers and magazines allowed for the promotion of the anti-alcohol movement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanheritage.com/content/when-cotton-mather-fought-smallpox|title=When Cotton Mather Fought The Smallpox {{!}} AMERICAN HERITAGE|website=www.americanheritage.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cardiovascular disease=====
Three-community study and the five-city project were experimental campaigns to inform middle-aged men about the causes of [[cardiovascular disease]]. Health messages were communicated via television, radio, newspaper, cookbooks, booklets, and bus cards. The three "communities" comprised three experimental communication strategies: a media-only campaign, a media campaign supplemented with face-to-face communication, and a no-intervention [[control group]]. The experimented revealed that after one year, the most informed at-risk men were those in the second experimental group: they men consumed the media campaign and were attended by a [[health care provider]].

===Communication channels===

====Entertainment media====
Using the entertainment industry as a platform for advocating health information and education is a communication strategy that has become increasingly popular. The most utilized strategy is for health communication professionals to create partnerships with storyline creators so that public health information can be incorporated into within the plot of a television show. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has formed a strong partnership with Hollywood, Health, and Society, at the [[University of Southern California]] [[Norman Lear Center]] to continue to produce new storylines on television and in film studios that will help to promote public health information.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; Some of the resources provided with this partnership include comprehensive "tip sheets" to provide writers with easy to access and trustworthy information on health issues, and meetings and panels to discuss new information and resources. Some of the most notable examples of this method of communication in recent years have been with the films ''Contagion'' and ''I Am Legend'' in understanding the spread of disease, ''NBC's'' series ''Parenthood'' in Asperger's Syndrome, and with the ''CW's'' series ''90210'' and spreading cancer awareness. More recently, [[Public Health Film Festival|film festivals]] and [[International Public Health Film Competition|competitions]] focused specifically on health films have been organised by the [[American Public Health Association]], [[International Health Film Festival|the International Health Film Festival]], the Global Health Film Initiative of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] and the [[Public Health Film Society]]&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1757913915619120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.apha.org/events-and-meetings/annual/schedule/film-festival&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalhealthfilm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/40/1/169/3089818&lt;/ref&gt;.

Writers and storyline developers have an increased motivation to continue to incorporate public health information into their scripts with the creation of the Sentinel for Health Awards in 2000, which honors storylines that effectively promote health topics and audience awareness of [[public health]] issues.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; Surveys conducted by [[Porter Novelli]] in 2001 reported many interesting statistics on the effectiveness of this strategy, such as that over half of regular prime time and daytime drama viewers have reported that they have learned something about health promotion or disease prevention from a TV show.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; Amongst this data, minority groups are significantly represented with well over half of African American and Hispanic viewers stating that they had either taken some form of preventative action after hearing about a health issue on TV, or that a TV storyline helped them to provide vital health information to a friend or family member.

====Direct marketing====
{{Main|Social marketing}}
[[File:Text messaging used to provide encouragement to quit smoking.png|thumb|Some health organizations manage text messaging services to help people avoid smoking]]
Media advocacy use strategic mass media tools combined with widespread organization in order to advocate for healthy public policies or lifestyles.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; This can include the use of [[text messaging]] and [[email]] to spread messages from person to person, and using [[social networking]] venues to promote health information to a wide-ranging audience. As technologies expand, the platforms for health communication through media advocacy will undoubtedly expand as well.

====Interpersonal communication====
Health communication relies on strong interpersonal communications in order to influence health decisions and behaviours. The most important of these relationships are the connection and interaction between an individual and their [[health care provider]] (e.g., physician, therapist, pharmacist) and an individual's social support system (family, friends, community). These connections can positively influence the individual's decision to make healthy choices.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; Patients are more prone to listen when they feel invested emotionally into the situation. If they feel as if they understand what is being said, they are more prone to make objective decisions based on the information heard.

==Applications==
Health communication has become essential in promoting the general [[public health]] in myriad situations. One of health communication's most important applications has been throughout major Environmental events (e.g. [[hurricanes]], [[flooding]], [[tornado]]s) and addressing the affected audience's questions and needs quickly and efficiently, keeping the protection of [[public health]] and the forefront of their message.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt; Health communication professionals are constantly working to improve this type of risk communication in order to be prepared in the case of an emergency.

Another increasingly important application of health communication has been in reaching students in the college community. The National College Health Assessment has measured that 92.5% of college students reported being in "good, very good, or excellent health", however college students seem to battle serious problems with stress, depression, substance abuse, and a general lack of nutrition in comparison to other age groups and audiences.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|author2=Nichole Egbert |author3=Evelyn Ho |title=Everyday Health Communication Experiences of College Students|journal=Journal of American College Health|date=Jan–Feb 2008|volume=56|issue=4|pages=427–435|doi=10.3200/jach.56.44.427-436}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Professionals in health communication are actively striving for new ways to reach this at-risk audience in order to raise standards of [[public health]] in the college setting and to promote a healthier life style amongst students.

==Challenges==
There are many challenges in communicating information about health to individuals. Some of the most essential issues have to do with the gap between individual health literacy and healthcare workers and institutions, as well as flaws in communicating health information through mass media.

===Literacy-communication gap===
{{Further|Health literacy}}

One problem that health communication seeks to address is the gap that has formed between health literacy and the use of health communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communication Yearbook 19|year=1996|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=187–227|vauthors=Viswanath K, Finnegan JR |authorlink=The knowledge gap hypothesis: twenty-five years later|editor=Burleson, B|chapter=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the goal is that health communication will effectively ''lead'' to health literacy, issues such as the use of unexplained medical jargon, ill-formed messages, and often a general educational gap have created a disparity. Specifically, studies have been done amongst elderly populations in America to illustrate a common audience who is left at a disadvantage due to this issue.&lt;ref name=LCG&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hester|first=Eva Jackson|title=An Investigation of the Relationship Between Health Literacy and Social Communication Skills in Older Adults|journal=Communication Disorders Quarterly|date=February 2009|volume=30|issue=2|pages=112–119|doi=10.1177/1525740108324040}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The older adults comprise an age group that generally suffers from the most chronic health conditions in comparison to other age groups, however studies have shown{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} that even this group have difficulty understanding written health materials, understanding health care and policies, and generally do not comprehend medical jargon. Such shortcomings of health communication may lead to increased hospitalizations, the inability to respond to and manage a disease or medical condition, and a generally declining health status.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In some populations, health-related websites (e.g., [[WebMD]]) and online support groups (e.g., Association for Cancer Online Resources) have increased access to health information.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;

===Mass media===
Mass communication is used to promote beneficial changes in behavior among members of populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abroms|first=LC|author2=Maibach, EW|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|year=2008|volume=29|pages=219–34|pmid=18173391|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.29.020907.090824|title=The effectiveness of mass communication to change public behavior.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major criticism of the use of mass media as a method of health communication is the unfortunate ability for false and misinformed messages to spread quickly through the mass media, before they have the chance to be disputed by professionals. This issue may generate unwarranted panic amongst those who receive the messages and be an issue as technology continues to advance. An example of this may be observed in the ongoing distrust of vaccinations due to the publication of numerous messages that wrongly link the childhood measles-mumps-rubella ([[MMR vaccine|MMR]]) vaccination with the development and onset of [[Autism]].&lt;ref name=MMR&gt;{{cite news|last=Brauser|first=Deborah|title=Autism and MMR Vaccine Study an 'Elaborate Fraud,' Charger BMJ|date=January 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed with which this message spread due to new social networking technologies caused many parents to distrust vaccinations and therefore forgo having their children receive the vaccine. Although this panic has been ferociously labeled as fictitious, many still harbor a lingering suspicion towards vaccinations and refuse them, which has caused an immediate [[public health]] concern.

[[File:Regular_hexagon_as_intersection_of_two_triangles.png|thumb|A regular ''hexagram'', [[List_of_regular_polytopes_and_compounds#Two_dimensional_compounds|{6}[2{3}]{6}]], can be seen as a [[compound polygon|compound]] composed of an upwards (blue here) and downwards (pink) facing [[equilateral triangle]], with their intersection as a regular [[hexagon]] (in green).]]
A '''hexagram''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]) or '''sexagram''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]) is a six-pointed geometric [[star figure]] with the [[Schläfli symbol]] {6/2}, 2{3}, or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Since there are no true regular continuous hexagrams, the term is instead used to refer to the compound figure of two [[equilateral triangle]]s shown to the right. The intersection is a regular [[hexagon]].

The hexagram is part of an infinite series of shapes which are compounds of two n-dimensional [[simplex|simplices]]. In three dimensions, [[Compound of two tetrahedra|the analogous compound]] is the [[stellated octahedron]], and in four dimensions the [[compound of two 5-cells]] is obtained.

It has been historically used in religious and cultural contexts and as decorative motifs; for example by medieval [[Muslims]], especially [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]] dynasties,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Delhi: Adventures in a Megacity]]'' (PB) - Page 91, Sam Miller, Sam - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[Judaism]] and [[occultism]]. The symbol was used merely as a decorative motif in medieval Christian churches many centuries before its first known use in a Jewish synagogue.{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=244|ps=:"It is not to be found at all in medieval synagogues or on medieval ceremonial objects, although it has been found in quite a number of medieval Christian churches again, not as a Christian symbol but only as a decorative motif. The appearance of the symbol in Christian churches long before its appearance in our synagogues should warn the overzealous interpreters. "}} It was first used as a religious symbol by Arabs in the medieval period, known as the [[Seal of Solomon]], depicted as either a hexagram or [[pentagram]], and which was later adopted by Jewish [[Kabbalists]].{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=246|ps=:"In the beginning these designs had no special names or terms, and it is only in the Middle Ages that definite names began to be given to some of those most widely used. There is very little doubt that terms like these first became popular among the Arabs, who showed a tremendous interest in all the occult sciences, arranging and ordering them systematically long before the Practical Cabalists thought of doing so.{{pb}}It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that for a long time both the five-pointed and the six-pointed stars were called by one name, the "Seal of Solomon," and that no distinction was made between them. This name is obviously related to the Jewish legend of Solomon's dominion over the spirits, and of his ring with the Ineffable Name engraved on it. These legends expanded and proliferated in a marked fashion during the Middle Ages, among Jews and Arabs alike, but the name, "Seal of Solomon," apparently originated with the Arabs."}}&lt;ref&gt;Leonora Leet, "The Hexagram and Hebraic Sacred Science" in :''The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah'', 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=61hpoogearsC&amp;pg=PA212 pp. 212-217].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group theory==
In [[mathematics]], the [[root system]] for the simple [[Lie group]] [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is in the form of a hexagram, with six long roots and six short roots.&lt;br/&gt;
[[File:Root system G2.svg|250px]]

== Construction by compass and a straight edge ==
A six-pointed star, like a [[regular hexagon]], can be created using a compass and a straight edge:
*Make a circle of any size with the compass.
*Without changing the radius of the compass, set its pivot on the circle's circumference, and find one of the two points where a new circle would intersect the first circle.
*With the pivot on the last point found, similarly find a third point on the circumference, and repeat until six such points have been marked.
*With a straight edge, join alternate points on the circumference to form two overlapping equilateral triangles.

== Construction by linear algebra ==
[[File:Hexagram-cube.png|thumb]]
A regular hexagram can be constructed by [[orthographic projection|orthographically projecting]] any [[cube]] onto a plane through three vertices that are all adjacent to the same vertex.  The twelve midpoints to edges of the cube form a hexagram.  For example, consider the projection of the unit cube with vertices at the eight possible binary vectors in three dimensions &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt; onto the plane &lt;math&gt;x+y+z=1&lt;/math&gt;.  The midpoints are &lt;math&gt;(0,0,1/2),(0,1/2,1/2),(0,1,1/2),(1,1,1/2)&lt;/math&gt;, and all points resulting from these by applying a permutation to their entries.  These 12 points project to a hexagram: six vertices around the outer hexagon and six on the inner.

==Origins and shape==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}
It is possible that as a simple geometric shape, like for example the triangle, circle, or square, the hexagram has been created by various peoples with no connection to one another.

The hexagram is a [[mandala]] symbol called ''satkona yantra'' or ''sadkona yantra'' found on ancient South [[India]]n [[Hindu]] temples. It symbolizes the [[nara-narayana]], or perfect [[meditative]] state of balance achieved between Man and God, and if maintained, results in "[[moksha]]," or "[[nirvana]]" (release from the bounds of the earthly world and its material trappings).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some researchers have theorized that the hexagram represents the [[astrological]] chart at the time of David's birth or [[anointment]] as king. The hexagram is also known as the "King's Star" in astrological circles.

In antique [[papyri]], [[pentagram]]s, together with stars and other signs, are frequently found on [[amulet]]s bearing the Jewish names of [[God]], and used to guard against fever and other diseases. Curiously the hexagram is not found among these signs. In the [[Greek Magical Papyri]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} (Wessely, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;31, 112) at Paris and London there are 22 signs side by side, and a circle with twelve signs, but neither a pentagram nor a hexagram.

==Usage in Dharmic religions==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Jain Cosmology0007small.JPG|thumb|Diagram showing the two mystic syllables Om and Hrim]]
Six-pointed stars have also been found in cosmological diagrams in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. The reasons behind this symbol's common appearance in Indic religions and the West are unknown. One possibility is that they have a common origin. The other possibility is that artists and religious people from several cultures independently created the hexagram shape, which is a relatively simple geometric design.

Within Indic lore, the shape is generally understood to consist of two triangles—one pointed up and the other down—locked in harmonious embrace. The two components are called "Om" and the "Hrim" in Sanskrit, and symbolize man's position between earth and sky. The downward triangle symbolizes [[Shakti]], the sacred embodiment of femininity, and the upward triangle symbolizes [[Shiva]], or [[Agni Tattva]], representing the focused aspects of masculinity. The mystical union of the two triangles represents Creation, occurring through the divine union of male and female. The two locked triangles are also known as 'Shanmukha'—the six-faced, representing the six faces of Shiva &amp; Shakti's progeny [[Kartikeya]]. This symbol is also a part of several yantras and has deep significance in Hindu ritual worship and history.

In [[Buddhism]], some old versions of the [[Bardo Thodol]], also known as The "Tibetan Book of the Dead", contain a hexagram with a [[Swastika]] inside. It was made up by the publishers for this particular publication. In Tibetan, it is called the "origin of phenomenon" (chos-kyi 'byung-gnas). It is especially connected with [[Vajrayogini]], and forms the center part of Her [[mandala]]. In reality, it is in three dimensions, not two, although it may be portrayed either way.

The [[Shatkona]] is a symbol used in [[Hindu]] [[yantra]] that represents the union of both the [[male]] and [[Female|feminine]] form. More specifically it is supposed to represent [[Purusha]] (the supreme being), and [[Prakriti]] (mother nature, or causal matter). Often this is represented as [[Shiva]] - [[Shakti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sivasakti.com/articles/intro-yantra.html sivasakti.com: ''Iintroduction to Yantra'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shatkona is a hexagram and looks exactly like the [[Star of David]].

===Anahata: The Heart Chakra===
{| border="0"
|width=170 valign=top|[[File:Anahata Mandala.svg|center|170px]]
|valign=top|'''[[Anahata]]''' (also known as '''Anahata-puri''', or '''Padma-sundara''') is symbolized by a lotus flower with twelve petals. (See also [[bodhicitta|heartmind]]). Anahata is related to the colors green or pink. Key issues involving Anahata involve complex emotions, compassion, tenderness, unconditional love, equilibrium, rejection and well-being. Physically Anahata governs circulation, emotionally it governs unconditional love for the self and others, mentally it governs passion, and spiritually it governs devotion.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|}
In the [[endocrine system]], [[Anahata]] is associated with the [[thymus]] gland, located in the chest. This gland produces [[T-cells]], that combat disease, and bring equilibrium to the body. The functioning of the [[thymus]] is greatest before [[puberty]] and is impaired by the appearance of [[sex hormones]] in the blood stream from [[puberty]] onwards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Usage by the Abrahamic religions==

===Usage by Jews===
{{Main|Star of David}}
[[File:Leningrad Codex Carpet page e.jpg|thumb|The Star of David in the oldest surviving complete copy of the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], dated 1008.]]
The ''Magen David'' is a generally recognized symbol of Judaism and Jewish identity and is also known colloquially as the Jewish Star or "Star of David." Its usage as a sign of Jewish identity began in the Middle Ages, though its religious usage began earlier, with the current earliest archeological evidence being a stone bearing the shield from the arch of a 3–4th century synagogue in the Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;"King Solomon's Seal", ''MFA'', [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/King%20Solomon-s%20Seal King Solomon-s Seal].&lt;/ref&gt; A more enduring symbol of Judaism, the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], has been in use since about 1300 BC according to the [[Torah]] {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:31-40|HE}}.

===Usage by Christians===
The hexagram may be found in some Churches and stained-glass windows. In Christianity it is sometimes called the star of creation.  A very early example, noted by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], can be found in [[Winchester Cathedral]], England in one of the canopies of the choir stalls, circa 1308.&lt;ref&gt;Buildings of England: Hampshire and the North (now second edition) {{ISBN|978 0 300 12084 4}}, p.604. &lt;/ref&gt;

In Balkan countries, hexagrams can be found more often in Orthodox Christian churches than in Roman Catholic churches.  
 
====Latter-day Saints (Mormons)====
[[File:Salt Lake Assembly Hall Star of David.jpg|thumb|Star of David on the [[Salt Lake Assembly Hall]]]]
{{Main|Mormonism and Judaism}}
The Star of David is also used less prominently by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in the temples and in architecture. It symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. It may also symbolize the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]] and friendship and their affinity towards the Jewish people. Additionally, it is sometimes used to symbolize the quorum of the twelve apostles, as in Revelation 12, wherein the Church of God is symbolized by a woman wearing a crown of twelve stars. It is also sometimes used to symbolize the Big Dipper, which points to the North Star, a symbol of Jesus Christ.

====Rastafari====
A black star of David is used to identify the black population, in Africa or otherwise, with one of the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Due to the culture of Rastafari emerging out of the Judeo-Christian Ethiopian history, dating back to Solomonic dynastic rule, the star of David, or the Seal of Solomon is a prevalent symbol amongst its adherents. Rastafari has adherents from every race across the globe, rooted in Christian doctrine, it is not an African or bloodline doctrine.

===Usage by Muslims===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The symbol is known in Arabic as ''Khātem Sulaymān'' ([[Seal of Solomon]]; {{lang|ar|خاتم سليمان}}) or ''Najmat Dāwūd'' ([[Star of David]]; {{lang|ar|نجمة داوود}}). The "Seal of Solomon" may also be represented by a five-pointed star or [[pentagram]].

In the [[Qur'an]], it is written that David and [[King Solomon]] (Arabic, ''Suliman'' or ''Sulayman'') were prophets and kings, and are figures revered by Muslims. The Medieval pre-Ottoman [[Hanafi]] [[Anatolian beyliks]] of the [[Karamanids]] and [[Jandarids]] used the star on their flag.&lt;ref name="Muwahhidists"&gt;The Muslim Empires of the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, By Stephen F. Dale, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol also used on [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] flag. Today the six-pointed star can be found in [[mosques]] and on other [[Arabic Art|Arabic]] and [[Islamic art]]ifacts.

The superposed triangles thus represented combinations of those elements. From Aristotle's writings those symbols made their ways into early, pre-Muslim Arab literature.

==Usage in heraldry==
In [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], a hexagram is a fairly common charge employed, though it is rarely called by this name. In Germanic regions it is known simply as a "star." In English and French heraldry, however, the hexagram is known as a "mullet of six points," where ''mullet'' is a French term for a [[spur|spur rowel]] which is shown with five pointed arms by default unless otherwise specified. In [[Albania]]n heraldry and vexillology, hexagram has been used since [[classical antiquity]] and it is commonly referred to as ''sixagram''. [[:File:Coa Kastrioti Family.svg|Coa Kastrioti Family]] of the [[House of Kastrioti]] depicts the hexagram on a '''[[pile (heraldry)|pile]]''' argent over the double headed eagle. A hexagram also appears on the '''Dardania''' Flag, proposed for [[Kosovo]] by the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]].

==Usage in theosophy==
The Star of David is used in the seal and the emblem of the [[Theosophical Society]] (founded in 1875). Although it is more pronounced, it is used along with other religious symbols. These include the [[Swastika]], the [[Ankh]], the [[Om|Aum]], and the [[Ouroboros]]. The star of David is also known as the Seal of Solomon that was its original name until around 50 years ago.

==Usage in occultism==
The hexagram, like the [[pentagram]], was and is used in practices of the [[occult]] and [[ceremonial magic]] and is attributed to the 7 "old" planets outlined in [[astrology]].

The six-pointed star is commonly used both as a [[talisman]]&lt;ref&gt;P299 (and throughout) of ''The Complete Goldendawn'' by Israel Regardie. {{ISBN|978-0875426631}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for conjuring spirits and spiritual forces in diverse forms of [[Magic (paranormal)|occult magic]]. In the book [[The History and Practice of Magic, Vol. 2]], the six-pointed star is called the talisman of Saturn and it is also referred to as the Seal of Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;"The History and Practice of Magic" (Secaucus, NJ: University Books, published by arrangement with Lyle Stewart, 1979), Vol. II, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Details are given in this book on how to make these symbols and the materials to use.
[[File:Star of David GGNC grave marker engraving.JPG|thumb|200x200px|Double hexagram.]]
Traditionally, the Hexagram can be seen as the combination of the four elements. Fire is symbolized as an upwards pointing triangle, while Air (its elemental opposite) is also an upwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. Water is symbolized as a downwards pointing triangle, while Earth (its elemental opposite) is also a downwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. When you combine the symbols of Fire and Water, a hexagram (six-pointed star) is created. The same follows for when you combine the symbols of Air and Earth.  When you combine both hexagrams, you get the double-hexagram. Thus, a combination of the elements is created.&lt;ref&gt;P315-316 of ''The Wicca Bible'' by Ann-Marie Gallagher. {{ISBN|978-1-84181-250-2}}. Same information also found in many other books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] Magic, the seven Traditional Planets correspond with the angles and the center of the Hexagram as follows, in the same patterns as they appear on the [[Sephiroth]] and on the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. Saturn, although formally attributed to the Sephira of [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]], within this frame work nonetheless occupies the position of [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Daath]].&lt;ref&gt;P31 of ''The Ritual Magic Manual: A Complete Course in Practical Magic'' by David Griffin. {{ISBN|978-0965840897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in Freemasonry==
{{quote|"The interlacing triangles or deltas symbolize the union of the two principles or forces, the active and passive, male and female, pervading the universe ... The two triangles, one white and the other black, interlacing, typify the mingling of apparent opposites in nature, darkness and light, error and truth, ignorance and wisdom, evil and good, throughout human life." –&amp;nbsp;Albert G. Mackey: ''Encyclopedia of [[Freemason]]ry''}}

The hexagram is featured within and on the outside of many [[Masonic temple]]s as a decoration. It may have been found within the structures of [[King Solomon]]'s temple, from which [[Freemasons]] are inspired in their philosophies and studies. Like many other symbols in Freemasonry, the deciphering of the hexagram is non-dogmatic and left to the interpretation of the individual.

Non-Jewish Kabbalah (also called Christian or Hermetic Kabbalah) interprets{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} the hexagram to mean the divine union of male and female energy, where the male is represented by the upper triangle and the female by the lower one. Moreover, it derives four triangular symbols from it (two triangles crossed like a capital letter A and two uncrossed) to represent the four elements: water, fire, air, and earth. This use of the symbol was used as an important plot point in [[Dan Brown]]'s popular novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and [[Da Vinci Code (film)|the ''Da Vinci Code'' film]] cites this as the origin of the star.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25130">Various aspects of communication have been the subject of study since ancient times, and the approach eventually developed into the academic discipline known today as communication studies.

==Pre-20th century==
In ancient [[Greece]] and Rome, the study of [[rhetoric]], the art of [[Eloquence|oratory]] and [[persuasion]], was a vital subject for [[student]]s. One significant ongoing debate was whether one could be an effective speaker in a base cause ([[Sophists]]) or whether excellent rhetoric came from the excellence of the orator's character ([[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]]). Through the European Middle Ages and [[Renaissance]] [[grammar]], rhetoric, and [[logic]] constituted the entire [[trivium (education)|trivium]], the base of the system of classical learning in Europe.

Communication has existed since the beginning of human beings, but it was not until the 20th century that people began to study the process. As communication technologies developed, so did the serious study of communication. When World War I ended, the interest in studying communication intensified. The social-science study was fully recognized as a legitimate discipline after World War II.

Before becoming simply communication, or communication studies, the discipline was formed from three other major studies: psychology, sociology, and political science.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson D. Pooley, “The New History of Mass Communication Research,” in History of Media and Communication Research: Contested Memories, edited with David Park (New York: Peter Lang, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Communication studies focus on communication as central to the human experience, which involves understanding how people behave in creating, exchanging, and interpreting messages.

== United States ==

=== 1900s–20s ===
Though the study of communication reaches back to antiquity and beyond, early twentieth-century work by [[Charles Horton Cooley]], [[Walter Lippmann]], and [[John Dewey]] have been of particular importance for the academic discipline as it stands today. In his 1909 ''Social Organization: a Study of the Larger Mind'', Cooley defines communication as "the mechanism through which human relations exist and develop—all the symbols of the mind, together with the means of conveying them through space and preserving them in time." This view gave processes of communication a central and constitutive place in the study of social relations. ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]'', published in 1922 by Walter Lippmann, couples this view with a fear that the rise of new technologies in mass communication allowed for the 'manufacture of consent,' and generated dissonance between what he called 'the world outside and the pictures in our heads,' referring to the rift between the idealized concept of democracy and its reality. John Dewey's 1927 ''[[The Public and its Problems]]'' drew on the same view of communications, but instead took a more optimistic reform agenda, arguing famously that "communication can alone create a great community," as well as "of all affairs, communication is the most wonderful."

Cooley, Lippmann, and Dewey capture themes like the central importance of communication in social life, the impact of changing technology upon culture, and questions regarding the relationship between communication, democracy, and community. These concepts continue to drive scholars today. Many of these concerns are also central to the work of writers such as [[Gabriel Tarde]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]], who have also made significant contributions to the field.

In 1925, Herbert A. Wichelns published the essay "The Literary Criticism of Oratory" in the book ''Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James Albert Winans.''&lt;ref&gt;Herbert A. Wichelns, "The Literary Criticism of Oratory," in ''Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James Albert Winans'' (New York: The Century Co., 1925), 181–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Wicheln's essay attempted to "put rhetorical studies on par with literary studies as an area of academic interest and research."&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Medhurst, "The Academic Study of Public Address: A Tradition in Transition," in ''Landmark Essays in American Public Address,'' ed. Martin J. Medhurst (Hermagoras Press 1993), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Wichelns wrote that oratory should be taken as seriously as literature, and therefore, it should be subject to criticism and analysis. Although the essay is now standard reading in most rhetorical criticism courses, it had little immediate impact (from 1925–1935) on the field of rhetorical studies.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Medhurst, "The Academic Study of Public Address: A Tradition in Transition," in ''Landmark Essays in American Public Address,'' ed. Martin J. Medhurst (Hermagoras Press 1993), p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1930s–50s===
The institutionalization of communication studies in U.S. higher education and research has often been traced to [[Columbia University]], the [[University of Chicago]], and the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]], where early pioneers such as [[Paul F. Lazarsfeld]], [[Harold Lasswell]], and [[Wilbur Schramm]] worked.  The work of Samuel Silas Curry, who founded the School of Expression in 1879 in Boston, is also noted in early communication research.  Today, the School of Expression is known as Curry College, located in Milton, MA, which houses one of the nation's oldest Communication programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curry.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bureau of Applied Social Research]] was established in 1944 at Columbia University by Paul F. Lazarsfeld. It was a continuation of the Rockefeller Foundation-funded Radio Project that he had led at various institutions (University of Newark, Princeton) from 1937, which had been at Columbia as the Office of Radio Research since 1939. In its various incarnations, the Radio Project had involved Lazarsfeld himself, and people like Adorno, [[Hadley Cantril]], [[Herta Herzog]], Gordon Allport, and [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]] (who went on to be president of CBS). Lazarsfeld and the Bureau mobilized substantial sums for research, and produced, with various co-authors, a series of books and edited volumes that helped define the discipline, such as ''Personal Influence'' (1955) which remains a classic in what is called the 'media effects'-tradition.

From the 1940s and onwards, the University of Chicago was home to several committees and commissions on communications, as well as programs that educated communication scholars. In contrast to what took place at Columbia, these programs explicitly claimed the name 'communications' for themselves. The Committee on Communication and Public Opinion, also funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, was staffed with, in addition to Lasswell, people such as [[Douglas Waples]], [[Samuel A. Stouffer]], [[Louis Wirth]], and [[Herbert Blumer]], all of whom held positions elsewhere at the university. They formed a committee that essentially served as a scholarly and educational extension of the federal government's increasing interest in communications during times of war, particularly the [[Office of War Information]]. Chicago later provided an institutional home for The Hutchins Commission on the Freedom of the Press and the Committee on Communication (1947–1960). The latter was a degree-granting program that counted [[Elihu Katz]], [[Bernard Berelson]], [[Edward Shils]], and [[David Riesman]] amongst its faculty, alumni include [[Herbert J. Gans]] and Michael Gurevitch. The committee also produced publications such as Berelson and [[Morris Janowitz|Janowitz]]' ''Public Opinion and Communication'' (1950) and the journal ''Studies in Public Communication''.

The Institute for Communications Research was founded at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1947 by Wilbur Schramm, who was a key figure in the post-war institutionalization of communication studies in the U.S. Like the various Chicago committees, the Illinois program claimed the name 'communications' and granted graduate degrees in the subject. Schramm, who, in contrast to the more social science-inspired figures at Columbia and Chicago, had a background in English literature, developed communication studies partly by merging existing programs in speech communication, rhetoric, and, especially, journalism under the aegis of communication. He also edited a textbook ''The Process and Effects of Mass Communication'' (1954) that helped define the field, partly by claiming Lazarsfeld, Lasswell, [[Carl Hovland]], and [[Kurt Lewin]] as its founding fathers. He also wrote several other manifestos for the discipline, including ''The Science of Human Communication'' 1963. Schramm established three important communication institutes: the Institute of Communications Research (University of Illinois), the Institute for Communication Research (Stanford University), and the East-West Communication Institute (Honolulu). Many of Schramm's students, such as [[Everett Rogers]], went on to make important contributions of their own.

=== 1950s===
Universities combined scholars of speech and mass media together under the term communication, which turned out to be a difficult process. While east coast universities did not see human communication as an important area for research, the field grew in the midwest. The first college of communication was founded at Michigan State University in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E. (2001). The department of communication at Michigan State University as a seed institution for communication course. Communication Studies, 52, 234–248.&lt;/ref&gt; led by scholars from Schramm's original ICR and dedicated to studying communication scientifically. MSU was soon followed by important departments of communication at [[Purdue University]], [[University of Texas-Austin]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of Iowa]], and the [[University of Illinois]].  Walter Annenberg endowed three Schools for Communication at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[The University of Southern California]], and [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simonson and John Durham Peters, "Communication and Media Studies, History to 1968," in International Encyclopedia of Communication, ed. Wolfgang Donsbach, Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media had long been studied by Adorno and his colleagues at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]], but German communication research further expanded rapidly at institutions such as the University of Hamburg, which opened the Hans Bredow Institute for Radio and Television in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Simonson, Peter, and John Durham Peters. "Communication and Media Studies, History to 1968." In International Encyclopedia of Communication, edited by Wolfgang Donsbach. Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associations related to Communication Studies were founded or expanded during the 1950s. The National Society for the Study of Communication (NSSC) was founded in 1950 to encourage scholars to pursue communication research as a social science.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Eadie, "Communication as an Academic Field: USA and Canada," in International Encyclopedia of Communication, ed. Wolfgang Donsbach, Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This Association launched the Journal of Communication in the same year as its founding. Like many communication associations founded around this decade, the name of the association changed with the field. In 1968 the name changed to the International Communication Association (ICA).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simonson and John Durham Peters, "Communication and Media Studies, History to 1968," in International Encyclopedia of Communication, ed. Wolfgang Donsbach, Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of what has been called 'medium theorists', arguably defined by [[Harold Innis]]' (1950) ''Empire and Communications'' grew increasingly important, and was popularized by [[Marshall McLuhan]] in his ''Understanding Media'' (1964). “McLuhan recognized that the evolution of communication played a crucial role in the human historical development and that social changes following the World Wars were directly connected with the rising of electrical communication technologies, which contributed in transforming the world into a ‘global village.’” &lt;ref&gt;Paolo Magaudda, "Communication Studies," in Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture, ed. Dale Southernton (n.p.: n.p., 2011), [21].&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective informs the later work of [[Joshua Meyrowitz]] (''No Sense of Place'', 1986).

Two developments in the 1940s shifted the paradigm of communication studies in the 1950s and thereafter toward a more quantitative orientation.  One was cybernetics, as formulated by [[Norbert Wiener]] in his ''Cybernetics: Or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine''.&lt;ref&gt;Paris: Librairie Hermann &amp; Cie, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; The other was [[information theory]], as recast in quantitative terms by [[Claude E. Shannon]] and [[Warren Weaver]] in their ''Mathematical Theory of Communication''.&lt;ref&gt;Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1949. {{ISBN|0-252-72548-4}}. Shannon &amp; Weaver's seminal work, which had developed during [[World War II]], originally appeared during 1948 in ''Bell System Technical Journal 27'', 379–423 (July) and 623–656 (October).&lt;/ref&gt; These works were widely appropriated to, and offered for some the prospect of, a general theory of society.

The tradition of [[critical theory]] associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] was, as in Europe, an important source of influence for many researchers. While done out of sociology departments, the work of [[Jürgen Habermas]], the US-based [[Leo Löwenthal]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Siegfried Kracauer]], as well as earlier figures like Adorno and [[Max Horkheimer]] continued to inform a whole tradition of cultural criticism that often focused both empirically and theoretically on the [[culture industry]].

In 1953, to address growing needs in the industry, [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] began offering a [[master of science]] degree in [[technical writing]]. In the 1960s the degree title became [[technical communication]]. It was the brainchild of longtime RPI professor and administrator Jay R. Gould.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard David Ramsey]]. (1990). The life and work of Jay R. Gould. ''Journal of Technical Writing and Communication 20'', 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 1950’s [[Bernard Berelson]] remarked that the field of communication was becoming too disjointed and argued that the field was dying with no new ideas or directions. This is “often referred to as his obituary for communication research.” &lt;ref&gt;Lisa Mullikin Parcell, "Communication and Media Studies, History Since 1968," in International Encyclopedia of Communication, ed. Wolfgang Donsbach, Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, new developments in media technology helped advance the field.

Other advances in communication studies came from the United States Information Agency and the work of Paul R. Conroy, USIA's Chief of Professional Training. As Dr. Conroy detailed in Antioch Review in 1958 &lt;ref&gt; Paul R. Conroy, "On Giving a Good Account of Ourselves," The Antioch Review, Vol. 18, No 4 (Winter 1958)&lt;/ref&gt;, USIA's program to help State Department employees and other personnel position the U.S. in the best possible light helped codify -- in a training environment focused on mock news conferences and other role-playing encounters -- now commonly-accepted media training, crisis communication, and interpersonal communication principles. 

Dr. Conroy was among the first to focus on principles of real-time message delivery - rather than simply message development - and the first to format such principles in a large-scale and repeatable training curriculum on the scale of USIA's global training program for its personnel.  "It is not enough to have a clear concept of the message," Dr. Conroy summarized in Antioch Review, "Communication, after all, is an art. And since any art usually requires practice in the skilled application of sound techniques, it is better if the practice is guided rather than haphazard."

=== 1960s===
In the 1960s, Gould and his colleagues experienced increasing demand for doctoral-level studies in technical and business communication.  As a result, in 1965 RPI began its Ph.D. program in communication and rhetoric.  This Ph.D. degree program became a prototype for other technologically oriented programs in the United States and other industrialized countries.

The 1960s and 1970s saw the development of [[cultivation theory]], pioneered by [[George Gerbner]] at the [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania]]. This approach shifted emphasis from the short-term effects that had been the central interest of many earlier media studies, and instead tried to track the effects of exposure across time.

In the early 1960s Communication Studies began to move towards a more independent field, and move out of the departments of [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], and [[English language|English]]. The changes in the department are considered a result of the historical events taking place at the time. “Despite the different interpretations given to the changes around the time of World War II, mostly shaped by increasing technological innovations in the ways people communicate, communication became a relevant and recurrent issue in human and social science, opening the doors to the centrality of communication in social theories in the 1960s and 1970s.” &lt;ref&gt;Magaudda, "Communication Studies," in Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture, [22].&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of many of these sociological changes taking place in society, communication and mass media acquired the role of explaining these changes to the public. In response to the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Vietnam War]], and other dramatic cultural shifts, critics using [[Cultural Marxism|Marxist]] and [[feminist theory]] to study dominant cultures became prominent in scholarly conversations. [[Cultural Studies]] related to mass media and critics asked why a number of big organizations had such an influence on society.

The political turmoil of the 1960s worked to the field’s advantage because mass media scholars began to explore the influence that media had on culture and society.&lt;ref&gt;Parcell, "Communication and Media Studies," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  “Growing recognition of the importance of the media by both industry and the public, as well as increasing respect for the field at the university leveled to increased support for new scholarship.” &lt;ref&gt;Parcell, "Communication and Media Studies," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, national and international communications conferences started to be held and associations such as the Speech Association of America (now [[National Communication Association]]) and [[International Communication Association]] (ICA) increased membership. With each year that passed, the number of communication journals published grew rapidly and by 1970 there were nearly one hundred of them published. After 1968, communication studies started to mature into its own discipline and gained respect in developed nations.&lt;ref&gt;Simonson and Peters, "Communication and Media Studies," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s–80s===
The Journal of Communication referred to the 1970s as a “time of ferment, particularly in the speech field. As social scientists pushed for recognition of ‘communication’ as the dominant term, rhetorical and performance scholars reconsidered and redefined their theories and methodologies.” &lt;ref&gt;Eadie, "Communication as an Academic," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  Speech Criticism combined with other sectors such as journalism and broadcasting to form of Communication Studies. In addition to the subgroups of the field making changes, national associations frequently changed their formal names to adapt to the growing field of communication. For example, in 1970 the Speech Association of America became the Speech Communication Association.&lt;ref&gt;Eadie, "Communication as an Academic," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; Radio and television continued to develop throughout the 1970s and this boom in diversity “forced scholars to adopt a more convergent model of communication.” &lt;ref&gt;Parcell, "Communication and Media Studies," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no longer only one source for each message and there was almost always more than one path from sender to receiver. 
	
[[Neil Postman]] founded the [[media ecology]] program at [[New York University]] in 1971. Media ecologists draw on a wide range of inspirations in their attempts to study media environments in an even broader and more culturally-driven fashion. This perspective is the basis of a separate professional association, the Media Ecology Association.

In 1972, [[Maxwell McCombs]] and [[Donald Shaw (academic)|Donald Shaw]] published a groundbreaking article that offered an [[agenda-setting theory]] that paved a new conception of short-term effects of the media. This approach, organized around additional ideas such as framing, priming, and gatekeeping, has been highly influential, especially in the study of political communication and news coverage.

The 1970s also saw the development of what became known as [[uses and gratifications]] theory, developed by scholars such as Elihu Katz, [[Jay G. Blumler]], and Michael Gurevitch. Instead of seeing audiences as passive entities experiencing effects from a one-way model (sender to receiver), they are analyzed through the paradigm of actively seeking out content based on their own pre-existing communication needs.

In 1980 the [[US Department of Education]] classified “communication” as a practical discipline, which was associated primarily with learning journalism and media production. The same classification system deemed speech and rhetorical studies a subcategory of English.&lt;ref&gt;Eadie, "Communication as an Academic," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
By the 1980s many colleges and universities across the country decided to rename departments to include the word “communication” in the department title. Other schools began titling their departments [[Mass Communication]], or created independent communication departments. “Often these new schools merge the professional fields of print, broadcast, public relations, advertising, information science, and speech with growing research programs more broadly defined communication research.” &lt;ref&gt;Eadie, "Communication as an Academic," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  From this point in time communication studies began to gain recognition in schools worldwide.

Written by S. F. Scudder in the early 1900s, and later published in 1980, "The Universal Communication Law" states that, "All living entities, beings and creatures communicate." In an unpublished interview, Scudder clarified the concept - "All of the living communicate through movements, sounds, reactions, physical changes, gestures, languages, breath, color transformations, etc. Communication is a means of survival, existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge its presence. Examples - the cry of a child (communication that it is hungry, hurt, cold, etc.); the browning of a leaf (communication that it is dehydrated, thirsty per se, dying); the cry of an animal (communicating that it is injured, hungry, angry, etc.). Everything living communicates." [[citation needed]]

==Germany==
Communication studies in Germany has a rich hermeneutic heritage in philology, textual interpretation, and historical studies. The post-World War II era, however, has seen the rise of a number of new paradigms.

[[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]] pioneered work on the [[spiral of silence]] in a tradition that has been widely influential across the world and has proven to be easily compatible with the dominant paradigms in, for instance, the United States.

In the 1970s, [[Karl Deutsch]] came to [[West Germany]], and his [[cybernetics]] inspired work has been widely influential there as elsewhere.

The work of the Frankfurt School has been a cornerstone of much German work on communication, in addition to Horkheimer, Adorno, and Habermas, figures like [[Oskar Negt]] and [[Alexander Kluge]] has been important in the development of this strand of thought.

An important competing paradigm has been the systems theory developed by [[Niklas Luhmann]] and his students.

Finally, from the 1980s and onwards, theorists like [[Friedrich Kittler]] have led the development of a 'new German medium theory', aligned partly with the Canadian medium theory of Innis and McLuhan and partly with [[post-structuralism]].

The ways in which societies have perceived the [[concept]] of [[creativity]] have changed throughout history, as has the [[terminology|term]] itself.  The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] concept of art (in Greek, "''techne''" — the root of "technique" and "technology"), with the exception of poetry, involved not freedom of action but subjection to ''rules''.  In [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the Greek concept was partly shaken, and [[visual art]]ists were viewed as sharing, with poets, [[imagination]] and [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]].

Under [[medieval]] [[Christianity]], the [[Latin]] "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "''[[creatio ex nihilo]]''" ("creation from nothing"); thus "''creatio''" ceased to apply to human activities.  The Middle Ages, however, went even further than antiquity, when they revoked poetry's exceptional status:  it, too, was an art and therefore craft and not creativity.

[[Renaissance]] men sought to give voice to their sense of their freedom and creativity.  The first to apply the word "creativity," however, was the 17th-century Polish poet [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] — but he applied it only to poetry.  For over a century and a half, the idea of ''human'' creativity met with resistance, because the term "creation" was reserved for creation "from nothing."

In the 19th century, art took its revenge:  now not only was art recognized as creativity, but ''it alone'' was.  When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[sciences]] and in [[nature]], this was taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts that were proper to art.

==Term and concept==
[[File:Head Platon Glyptothek Munich 548.jpg|thumb|85px|[[Plato]]]]
The [[ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator."  The expression "''poiein''" ("to make") sufficed.  And even that was not extended to art in general, but only to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who ''made'' it.  [[Plato]] asks in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?" and answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."  To the ancient Greeks, the concept of a creator and of creativity implied freedom of action, whereas the Greeks' concept of art involved subjection to laws and rules.  Art (in Greek, "''techne''") was "the making of things, according to rules."  It contained no creativity, and it would have been — in the Greeks' view — a bad state of affairs if it ''had''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas:  an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding of art had a distinct premise:  [[Nature]] is [[perfection|perfect]] and is subject to laws, therefore man ought to discover its laws and submit to them, and not seek freedom, which will deflect him from that ''optimum'' which he can attain.  The artist was a [[discovery (observation)|discoverer]], not an [[inventor]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sole exception to this Greek view — a ''great'' exception — was poetry.  The poet made new things — brought to life a new world — while the artist merely ''imitated''.  And the poet, unlike the artist, was ''not'' bound by laws.  There were no terms corresponding to "creativity" or "creator," but in reality the poet was understood to be one who creates.  And only he was so understood.  In music, there was no freedom:  melodies were prescribed, particularly for ceremonies and entertainments, and were known tellingly as "''nomoi''" ("laws").  In the [[visual arts]], freedom was limited by the [[Body proportions|proportions]] that [[Polyclitus (sculptor)|Polyclitus]] had established for the human frame, and which he called "the canon" (meaning, "measure").  [[Plato]] argued in ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' that, to execute a good work, one must contemplate an eternal model.  Later the [[Roman Republic|Roman]], [[Cicero]], would write that art embraces those things "of which we have knowledge" ("''quae sciuntur''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"/&gt;

Poets saw things differently.  Book I of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' asks, "Why forbid the singer to please us with singing ''as he himself will?''"  [[Aristotle]] had doubts as to whether poetry was imitation of reality, and as to whether it required adherence to truth:  it was, rather, the realm of that "which is neither true nor false."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, these Greek concepts were partly shaken.  [[Horace]] wrote that not only poets but painters as well were entitled to the privilege of daring whatever they wished to ("''quod libet audendi''").  In the declining period of antiquity, [[Philostratus]] wrote that "one can discover a similarity between poetry and art and find that they have [[imagination]] in common."  [[Callistratos]] averred that "Not only is the art of the poets and [[prose|prosaist]]s inspired, but likewise the hands of [[sculptor]]s are gifted with the blessing of divine [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]]."  This was something new:  [[classical Greece|classical Greeks]] had not applied the [[concept]]s of [[imagination]] and inspiration to the [[visual arts]] but had restricted them to poetry.  [[Latin]] was richer than Greek:  it had a term for "creating" ("''creatio''") and for "''creator''," and had ''two'' expressions — "''facere''" and "''creare''" — where Greek had but one, "''poiein''."  Still, the two Latin terms meant much the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental change, however, came in the Christian period:  "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "creation from nothing" ("''creatio ex nihilo''").  "''Creatio''" thus took on a different meaning than "''facere''" ("to make"), and ceased to apply to human functions.  As the 6th-century Roman official and literary figure [[Cassiodorus]] wrote, "things made and created differ, for we can make, who cannot create."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside this new, [[religion|religious]] interpretation of the expression, there persisted the ancient view that art is not a domain of creativity. This is seen in two early and influential Christian writers, [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. Later [[medieval]] men such as [[Hraban the Moor]], and [[Robert Grosseteste]] in the 13th century, thought much the same way.  The [[Middle Ages]] here went even further than [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]; they made no exception of poetry:  it too had its rules, was an art, and was therefore [[craft]] and not creativity.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"/&gt;

All this changed in modern times.  [[Renaissance]] men had a sense of their own independence, freedom and creativity, and sought to give voice to this sense of independence and creativity.  The philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] wrote that the artist "thinks up" ("''excogitatio''") his works; the theoretician of architecture and painting, [[Leon Battista Alberti]], that he "preordains" ("''preordinazione''"); [[Raphael]], that he shapes a painting according to his idea; [[Leonardo da Vinci]], that he employs "shapes that do not exist in nature"; [[Michelangelo]], that the artist realizes his vision rather than imitating nature; [[Giorgio Vasari]], that "nature is conquered by art"; the Venetian art theoretician, [[Paolo Pino]], that painting is "inventing what is not"; [[Paolo Veronese]], that painters avail themselves of the same liberties as do poets and madmen; [[Federico Zuccari]] (1542–1609), that the artist shapes "a new world, new paradises"; [[Cesare Cesariano]] (1483–1541), that architects are "demi-gods."  Among musicians, the [[Flanders|Flemish]] composer and musicologist [[Johannes Tinctoris]] (1446–1511) demanded novelty in what a composer did, and defined a composer as "one who produces ''new'' songs."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still more emphatic were those who wrote about poetry:  [[G.P. Capriano]] held (1555) that the poet's invention springs "from nothing."  [[Francesco Patrizi]] (1586) saw poetry as "fiction," "shaping," "transformation."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at long last, someone ventured to use the word, "creation."  He was the 17th-century Polish poet and theoretician of poetry, [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] (1595–1640), known as "the last Latin poet."  In his treatise, ''De perfecta poesi'', he not only wrote that a poet "invents," "after a fashion builds," but also that the poet "''creates anew''" ("''de novo creat''").  Sarbiewski even added:  "in the manner of God" ("''instar Dei''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

Sarbiewski, however, regarded creativity as the exclusive privilege of poetry; creativity was not open to visual artists.  "Other arts merely imitate and copy but do not create, because they assume the existence of the material from which they create or of the subject."  As late as the end of the 17th century, [[André Félibien]] (1619–75) would write that the painter is "so to speak [a] creator."  The Spanish [[Jesuit]] [[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–58) wrote similarly as Sarbiewski:  "Art is the completion of nature, as it were ''a second Creator''..."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

By the 18th century, the concept of creativity was appearing more often in art theory.  It was linked with the concept of [[imagination]], which was on all lips. [[Joseph Addison]] wrote that the imagination "has something in it like creation."  [[Voltaire]] declared (1740) that "the true poet is creative."  With both these authors, however, this was rather only a ''comparison'' of poet with creator.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers took a different view.  [[Denis Diderot]] felt that imagination is merely "the memory of forms and contents," and "creates nothing" but only combines, magnifies or diminishes.  It was precisely in 18th-century France, indeed, that the idea of man's creativity met with resistance.  [[Charles Batteux]] wrote that "The human mind ''cannot create'', strictly speaking; all its products bear the stigmata of their model; even monsters invented by an imagination unhampered by laws can only be composed of parts taken from nature."  [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues]] (1715–47), and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] (1715–80) spoke to a similar effect.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their resistance to the idea of human creativity had a triple source.  The expression, "creation," was then reserved for creation ''ex nihilo'' ({{lang-la|from nothing}}), which was inaccessible to man.  Second, creation is a mysterious act, and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] psychology did not admit of mysteries.  Third, artists of the age were attached to their rules, and creativity seemed irreconcilable with rules.  The latter objection was the weakest, as it was already beginning to be realized (e.g., by [[Houdar de la Motte]], 1715) that rules ultimately are a ''human invention''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

In the 19th century, art took its compensation for the resistance of preceding centuries against recognizing it as creativity.  Now not only was art regarded as creativity, but ''it alone'' was so regarded. When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[science]]s (e.g., [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], 1878–1956) and in [[nature]] (e.g., [[Henri Bergson]]), this was generally taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts proper to art.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

The start of the ''scientific'' study of creativity is sometimes taken as [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the subject.&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cocreativity.com/handouts/guilford.pdf | title=Guilford's structure of the intellect | publisher=The Co-Creativity Institute | accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other students of creativity have taken a more pragmatic approach, teaching practical [[creativity techniques]]. Three of the best-known are [[Alex Osborn]]'s "[[brainstorming]]" (1950s to present), [[Genrikh Altshuller]]'s Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving ([[TRIZ]], 1950s to present), and [[Edward de Bono]]'s "[[lateral thinking]]" (1960s to present).

On Wednesday 5 September 2007, the [[Australian House of Representatives]] Environment and Heritage Committee presented, to the [[Speaker_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives | Speaker]], its report on the inquiry into a sustainability charter entitled ''Sustainability for survival: creating a climate for change''.

A key recommendation within this report was to restate the need for a [[Australian sustainability commission | national Sustainability Commission]] headed by a Sustainability Commissioner that was previously recommended in the [[Sustainable Cities Report]] published in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11099">The '''International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres''' (IAML), also known as ''Association Internationale des Bibliothèques, Archives et Centres de Documentation Musicaux'' (AIBM) and ''Internationale Vereinigung der Musikbibliotheken, Musikarchive und Musikdokumentationszentren'' (IVMB), is an organisation of [[library|libraries]] with music departments, [[music conservatory]] libraries, radio and orchestra archives, university institutes, music documentation centers, music publishers, and music dealers that fosters international cooperation and promotes music [[bibliography]] and music [[library science]].&lt;ref name=ALA&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Robert |editor-last=Wedgeworth |title=World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services |date=1993 |publisher=[[American Library Association]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSFu99FCJwQC&amp;pg=PA371&amp;dq=International+Association+of+Music+Libraries,+Archives+and+Documentation+Centres&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OCdRUtG6EYjNswa384GYBw&amp;ved=0CGgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=International%20Association%20of%20Music%20Libraries%2C%20Archives%20and%20Documentation%20Centres&amp;f=false  |isbn=9780838906095}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was founded in Paris in 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Harrod's Librarians' Glossary and Reference Book |editor-first=Raymond John |editor-last=Prytherch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zoCfMEscyzwC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=International+Association+of+Music+Libraries,+Archives+and+Documentation+Centres&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OCdRUtG6EYjNswa384GYBw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=International%20Association%20of%20Music%20Libraries%2C%20Archives%20and%20Documentation%20Centres&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |date=2005 |isbn=9781409486152}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its three official languages are English, German, and French.

==History==
IAML was founded after [[World War II]] to "promote international cooperation and standardization in such matters as [[cataloging]], standards of service, personnel training and the exchange of materials between [[libraries]]."&lt;ref name=Lonn&gt;Anders Lönn, "International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres," The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd edition, 2002, vol. 12, p. 491. {{ISBN|0-333-60800-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of IAML was a three-year process from 1949 to 1951. It was part of the [[United Nations]]' mission to promote world peace. The founding conferences were held in [[Basel]] and [[Florence]] in 1949, in [[Lüneburg]] in 1950, and in [[Paris]] in 1951, the last one conducted by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Music Librarianship in the United Kingdom |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Turbet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zoCfMEscyzwC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=International+Association+of+Music+Libraries,+Archives+and+Documentation+Centres&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OCdRUtG6EYjNswa384GYBw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=International%20Association%20of%20Music%20Libraries%2C%20Archives%20and%20Documentation%20Centres&amp;f=false |date=2003 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |isbn=9780754605720}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Accademia Nazionale [[Luigi Cherubini]] celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1949, an event that brought around 60 music librarians, musicologists, and museum professionals from twelve countries to [[Florence]].&lt;ref name=Geering /&gt; This was the first meeting of music librarians from around the world; plans for a separate organization had been discussed since the founding of the [[International Musicological Society]] in 1927, but the [[Second World War]] prevented anything from taking shape.&lt;ref name="Pleßke"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pleßke|first=Hans-Martin|title=Geschichte und Funktion der Internationalen Vereinigung der Musikbibliotheken (IVMB)|journal=Zentralblatt für Bibliothekswesen|date=1972|volume=86|issue=6|pages=352–359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war had caused heavy losses at many [[libraries]], and international cooperation was of utmost importance. 

The goals of the Florence conference included updating the status and locations of the musical sources described in {{Interlanguage link multi|Robert Eitner's|de}} ''Biographisch-Bibliographisches Quellen-Lexikon der Musiker und Musikgelehrten der christlichen Zeitrechnung bis zur Mitte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts'' ([[Leipzig]], 1900–1904), establishing a central office in each country responsible for [[Microform|microfilming]] musical sources from before 1800, and addressing issues related to [[Music librarianship#Cataloging and Classification|music cataloging]].&lt;ref name=Geering /&gt; The first goal was realized in 1952 with the founding of the [[Répertoire International des Sources Musicales]].

In 1952, IAML had 224 members in 20 countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Membership grew to about 1,100 members in 39 countries in 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The International Association of Music Libraries |journal=[[Notes (journal)|Notes]] |first=Thor E. |last=Wood |pages=697–699 |volume=25 |issue=4 |date= June 1959 |jstor=896620}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,850 members in 40 countries in 1991,&lt;ref name=ALA /&gt; with national branches in 26 countries as of 2017.

IAML has professional sections, subject sections, study group, and project groups that focus on particular aspects of music librarianship and documentation. Two professional organizations, [[the International Association of Music Information Centres]] and the [[International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives]] began as IAML groups but later formed their own organizations.&lt;ref name=Lonn /&gt;

==Structure==
The IAML board of directors is made up of the [[president]], past president, [[Secretary (club)|secretary general]], [[treasurer]], and [[vice presidents]].&lt;ref name=Meinhold&gt;{{cite book|last=Meinhold|first=Alexandra|title=World Guide to Library, Archive, and Information Science Associations|date=2010|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=9783110226379|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board governs IAML together with a Council (which includes representatives from national branches and professional sections) and the General Assembly.

IAML is affiliated with the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), the [[International Music Council]], and the IMS.&lt;ref name=Meinhold /&gt;

==Activities==
IAML holds annual conferences and has implemented four main programmes, together known as the "R projects" of [[musicology]]: ''Répertoire international des sources musicales'' (RISM), ''[[Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale|Répertoire international de littérature musicale]]'' (RILM), ''Répertoire international d'iconographie musicale'' (RIdIM) and ''[[Répertoire international de la presse musicale]]'' (RIPM). IAML publishes a journal, ''Fontes Artis Musicae'', with articles on music librarianship and bibliography as well as reports on IAML conferences and on the progress of the "R projects".&lt;ref name=ALA /&gt;

===Annual Conferences===
IAML holds annual meetings in different locations around the world. Occasionally, meetings are held jointly with other professional organizations. After the founding meetings held from 1949-1951, annual meetings commenced in 1954.&lt;ref name=Geering&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geering|first=Mireille|title=Geschichte und Gegenwart der AIBM|journal=Forum Musikbibliothek|date=1991|volume=3|pages=197–212.

The '''International Association of Research Institutes in the History of Art''' (RIHA) promotes education and research in [[art history]] and related disciplines. It was founded in 1998 in [[Paris]] to intensify cooperation between art historical institutes by facilitating the flow of information on scientific and administrative activities as well as the exchange of research findings, and to encourage the institutes to undertake joint projects.

The '''RIHA Journal''' is a peer-reviewed, open-access e-journal providing a publishing platform for international research articles in the history of art. It features art historical articles in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.

The '''John Templeton Foundation''' ('''Templeton Foundation''') is a philanthropic organization that reflects the ideas of its founder, [[John Templeton]], who became wealthy after a career as a [[Contrarian investing|contrarian investor]] and wanted to support progress in religious and spiritual knowledge, especially at the intersection of religion and science. He also wanted to fund research on methods to promote and develop [[moral character]], intelligence, and creativity in people, and to promote free markets.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt; In 2016 ''Inside Philathropy'' called it "the oddest — or most interesting — big foundation around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Tate |title=Templeton Remains the Oddest—or Most Interesting—Big Foundation Around |url=https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2016/4/5/templeton-remains-the-oddestor-most-interestingbig-foundatio.html |work=Inside Philanthropy |date=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Templeton founded the organization in 1987 and ran it until his death in 2008.  Templeton's son [[John Templeton, Jr.]] ran it until his death in 2015, at which point Templeton, Jr.'s daughter, Heather Templeton Dill, became president.

The foundation administers the annual [[Templeton Prize]] for achievements in the field of spirituality, including those at the intersection of science and religion.  It has an extensive grant-funding program (around $70M per year as of 2011) aimed at supporting notions associated with [[classical liberalism]], like "character development", "freedom and free enterprise", and "exceptional cognitive talent and genius".  It funded work in [[intelligent design]] in the 1990s but then abandoned that activity after it faced sharp criticism from the mainstream scientific community in the 2000s.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

Many scholars have raised concerns about the biased nature of the awards, research projects and publications backed by the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Libby A. Nelson.

According to Lecointre, this type of private funding would be "disastrous for the autonomy of scientific research".&lt;ref name=CNRS&gt;{{cite web|title=La Fondation Templeton, les formes présentables du créationnisme philosophique : des initiatives " science et religions " pour dissoudre les limites entre le collectif et l'individuel, entre le public et le privé|url=http://www.cnrs.fr/cw/dossiers/dosevol/decouv/articles/chap1/lecointre5.html|author=Guillaume Lecointre|publisher=[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Center for Scientific Research]]|quote=très lié au fondamentalisme protestant ...

Ils ont bien compris qu'en finançant des scientifiques, des laboratoires, des colloques, elles peuvent coopter des scientifiques individuellement afin de créer la confusion sur le projet collectif d'une profession ; et faire passer une posture métaphysique pour scientifiquement validée –et donc collectivement validée. Il est donc de leur plus haut intérêt de se faire les amis de la science et des scientifiques. ... leur communication risque de s'avérer désastreuse pour l'autonomie de la science dans un contexte où le financement public des recherches ne cesse de diminuer au profit des financements privés de ce type.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation has also been criticized for supporting Christian-biased research in the field of the scientific [[religious studies|study of religions]].&lt;ref name=Wiebe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiebe|first=Donald|title=Religious Biases in Funding Religious Studies Research?|url=https://digilib.phil.muni.cz/bitstream/handle/11222.digilib/125290/2_Religio_17-2009-2_6.pdf|journal=Religio: revue pro religionistiku|volume=XVII|number=2|year=2009|pages=125–140|issn=1210-3640}} p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The Templeton Foundation has had links with the [[Discovery Institute]], an [[American conservatism|American conservative]] and creationist think-tank, and other similar organizations.&lt;ref name=CNRS/&gt;

==Leadership==
[[John Templeton]] (29 November 1912 – 8 July 2008) was an American-born British [[investor]], banker, [[Asset management|fund manager]], and philanthropist. In 1954, he entered the [[Mutual fund|mutual fund market]] and created the [[Franklin Templeton Investments|Templeton Growth Fund]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/business/09templeton-cnd.html|title=Sir John M. Templeton, Philanthropist, Rockstar, Dies at 95|date=9 July 2000|first=Robert D.|last=McFadden}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2011 profile of the foundation: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like many of his generation, Templeton was a great believer in progress, learning, initiative and the power of human imagination — not to mention the free-enterprise system that allowed him, a middle-class boy from Winchester, Tennessee, to earn billions of dollars on Wall Street. ... Unlike most of his peers, however, Templeton thought that the principles of progress should also apply to religion. He described himself as "an enthusiastic Christian" — but was also open to learning from Hinduism, Islam and other religious traditions. Why, he wondered, couldn't religious ideas be open to the type of constructive competition that had produced so many advances in science and the free market?.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These were the values he sought to promote first through the [[Templeton Prize]] which he started in 1972 and then through the foundation, which he founded in 1987 and ran until his death in 2008.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

[[John M. Templeton, Jr.]] worked as a pediatric surgeon; he was chief of pediatric surgery at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 1995 when he stopped practicing medicine and joined the foundation. He took over the leadership when his father died. He was an [[evangelical Christian]] and supported various [[American conservatism|American conservative]] causes.&lt;ref name=NYT2015&gt;{{cite news |title=John M. Templeton Jr., Who Led Foundation, Dies at 75 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/us/john-m-templeton-jr-who-led-foundation-dies-at-75.html |work=Associated Press via the New York Times |date=May 19, 2015 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2008-10-28/news/25263219_1_ban-gay-marriage-heterosexual-marriages-proposition|title=$1 million for their own two cents Bryn Mawr couple are largest individual donors in efforts to ban gay marriage in California.|work=Philadelphia Inquirer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216130758/http://articles.philly.com/2008-10-28/news/25263219_1_ban-gay-marriage-heterosexual-marriages-proposition|archivedate=December 16, 2013 |first=David |last=O'Reilly|date=October 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He always maintained that he tried to run the foundation according to his father's wishes instead of his own wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Olasky |first1=Marvin |title=Jack Templeton dies at age 75 |url=https://world.wng.org/2015/05/jack_templeton_dies_at_age_75? |work=World Magazine |date=19 May 2015 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He died in 2015.&lt;ref name=NYT2015/&gt;

Heather Templeton Dill, the daughter of John Templeton, Jr., became president in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People in the News (8/02/15): Appointments and Promotions|url=http://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/people-in-the-news-8-02-15-appointments-and-promotions|newspaper=Philanthropy News Digest|date=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endowment==
As of 2011, the foundation had an endowment of around $2.1 billion.  Around $500 million of that was a bequest from John Templeton when he died in 2008.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

==Prizes==
{{main|Templeton Prize}}
The Templeton Prize was established by [[John Templeton]] and he administered the prize until the foundation was established in 1987, which took it over.&lt;ref name=Nature2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Waldrop |first1=M. Mitchell |title=Religion: Faith in science |journal=Nature |date=17 February 2011 |volume=470 |issue=7334 |pages=323–325 |doi=10.1038/470323a}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11745591 |work = The Economist| title= Obituary – John Templeton | accessdate=July 2, 2009|date=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early prizes were given solely to people who had made great achievements in the field of religion; Mother Teresa received the inaugural award in 1973.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt; In the 1980's Templeton began considering the intersection of science and religion, and after he appointed to scientists to the judging panel, scientists who worked at the intersection began receiving it; [[Alister Hardy]] was the first, in 1987.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

==Funding==
Templeton believed in capitalism and in competition in all things.  Around 40% of grants are given in fields associated with [[classical liberalism]], like "character development", "freedom and free enterprise", and "exceptional cognitive talent and genius", and also across all religions, since Templeton believed progress in the field of spirituality could come from anywhere.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

The field of grants was broadened in the 1980s to include scientific fields like neuroscience, psychology, and cosmology, that could be seen as being at the intersection of science and religion.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;  In the 1990s the foundation funded people and organizations in the field of [[intelligent design]]; the foundation was frequently described as a major supporter of intelligent design during the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] litigation in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt; In the late 2000s, in the aftermath of its public shaming and loss of credibility among mainstream scientists, the foundation changed its grant topics to reduce the emphasis on religion and increase the emphasis on science and explicitly discouraged intelligent design proposals on its grant-application website.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

The top ten grants as of 2011 were:&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;
# Foundational Questions in Evolutionary Biology ($10,500,000)

===American conservatism===

Like all [[501(c)(3)]] organizations, the Templeton Foundation is prohibited from engaging directly in political activity. However, a number of journalists have highlighted connections with conservative causes. A 1997 article in ''[[Slate Magazine]]'' said the Templeton Foundation had given a significant amount of financial support to groups, causes and individuals considered [[American conservatism|conservative]], including gifts to [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Walter E. Williams]], [[Julian Lincoln Simon]] and [[Mary Lefkowitz]], and referred to John Templeton, Jr., as a "conservative sugar daddy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plotz |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1822/ |title=God's Venture Capitalist |publisher=Slate.com |date=1997-06-08 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation also has a history of supporting the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] think-tank, as well as projects at major research centers and universities that explore themes related to [[free market economics]], such as [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]]'s [[Institute for Liberty and Democracy|Instituto Libertad Y Democracia]] and the [[X Prize Foundation]].

In a 2007 article in ''[[The Nation]]'', [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] drew attention to the Foundation's president John M.

In 2013 it was highlighted that the Templeton Foundation has been funding the [[climate change denial]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacPherson|first=Diana|date=26 December 2013|title=Templeton funds climate-change denialist groups|url=https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2013/12/26/templeton-funds-climate-change-denialist-groups/|website=Why Evolution is True}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligent design===

In the 1990s organizations funded by the foundation gave grants for writing books to [[Guillermo Gonzalez (astronomer)|Guillermo Gonzalez]] and to [[William Dembski]] who are proponents of [[intelligent design]] and who both joined the [[Discovery Institute]].&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dembski |first1=William A. |title=Being as Communion: A Metaphysics of Information |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317175445 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wYHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation also gave money directly to the Discovery Institute which in turn passed it through to Baylor University, which used the funds to support Dembski's salary at the short-lived [[Michael Polanyi Center]] at Baylor,&lt;ref name=Trojan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forrest |first1=Barbara |last2=Gross |first2=Paul R. |title=Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design |date=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195319736 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mMSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA306#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|306}}&lt;ref name=wedgeatwork&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gross |first1=Barbara |title=The Wedge at Work |url=https://ncse.com/creationism/analysis/wedge-at-work |work=NCSE |date=3 December 2008 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a major step forward in the Discovery Institute's [[wedge strategy]], in that it established a beachhead for intelligent design within a major US university.&lt;ref name=wedgeatwork/&gt; [[Bruce L. Gordon]], another intelligent design proponent, was associate director of the center, and the foundation continued to fund his projects at Baylor after the center was dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Final In Series Of Science And Faith Lectures To Be Held April 22–23 |url=https://www.baylor.edu/mediacommunications/news.php?action=story&amp;story=7161 |work=Media Communications {{!}} Baylor University |date=19 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other grants supported a conference around 2000 that put proponents of intelligent design on an equal footing with scientists.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

In 2005 the foundation was frequently described as a major supporter of intelligent design during the widely discussed [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] litigation in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;  The foundation, through Charles L. Harper Jr., its senior vice president for research, disputed that characterization, saying that while the foundation had initially been sympathetic to intelligent design, it had since grown disillusioned.&lt;ref name=NYT2005&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goodstein |first1=Laurie |title=Intelligent Design Might Be Meeting Its Maker |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/weekinreview/intelligent-design-might-be-meeting-its-maker.html |work=New York Times |date=December 4, 2005 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He told ''BusinessWeek'' that the foundation had become one of the "principal critics" of the intelligent design movement and funded projects that challenged it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_48/b3961617.htm |title=Bloomberg Business |publisher=Businessweek.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and told the ''New York Times'': "From the point of view of rigor and intellectual seriousness, the intelligent design people don't come out very well in our world of scientific review".&lt;ref name=NYT2005/&gt;

A 2007 article in the ''Los Angeles Times'' described the foundation as having "drawn criticism for its early support of intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Iritani |first1=Evelyn |title=Testing the role of trust and values in financial decisions |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/21/business/fi-values21 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=21 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, the Discovery Institute accused the foundation of blocking its involvement in ''[[Biological Evolution: Facts and Theories]]'', a Vatican-backed, Templeton-funded conference in Rome. On the lack of involvement of any speakers supporting intelligent design, the conference director Rev. Marc Leclerc said, "We think that it's not a scientific perspective, nor a theological or philosophical one ... This makes a dialogue difficult, maybe impossible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cleveland.com/world/index.ssf/2009/03/vaticanbacked_rome_conference.html |title=Vatican-backed Rome conference on evolution snubs intelligent-design and creationist groups |publisher=cleveland.com |date=2009-03-05 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{pov section|date=November 2018}}
===Critiques from the French National Center for Scientific Research===
Giullaume Lecointre of the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Center for Scientific Research]] (CNRS) has been scathingly critical of the Templeton Foundation, calling its type of private founding "disastrous for the autonomy of scientific research", as the French Center considers it aligned to fundamentalist Protestantism, creationism, and aimed at the dissolution of the [[epistemology|epistemological]] distinction between the collective and public [[empirical knowledge|empirical]] enquiry and the individual and private [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] convictions.&lt;ref name=CNRS/&gt;

{{quote|''... Mais ce choix ne saurait en rien constituer un projet collectif de connaissance objective. Les connaissances empiriques, universellement testables, constituent la partie de nos savoirs qui unissent les hommes, et c'est pour cela qu'elles sont politiquement publiques. Les options métaphysiques restent personnelles et politiquement privées car elles peuvent diviser les hommes et donc devenir dans le champ politique une source d'oppression.''&lt;br&gt; ... But this choice [the promotion of individual metaphysical opinions] will not be able at all to constitute a collective project of objective knowledge. Empirical knowledge, universally testable, forms the part of our knowledge which unites humanity, and it is for this reason politically public. Metaphysical opinions remain personal and politically private since they can divide humanity and thus become, within the political field, a source of oppression.|CNRS&lt;ref name=CNRS/&gt;}}

===Critiques from individual scholars===
The Foundation's views on the connections between religious and scientific inquiry and their ability to provide significant grants for scientific research has led to a polarising debate within the scientific community.

====Chris Mooney====
Science journalist Chris Mooney, an atheist and author of ''The Republican War on Science'', received a 2010 Templeton-Cambridge Journalism Fellowship, enabling him to join other journalists for a three-week lecture program on science and religion at Cambridge University. In a 2010 article on his ''Discover'' magazine blog, Mooney wrote, "I can honestly say that I have found the lectures and presentations that we've heard here to be serious and stimulating. The same goes for the discussions that have followed them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mooney|first=Chris|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/06/07/science-and-religion-on-the-cam-part-i/#more-8792|title=Science and Religion on the Cam, Part I|website=Doscover|date=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Horgan, a 2005 Templeton-Cambridge fellow then working as a freelance science journalist, wrote in ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' that he had enjoyed his fellowship, but felt guilty that by taking money from the Templeton Foundation, he had contributed to the mingling of science with religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnhorgan.org/the_templeton_foundation__a_skeptic_s_take_52371.htm|title=The Templeton Foundation: A Skeptic's Take|publisher=John Horgan|date=7 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another 2010 article, Mooney took issue with Horgan's point, calling the idea that the fellowship was a "Trojan horse" for religion "pretty untenable". Templeton critics Richard Dawkins, [[A. C. Grayling]], and [[Daniel Dennett]] declined to answer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mooney|first=Chris|title=Science and Religion on the Cam, Part II|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/06/10/science-and-religion-on-the-cam-part-ii/#.VJiK_sAKA|website=Doscover|date=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Templeton-Cambridge fellow's interview requests, saying that they did not want to lend credibility to the science and religion journalism program. Mooney rejected this approach, writing, "You can't both denounce the fellowship for being intellectually tilted and also boycott it, thereby refusing to help lend it more of the balance you claim it needs". Grayling and Dennett answered this criticism as follows:

{{quote|... I disapprove of the Templeton Foundation's attempt to tie theologians to the coat tails of scientists and philosophers who actually do have expertise on this topic [that materialism is in Dennett's opinion not an obstacle to an ethical life].

Many years ago I made the mistake of participating, with some very good scientists, in a conference that pitted us against astrologers and other new age fakes. I learned to my dismay that even though we thoroughly dismantled the opposition, many in the audience ended up, paradoxically, with an increased esteem for astrologers! As one person explained to me "I figured that if you scientists were willing to work this hard to refute it, there must be something to it!" Isn't it obvious to you that the Templeton Foundation is eager to create the very same response in its readers?

{{quote|I cannot agree with the Templeton Foundation's project of trying to make religion respectable by conflating it with science; this is like mixing astrology with astronomy or voodoo with medical research, and I disapprove of Templeton's use of its great wealth to bribe compliance with this project. Templeton is to all intents and purposes a propaganda organisation for religious outlooks; it should honestly say so and equally honestly devote its money to prop up the antique superstitions it favours, and not pretend that questions of religion are of the same kind and on the same level as those of science—by which means it persistently seeks to muddy the waters and keep religion credible in lay eyes. It is for this reason I don't take part in Templeton-associated matters.|[[A.C. Grayling]]&lt;ref name="whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com"/&gt;}}

====Donald Wiebe====
Donald Wiebe, scholar of [[religious studies]] at the [[University of Toronto]], criticized the Templeton Foundation in a 2009 article entitled ''Religious Biases in Funding Religious Studies Research?''. According to him, the Templeton Foundation supports Christian bias in the field of religious studies, by deliberately imposing constraints to steer the results of the research.&lt;ref name=Wiebe/&gt;

{{quote|... A cursory review of these projects suggested to me that the religious (perhaps, speaking liberally, Christian) objectives of the Templeton Foundation were sufficiently problematic to warrant critical public scrutiny of their support for Religious Studies research. It seems to me that obtaining a grant from the Foundation involves constraints that impose a religious bias on the research they fund. As I see it, the Foundation seeks, whether directly or indirectly, to transform genuinely scientific research agendas into religious ones ...&lt;ref name=Wiebe/&gt;}}

====Jerry Coyne====
In 2011, the science journal ''Nature'' took note of the ongoing controversy among scientists over working with Templeton.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt; [[Jerry Coyne]], [[University of Chicago]] evolutionary biologist  sees a fundamental impossibility in attempting to reconcile faith with science.

{{quote|"Religion is based on dogma and belief, whereas science is based on doubt and questioning," says Coyne, echoing an argument made by many others. "In religion, faith is a virtue. In science, faith is a vice". The purpose of the Templeton Foundation is to break down that wall, he says—to reconcile the irreconcilable and give religion scholarly legitimacy ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/nature-on-templeton/|title=''Nature'' on Templeton|website=Why Evolution Is True|date=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A fierce Templeton critic, Coyne told ''Nature'' writer Mitchell Waldrop that the Foundation's purpose is to eliminate the wall between religion and science, and to use science's prestige to validate religion. Other scientists, including Foundation grantees like University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo and Anthony Aguirre, a University of California—Santa Cruz astrophysicist, told ''Nature'' that they have never felt pressured by Templeton to spin their research toward religion-friendly conclusions.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;

====John Horgan====
[[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]], a science journalist and the author of several books, in 2006 wrote an article for ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' (reprinted in ''Edge'') of his "misgivings about the foundation's agenda of reconciling religion and science". He said that a conference he attended favored scientists who "offered a perspective clearly skewed in favor of religion and Christianity", and says that:

{{quote|One Templeton official made what I felt were inappropriate remarks about the foundation's expectations of us fellows. She told us that the meeting cost more than $1-million, and in return the foundation wanted us to publish articles touching on science and religion.&lt;ref name="Edge Horgan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/horgan06/horgan06_index.html|title=The Templeton Foundation: A Skeptic's Take|last=Horgan|first=John|date=4 May 2006|website=Edge}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Horgan fears recipients of large grants from the Templeton Foundation sometimes write what the Foundation wants rather than what they believe.

{{quote|Several areligious scientists told me privately that they did not want to challenge the beliefs of religious speakers for fear of offending them and the Templeton hosts.&lt;ref name="Edge Horgan"/&gt;}}

====Nathan Schneider====
In 2010, journalist [[Nathan Schneider]] published a lengthy investigative article about the Templeton Foundation, entitled ''God, Science and Philanthropy'', in ''[[The Nation]]''. In the article, he aired familiar complaints about the Foundation, but observed that many of its critics and grantees alike failed to appreciate "the breadth of the foundation's activities, much less the quixotic vision of its founder, John Templeton". Schneider observed: "At worst, Templeton could be called heterodox and naïve; at best, his was a mind more open than most, reflective of the most inventive and combinatorial strains of American religious thought, eager to radically reinterpret ancient wisdom and bring it up to speed with some version from the present."&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/god-science-and-philanthropy?page=full|title=God, Science and Philanthropy|newspaper=The Nation|date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the foundation, in Schneider's view, "has associated itself with political and religious forces that cause it to be perceived as threatening the integrity of science and protecting the religious status quo," these alliances meant the foundation "is also better positioned than most to foster a conservatism—and a culture generally—that holds the old habits of religions and business responsible to good evidence, while helping scientists better speak to people's deepest concerns".&lt;ref name=schneider/&gt;

====Paul Davies====
Professor [[Paul Davies]], physicist and member of the Foundation's Board of Trustees, gave a defense of the Foundation's role in the scientific community in the Times Higher Education Supplement in March 2005. Responding to concerns about the funding of such research by religious organisations that might have a hidden agenda and in particular the Templeton Foundation, Davies said:

{{quote|If the foundation were indeed a religious organisation with its own specific doctrine, [the] objections would have substance. In fact, it is nothing of the sort. The benefactor, Sir John Templeton, bemoans the way that religious leaders often claim to have all the answers. Imagine, he says, consulting a doctor about an ailment, only to find him reaching for a volume of Hippocrates.  Yet priests rely on ancient scriptures to deliver spiritual guidance. Sir John wants to address the big questions of existence with humility and open-mindedness, adopting the model of scientific research in place of religious dogma. "How little we know!" is his favourite aphorism. It is a radical message, as far from religious fundamentalism as it is possible to get.

... recurring research themes supported by the foundation are the search for extra-solar planets, the properties of liquid water, the evolution of primate behaviour, emergent properties of complex systems, the foundations of quantum mechanics and the biological and social bases for forgiveness in areas of human conflict. In none of these projects is anything like a preferred religious position encouraged or an obligation imposed to support any religious group.

Britain is a post-religious society. Yet ordinary men and women still yearn for some sort of deeper meaning to their lives.  Can science point the way? Science has traditionally been regarded as dehumanising and alienating, trivialising the significance of humans and celebrating the pointlessness of existence. But many scientists, atheists included, see it differently. They experience what Einstein called "a cosmic religious feeling" when reflecting on the majesty of the cosmos and the extraordinary elegance and ingenuity of its mathematical laws.

Science cannot and should not be a substitute for religion. But I see nothing sinister or unprofessional about scientists working with open-minded theologians to explore how science might be a source of inspiration rather than demoralisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seeking inspiration in science|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/seeking-inspiration-in-science/194642.article|date=11 March 2005|website=Times Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Peter Woit====
[[Peter Woit]], a mathematical physicist at [[Columbia University]], occasionally writes about his misgivings with the foundation on his blog (which is hosted by Columbia University). Woit feels it is unfortunate that Templeton's money is used to influence scientific research towards a convergence between science and religion.

In June 2005, Woit wrote:

{{quote|Look not at what the Templeton people say (which is relatively innocuous), but at what they do. They explicitly refuse to support serious science, and instead fund an incredible array of attempts to inject religion into scientific practice. ... Instead they are heavily funding the one part of the field that most people consider dangerous pseudo-science and a serious threat to the whole concept of what it means to do science.&lt;ref name=Woit1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=205|title=Multiverse, String Theory and Templeton|last=Woit|first=Peter|date=12 June 2005|work=Not Even Wrong (Peter Woit's blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In October 2007, he gave this more qualified, but still largely critical, assessment of the Foundation following attendance at a Templeton sponsored seminar:
 
{{quote|The symposium I attended had not a trace of involvement of religion in it, and it seems that Templeton is careful to keep this out of some of the things that it funds as pure science ... They appear to have a serious commitment to the idea of funding things in physics that can be considered "foundational". People working in some such areas often are considered out of the physics mainstream and so find it hard to get their research funded. For them, Templeton is in many ways a uniquely promising funding source.

... However, they unambiguously are devoted to trying to bring science and religion together, and that's my main problem with them. ... I remain concerned though about the significance for physics of this large new source of funding, out of scale with other such private sources, and with an agenda that seems to me to have a dangerous component to it.&lt;ref name=Woit2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=606|title=Deep Beauty|last=Woit|first=Peter|date=6 October 2007|work=Not Even Wrong (Peter Woit's blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nonetheless, Woit's impression is that the Foundation is careful to keep conservative politics out of its activities and he does state that "their encouragement of religion seems to be of a very ecumenical nature".&lt;ref name=Woit2/&gt;

On 16 March 2012, in an article entitled ''Templeton Millions'', Woit expressed a more scathing critique of the Templeton Foundation:

{{quote|... I think what is going on here is very dangerous. The Templeton Foundation's agenda is not the advancement of science, it is the advancement of a particular religious point of view about what science is and how it should be done. They are very cleverly putting large sums of money into backing theology and pseudo-scientific research at the most prestigious academic institutions in the world. One reason that these places are happily taking the money is because public funding is drying up. The organization is extremely wealthy, and now led by Templeton's son, who when he isn't spending his father's money on this is spending it on promoting Rick Santorum's political career or other far-right causes.&lt;ref name=Woit3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=4478&amp;cpage=1|title=Templeton Millions|last=Woit|first=Peter|date=16 March 2012|work=Not Even Wrong (Peter Woit's blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Woit wrote that the Templeton Foundation that year funded a project led by the astronomer Donald York of the [[University of Chicago]] because he is an [[evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]], quoting a statement of the Foundation itself.&lt;ref name=Woit3/&gt;

====PZ Myers====
On 7 May 2009, [[PZ Myers]], biologist at the [[University of Minnesota Morris]], wrote:

{{quote|They have an agenda, and it is one of the most corrupting and untrustworthy causes of all, religion. They already know the answer, and they only want to pay for results that can be interpreted to bolster their unsupportable claims. Even if they are not asking that anyone fake evidence, we know that any line of inquiry that leads away from their desired answer will be abandoned, even if it is leading to the right answer. They are antithetical to good science. ... And, boy are they loaded, with a massive endowment and the willingness to throw large sums of money around. Scarily huge sums — the kind of money that will tempt even the most principled scientist to compromise a little bit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PZ Myers|url=https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/07/the-templeton-conundrum/#more://|title=The Templeton condrum|website=Freethought Blogs – Pharyngula|date=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Richard Dawkins====
In his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] (an [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]]) repeatedly criticizes the Templeton Foundation, referring to the Templeton Prize as "a very large sum of money given ... usually to a scientist who is prepared to say something nice about religion". Concerning the conference that he and John Horgan attended, and to John Horgan's resulting article, Dawkins comments, "If I understand Horgan's point, it is that Templeton's money corrupts science".&lt;ref name='GodDelusion'&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The God Delusion|publisher=Black Swan|year=2006|location=UK|isbn=9780552773317|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Templeton funded a study specifically targeting Richard Dawkins, authored by a team led by the Templeton-funded sociologist [[Elaine Howard Ecklund]], of the [[Rice University]]. Out of a total number of interviewed scientists, the authors selected those who didn't like Dawkins, and compiled an entire publication based on their opinion. In the article Dawkins is variously called "Mr. Anti-God Europe", "extremely arrogant" and "overly aggressive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2016/11/18/in-defense-of-richard-dawkins-elaine-ecklund-and-team-write-a-pointless-templeton-funded-paper-saying-that-surveyed-scientists-feel-that-dawkins-misrepresents-science/|title=In defense of Richard Dawkins: Elaine Ecklund and team write a pointless, Templeton-funded paper saying that Dawkins "misrepresents science"|website=Why Evolution is True|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sean M. Carroll====
[[Sean M. Carroll]], a [[cosmologist]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]], wrote, in describing his self-recusal from a conference he discovered was funded by the Foundation, that "the entire purpose of the Templeton Foundation is to blur the line between straightforward science and explicitly religious activity, making it seem like the two enterprises are part of one big undertaking. It's all about appearances". But he also said, "I appreciate that the Templeton Foundation is actually, in its own way, quite pro-science, and is not nearly as objectionable as the anti-scientific crackpots at the [[Discovery Institute]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Sean|url=http://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/2005_04_01_preposterousuniverse_archive.html#111387591806156772|title=Purity of essence|date=18 April 2005|website=Preposterous Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sunny Bains====
Sunny Bains of [[University College London]] Faculty of Engineering Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Sunny Bains Biography|url=http://www.sunnybains.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that there is:

{{quote|... evidence of cronyism (especially in the awarding in those million-dollar-plus Templeton prizes), a misleading attempt to move away from using religious language (without changing the religious agenda), the funding of right-wing anti-science groups, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bains|first=Sunny|title=Keeping an eye on the John Templeton Foundation|date=6 April 2011|url=https://www.absw.org.uk/news-and-events/news/keeping-an-eye-on-the-john-templeton-foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bains feels the Templeton Foundation "blur the line between science and religion". Bains' claims have been disputed by Josh Rosenau of the National Center for Science Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenau|first=Josh|url=http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2011/03/how_bad_is_the_templeton_found.php|title=How bad is the Templeton Foundation? – Thoughts from Kansas|publisher=Scienceblogs.com|date=5 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502174515/http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2011/03/how_bad_is_the_templeton_found.php|archivedate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] which continues the process of [[land reform in Scotland]] following the [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015]]. It is notable for granting [[Scottish ministers]] the power to force the sale of private land to community bodies to further [[sustainable development]] in the absence of a willing seller.

==Provisions==

Under the provisions of the act there is to be a ‘Land Rights and Responsibilities Statement’, setting out the Scottish Government’s objectives for [[Land reform in Scotland|land reform]], a [[Scottish Land Commission]] is to take forward the land reform process, preparing a strategic plan, for the approval of Scottish ministers. One of the new land commissioners is to be a Tenant Farming Commissioner who must be neither an agricultural landlord nor a tenant but who is to be responsible for reviewing issues relating to [[tenant farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blair|first1=Mike|title=A Brief Guide to Land Reform in Scotland|url=http://www.gillespiemacandrew.co.uk/media/340813/land-reform-act-2016.pdf|publisher=Gillespie Macandrew LLP|accessdate=5 March 2017|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further provision is the creation of the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development. This permits Scottish ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a registered interest. Unlike the Community Right to Buy established by the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] and extended by the [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015]], the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. In this respect it is similar to the Crofting Community Right to Buy of the 2003 Act which allows [[crofting]] communities to purchase croft land and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land of the 2015 Act, neither of which require a willing seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community rights to buy in Scotland – which is which, and what are they for?|url=http://www.brodies.com/node/8185|website=Brodies|accessdate=5 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a 3rd party to purchase land on the same basis. 

Other provisions of the act include new regulations to require persons who control land to be identified, with information obtained to appear in the Land Register of Scotland; the removal of sporting rights exemption from rates, which are to be re-valued; and further powers for [[Scottish Natural Heritage]] to control deer management. It also makes provision for notice and consultation where core paths are to be amended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2016/18/pdfs/asp_20160018_en.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of notable [[codex|codices]]. 

For the purposes of this compilation, as in [[philology]], a "[[codex]]" is a [[manuscript]] book published from the [[late Antiquity]] period through the [[Middle Ages]]. (The majority of the books in both the [[list of manuscripts]] and [[list of illuminated manuscripts]] are codices.) More modern works that include "codex" as part of their name are not listed here. The following codices are usually named for their most famous resting-places, such as a city or library.

[[File:Blue-tailed damselflies (Ischnura elegans) mating, female typica 2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Blue-tailed damselfly|Blue-tailed damselflies]]&lt;br&gt;(''Ischnura elegans'') mating]]

In [[biology]], '''mating''' (or '''mateing''' in [[American and British English spelling differences|British English]]) is the pairing of either opposite-[[sex]] or [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[organism]]s, usually for the purposes of [[sexual reproduction]]. Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mating|title=Mate|author=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other definitions extend the term to mating in plants and fungi. ''[[Fertilization]]'' is the fusion of both [[Germ cell|sex cell]] or [[gamete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Free Dictionary|title='Fertilization' - definition of|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fertilization|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Copulation (zoology)|Copulation]]'' is the union of the [[sex organ]]s of two sexually reproducing animals for [[insemination]] and subsequent [[internal fertilization]]. Mating may also lead to [[external fertilization]], as seen in [[amphibians]], [[fish]]es and plants. For the majority of species, mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes. However, for some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not required because the parent organism is capable of self-fertilization ([[Reproduction#Autogamy|autogamy]]); for example, [[banana slug]]s.

The term ''mating'' is also applied to related processes in [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[virus]]es.  Mating in these cases involves the pairing of individuals, accompanied by the pairing of their [[homologous chromosomes]] and then exchange of genomic information leading to formation of [[Genetic recombination|recombinant]] progeny (see [[mating systems]]).

==Animals==
{{Main|Animal sexual behaviour}}
{{See also|Copulation (zoology)|Human mating strategies}}

For animals, mating strategies include [[random mating]], [[disassortative mating]], [[assortative mating]], or a [[mating pool]]. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as [[nest]]-building and [[nutrition|feed]]ing offspring. The human practice of mating and [[Artificial_insemination#Artificial_insemination_in_livestock_and_pets|artificially inseminating domesticated animals]] is part of [[animal husbandry]].

In some [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[arthropod]]s, including [[insect]]s representing [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] (primitive) [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] clades, the male deposits [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure.  [[Courtship display|Courtship]] involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening without actual copulation. In groups such as [[dragonflies]] and many [[spider]]s, males extrude sperm into secondary copulatory structures removed from their genital opening, which are then used to inseminate the female (in dragonflies, it is a set of modified [[sternite]]s on the second abdominal segment; in spiders, it is the male [[pedipalp]]s). In advanced groups of insects, the male uses its [[aedeagus]], a structure formed from the terminal segments of the abdomen, to deposit sperm directly (though sometimes in a capsule called a "[[spermatophore]]") into the female's reproductive tract.

Other animals reproduce sexually with external fertilization, including many [[primitive (biology)|basal]] [[vertebrate]]s. Vertebrates (such as [[reptile]]s, some [[fish]], and most [[bird]]s) reproduce with internal fertilization through [[cloaca]]l copulation (see also [[hemipenis]]),{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} while [[Mating behavior of mammals|mammals copulate vagina]]lly.&lt;ref name="Hyman1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Libbie Henrietta Hyman|title=Hyman's Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKlWjdOkiMwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=copulate&amp;f=false|date=15 September 1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-87013-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants and fungi==
{{Main|Mating systems#In plants|Mating in fungi|Mating of yeast}}

Like in animals, mating in other Eukaryotes, such as [[plant]]s and [[fungus|fungi]], denotes {{clarify span|sexual conjugation|date=April 2013}}. However, in vascular plants this is mostly achieved without physical contact between mating individuals (see [[pollination]]), and in some cases, e.g., in fungi no distinguishable male or female organs exist (see [[isogamy]]); however, [[mating type]]s in some fungal species are somewhat analogous to [[sexual dimorphism]] in animals, and determine whether or not two individual isolates can mate. ''[[Yeasts]]'' are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s classified in the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[fungus|Fungi]], with 1,500 [[species]] currently described.&lt;ref name="YeastRef2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yeastgenome.org/VL-what_are_yeast.html |title=What are yeasts? |work=Yeast Virtual Library |date=13 September 2009 |accessdate=28 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226151906/http://www.yeastgenome.org/VL-what_are_yeast.html |archivedate=26 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, under high stress conditions like [[nutrient]] starvation, [[haploid]] cells will die; under the same conditions, however, [[diploid]] cells of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' can undergo sporulation, entering sexual reproduction ([[meiosis]]) and produce a variety of haploid [[spore]]s, which can go on to [[mating of yeast|mate]] (conjugate) and reform the [[diploid]].&lt;ref name=Neiman2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Neiman, A.M. |title=Ascospore formation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=565–584 |year=2005 |pmid=16339736 |pmc=1306807 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.69.4.565-584.2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protists==

Protists are a large group of diverse [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s, mainly [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] animals and plants, that do not form [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].  Eukaryotes emerged in evolution more than 1.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="pmid11452306"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Javaux EJ, Knoll AH, Walter MR |title=Morphological and ecological complexity in early eukaryotic ecosystems |journal=Nature |volume=412 |issue=6842 |pages=66–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11452306 |doi=10.1038/35083562 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest eukaryotes were likely protists. Mating and sexual reproduction are widespread among extant eukaryotes including protists such as ''[[Paramecium]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]''. In many eukaryotic species, mating is promoted by [[sex pheromones]] including the protist ''[[Blepharisma japonicum]].'' Based on a phylogenetic analysis, Dacks and Roger&lt;ref name="pmid10229582"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dacks J, Roger AJ |title=The first sexual lineage and the relevance of facultative sex |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=779–83 |year=1999 |pmid=10229582 |doi= 10.1007/pl00013156|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes.

However, to many biologists it seemed unlikely until recently, that mating and sex could be a primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes.  A principal reason for this view was that mating and sex appeared to be lacking in certain [[pathogen]]ic protists whose ancestors branched off early from the eukaryotic family tree.  However, several of these protists are now known to be capable of, or to recently have had, the capability for [[meiosis]] and hence mating.  To cite one example, the common intestinal parasite ''[[Giardia lamblia|Giardia intestinalis]]'' was once considered to be a descendant of a protist lineage that predated the emergence of meiosis and sex.  However, ''G. intestinalis'' was recently found to have a core set of genes that function in meiosis and that are widely present among sexual eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid15668177"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramesh MA, Malik SB, Logsdon JM |title=A phylogenomic inventory of meiotic genes; evidence for sex in Giardia and an early eukaryotic origin of meiosis |journal=Curr.

'''Mesohabitat simulation model (MesoHABSIM)''', created by Dr. [[Piotr Parasiewicz]] addresses the requirements of [[Drainage basin|watershed]]-based management of running waters and is designed to predict an aquatic community's response to [[habitat]] modification.

== Overview ==

'''MesoHABSIM''' builds upon pre-existing physical habitat simulation models (e.g. PHABSIM) which is an essential component of the United States government's methods for establishing minimum [[stream flow]] requirements. 
MesoHABSIM is an augmentation of this system, designed during a restoration study of the [[Quinebaug River]].&lt;ref&gt;Northeast Instream Habitat Program. Northeast Instream Habitat Program – Quinbaug River 10 November. 2008. {{cite web |url=http://neihp.org/projects/quinebaug/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725063409/http://www.neihp.org/projects/quinebaug/index.htm |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The changing spatial distributions of physical attributes of a river as a result of variations in flow and the biological responses of aquatic species to these changes, provide the basis for simulating the consequences of [[ecosystem]] alteration, and consequently the justification of restoration measures. MesoHABSIM modifies the data acquisition technique and analytical approach of similar models by changing the scale of resolution from micro- to meso-scales. Due to this increase in scale, the model takes variations in stream morphology along the river into account and allows for application in larger-scale projects.

== Data collection and analysis ==

Mesohabitat types are defined by their hydromorphological units (HMUs), such as pools and [[rapids]], [[geomorphology]], [[land cover]] and other [[hydrological]] characteristics. Mesohabitats are mapped under multiple flow conditions at extensive sites along the river. Fish data is collected in randomly distributed mesohabitats where habitat surveys are also conducted. This allows modeling of available fish habitat at a range of flows. Rating curves represent the changes in relative area of suitable habitat in response to flow and allow for the determination of habitat quantity at any given flow within the range of surveys. These rating curves can be developed for river units of any size allowing conclusions to be drawn about the suitability of channel patterns or habitat structures for various species of fish for specific sections as well as for the entire river. Rating curves can also be used to evaluate the benefits of various restoration measures on the entire fish community. In combination with hydrologic time series, rating curves are used to create Continuous Under Threshold (CUT) curves for the analysis of frequency, magnitude and duration of significant habitat events. The CUT curve technique described by Capra et al. (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Capra, H., B. Pascal, and Y. Souchon. 1995. A new tool to interpret magnitude and duration of fish habitat variations. Regulated Rivers: Research and Management. 10: 281–289.&lt;/ref&gt;  defines critical thresholds and determines what habitat variability and availability is necessary to support the target river [[fauna]]. CUT curves evaluate durations of unsuitable habitat under a specified threshold by comparing continuous durations in days under this threshold to the cumulative durations in the study period. A highly useful product of the CUT curves are reference tables that can be used to determine how long a given species can tolerate unsuitable conditions depending on its life stage.

== Results ==

To use physical habitat models to analyze and predict ecosystem potential, compositions must also be determined of the native fish community and a subset of species must be selected for model development. The development of a Reference Fish Community (RFC) is based on the Target Fish Community approach, described by Bain and Meixler (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Meixler. 2000. Defining a Target Fish Community for Planning and Evaluating Enhancement on the Quinebaug River in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Report for Quinebaug River Study Agencies. [[Cornell University]], Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive list of species is generated from literature sources and available regional data collected on relatively intact river reaches. The species are ranked on the basis of abundance in long-term fish collection data from multiple rivers of similar character. Securing habitat for naturally occurring [[dominant species (ecology)]] should preserve the most profound characteristics of the ecosystem, providing survival conditions for the majority of the aquatic community and therefore a reference for restoration efforts. The simplest way to create a river habitat model is therefore to select the five to ten highest ranking species for model development. It can then be assumed that community structure reflects habitat structure; therefore, the most common species should indicate the most common habitat. Since habitat availability forms the structure of aquatic fauna, the affinity between the structure of the river habitat and the structure of the fish community can be used as a measure of habitat quality.

The results of MesoHABSIM creates the framework for integrative analysis of many aspects of the ecosystem. It also allows managers to recreate reference conditions and evaluate possible instream and watershed restoration measures or alterations (such as dam removals or changes in water withdrawals). From the perspective of resource managers, it not only allows for quantitative measures of ecological integrity, but also creates a basis for making decisions where trade-offs between resource use and river restoration need to be considered.

'''''Oragenitalism''''' is a book by the American folklorist [[Gershon Legman]], published by the Julian Press in 1969. The book describes various types of [[oral sex]]. 
The book is intended as "instruction manual, conduct guide, and household advice book".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7OeNRe9V1K8C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq= Kick 2006, p. 66a]&lt;/ref&gt;  The author claimed that it was the earliest book of its kind on the subject, and for a long time the only one.&lt;ref name=brottman31&gt;Brottman (2004) p.31&lt;/ref&gt; 
Its contents are divided into four sections: "[[Cunnilingus|Cunnilinctus]]" written under the pen-name Roger-Maxe de la Glannege (an [[anagram]] of his real name) and published by Jacob Brussel of New York in 1940;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Martha Cornog |author2=Timothy Perper | title=Make love, not war: The legacy of Gershon Legman, 1917-1999 | doi=10.1080/00224499909552002 | journal=Journal of Sex Research | volume=36 | issue=3 |date=August 1999 | pages=316–317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slade (2001) p.802&lt;/ref&gt; the three remaining sections "[[Fellatio]]", "[[Irrumatio]]n", and "[[69 (sex position)|Sixty-Nine]]" were not published until 1969.&lt;ref name=brottman31/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20728">'''Pagan studies''' is the multidisciplinary academic field devoted to the study of [[Modern Paganism|contemporary Paganism]], a broad assortment of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]], which are typically influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of premodern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Pagan studies embrace a variety of different scholarly approaches to studying such religions, drawing from history, [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[folkloristics]], [[theology]] and other [[religious studies]].

==Background==
The earliest academic studies of contemporary Paganism were published between 1970 and 1980 by scholars like [[Margot Adler]], [[Marcello Truzzi]] and [[Tanya Luhrmann]], although it would not be until the 1990s that the actual Pagan studies discipline properly developed, pioneered by academics such as Graham Harvey and [[Chas S. Clifton]]. Increasing academic interest in Paganism has been attributed to the new religious movement's increasing public visibility, as it began interacting with the [[interfaith dialogue|interfaith movement]] and holding large public celebrations at sites such as [[Stonehenge]].

The first academic conference on the subject was held at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], North-East England in 1993, followed three years later by a larger conference organised by the [[University of Lancaster]] in North-West England. Annual gatherings of the Conference on Current Pagan Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://paganconference.com/|title=Conference on Current Pagan Studies|website=Conference on Current Pagan Studies|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Contemporary Pagan Studies Unit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://papers.aarweb.org/content/contemporary-pagan-studies-unit|title=Contemporary Pagan Studies Unit {{!}} PAPERS|website=papers.aarweb.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the American Academy of Religion continue to develop scholarship in this field. In 2004, a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] devoted to the discipline, ''[[The Pomegranate (journal)|The Pomegranate]]'', began publication.&lt;ref&gt;

|publisher=www.equinoxjournals.com|accessdate=2008-05-26|last=|first=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Many books on the subject have been published by a variety of different academic publishing companies, while AltaMira Press began publication of the Pagan Studies Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csulb.edu/~wgriffin/paganstudies/|title=Pagan Studies / AltaMira Press|publisher=www.csulb.edu|accessdate=2008-05-26|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Pagan studies scholars and the contemporary Pagan community which it studies has at times been strained, with some practitioners rejecting academic interpretations of their faiths. At the same time, many academics involved in Pagan studies are practicing Pagans themselves, bringing an insider's perspective to their approaches.

Pagan studies scholar [[Chas S. Clifton]] argued that the discipline had developed as a result of the increasing "academic acknowledgement" of contemporary Paganism's "movement into the public eye", referring to the emergence of Pagan involvement with [[interfaith]] groups and the Pagan use of archaeological monuments as "sacred sites", particularly in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 7"/&gt; Clifton also argued that the development of Pagan studies was necessary to "set forth an audacious redefinition of the term "pagan" as [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] has done", something which Clifton felt "gives us room to reexamine from fresh perspectives all manifestation of ancient Pagan religions".&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 7&amp;ndash;8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. pp. 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
The first international academic conference on the subject of Pagan studies was held at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], North-East England in 1993. It had been organised by two British religious studies scholars, [[Graham Harvey (author)|Graham Harvey]] and Charlotte Hardman.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996 a larger conference dealing with contemporary Paganism took place at [[Ambleside]] in the [[Lake District]], organised by the Department of Religious Studies at the [[University of Lancaster]], North-West England. Titled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s", it led to the publication of an academic anthology, ''[[Nature Religion Today|Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World]]''.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson 1998 1"&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In that anthology, some of the conference's organisers described its original intentions, remarking that through it they "sought to explore the innovations in practice and belief which constitute contemporary Paganism, and which appear to be a part of a widespread cultural response to the decay of main-line religions and to a widely felt awareness of ecological crisis."&lt;ref name="Pearson 1998 1"/&gt;

That same year saw the beginnings of ''The Pomegranate'', which would later be transformed into a peer-reviewed academic journal, which first appeared in 2004.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the books AltaMira released was ''Researching Paganisms'', an anthology edited by Jenny Blain, Douglas Ezzy and [[Graham Harvey (author)|Graham Harvey]] in which different Pagan studies scholars discussed their involvement with the subject and the opposition that they have faced.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bla04|Blain, Ezzy and Harvey 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethan Doyle White noted that as Pagan studies reached its twentieth year, it came under "increasing pressure to explain itself, both to academia and to the Pagan community that it studies."{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|p=17}}

==Approaches==
===Sociological===
[[File:Margot-adler-2004.jpg|thumb|right|Margot Adler ''(pictured in 2004)'' published an early sociological study of Paganism in the United States.]]
In 1979, the American sociologist, journalist and Wiccan [[Margot Adler]] published ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon]]'', a sociological study of the Pagan movement across the United States, covering Wiccans, Druids, Goddess Worshipers, Heathens and Radical Faeries.

In 1999, the American sociologist [[Helen A. Berger]] of [[West Chester University]] published ''[[A Community of Witches]]'', a sociological study of the Wiccan and Pagan movement in the north-eastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious studies===
In 2003, the British religious studies scholar [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] published ''[[Pagan Theology|Pagan Theology: Paganism as a World Religion]]'', in which he argued that contemporary Paganism could be seen as a part of a much wider global "paganism" which encompassed a large variety of animistic and polytheistic religious traditions, including [[Indigenous religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ABC-CLIO published an anthology entitled ''[[Modern Paganism in World Cultures]]'', which was edited by the American religious studies scholar Michael F. Strmiska.

===Historical===
Among the first scholars to study contemporary Paganism from a historical perspective was the American Wiccan [[Aidan Kelly]], who had been a founding member of the [[New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the [[Covenant of the Goddess]] during the 1970s. Having attained several academic qualifications, including in the field of religious studies, in the 1970s he began a study of the religious texts of [[Gardnerian Wicca]], in order to establish a historical chronology for the tradition. The results of his study would only be published in 1991, as ''Crafting the Art of Magic''. This would later be rewritten and republished in 2007 as ''Inventing Witchcraft''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kel07|Kelly 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominent English historian [[Ronald Hutton]] of the [[University of Bristol]] later devoted the latter part of his book ''[[The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles]]'' (1991) to an examination of the contemporary Pagan religions that took these pre-Christian religions as a core influence. He followed this with several studies of British folk customs, but in 1999 returned to the field of Pagan studies when he published ''[[The Triumph of the Moon|The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft]]'', the first academic study of [[History of Wicca|Wiccan history]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical debates==
Pagan studies has been charged with failing to properly define "paganism", as some scholars use it solely to designate contemporary Paganism and others &amp;ndash; like Michael York and Chas Clifton &amp;ndash; using it to refer to a wide range of religious movements across the world and throughout history.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|pp=11&amp;ndash;15}} A further problem arises from the fact that while Pagan studies scholars might adopt "paganism" in reference to pre-Christian belief systems in Europe, the term was increasingly rejected by archaeologists specialising in those belief systems.{{sfn|Doyle White|2014|p=11}}

Pagan studies has failed to satisfactorily define "contemporary Paganism"; a minority of scholars have treated it as a singular religion within which groups like Wicca and Heathenry are [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s, while a larger group have instead treated it as a "group of comparative religions".{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|pp=15&amp;ndash;17}} The concern has been made that Pagan studies scholars would be "at a loss to convey (to ourselves and to others), what it is that we are actually studying. The current situation, in which widely differing definitions are being used in tandem, is clearly unsustainable."{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|p=18}}

Religious studies scholar Markus Altena Davidsen published a critique of the field in 2012, via a review of the ''Handbook of Contemporary Paganism''.{{sfn|Davidsen|2012}} Ethan Doyle White in ''The Pomegranate'', arguing that there were flaws in Davidsen's approach.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|p=5}} Arguing that the ''Handbook of Contemporary Paganism'' was not as symptomatic of the field as Davidsen had assumed, he goes on to identify a number of factual errors within Davidsen's paper.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|pp=7&amp;ndash;8}} Doyle White argued that Davidsen's division of scholars into firmly insider and outsider categories was problematic as scholars of Pagan studies like [[Sabina Magliocco]] straddled both boundaries, an approach based in the methodologies employed in anthropology.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|pp=8&amp;ndash;11}}

==Relationship with Pagan community==
The relationship between Pagan studies scholars and some practicing Pagans has at times been strained.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|p=17}} The Australian academic and practicing Pagan Caroline Jane Tully argued that as a result of [[cognitive dissonance]], many Pagans can react negatively to new scholarship regarding historical pre-Christian societies, believing that it is a threat to the structure of their beliefs and "sense of identity." She furthermore argued that some of those dissatisfied Pagans lashed out against academics as a result, particularly on the internet.{{sfn|Tully|2011|pp=98&amp;ndash;99}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7525">'''Preservation of meaning''' in library, archival or museum collections involves understanding spiritual, ritual, or cultural perceptions of value for specific objects, and ensuring these values are maintained and respected.  Meaning is something assigned to objects of cultural or spiritual significance based on interpretations and perceived values by user populations, a process known as social construction of an object (Barker, 77).  When moved to [[memory institution]]s such as libraries or museums, these objects of social construction require unique approaches to preservation and maintenance in order to remain relevant as representations of cultural or spiritual societies.

In many memory institutions of the Western World, including libraries and museums, focus is often placed on the informational content and physical attributes, or artifactual value, of collected materials.  Preservation policies are primarily concerned with the maintenance of these two things, either through reformatting to preserve textual information, or repairs and environmental controls to ensure continued existence of their physical structure (Foot, 19). However, it is necessary to look beyond the physical and informational aspects of objects in order to ensure we are also preserving the integrity of the spiritual or cultural values which may be fundamental in defining the object.   
 
Concerns arise when actions taken to preserve the physical object may compromise the spiritual or cultural integrity of a given object.  Artifacts, including books, throughout history and the present were created and utilized according to rules and taboos that may not be inherently understood in today's world of mass consumer goods and material culture.  While not all books, documents, and artifacts have rituals or socially constructed beliefs associated with their continued existence, it is a relevant issue for many cultural and religious collections.

== Examples ==

An extreme example of how efforts to physically preserve may compromise the socially constructed meaning of the object is the [[Shinto]] Shrines of Ise Jingu, in [[Japan]] (Maré, 2004).  These shrines are of significant cultural and spiritual value to the Japanese people, but every twenty years since the time of Emperor Temmu in the 7th century C.E. the buildings are completely destroyed and rebuilt.  The rebuilding process is based on descriptions in the Documents on the rituals of the Great Shrine of Ise which dates from 804 C.E. and ensures that the recreations are exact replicas of the shrines taken down.  Physical preservation of these monuments would damage the spiritual and cultural integrity of the process and purpose behind the continuous rebuilding.

Similarly, in the [[Buddhist]] faith, materials are considered to have a life, which must be allowed to progress and end naturally.  Impermanence (anitya) in the Buddhist faith relates to the natural end of all things, [[nirvana]], and acts of physical preservation would be contrary to this belief (Karlström). Buddhist [[Conservation of South Asian household shrines|shrines]] are an example of such items that hold spiritual meaning. 

Physical preservation can also work to maintain spiritual and culture integrity of an object, especially in the case of musical instruments.  At the violin museum in [[Cremona, Italy]], nine instruments crafted by the [[Amatis]], [[Guarneris]], and by Antonio [[Stradivari]] are played ceremoniously six days a week – both to keep them in good physical, playable condition, and to maintain their cultural significance and meaning.  From the island of [[Java]] in [[Indonesia]], the instruments of the [[gamelan]] are treated with respect and reverence, and played on a regular basis to maintain their physical and spiritual life.  They are played only for certain occasions and only by certain individuals trained in the art.  They must also be handled and stored with care to be sure no one should compromise their spiritual integrity by stepping over them.  (Kartomi and Mendonça) Gamelan instruments can be found in museums throughout North America, but to accurately remain gamelan instruments, they must be treated and respected according to both their physical and spiritual properties.

However, examples of the significance of meaning and spiritual integrity exist in North America as well.  ''[[Jish]]'' is a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] medicine bundle used in religious rituals related to curing or prevention, and specific care and established provenance is necessary to preserve the existence of ''jish'' versus a simple bundle of herb and grasses.  [[NAGPRA]], or North American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act has helped to highlight this issue of meaning and spiritual integrity in the United States.  The act not only covers objects and remains recovered from American Indian graves, but the subsequent literary material developed based on the examination and analysis of these objects.  (Grose)

Preservation of meaning is perhaps most relevant and recognized in museum collections, but this does not mean there are not key books and documents that are defined by their social construction as well as their physical existence.  When a book printed on acid paper turns to dust, there is no doubt that it ceases to exist as book.  However, when books are stacked on top of a [[Koran]], or a [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is repaired rather than ceremoniously cremated, the spiritual integrity of these texts is compromised or destroyed, and the physical object is void of spiritual or cultural meaning.  It may at this point actually cease to be what it had been previously identified as, at least in terms of its cultural or spiritual meaning.

Admittedly, more work and research needs to be done in regard to  preservation of meaning in the area of Library Science.  However, it is necessary for libraries and archival institutions to assess their preservation priorities in consideration of social and cultural meaning in tandem with physical attributes and informational context.  Preservation and curatorial policies and activities can take into account how materials are housed, handled, repaired, or analyzed not just in terms of preserving physical qualities, but spiritual and cultural meaning as well.

== Environmental aspect ==
Electricity from hydro schemes cuts down the use of [[Wood fuel|wood]] for [[cooking]], [[heating]] and [[light]]ing, consequently reducing [[deforestation]] which is a huge problem in the [[Deforestation by region|region]]. The hydro schemes also cut [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, by virtually eliminating the use of [[kerosene]] [[Kerosene lamp|lighting]], cutting the use of [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[Diesel generator|generators]], and also reducing the use of unsustainable wood. A detailed breakdown has not been made of [[Fossil fuel|fuels]] replaced, but an indication of the significance can be made by assuming that the estimated 110,000 [[Kilowatt hour|MWh]] of electricity generated each year replaces diesel generation producing around 0.8 [[tonne]]s of [[carbon dioxide]] per MWh. This suggests a substantial greenhouse gas saving of around 88,000 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ashden.org/files/case_studies/SRSP%20Pakistan.pdf|title=Winner case study summary: Sarhad Rural Support Programme, Pakistan.|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|publisher=Ashden Award for Increasing Energy Access, supported by the IKEA Foundation Award|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ashden.org/winners/SRSP15|title=The power of water brings new life to mountain villages|last=|first=|date=2015-06-05|work=|newspaper=Ashden Awards, sustainable and renewable energy in the UK and developing world|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webwidemedia.net/rspn/index.php/about-us/awards-recognition|title=Awards &amp; Recognitions {{!}} RSPN|last=|first=|date=|website=Rural Support Programmes Network (RSPN)|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/article/804936/what-the-smart-villages-of-pakistan-can-teach-us-about-energy|title=What the ‘smart villages’ of Pakistan can teach us about energy|last=Cheema|first=Abdur Rehman|date=12 March 2016|newspaper=Scroll.in|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Jean Miélot]], a European author and scribe at work]]
[[File:Scribes with typewriters outside Post Office, Mandi.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern scribes with typewriters outside post office, [[Mandi, Himachal Pradesh]], India, 2010.]]

A '''scribe''' is a person who serves as a professional [[copyist]], especially one who made copies of manuscripts before the invention of [[Printing press|automatic printing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/scribe|title=the definition of scribe|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profession, previously widespread across cultures, lost most of its prominence and status with the advent of the [[Printing press|printing press.]] The work of scribes can involve copying manuscripts and other texts as well as secretarial and administrative duties such as the taking of dictation and keeping of business, judicial, and historical records for [[king]]s, [[nobility|nobles]], [[temple]]s, and [[City|cities]]. The profession has developed into [[Civil service|public servant]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[accountant]]s, [[Audio typist|typist]]s, and [[lawyer]]s. In societies with low literacy rates, street-corner letter-writers (and readers) may still be found providing scribe service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/11/1055220661012.html|title=Women of letters doing write for the illiterate - smh.com.au|website=www.smh.com.au|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Egypt==
[[File:GD-EG-Louxor-126.JPG|thumb|300px|Egyptian scribe with [[papyrus]] scroll]]
One of the most important   professionals in ancient Egypt was a person educated in the arts of writing (both [[hieroglyphics]] and [[hieratic]] scripts, as well as the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] script from the second half of the first millennium BCE, which was mainly used as shorthand and for commerce) and arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rice|first1=Michael|title=Who's Who in Ancient Egypt|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415154482|page=lvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Damerow|first1=Peter|title=Abstraction and Representation: Essays on the Cultural Evolution of Thinking|date=1996|publisher=Kluwer|location=[[Dordrecht]]|isbn=978-0792338161|pages=188–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sons of scribes were brought up in the same scribal tradition, sent to school, and inherited their fathers' positions upon entering the civil service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carr|first1=David M.|title=Writing on the Tablet of the Heart: Origins of Scripture and Literature|date=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0195172973|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of what is known about ancient Egypt is due to the activities of its scribes and the officials. Monumental buildings were erected under their supervision,&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kemp|first1=Barry J. |author-link=Barry J. Kemp |title=Ancient Egypt: Anatomy of a Civilization|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415235495|page=180|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; administrative and economic activities were documented by them, and stories from Egypt's lower classes and foreign lands survive due to scribes putting them in writing.&lt;ref name="Kemp"/&gt;{{rp|296}}

[[File:Ancient Egyptian Scribe's palette HARGM7677.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ancient Egyptian scribe's palette with five depressions for pigments and four styli]]
Scribes were considered part of the royal court, were not [[conscription|conscripted]] into the army, did not have to pay taxes, and were exempt from the heavy manual labor required of the lower classes ([[corvée]] labor). The scribal profession worked with painters and artisans who decorated [[relief]]s and other building works with scenes, personages, or hieroglyphic text. 

&lt;div&gt;The hieroglyph used to [[scribe equipment (hieroglyph)|signify the scribe]], ''to write'' and ''writings'', etc., is [[Gardiner's sign list|Gardiner sign]] Y3, &lt;hiero&gt;Y3&lt;/hiero&gt; from the category of 'writings, &amp; music'. The hieroglyph contains the scribe's ink-mixing palette, a vertical case to hold writing-reeds, and a leather pouch to hold the black and red ink blocks.&lt;/div&gt; The demotic scribes used rush pens which had stems thinner than that of a reed (2 mm). The end of the rush was cut obliquely and then chewed, so that the fibers became separated. The result was a short, stiff brush which was handled in the same manner as that of a calligrapher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Willy |last=Clarysse |title=Egyptian Scribes Writing Greek |journal=Chronique d'Egypte |volume=68 |issue=135–136 |date=1993 |pages=186–201 |doi=10.1484/J.CDE.2.308932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thoth]] was the god credited with the invention of writing by the ancient Egyptians. He was the scribe of the gods who held knowledge of scientific and moral laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Budge|first1=E. A. Wallis|authorlink=E. A.

==Egyptian and Mesopotamian functions==
[[File:Tablet with Cuneiform Writing.jpg|thumb|Cuneiform depiction]][[File:Egyptian - Scribe Statue of Min-nakht - Walters 22230 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumb|upright|right|This early [[New Kingdom]] statue commemorates the scribe Minnakht ("Strength of [[Min (god)|Min]]") and demonstrates how ancient scribes read [[papyri]] – in a seated position on the floor with the text on their lap.&lt;!-- [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].--&gt;]]

In addition to accountancy and governmental politicking, the scribal professions branched out into literature. The first stories were probably creation stories and religious texts. Other genres evolved, such as [[wisdom literature]], which were collections of the philosophical sayings from wise men. These contain the earliest recordings of societal thought and exploration of ideas in some length and detail.

In [[Mesopotamia]] during the middle to late 3rd millennium BCE, the [[Sumer|Sumerians]] originated some of this literature in the form of a series of debates. Among the list of [[Sumerian disputations]] is the ''[[Debate between bird and fish]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.5.3.5&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=j&amp;lineid=t535.p2#t535.p2 |title=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature |website=Etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Sumerian examples include the ''[[Debate between Summer and Winter]]'' where Winter wins, and disputes between the cattle and grain, the tree and the reed, silver and copper, the pickaxe and the plough, and the millstone and the gul-gul stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.5.3 |title=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature |website=Etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Ancient Egyptian version is [[Dispute between a man and his Ba|''The Dispute between a man and his Ba'']], which comes from the Middle Kingdom period.

==Judaism==
As early as the 11th century BCE, scribes in [[Ancient Israel]], were distinguished professionals who would exercise functions which today could be associated with lawyers, journalists, government ministers, judges, or financiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hebrew.htm |title=Hebrew language, alphabet and pronunciation |website=Omniglot.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scribes also copied documents, but this was not necessarily part of their job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metzger|first1=Bruce M.|last2=Coogan|first2=Michael D.|title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780195046458|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Tomb of Ezekiel.jpg|thumb|left|Jewish scribes at the Tomb of Ezekiel in Iraq, ca. 1914]]
The Jewish scribes used the following rules and procedures while creating copies of the Torah and eventually other books in the [[Tanakh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scottmanning.com/content/process-of-copying-the-old-testament-by-jewish-scribes/ |title=Process of copying the Old Testament by Jewish Scribes |last=Manning |first=Scott |date=17 March 2007 |access-date=9 July 2018 |website=Historian on the Warpath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# They could only use clean animal skins, both to write on, and even to bind manuscripts.
# Each column of writing could have no less than forty-eight, and no more than sixty lines.
# The ink must be black, and of a special recipe.
# They must say each word aloud while they were writing.
# They must wipe the pen and wash their entire bodies before writing the most Holy Name of God, [[YHVH]], every time they wrote it.
# There must be a review within thirty days, and if as many as three pages required corrections, the entire manuscript had to be redone.
# The letters, words, and paragraphs had to be counted, and the document became invalid if two letters touched each other. The middle paragraph, word and letter must correspond to those of the original document.
# The documents could be stored only in sacred places (synagogues, etc.).
# As no document containing God's Word could be destroyed, they were stored, or buried, in a [[genizah]].
===Sofer===
{{main|Sofer (scribe)}}
Sofers ({{lang-he|סופר סת”ם}}) are among the few scribes that still ply their trade by hand, writing on [[parchment]]. Renowned [[calligrapher]]s, they produce the [[Hebrew]] [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] and other holy texts.
====Accuracy====
{{further|Dead Sea Scrolls}}

Until 1948, the oldest known manuscripts of the [[Hebrew Bible]] dated back to CE 895. In 1947, a shepherd boy discovered some scrolls dated between 100 BCE and CE 100, inside a cave west of the [[Dead Sea]]. Over the next decade, more scrolls were found in caves and the discoveries became known collectively as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Every book in the [[Hebrew Bible]] was represented except [[Esther]]. Numerous copies of each book were discovered, including 25 copies of the book of [[Deuteronomy]].

While there are other items found among the Dead Sea Scrolls not currently in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and many variations and errors occurred while they were copied down, the texts on the whole testify to the accuracy of the scribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Paul|title=A History of the Jews|date=1993|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|isbn=978-1857990966|page=91|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dead Sea Scrolls are currently the best route of comparison to the accuracy and consistency of translation for the [[Hebrew Bible]] because they are the oldest out of any [[Bible|Biblical text]] currently known.
====Corrections by the scribes and editing biblical literature====
Priests who took over the leadership of the Jewish community preserved and edited biblical literature. Biblical literature became a tool that legitimated and furthered the priests' political and religious authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/origins-written-bible.html |title=Origins of the Written Bible |first=William M. |last=Schniedewind |author-link=William M. Schniedewind |date=18 November 2008 |access-date=9 July 2018 |website=[[PBS Online]] |publisher=Nova}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrections by the scribes ([[Tiqqun soferim|Tikkunei Soferim]]) refers to changes that were made in the original wording of the Hebrew Bible wording during the second temple period, perhaps sometime between 450 and 350 BCE. One of the most prominent men at this time was [[Ezra|Ezra the scribe]]. He also hired scribes to work for him, in order to write down and revise the oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://booksnthoughts.com/ezra-changed-the-torah-text/ |title=Ezra changed the Torah text |first=Israel |last=Drazin |date=26 August 2015 |access-date=9 July 2018 |website=Jewish Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ezra and the scribes had completed the writing, Ezra gathered the Jews who had returned from exile, all of whom belonged to [[Kohen|Kohanim]] families. Ezra read them an unfamiliar version of the Torah. This version was different from the Torah of their fathers. Ezra did not write a new bible. Through the genius of his ‘editing’ he presented the religion in a new light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Okouneff |title=The Wrong Scribe: The Scribe Who Revised the King David Story |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=3XFdjwEACAAJ |publisher=[[CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform]] |date=23 January 2016 |pages=146 |editor-first=John |editor-last=Greenburg |isbn=9781523640430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-who-wrote-the-torah-1.5318582 |title=Who Wrote the Torah? |last=Gilad |first=Elon |date=22 October 2014 |access-date=9 July 2018 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe in the Middle Ages==

===Monastic scribes===
In the [[Middle Ages]] every book was made by hand. Specially trained monks, or scribes, had to carefully cut sheets of parchment, make the ink, write the script, bind the pages, and create a cover to protect the script. This was all accomplished in a monastic writing room called a [[scriptorium]] which was kept very quiet so scribes could maintain concentration.&lt;ref name=" Pavlik, McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlik|first1=John|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shawn|title=Converging Media: A New Introduction to Mass Communication|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780190271510|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large scriptorium may have up to forty scribes working.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Scribes woke to morning bells before dawn and worked until the evening bells, with a lunch break in between. They worked every day except for the [[Sabbath]].&lt;ref name="Lyons"/&gt; The primary purpose of these scribes was to promote the ideas of the Christian Church, so they mostly copied classical and religious works. The scribes were required to copy works in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew whether or not they understood the language.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt;These re-creations were often written in calligraphy and featured rich illustrations, making the process incredibly time consuming. Scribes had to be familiar with the writing technology as well. They had to make sure that the lines were straight and the letters were the same size in each book that they copied. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707023033|title=Books : a living history|last=Martyn.|first=Lyons,|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|isbn=9781606060834|location=Los Angeles|oclc=707023033}}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically took a scribe fifteen months to copy a Bible.&lt;ref name="Lyons"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|pages=36–38, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such books were written on parchment or vellum made from treated hides of sheep, goats, or calves. These hides were often from the monastery's own animals as monasteries were self sufficient in raising animals, growing crops, and brewing beer.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  The overall process was too extensive and costly for books to become widespread during this period.&lt;ref name=" Pavlik, McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlik|first1=John|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shawn|title=Converging Media: A New Introduction to Mass Communication|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780190271510|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although scribes were only able to work in daylight, due to the expense of candles and the rather poor lighting they provided, monastic scribes were still able to produce three to four pages of work per day.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt; The average scribe could copy two books a year.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602397064|page=33–34|ref=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were expected to make at least one mistake per page.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Female Scribes===
Women also played a role as scribes in Anglo-Saxon England, as religious women in convents and schools were literate. Excavations at medieval convents have uncovered [[styli]], indicating that writing and copying were done at those locations.&lt;ref&gt;https://thenewinquiry.com/blog/women-scribes-the-technologists-of-the-middle-ages/&lt;/ref&gt; Also, female pronouns are used in prayers in manuscripts from the late 8th century, suggesting that the manuscripts were originally written by and for female scribes.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2017/03/female-scribes-in-early-manuscripts-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Town scribe==
The scribe was a common job in medieval towns during the 10th and 11th centuries. Many would be employed at scriptoria owned by local schoolmasters or lords. These scribes would be working under deadlines to complete commissioned works such as historic chronicles or poetry. Because parchment was quite costly, the scribe would often create a draft of the work first on a wax or chalk tablet.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart. (2009). ''The Library: An Illustrated History.'' Skyhorse Publishing: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scriptorium''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-scriptorium.ogg|s|k|r|ɪ|p|ˈ|t|ɔːr|i|ə|m}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|scriptorium|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally "a place for writing", is commonly used to refer to a room in medieval European [[monasteries]] devoted to the writing, copying and [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminating]] of manuscripts by monastic [[scribe]]s.

== The functional outset ==
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|left|This late 15th-century miniature of [[Jean Miélot]] (died 1472)&lt;ref&gt;
De Hamel, 1992, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; 
depicts the author at work: perhaps his ''Miracles de Nostre Dame'', in which this miniature appears.]]

When monastic institutions arose in the early 6th century (the first European monastic writing dates from 517), they defined European literary culture and selectively preserved the literary history of the West. Monks copied Jerome's Latin Vulgate Bible and the commentaries and letters of early Church Fathers for missionary purposes as well as for use within the monastery.

In the copying process, there was typically a division of labor between the monks who readied the parchment for copying by smoothing and chalking the surface, those who ruled the parchment and copied the text, and those who illuminated the text. Sometimes a single monk would engage in all of these stages to prepare a manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Shailor, ''The Medieval Book'', (Toronto: U Toronto Press, 1991), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminators of manuscripts]] worked in collaboration with scribes in intricate varieties of interaction that preclude any simple understanding of monastic manuscript production.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Aliza Muslin-Cohen, ''A Medieval Scriptorium: St. maria Magdalena de Frankenthal'' series Wolfenbüttler Mittelalter Studien (Wiesbaden) 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The products of the monasteries provided a valuable medium of exchange.
Comparisons of characteristic regional, periodic as well as contextual styles of [[handwriting]] do reveal social and cultural connections among them, as new hands developed and were disseminated by travelling individuals, respectively what these individuals represented, and by the examples of manuscripts that passed from one cloister to another. 
Recent studies follow the approach, that ''scriptoria'' developed in relative isolation, to the extent that the [[Paleography|paleographer]] is sometimes able to identify the product of each writing centre and to date it accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;
McKitterick, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

By the start of the 13th century secular workshops developed,&lt;ref&gt;
De Hamel, 1992, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; 
where professional scribes stood at writing-desks to work the orders of customers, and during the [[Late Middle Ages]] the praxis of writing was becoming not only confined to being generally a monastic or regal activity. However, the practical consequences of private workshops, and as well the invention of the [[printing press]] vis-a-vis monastic ''scriptoria'' is a complex theme.&lt;ref&gt;
for example, cf. De Hamel, 1992, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==The physical scriptorium==

Much as medieval libraries do not correspond to the exalted sketches from [[Umberto Eco]]'s "Name of the Rose,”&lt;ref&gt;
[https://medievalfragments.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/library-or-labyrinth/ "Library or labyrinth" Irene O’Daly. January 11, 2013 (medievalfragments.wordpress.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
it seems that ancient written accounts, as well as surviving buildings, and archaeological excavations do not invariably attest to the evidence of scriptoria.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://medievalfragments.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/pondering-the-physical-scriptorium/ "Pondering the physical scriptorium" Jenneka Janzen. January 25, 2013 by medievalfragments (medievalfragments.wordpress.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Scriptoria in the physical sense of a room set aside for the purpose perhaps mostly existed in response to specific scribal projects; for example, when a monastic (and) or regal institution wished a large number of texts copied.

References in modern scholarly writings to 'scriptoria' typically refer to the collective written output of a monastery, 
somewhat like the [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] in the early regal times is taken to refer to a specific fashion of modelling formulars, 
but especially traditional is the view that scriptoria was a necessary adjunct to a library, as per the entry in du Cange, 1678 'scriptorium'.&lt;ref&gt;
Du Cange, et al., ''Glossarium mediae et infimae Latinitatis'', Niort: L. Favre, 1883–1887 (10 vol.).

&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Giovanni Evangelista, Rimini===
At this church whose patron was [[Galla Placidia]] (died 450), paired rectangular chambers flanking the apse, accessible only from each aisle, have been interpreted as paired (Latin and Greek) libraries and perhaps scriptoria.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Charlotte Smith, "The Side Chambers of San Giovanni Evangelista in Ravenna: Church Libraries of the Fifth Century" ''Gesta,'' '''29'''.1 (1990): 86–97)&lt;/ref&gt; The well-lit niches .5 meter deep, provisions for [[hypocaust]]s beneath the floors to keep the spaces dry, have prototypes in the architecture of Roman libraries.&lt;ref&gt;E. Mackowiecka, ''The Origin and the Evolution of the Architectural Forms of the Roman Library'' (Warsaw) 1978, noted by Smith 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassiodorus and the Vivarium===
The monastery built in the second quarter of the 6th century under the supervision of [[Cassiodorus]] at the Vivarium near [[Squillace]] in southern Italy contained a scriptorium, for the purpose of collecting, copying, and preserving texts.

Cassiodorus' description of his monastery contained a purpose-built scriptorium, with self-feeding{{clarify|date=February 2016}} oil lamps, a [[sundial]], and a [[water-clock]]. The scriptorium would also have contained desks where the monks could sit and copy texts, as well as the necessary ink wells, penknives, and quills. Cassiodorus also established a library where, at the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|end of the Roman Empire]], he attempted to bring Greek learning to Latin readers and to preserve texts both sacred and secular for future generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus collected as many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his monks in the proper uses of texts. In the end, however, the library at the Vivarium was dispersed and lost, though it was still active around 630.&lt;ref name=JNormanVivarium&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norman|first1=Jeremy|title=The Scriptorium and Library at the Vivarium (Circa 560)|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=204|website=HistoryofInformation.com|publisher=Jeremy Norman &amp; Co., Inc.|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
The scriptoria of the [[Cistercian]] order seem to have been similar to those of the Benedictines. The mother house at [[Cîteaux]], one of the best-documented high-medieval scriptoria, developed a severe "house style" in the first half of the 12th century. 
The 12th-century scriptorium of [[Cîteaux]] and its products, in the context of Cistercian scriptoria, have been studied by Yolanta Załuska, ''L'enluminure et le scriptorium de Cîteaux au XIIe siècle'' (Brecht:Cîteaux) 1989.

== Institutions ==
In [[Byzantium]] or [[Eastern Roman Empire]] learning maintained importance and numerous monastic 'scriptoria' were known for producing Bible/Gospel illuminations, along with workshops that copied numerous classical and Hellenistic works.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707023033|title=Books : a living history|last=Martyn|first=Lyons,|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|isbn=9781606060834|location=Los Angeles|oclc=707023033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records show that one such monastic community was that of [[Mount Athos]], which maintained a variety of illuminated manuscripts and ultimately accumulated over 10,000 books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Benedictines===
Cassiodorus' contemporary, [[Benedict of Nursia]], allowed his monks to read the great works of the pagans in the monastery he founded at [[Monte Cassino]] in 529. The creation of a library here initiated the tradition of Benedictine scriptoria, where the copying of texts not only provided materials needed in the routines of the community and served as work for hands and minds otherwise idle, but also produced a marketable end-product. Saint [[Jerome]] stated that the products of the scriptorium could be a source of revenue for the monastic community, but Benedict cautioned, "If there be skilled workmen in the monastery, let them work at their art in all humility".&lt;ref&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 57, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch57 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest Benedictine monasteries, the writing room was actually a corridor open to the central quadrangle of the [[cloister]].&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Landelin Robling OSB, ''Monastic Scriptoria'', [http://www.osb.org/gen/robling/03script.html#location OSB.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The space could accommodate about twelve monks, who were protected from the elements only by the wall behind them and the vaulting above. Monasteries built later in the Middle Ages placed the scriptorium inside, near the heat of the kitchen or next to the [[calefactory]]. The warmth of the later scriptoria served as an incentive for unwilling monks to work on the transcription of texts (since the charter house was rarely heated).

====St. Gall====
The Benedictine [[Plan of St. Gall]] is a sketch of an idealised monastery dating from 819–826, which shows the scriptorium and library attached to the northeast corner of the main body of the church; this is not reflected by the evidence of surviving monasteries. Although the purpose of the plan is unknown, it clearly shows the desirability of scriptoria within a wider body of monastic structures at the beginning of the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Murray, ''After Rome's Fall,'' (Toronto: University Toronto Press, 1998), pp. 262, 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
There is evidence that in the late 13th century, the Cistercians would allow certain monks to perform their writing in a small cell "which could not... contain more than one person".&lt;ref&gt;George Haven Putnam, ''Books and their Makers During the Middle Ages'', (New York: Hillary House, 1962), 405.&lt;/ref&gt; These cells were called scriptoria because of the copying done there, even though their primary function was not as a writing room.

===Carthusians===
The [[Carthusian]]s viewed copying religious texts as their missionary work to the greater [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]; the strict solitude of the Carthusian order necessitated that the manual labor of the monks be practiced within their individual cells, thus many monks engaged in the transcription of texts. In fact, each cell was equipped as a copy room, with parchment, quill, inkwell, and ruler. Guigues du Pin, or Guigo, the architect of the order, cautioned, "Let the brethren take care the books they receive from the cupboard do not get soiled with smoke or dirt; books are as it were the everlasting food of our souls; we wish them to be most carefully kept and most zealously made."&lt;ref&gt;C.H.Lawrence, ''Medieval Monasticism'', Ed.2 (London &amp; New York: Longman, 1989) 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Orthodox church===

====The Resava====

After the establishment of [[Manasija]] Monastery by [[Stefan Lazarević]] in the early 15th century, many educated monks have gathered there. They fostered copying and literary work that by its excellence and production changed the history of the South Slavic literature and languages spreading its influence all over the Orthodox [[Balkans]]. One of the most famous scholars of the so-called School of Resava was Constantine the Philosopher /Konstantin Filozof/, an influential writer and biographer of the founder of the school (Stefan Lazarević).

====Rača====
During the Turkish invasions of the Serbian lands (which lasted from the end of the 14th to the beginning of the 19th centuries) the monastery was an important centre of culture. The scriptorium of each monastery was a bastion of learning where illuminated manuscripts were being produced by monk-scribes, mostly Serbian liturgical books and Old Serbian ''Vita.'' [[hagiographies]] of kings and archbishops.

Numerous scribes of the Serbian Orthodox Church books—at the term of the 16th and the beginning of the 18th centuries—who worked in the [[Rača monastery]] are named in Serbian literature – "The Račans". . Among the monk-scribes the most renown are the illuminator Hieromonk Hristifor Račanin, [[Kiprijan Račanin]], [[Jerotej Račanin]], [[Teodor Račanin]] and [[Gavril Stefanović Venclović]]. These are well-known Serbian monks and writers that are the link between literary men and women of the late medieval ([[Late Middle Ages]]) and [[Baroque]] periods in art, architecture and literature in particular.

==Monastic rules==
[[File:Meister des Codex Amiatus 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ezra]] in the [[Codex Amiatinus]], believed to be based on a portrait of [[Cassiodorus]] in his library. [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey]], before 716]]

===Cassiodorus' ''Institutes''===
Although it is not a monastic rule as such, [[Cassiodorus]] did write his ''[[Institutes]]'' as a teaching guide for the monks at Vivarium, the monastery he founded on his family's land in southern Italy. A classically educated Roman convert, Cassiodorus wrote extensively on scribal practices. He cautions over-zealous scribes to check their copies against ancient, trustworthy [[exemplar (manuscript)|exemplars]] and to take care not to change the inspired words of scripture because of grammatical or stylistic concerns. He declared "every work of the Lord written by the scribe is a wound inflicted on Satan", for "by reading the Divine Scripture he wholesomely instructs his own mind and by copying the precepts of the Lord he spreads them far and wide".&lt;ref&gt;Cassiodorus, Institutes, I, xxx&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that Cassiodorus did include the classical texts of ancient Rome and Greece in the monastic library. This was probably because of his upbringing, but was, nonetheless, unusual for a monastery of the time. When his monks copied these texts, Cassiodorus encouraged them to amend texts for both grammar and style.&lt;ref&gt;James O. O'Donnell, ''Cassiodorus,'' University of Californian Press, 1979. Postprint online (1995), [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap6.html Upenn.edu], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint Benedict===
The more famous monastic treatise of the 7th century, Saint [[Benedict of Nursia]]'s [[Rule of St Benedict|Rule]], fails to mention the labor of transcription by name, though his institution, the monastery of [[Montecassino]], developed one of the most influential scriptoria, at its acme in the 11th century, which made the abbey "the greatest center of book production in South Italy in the High Middle Ages".&lt;ref&gt;Newton 1999:3; the scriptorium is fully examined in Francis Newton, ''The Scriptorium and Library at Monte Cassino, 1058–1105'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Here was developed and perfected the characteristic "Cassinese" [[Beneventan script]] under [[Desiderius of Montecassino|Abbot Desiderius]].

The [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] does explicitly call for monks to have ready access to books during two hours of compulsory daily reading and during [[Lent]], when each monk is to read a book in its entirety.&lt;ref name="accessed 2 May 2007"&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 48, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch48 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus each monastery was to have its own extensive collection of books, to be housed either in [[armarium]] (book chests) or a more traditional library. However, because the only way to obtain a large quantity of books in the [[Middle Ages]] was to copy them, in practice this meant that the monastery had to have a way to transcribe texts in other collections.&lt;ref&gt;Geo. Haven Putnam, ''Books and Their Makers During the Middle Ages'', (New York: Hillary House, 1962), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative translation of Benedict's strict guidelines for the oratory as a place for silent, reverent prayer actually hints at the existence of a scriptorium. In Chapter 52 of his Rule, Benedict's warns: "Let the oratory be what it is called, and let nothing else be done or stored there".&lt;ref&gt;''Rule of Saint Benedict'', Chapter 52, [http://www.kansasmonks.org/RuleOfStBenedict.html#ch52 Kansasmonks.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; But ''condatur'' translates both as ''stored'' and ''to compose or write,'' thus leaving the question of Benedict's intentions for manuscript production ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Landelin Robling OSB, ''Monastic Scriptoria'', [http://www.osb.org/gen/robling/07script.html#rules OSB.org], accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest commentaries on the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] describe the labor of transcription as the common occupation of the community, so it is also possible that Benedict failed to mention the scriptorium by name because of the integral role it played within the monastery.

====Saint Ferréol====
Monastic life in the [[Middle Ages]] was strictly centered around [[Liturgy of the Hours|prayer]] and manual labor. In the early Middle Ages, there were many attempts to set out an organization and routine for monastic life. [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert|Montalembert]] cites one such sixth-century document, the Rule of [[Ferréol of Uzès|Saint Ferréol]], as prescribing that "He who does not turn up the earth with the plough ought to write the parchment with his fingers."&lt;ref&gt;Montalembert, ''The Monks of the West from St. Benedict to St. Bernard'', vol. 6, (Edinburgh, 1861–1879) p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; As this implies, the labor required of a [[scribe]] was comparable to the exertion of agriculture and other outdoor work. Another of Montalembert's examples is of a scribal note along these lines: "He who does not know how to write imagines it to be no labour, but although these fingers only hold the pen, the whole body grows weary."&lt;ref&gt;Montalembert, ''The Monks of the West from St. Benedict to St. Bernard'', vol. 6, (Edinburgh, 1861–1879) p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cistercians===
An undated Cistercian ordinance, ranging in date from 1119–52 (Załuska 1989) prescribed ''literae unius coloris et non depictae'' ("letters of one color and not ornamented"), that spread with varying degrees of literalness in parallel with the Cistercian order itself, through the priories of Burgundy and beyond.

In 1134, the Cistercian order declared that the monks were to keep silent in the scriptorium as they should in the [[cloister]].

==Books and transcription in monastic life==

Manuscript-writing was a laborious process in an ill-lit environment that could damage one's health. One prior complained in the tenth century:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"''Only try to do it yourself and you will learn how arduous is the writer's task. It dims your eyes, makes your back ache, and knits your chest and belly together. It is a terrible ordeal for the whole body''".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in: Greer, Germaine. ''The Obstacle Race: The Fortunes of Women Painters and Their Work''. Tauris Parke, 2001. p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The director of a monastic scriptorium would be the ''armarius'' ("provisioner"), who provided the scribes with their materials and supervised the copying process. However, the armarius had other duties as well. At the beginning of Lent, the armarius was responsible for making sure that all of the monks received books to read,&lt;ref name="accessed 2 May 2007"/&gt; but he also had the ability to deny access to a particular book. By the 10th century the armarius had specific liturgical duties as well, including singing the eighth [[responsory]], holding the lantern aloft when the abbot read, and approving all material to be read aloud in church, chapter, and [[refectory]].&lt;ref&gt;Fassler, Margot E., "The Office of the Cantor in Early Western Monastic Rules and Customaries," in ''Early Music History'', 5 (1985), pp. 35, 40, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Vivarium c. 540–548, '''Cassiodorus''' wrote a commentary on the Psalms entitled ''Expositio Psalmorum'' as an introduction to the Psalms for individuals seeking to enter the monastic community. The work had a broad appeal outside of Cassiodorus' monastery as the subject of monastic study and reflection.

Abbot '''[[Johannes Trithemius]]''' of Sponheim wrote a letter, ''De Laude Scriptorum'' (In Praise of Scribes), to Gerlach, Abbot of Deutz in 1492 to describe for monks the merits of copying texts. Trithemius contends that the copying of texts is central to the model of monastic education, arguing that transcription enables the monk to more deeply contemplate and come to a more full understanding of the text. He then continues to praise scribes by saying "The dedicated scribe, the object of our treatise, will never fail to praise God, give pleasure to angels, strengthen the just, convert sinners, commend the humble, confirm the good, confound the proud and rebuke the stubborn".&lt;ref name="Johannes Trithemius 1974 p.35"&gt;Johannes Trithemius, ''In Praise of Scribes (de Laude Scriptorum)'', Klaus Arnold, ed. (Lawrence, Kansas: Colorado Press, 1974), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons he gives for continuing to copy manuscripts by hand, are the historical precedent of the ancient scribes and the supremacy of transcription to all other manual labor. This description of monastic writing is especially important because it was written after the first printing presses came into popular use. Trithemius addresses the competing technology when he writes, "The printed book is made of paper and, like paper, will quickly disappear. But the scribe working with parchment ensures lasting remembrance for himself and for his text".&lt;ref name="Johannes Trithemius 1974 p.35"/&gt; Trithemius also believes that there are works that are not being printed but are worth being copied.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Trithemius, ''In Praise of Scribes (de Laude Scriptorum)'', Klaus Arnold, ed. (Lawrence, Kansas: Colorado Press, 1974), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manuscript-Alexander-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|[[John White Alexander]], Manuscript Book mural (1896), Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]

In his comparison of modern and medieval scholarship, '''James J. O'Donnell''' describes monastic study in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"''[E]ach Psalm would have to be recited at least once a week all through the period of study. In turn, each Psalm studied separately would have to be read slowly and prayerfully, then gone through with the text in one hand (or preferably committed to memory) and the commentary in the other; the process of study would have to continue until virtually everything in the commentary has been absorbed by the student and mnemonically keyed to the individual verses of scripture, so that when the verses are recited again the whole phalanx of Cassiodorian erudition springs up in support of the content of the sacred text''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James O. |last=O'Donnell |title=Cassiodorus |publisher=University of California Press |year=1979 |url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap5.html |accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this way, the monks of the Middle Ages came to intimately know and experience the texts that they copied. The act of transcription became an act of meditation and prayer, not a simple replication of letters.

==Soviet Avant-Garde art==

During the [[Bolshevik Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] a movement was initiated to put all arts to service of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The instrument for this was created just days before the [[October Revolution]], known as [[Proletkult]], an abbreviation for "Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was [[Aleksandr Bogdanov]]. Initially [[Narkompros]] (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. However the latter sought too much independence from the ruling [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] of [[Bolsheviks]], gained negative attitude of [[Vladimir Lenin]], by 1922 declined considerably, and was eventually disbanded in 1932.
The ideas of Proletkult attracted the interests of [[Russian avantgarde]], who strived to  get rid of the conventions of "bourgeois art". Among notable persons of this movement was [[Kazimir Malevich]]. However the ideas of the avantgarde eventually clashed with the newly emerged state-sponsored direction of [[Socialist Realism]].

In search of new forms of expression, the Proletkult organisation was highly eclectic in its art forms, and thus was prone to harsh criticism for inclusion of such modern directions as [[impressionism]] and [[cubism]], since these movements existed before the revolution and hence were associated with "decadent bourgeois art".

Among early experiments of Proletkult was [[pragmaic aesthetic|pragmatic aesthetic]] of [[industrial art]], the prominent theoretist being [[Boris Arvatov]].

Another group was [[UNOVIS]], a very short-lived but influential collection of young artists led by [[Kasimir Malevich]] in the 1920s.

==Socialist realism==
{{Main|Socialist realism}}

Officially approved art was required to follow the doctrine of [[Socialist Realism]]. In the spring of 1932, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decreed that all existing literary and artistic groups and organizations should be disbanded and replaced with unified associations of creative professions. Accordingly, the Moscow and Leningrad Union of Artists was established on August 1932, which brought the history of post-revolutionary art to a close. The epoch of Soviet art began.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov. ''Unknown Socialist Realism: The Leningrad School'', pp. 28–29. {{ISBN|5-901724-21-6}}, {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known Soviet artists were [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Aleksandr Deyneka]], [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Aleksandr Laktionov]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]] and other painters from Moscow and Leningrad School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradartist.com/outline.htm ''Segei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow artist [[Aleksandr Gerasimov (painter)|Aleksandr Gerasimov]] during his career produced a large number of heroic paintings of [[Joseph Stalin]] and other members of the [[Politburo]]. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] later alleged that [[Kliment Voroshilov]] spent more time posing in Gerasimov's studio than he did attending to his duties in the People's Commissariat of Defense. Gerasimov's painting shows a mastery of classical representational techniques.

However, art exhibitions of 1935–1960 disprove the claims that artistic life of the period was suppressed by the ideology and artists submitted entirely to what was then called ‘social order’. A great number of landscapes, portraits, genre paintings and studies exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus free from any ideology. Thematic painting was also approached in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;Vern G. Swanson, ''Soviet Impressionist Painting.'' Woodbridge, England: Antique Collectors' Club, 2008; p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period between the mid-1950s and 1960s, the [[:ru:Ленинградская школа живописи|Leningrad school]] was approaching its apex. Artists who had graduated from the Academy ([[Repin Institute of Arts]]) in the 1930s–50s were in their prime. They were quick to present their art, they strived for experiments and were eager to appropriate a lot and to learn even more. Their time and contemporaries, with all its images, ideas and dispositions found it full expression in portraits by [[:ru:Русов, Лев Александрович|Lev Russov]], [[:ru:Орешников, Виктор Михайлович|Victor Oreshnikov]], Boris Korneev, Semion Rotnitsky, Vladimir Gorb, Engels Kozlov, landscapes by [[:ru:Тимков, Николай Ефимович|Nikolai Timkov]], [[:ru:Овчинников, Владимир Иванович|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]], [[:ru:Осипов, Сергей Иванович|Sergei Osipov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Александр Михайлович|Alexander Semionov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Арсений Никифорович|Arseny Semionov]], Nikolai Galakhov, genre paintings by [[:ru:Позднеев, Николай Матвеевич|Nikolai Pozdneev]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]], Yevsey Moiseenko, Andrey Milnikov. Art of this period showed extraordinary taste for life and creative work.

In 1957, the first all-Russian Congress of Soviet artists took place in Moscow. In 1960, the all-Russian Union of Artists was organized. Accordingly, these events influenced the art life in Moscow, Leningrad and province. The scope of experimentation was broadened; in particular, this concerned the form and painterly and plastic language. Images of youths and students, rapidly changing villages and cities, virgin lands brought under cultivation, grandiose construction plans being realized in Siberia and the Volga region, great achievements of Soviet science and technology became the chief topics of the new painting. Heroes of the time – young scientists, workers, civil engineers, physicians – become the most popular heroes of paintings.

At this period, life provided artists with plenty of thrilling topics, positive figures and images. Legacy of many great artists and [[art movements]] became available for study and public discussions again. This greatly broadened artists’ understanding of the [[realist art|realist method]] and widened its possibilities. It was the repeated renewal of the very conception of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] that made this style dominates in the [[Russian art]] throughout its history. Realist tradition gave rise to many trends of [[Contemporary art|contemporary painting]], including painting from nature, "severe style" painting and decorative art. However, during this period [[impressionism]], [[postimpressionism]], [[cubism]] and [[expressionism]] also had their fervent adherents and interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradschool.com/outline.htm ''Sergei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Nonconformist Art==
{{Main|Soviet Nonconformist Art}}

The death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]], paved the way for a wave of liberalization in the arts throughout the [[Soviet Union]].  Although no official change in policy took place, artists began to feel free to experiment in their work, with considerably less fear of repercussions than during the Stalinist period.

In the 1950s Moscow artist [[Ely Bielutin]] encouraged his students to experiment with [[abstractionism]], a practice thoroughly discouraged by the [[Creative unions in the Soviet Union|Artists' Union]], which strictly enforced the official policy of [[Socialist Realism]].  Artists who chose to paint in alternative styles had to do so completely in private and were never able to exhibit or sell their work. As a result, [[Nonconformist Art]] developed along a separate path than the [[Official Art]] that was recorded in the history books.

[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine published two portraits by two painters, who to their mind, were most representative of Russian Arts of the period: it was Serov, an official Soviet icon and [[Anatoly Zverev]], an underground [[Russian avant-garde]] expressionist.  Serov's portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and Zverev's selfportrait were associated by many with an eternal Biblical struggle of Satan and Saviour.  When Khrushchev learned about the publication he was outraged and forbade all contacts with Western visitors, closed down all semi legal exhibitions.  And of course Zverev was the main target of his outrage.

The [[Soviet Nonconformist Art#Lianozovo|Lianozovo Group]] was formed around the artist [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]] in the 1960s and included artists such as [[Valentina Kropivnitskaya]], [[Vladimir Nemukhin]], and [[Lydia Masterkova]].  While not adhering to any common style, these artists sought to faithfully express themselves in the mode they deemed appropriate, rather than adhere to the propagandistic style of [[Socialist Realism]].

Tolerance of Nonconformist Art by the authorities underwent an ebb and flow until the ultimate collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991.  Artists took advantage of the first few years after the death of Stalin to experiment in their work without the fear of persecution.  In 1962, artists experienced a slight setback when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] appeared at the exhibition of the 30th anniversary of the Moscow Artist's Union at the [[Moscow Manege]] exhibition hall, an episode known as the [[Manege Affair]].  Among the customary works of [[Socialist Realism]] were a few abstract works by artists such as [[Ernst Neizvestny]] and [[Eli Beliutin]], which Khrushchev criticized as being "shit," and the artists for being "homosexuals."  The message was clear: artistic policy was not as liberal as everyone had hoped.

The history of late Soviet art has been dominated by politics and simplistic formulae. Both within the artworld and the general public, very little consideration has been given to the aesthetic character of the work produced in the USSR in the 1970s and 1980s. Instead, the official and unofficial art of the period usually stood in for either "bad" or "good" political developments.  A more nuanced picture would emphasize that there were numerous competing groups making art in Moscow and Leningrad throughout this period. The most important figures for the international art scene have been the Moscow artists Ilya Kabakov, Erik Bulatov, Andrei Monastyrsky, Vitaly Komar and Aleksandr Melamid.

The most infamous incident regarding nonconformist artists in the former Soviet Union was the 1974 [[Bulldozer Exhibition]], which took place in a park just outside Moscow, and included work by such artists as [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]], [[Komar and Melamid]], [[Alexandr Zhdanov]], [[Nikolai Smoliakov]] and [[Leonid Sokov]].  The artists involved had written to the authorities for permission to hold the exhibition but received no answer to their request.  They decided to go ahead with the exhibition anyway, which consisted solely of unofficial works of art that did not fit into the rubric of [[Socialist Realism]].  The [[KGB]] put an end to the exhibition just hours after it opened by bringing in bulldozers to completely destroy all of the artworks present.  However, the foreign press had been there to witness the event, and the worldwide coverage of it forced the authorities to permit an exhibition of Nonconformist Art two weeks later in [[Izmailovsky Park]] in Moscow.

A few West European collectors, supported during the 60th and the 70th and until 1988 (the year of the Perestroika) many of the artists in the old Soviet Union. One of the leading collectors and philanthropists were the couple Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera. The Bar-Gera Collection consists of some 200 works of 59 Soviet Russian artists of who did not want to embrace the official art directive of the post-Stalinist Soviet Union. Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera, both are survivors of the holocaust, supported these partially persecuted artists by sending them money or painting material from Germany to the Soviet Union. Even though the Kenda and Jacob did not meet the artists in person, they bought many of their paintings and other art objects. The works were smuggled to Germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats, traveling businessmen, and students, thus making the Bar-Gera Collection of Russian Non-Conformists among the largest of its kind in the world. Among others, the collection content works of Bachtschanjan Vagritsch, Jankilevskij Wladimir,Rabin  Oskar, Batschurin Ewganij, Kabakov Ilja, Schablavin Sergei, Belenok Piotr, Krasnopevcev Dimitrij, Schdanov Alexander, [[Igor Novikov (painter)|Igor Novikov]],
Bitt Galina, Kropivnitzkaja Walentina, Schemjakin Michail, Bobrowskaja Olga, Kropivnitzkij Lew,Schwarzman  Michail, Borisov  Leonid, Kropiwnizkij Jewgenij, Sidur  Vadim, Bruskin Grischa, Kulakov  Michail, Sitnikov  Wasili, and many others.

By the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] made it virtually impossible for the authorities to place restrictions on artists or their freedom of expression.  With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], the new market economy enabled the development of a gallery system, which meant that artists no longer had to be employed by the state, and could create work according to their own tastes, as well as the tastes of their private patrons.  Consequently, after around 1986 the phenomenon of Nonconformist Art in the Soviet Union ceased to exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7944">The concept of the '''spatial icon''', introduced by [[Aleksey Lidov|Alexei Lidov]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hodegetria of Constantinople" in the encyclopedia ''Miraculous icons in the Eastern Christian culture'', Moscow, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; plays a central role in [[hierotopy]] and is used to describe the perception of sacred spaces. Spatial icons are image-visions, that are evoked, for example, in the space of a [[temple]] or [[sanctuary]]. The spatial icon encompasses a broad range of components involved in the formation and definition of sacred spaces.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Spatial Icons. The Miraculous Performance with the Hodegetria of Constantinople" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of  Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Progress-tradition, 2006, pp. 325-372.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a consciously created spatial image that transcends the material objects involved in its formation. A variety of plastic elements, including everything from buildings to decoration, and from [[mural]]s to [[liturgy|liturgical]] artifacts, work together to form a spatial icon. Sacred [[relic]]s and iconic images often play an integral role in the creation of a comprehensive spatial image.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bogdanovich.

Lidov. [http://hierotopy.ru/contents/NewJerusalems_01_Lidov_Introduction_2009_RusEng.pdf "New Jerusalems.

Lidov. "The Creator of Sacred Space as a Phenomenon of Byzantine Culture" in ''L’artista a Bisanzio e nel mondo cristiano-orientale'', ed. Michele Bacci, Pisa, 2003, pp.135-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performativity, as well as various dynamic elements, is a significant feature of spatial icons.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Byzantine World and Performative Spaces" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011. pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a statue or building, they are constantly in motion, changing with the movement and activity of ritual and celebration, as well as with the alteration of light, odor and the movements of those participating and inhabiting them.

Flier. "The Image of the Tsar in the Muscovite Palm Sunday Ritual" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 533-562.&lt;/ref&gt; are classical examples of iconic performativity in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Christian]] tradition. In both cases, the city itself was temporarily transformed into the matrix of a spatial icon; the participants involved in these rituals were thus veritable co-creators of the sacred space along with the artists, priests and celebrants responsible for leading it. Another example of this performative element at work in spatial icons can be found in the ritual creation and destruction of the [[sand mandala]] in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition.

'''The Spoils of War (symposium)'''
[[File:Looted_Art_-_German_loot_stored_at_Schlosskirche_Ellingen_-_Ellingen_(Bavaria_-_Germany).jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|German repository of looted possessions in a church at Ellingen, Bavaria, May 1945.]]
"The Spoils of War—World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property" was a ground-breaking international [[symposium]] held in New York City in 1995 to discuss the artworks, cultural property, and historic sites damaged, lost, and [[Nazi plunder|plundered as a result of World War II]]. The three-day event was sponsored by the [[Bard Graduate Center]] for Studies in the Decorative Arts to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;January 19–21, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was organized by [[Elizabeth Simpson (archaeologist)|Elizabeth Simpson]], an archaeologist and professor at the Bard Graduate Center.

Worldwide interest in the subject was generated by announcements in 1991 of the location of objects confiscated by Soviet Trophy Brigades from German territory at the end of the war. The unification of Germany in 1990 and dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 were followed by a number of goodwill agreements between Germany and the countries of the former USSR, as well as the opening of official negotiations on repatriation. It was this spirit of openness and cooperation that made the New York symposium possible. This initial gathering of concerned parties would be followed by a series of conferences, initiatives, agreements, and repatriations that continue into the present.

==New York conference and proceedings==
[[File:Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton inspect looted art HD-SN-99-02758.JPEG|thumb|Generals Bradley, Patton, and Eisenhower examining works of art stored by the Nazis in the Merkers mine, Germany, April 1945.]]The program featured 48 notable speakers—government officials, diplomats, journalists, art historians, archaeologists, lawyers, and independent researchers—from Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Australia, England, and the United States. The combined testimony laid bare another horrifying dimension to the anguish of human suffering wrought by the [[World War II|Second World War]].

The symposium was the first to address the issue in a public forum, and led to numerous initiatives on provenance research by the governments involved as well as museums, libraries, and art dealers internationally. As a result, the art world was changed irrevocably. Acquisitions policies were revised and organizations restructured to facilitate the identification of artistic and cultural objects that had been stolen or transferred illegally during and after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aamd.org/standards-and-practices |title=Standards &amp; Practices &amp;#124; Association of Art Museum Directors |website=Aamd.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processes were established to allow families to claim their missing property; such claims have resulted in many works being restored to the heirs and descendants of the rightful owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lootedart.com/home |title=Welcome to |publisher=Lootedart.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Spoils of War cover.jpg|thumb|left|''The Spoils of War'' (1997), showing paintings stolen from the Russian palaces at Petrodvorets and Pushkin, abandoned in March 1945 in East Prussia by German soldiers fleeing the Red Army.]]

The conference proceedings were published in an award-winning volume edited by Elizabeth Simpson (Harry N. Abrams, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Elizabeth. ''The Spoils of War--World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property''. New York: [[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]] in association with the Bard Graduate Center, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes 17 treaties, conventions, and other official documents relating to the protection and return of cultural property. These begin with the "[[Lieber Code]]" of 1863 and the "[[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]]," and continue with the treaties following World War I, the "[[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention and Protocol of 1954]]" for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|1970 UNESCO Convention]]" on the prevention of illicit import, export, and transfer of ownership of cultural property,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects]] of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/instruments/cultural-property/1995-convention |title=Cultural Property - 1995 Convention - Unidroit - International Institute for the Unification of Private Law - Institut International pour l'Unification du droit privè |publisher=Unidroit |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Losses resulting from World War II==
Elizabeth Simpson and lawyer Jeanette Greenfield, author of ''The Return of Cultural Treasures'',&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Jeanette. ''The Return of Cultural Treasures.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; provided introductory comments on the subject, along with [[Lynn H. Nicholas|Lynn Nicholas]], author of ''The Rape of Europa'',&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Lynn. ''The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War''. New York: Vintage Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; who discussed the massive displacement of art and cultural property that occurred during World War II. Individual countries detailed the damage to their national patrimony, as well as losses suffered by individuals. A talk on Jewish ceremonial art and private property was given by Vivian Mann, then Chair of Judaica at [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|The Jewish Museum]], New York. These reports were followed by a series of contributions on laws, directives, and conventions in place at the beginning of World War II, directives in force in Germany during the war, and laws enacted by the Allies to counter German appropriations. These and all the conference presentations are published in the proceedings (see list of contributors below).

==The "Monuments Men"==
[[File:Capt Edith Standen at Central Collecting Point Wiesbaden 1946.jpg|thumb|Captain Edith Standen at the Wiesbaden Collecting Point, 1946.]]A group of the so-called [[Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art|"Monuments Men"]] (which in fact included several women) detailed their firsthand accounts of the work of the art-specialist officers of the Western Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monumentsmen.com |title=Official Site |publisher=The Monuments Men |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Section]] of the [[Office of Military Government, United States]], recounted the discovery of [[looted art]] and stashed bullion in German mines, bunkers, castles, and churches, along with the redistribution and repatriation of these finds through the Munich and Wiesbaden Collecting Points. Of the veteran officers speaking the New York conference—James S. Plaut (d. 1996), [[Walter Farmer|Walter I. Farmer]] (d. 1997), [[Edith Standen|Edith A. Standen]] (d. 1998), [[Craig Hugh Smyth]] (d. 2006), [[S. Lane Faison]] (d. 2006), and Bernard Taper (d. 2016)—none survives today.

==Reappearance and recovery==
Other repatriations occurred at the end of the war, effected by the US State Department, the USSR, and other countries. Case studies include fascinating discussions of the [[Theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg|Quedlinburg Church Treasures]], the Soviet Secret Repositories,&lt;ref&gt;Akinsha, Konstantin, Grigorii Kozlov, and Sylvia Hochfield. ''Beautiful Loot: The Soviet Plunder of Europe's Art Treasures'', New York: Random House, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Treasure of Priam," which was excavated by Heinrich Schliemann at Troy in 1873, shipped out of Turkey illegally by Schliemann, ended up in Berlin, transferred to Moscow by the Soviet Trophy Brigades after the fall of Berlin, held in secret in the Pushkin Museum, and finally brought out of the secret repository and exhibited in the museum in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstikov, Vladimir, and Mikhail Treister. ''The Gold of Troy: Searching for Homer’s Fabled City''. Moscow and New York: Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation and the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, in association with Harry N. Abrams, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite claims to ownership of the Trojan treasures by Turkey, Germany, and Greece, the objects remain in Moscow with the issue unresolved.[[File:Sophia Schliemann wearing Treasure A, Troy.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|left|Heinrich Schliemann's wife, Sophia, wearing gold jewelry from Treasure A, Troy, ca. 1873.]]

==Current issues and cooperative efforts==
The conference concluded with a series of presentations on current and proposed efforts to mitigate the losses suffered. Lyndel Prott, then Chief of the International Standards Section of the Cultural Heritage Division of [[UNESCO]], offered a list of "Principles for the Resolution of Disputes Concerning Cultural Heritage Displaced during the Second World War":

# Cultural objects that have been taken from territory occupied during or immediately after hostilities in the Second World War by any belligerent will be returned to the country from which they have been taken.
#Where there have been successive displacements, the objects will be returned to the territory where they were located at the outbreak of hostilities in 1939.
#Principle 1 will apply whether  transfers of the cultural objects concerned have taken the form of open looting or plunder, or of transactions apparently legal in form, even when they purport to have been voluntarily effected.
#Cultural property taken from an occupied territory shall never be detained as war reparations.
#Where cultural objects displaced during or immediately after hostilities in the Second World War have passed into the hands of third parties, the state that is responsible for their removal from the country where they were located in 1939 shall reacquire them for return to the state from which they were taken, by repurchase, indemnity or other appropriate means.
#No time limits can be set.
#Cultural objects being repatriated are to be accompanied by the relevant scientific documentation where available.
#Restitution by replacement is an available remedy where unique cultural objects have been destroyed.

==Press coverage and controversy==
The "Spoils of War" symposium was covered extensively in the international press, including articles carried by the [[Associated Press]] and in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''New York [[Newsday]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''[[Die Zeit]]'', and ''[[Pravda]]''. The [[The Forward|''Jewish Forward'']] published a critique that appeared on the first day of the conference; at issue was whether or not the conference gave sufficient weight to Jewish wartime losses, since these losses were detailed within the greater context of the Second World War and the damages experienced by the peoples of the many nations involved.

[[File:Amber Room Catherine Palace Tsarskoye Selo pre-war photo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|The original [[Amber Room]] in the [[Catherine Palace]], Pushkin (Tsarskoye Selo), Russia, in an early 20th century photograph before it was lost as a result of the Second World War.]]This issue sparked a second conference in Washington, DC, in 1998. Sponsored by the [[United States Department of State]] and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], the "Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/index.HTM |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; assembled participants from the New York symposium along with others to discuss Jewish losses in particular, including artworks, books, and archives, as well as insurance claims and other types of assets. This resulted in a further set of "[[Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art|Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rt/hlcst/122038.htm |title=Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art |publisher=State.gov |date=1998-12-03 |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined by organizer [[Stuart E. Eizenstat]], as well as "Declarations of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/decl.htm |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York conference has remained influential, however, due to its broader scope—dealing as it did with losses that occurred throughout Europe, inflicted not only by the Germans but also by the Soviets and western Allies, and affecting all those peoples who suffered as a result of the Second World War. The volume of conference proceedings was reviewed widely by publications in the United States and Europe, as well as ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', ''[[Yeni Yüzyıl]]'', [[Russian News Agency TASS|''ITAR-TASS'']], and others. As the only comprehensive treatment of the subject, it is cited frequently, considered one of the most important books on World War II and its aftermath—and the loss, reappearance, and recovery of cultural property relating to the war.

'''Time for Citizenship''' is a free website, initiated in 1999 by [[Primary education|Primary schools]] in the UK and Ireland. Since then, the site has expanded somewhat and now has a membership of over 4,000 schools. Its central tenets are to teach children to learn: 
to respect themselves, to respect others’ values and beliefs, to respect their environment, and to respect the law of the land.

Schools interact and share 'best practice' by submitting outstanding projects and children's Artwork. There are currently 38 projects featured on the site from the UK, France, [[South Africa]], Australia, India, Romania, Poland, Spain, Belarus, Greece, Canada, Lithuania, Ireland, Austria, Latvia and Portugal. The site is supported by the Treasury in the UK, [[HSBC]], [[Microsoft]] and [[CSEF]]. Schools and children receive prizes for their entries. A problem page exists for children to pose problems and be answered by their peers - a fine example of [[Mediation|Peer Mediation]].

The site has been endorsed by many of the UK and Ireland's leading politicians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8140">'''Visual literacy in education''' develops a student's [[visual literacy]] – their ability to comprehend, make meaning of, and communicate through visual means, usually in the form of [[image]]s or [[multimedia]].

==History==
Images have always been involved in learning with pictures and artwork to help define history or literary works. There is also a long tradition of using texts as educational images that reaches back to the Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Shape of Knowledge: Children and the Visual Culture of Literacy and Numeracy|year=2014|volume=26|pages=215–245|url=https://www.academia.edu/1817033/The_Shape_of_Knowledge_Children_and_the_Visual_Culture_of_Literacy_and_Numeracy_Science_in_Context_26_2013_215-245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, visual literacy in education is becoming a much broader and extensive body of learning and comprehension. This is due to the integration of images and visual presentations in the curriculum as technology and the increasing availability of computers.&lt;ref name=Stokes2002&gt;Stokes, Suzanne. [http://ejite.isu.edu/Volume1No1/pdfs/stokes.pdf "Visual Literacy in Teaching and Learning: A Literature Perspective."] ''[http://ejite.isu.edu/ Electronic Journal for the Integration of Technology in Education]'', [[Idaho State University]]. Volume 1, No. 1, Spring 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, in education in particular, the conventional approach was that young learners acquired conventions of print which made each student a discursive learner. As we have recognized that there are multiple learning
styles which better suit some students, some are text oriented, others are visual, kinesthetic, auditory, or a combination of two or more, developers of educational materials have adapted and made use of new media and technology. In 1989, there was a call for new curriculum in social studies, which was uniquely suited to bringing visual information to educational programs by introducing map reading skills, charts and graphs for analyzing data, primary source visuals from the period ephemera, and paintings, sculpture, architecture, objects of daily use, and other evidence of material culture that is the archive from which historians draw their information about past and present cultures. Materials that were embraced for their visual energy, authenticity, and characteristic interest to engage students were prepared by a research and development group named Ligature, whose design director, Josef Godlewski (July 3, 1948 – April 8, 2013), a teacher of graphic design at The Rhode Island School of Design, brought to what is now the accepted integration of visuals with text that we see in print and media board learning programs.

==Advancements of multimedia==
[[Multimedia]] advancements have redefined what it means to teach literacy in the classroom. Today, students must be able to present and decode written and visual images, presenting educators with the task of teaching visual literacy in the classroom. Students today are using [[PowerPoint]], [[PhotoStory]], [[MovieMaker]] and other tools to create presentations in the classroom. This presents a challenge to educators as they seek to empower their students with the necessary tools to thrive in a media driven environment.&lt;ref&gt;Riesland, Erin. [http://www.newhorizons.org/strategies/literacy/riesland.htm "Visual Literacy and the Classroom."] ''NewHorizons.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

Educators now understand that students lack the skills to accurately decipher and make ethical decisions based on that image. According to Susan Metros of the [[University of Southern California]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educause.edu/Community/MemDir/Profiles/SusanEMetros/41090 Susan E. Metros biography], Associate Vice Provost/Deputy CIO/Professor, [[University of Southern California]]&lt;/ref&gt; students find themselves able to view pictures, read a map and input data, but are unable to create an image, map data and understand why one chart is better than another. To better prepare students, school districts are taking it upon themselves to add a technology component to their [[curriculum]]. For example, instead of submitting papers, students can create short films or interactive essays. This promotes a hands-on approach to multimedia for students to learn new tools.&lt;ref&gt;Metros, Susan E. "[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ791201&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ791201 The Educator's Role in Preparing Visually Literate Learners]", ''Theory Into Practice'' 47.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching visual literacy==
Teaching [[visual literacy]] in the classroom means many things from film, dance, and mime through the use of diagrams, maps and graphs to children's picture books. Visual texts can be found in books, the internet, environmental signage, TV, tablet devices and touch-screen machines like ATMs. It includes teaching students to critically analyze the images presented to them through advertising and other media. It also entails equipping students with the tools to create presentations that effectively communicate content. Today teachers are using classroom [[blogs]] and [[wikis]] to keep their students up to date with class requirements and to encourage collaborative class discussions. More and more students are relying on technology to enhance their learning environments.&lt;ref name=Stokes2002/&gt; As technology continues to advance, their availability and capability  will create more tools for teachers to utilize.

An attempt to observe children reading and writing visual texts was made by twenty US and Australian teachers in 1990-94, and followed up in 2011. The results were published in Steve Moline, [http://www.k-8visual.info ''I See What You Mean; Visual literacy K-8''] (Stenhouse, 1995, [http://www.stenhouse.com rev. ed. 2011]). The visual texts studied were limited to those used in information books, e-books, and websites, such as diagrams, maps, storyboards, flowcharts, time lines, webs, trees and tables. Moline claims that the strategy he calls recomposing assists in essay planning and comprehension. Recomposing is described &lt;ref&gt;Steve Moline, ''I See What You Mean'', Stenhouse, 2nd ed., 2011, pp. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt; as reading information in a lexical format (such as a paragraph of sentences) and summarizing it in a visual format (such as a flowchart or table). The visual text then forms the framework for the child when writing her/his essay on the topic.

==Benefits==
Computers have become a major part of society. People must learn to communicate through images, as [[technology]] continues to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Burmark, Lynell (2002). "Visual Literacy: Learn to See, See to Learn." Virginia: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses in higher education===
As technology advances, so too do the tools that teachers gain in teaching visual literacy skills to students. Scientific [[virtual model]]s and figures, [[digital mapping]], and other computer-based visual programs are all tools available as resources for higher education in schools. These tools can be used to "promote students' capabilities and skills" and create a new understanding of writing and learning in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Felten, Peter. [http://www.changemag.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/November-December%202008/abstract-visual-literacy.html Visual Literacy]", ''[[Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning]]'', 40.6 (November/December 2008): 60-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wildenstein Institute''' is a French art institute that publishes [[Catalogue raisonné|catalogues raisonnés]] and scholarly inventories.  

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1970 by [[Daniel Wildenstein]] as the ''Fondation Wildenstein'', and it was renamed the Wildenstein Institute in 1990. It is an offshoot of the art dealing company ([[Wildenstein &amp; Co.]]) owned by the Wildenstein family for five generations.

It houses the historic documents and photographic archives assembled by Nathan Wildenstein (the company founder) and his son [[Georges Wildenstein|Georges]], which have been added to by subsequent generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/special_sites/wildenstein/printer.asp?page=3|title=The Wildenstein Institute|publisher=Christies|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Wildenstein established the [[Wildenstein Index Number]] used by the Institute to identify paintings.

It publishes catalogues raisonnés and scholarly inventories of impressionists such as Monet, and other modern artists such as Gauguin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-buying-art-dealer-wildenstein8217s-manhattan-headquarters-1391049030?tesla=y|title=Qatar Buying Art Dealer Wildenstein's Manhattan Headquarters|last=Maloney|first=Jennifer|date=29 January 2014|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes itself as a center for research in art history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=accueil&amp;lang=en Institute web site]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently headed by [[Guy Wildenstein]].

==Controversy==
The Institute publishes a Monet catalogue raisonné and is regarded as the "official" authenticator of Monet paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tom-flynn.blogspot.com/2011/07/exclusive-more-on-monet-rejected-by.html|title=More on the Monet rejected by the Wildenstein Institute|last=Flynn|first=Tom|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptance of a Monet by the Institute significantly increases the commercial value of a painting. The Institute controversially refused to authenticate ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]'' after an investigation by [[Fiona Bruce]] (a journalist) and [[Philip Mould]] (an art dealer and historian) in the BBC television programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'', which first aired on 19 June 2011.&lt;ref name="FoF"&gt;{{Cite episode

In 2011, a police raid discovered and seized 30 paintings valued at tens of millions of pounds from the Institute's Paris headquarters (see: [[Guy Wildenstein#Criticism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8301627/Artworks-worth-millions-seized-from-Wildenstein-Institute.html|title=Artworks worth millions seized from Wildenstein Institute|last=Samuel|first=Henry|date=2 February 2011|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zenodotus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ζηνόδοτος}}) was a [[Greek language|Greek]] grammarian, [[literary critic]], [[Homeric scholarship|Homeric scholar]], and the first [[librarian]] of the [[Library of Alexandria]].{{efn|name="Two Others}} A native of [[Ephesus]] and a pupil of [[Philitas of Cos]], he lived during the reigns of the first two [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]], and was at the height of his reputation about 280 BC.

==Biography==
Zenodotus was the first superintendent of the [[Library of Alexandria]] and the first critical editor ({{lang|grc|διορθωτής}} ''diorthōtes'') of [[Homer]]. His colleagues in the librarianship were [[Alexander Aetolus|Alexander of Aetolia]] and [[Lycophron of Chalcis]], to whom were allotted the tragic and comic writers respectively, Homer and other epic poets being assigned to Zenodotus.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=973}}

Although he has been reproached with arbitrariness and an insufficient knowledge of Greek, his recension undoubtedly laid a sound foundation for future criticism. Having collated the different manuscripts in the library, he expunged or obelized doubtful verses, transposed or altered lines, and introduced new readings. It is probable that he was responsible for the division of the Homeric poems into twenty-four books each (using capital Greek letters for the ''[[Iliad]]'', and lower-case for the ''[[Odyssey]]''){{dubious|date=March 2016}}, and possibly was the author of the calculation of the days of the ''Iliad'' in the ''[[Tabula Iliaca]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=973}}

He does not appear to have written any regular commentary on Homer, but his Homeric {{lang|grc|γλῶσσαι}} (''[[wikt:γλῶσσα|glōssai]]'', "lists of unusual words, [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]]") probably formed the source of the explanations of Homer attributed by the grammarians to Zenodotus. He also lectured upon [[Hesiod]], [[Anacreon (poet)|Anacreon]] and [[Pindar]], if he did not publish editions of them. He is further called an epic poet by the ''[[Suda]],'' and three epigrams in the ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' are assigned to him.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=973}}

In addition to his other scholarly work, Zenodotus introduced an organization system on the materials in the [[Library of Alexandria]] whereby texts were assigned to different rooms based on their subject matter. Within their subjects, Zenodotus organized the works [[Alphabetical order|alphabetically]] by the first letter of the name of their author. The principle of alphabetic organization was introduced by Zenodotus.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}  In addition, library staff attached a small tag to the end of each scroll which contained information on each work’s author, title, and subject so that materials could be easily returned to the area in which they had been classified, but also so that library users did not have to unroll each scroll in order to see what it contained. This was the first recorded use of [[metadata]], a landmark in library history.{{sfn|Phillips|2010}}
