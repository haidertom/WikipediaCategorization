In [[futures studies]] and the [[history of technology]], '''accelerating change''' is a perceived increase in the rate of [[technological change]] throughout history, which may suggest faster and more profound change in the future and may or may not be accompanied by equally profound social and cultural change&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Being surprised and surprising ourselves: a geography of personal and social change. Progress in Human Geography, OnlineFirst, pp. 1-20, https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132518810431 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, M., 2018. On the future: prospects for humanity. Princeton: Princeton University Press &lt;/ref&gt;.

== Early observations ==
In 1910 during the town planning conference of London [[Daniel Burnham]] noted that "But it is not merely in the number of facts or sorts of knowledge that progress lies: it is still more in the geometric ratio of sophistication, in the [[geometric growth|geometric widening]] of the sphere of knowledge, which every year is taking in a larger percentage of people as time goes on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/transactions00town|title=Transactions|first1=England)|last1=Town Planning Conference (1910 : London|last2=Royal Institute of British Architects|date=8 July 2018|publisher=London : Royal Institute of British Architects|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later on  "It is the argument with which I began, that a mighty change having come about in fifty years, and our pace of development having immensely accelerated, our sons and grandsons are going to demand and get results that would stagger us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/transactions00town|title=Transactions|first1=England)|last1=Town Planning Conference (1910 : London|last2=Royal Institute of British Architects|date=8 July 2018|publisher=London : Royal Institute of British Architects|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[Buckminster Fuller]] introduced the word [[ephemeralization]] to describe the trends of "doing more with less" in chemistry, health and other areas of [[industrial development]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]], ''[[Nine Chains to the Moon]]'', [[Southern Illinois University Press]] [1938] 1963 pp.&amp;nbsp;276–79.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946, Fuller published a chart of the discoveries of the chemical elements over time to highlight the development of accelerating acceleration in human knowledge acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]], ''[[Synergetics (Fuller)]]'', http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s04/figs/f1903.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Stanislaw Ulam]] wrote in reference to a conversation with [[John von Neumann]]: {{quote|One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.&lt;ref name="mathematical"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-5-JeCa2Z7hbWcxTGsyU09HSTg/edit?pli=1 | last=Ulam|first=Stanislaw |title=Tribute to John von Neumann|publisher=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume= 64, nr 3, part 2|date=May 1958|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Moravec's ''Mind Children''==
In a series of published articles from 1974–1979, and then in his 1988 book ''Mind Children'', computer scientist and futurist [[Hans Moravec]] generalizes [[Moore's law]] to make predictions about the future of artificial life. Moore's law describes an [[exponential growth]] pattern in the complexity of integrated semiconductor circuits. Moravec extends this to include technologies from long before the integrated circuit to future forms of technology. Moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm| journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology| date=1998| volume=1| title=When will computer hardware match the human brain?| first=Hans| last=Moravec| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm| archivedate=15 June 2006| deadurl=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1993/Robot93.html| title= The Age of Robots|date=June 1993| first=Hans| last=Moravec| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060615055406/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1993/Robot93.html| archivedate= 15 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species, starting around 2030–2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2004/Predictions.html| title=Robot Predictions Evolution| first=Hans| last=Moravec|date=April 2004| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060616045535/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2004/Predictions.html| archivedate= 16 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind'', published in 1998, Moravec further considers the implications of evolving [[robot intelligence]], generalizing [[Moore's Law]] to technologies predating the [[integrated circuit]], and also plotting the exponentially increasing computational power of the brains of animals in evolutionary history. Extrapolating these trends, he speculates about a coming "mind fire"  of rapidly expanding [[superintelligence]] similar to the [[intelligence explosion|explosion of intelligence]] predicted by Vinge.

== James Burke's ''Connections'' ==
{{Main|Connections (TV series)}}

In his TV series ''[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]'' (1978)&amp;mdash;and sequels ''Connections²'' (1994) and ''Connections³'' (1997)&amp;mdash;[[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] explores an "Alternative View of Change" (the subtitle of the series) that rejects the conventional linear and teleological view of historical progress. Burke contends that one cannot consider the development of any particular piece of the modern world in isolation. Rather, the entire gestalt of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religious) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation, and is also the main focus of the series and its sequels.

Burke also explores three corollaries to his initial thesis. The first is that, if history is driven by individuals who act only on what they know at the time, and not because of any idea as to where their actions will eventually lead, then predicting the future course of technological progress is merely conjecture. Therefore, if we are astonished by the connections Burke is able to weave among past events, then we will be equally surprised to what the events of today eventually will lead, especially events we weren't even aware of at the time.

The second and third corollaries are explored most in the introductory and concluding episodes, and they represent the downside of an interconnected history. If history progresses because of the synergistic interaction of past events and innovations, then as history does progress, the number of these events and innovations increases. This increase in possible connections causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but to accelerate. Burke poses the question of what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly change itself, becomes too much for the average person to handle, and what this means for individual power, liberty, and privacy.

== Gerald Hawkins' ''Mindsteps'' ==

In his book "Mindsteps to the Cosmos" (HarperCollins, August 1983), [[Gerald Hawkins|Gerald S. Hawkins]] elucidated his notion of 'mindsteps', dramatic and irreversible changes to [[paradigms]] or world views. He identified five distinct mindsteps in human history, and the technology that accompanied these "new world views": the invention of imagery, writing, mathematics, printing, the telescope, rocket, radio, TV, computer... "Each one takes the collective mind closer to reality, one stage further along in its understanding of the relation of humans to the cosmos." He noted: "The waiting period between the mindsteps is getting shorter. One can't help noticing the acceleration." Hawkins' empirical 'mindstep equation' quantified this, and gave dates for future mindsteps. The date of the next mindstep (5; the series begins at 0) is given as 2021, with two further, successively closer mindsteps in 2045 and 2051, until the limit of the series in 2053. His speculations ventured beyond the technological:

{{quote|The mindsteps... appear to have certain things in common - a new and unfolding human perspective, related inventions in the area of memes and communications, and a long formulative waiting period before the next mindstep comes along. None of the mindsteps can be said to have been truly anticipated, and most were resisted at the early stages. In looking to the future we may equally be caught unawares. We may have to grapple with the presently inconceivable, with mind-stretching discoveries and concepts.}}

==Vinge's exponentially accelerating change==
The mathematician [[Vernor Vinge]] popularized his ideas about exponentially accelerating technological change in the science fiction novel ''[[Marooned in Realtime]]'' (1986), set in a world of rapidly accelerating progress leading to the emergence of more and more sophisticated technologies separated by shorter and shorter time intervals, until a point beyond human comprehension is reached. His subsequent [[Hugo award]]-winning novel ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]'' (1992) starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of a [[superintelligence]] passing through exponentially accelerating developmental stages ending in a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], almost [[omnipotent]] power unfathomable by mere humans. His already mentioned influential 1993 paper on the [[technological singularity]] compactly summarizes the basic ideas.

==Kurzweil's ''The Law of Accelerating Returns''{{anchor|The Law of Accelerating Returns|Law of Accelerating Returns}}==

In his 1999 book ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'', [[Ray Kurzweil]] proposed "The Law of Accelerating Returns", according to which the rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems (including but not limited to the growth of technologies) tends to increase exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Kurzweil, ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'', Viking, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA630#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 30] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA632#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; He gave further focus to this issue in a 2001 essay entitled "The Law of Accelerating Returns".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns ''The Law of Accelerating Returns'']. [[Ray Kurzweil]], March 7, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Kurzweil, after Moravec, argued for extending Moore's Law to describe [[exponential growth]] of diverse forms of [[technology|technological]] progress.  Whenever a technology approaches some kind of a barrier, according to Kurzweil, a new technology will be invented to allow us to cross that barrier. He cites numerous past examples of this to substantiate his assertions. He predicts that such [[paradigm shift]]s have and will continue to become increasingly common, leading to "technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history." He believes the Law of Accelerating Returns implies that a [[technological singularity]] will occur before the end of the 21st century, around 2045. The essay begins:

{{quote|An analysis of the history of technology shows that technological change is exponential, contrary to the common-sense 'intuitive linear' view. So we won't experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century—it will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at today's rate). The 'returns,' such as chip speed and cost-effectiveness, also increase exponentially. There's even exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth. Within a few decades, machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to the Singularity—technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history. The implications include the merger of biological and nonbiological intelligence, immortal software-based humans, and ultra-high levels of intelligence that expand outward in the universe at the speed of light.}}

[[Image:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Moore's Law expanded to other technologies]]
[[File:Moore's_Law_over_120_Years.png|thumb|right|200px|An updated version of Moore's Law over 120 Years (based on [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil's]] [[c:File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|graph]]). The 7 most recent data points are all [[Nvidia GPUs|NVIDIA GPUs]].]]
The Law of Accelerating Returns has in many ways altered public perception of [[Moore's law]]. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It is a common (but mistaken) belief that Moore's law makes predictions regarding all forms of technology,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} when really it only concerns semiconductor circuits. Many [[futurist]]s still use the term "Moore's law" to describe ideas like those put forth by Moravec, Kurzweil and others.

According to Kurzweil, since the beginning of [[evolution]], more complex life forms have been evolving exponentially faster, with shorter and shorter intervals between the emergence of radically new life forms, such as human beings, who have the capacity to engineer (i.e. intentionally design with efficiency) a new trait which replaces relatively blind evolutionary mechanisms of selection for efficiency. By extension, the rate of technical progress amongst humans has also been exponentially increasing, as we discover more effective ways to do things, we also discover more effective ways to learn, i.e. [[language]], numbers, written language, [[philosophy]], [[scientific method]], instruments of observation, tallying devices, mechanical calculators, computers, each of these major advances in our ability to account for information occur increasingly close together. Already within the past sixty years, life in the industrialized world has changed almost beyond recognition except for living memories from the first half of the 20th century. This pattern will culminate in unimaginable technological progress in the 21st century, leading to a singularity. Kurzweil elaborates on his views in his books ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'' and ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]''.

==Criticisms==
Examples of large human "buy-ins" into technology include the [[computer revolution]], as well as massive government projects like the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[Human Genome Project]]. The foundation organizing the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]] believes [[aging research]] could be the subject of such a massive project if substantial progress is made in slowing or reversing [[cellular aging]] in mice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Both [[Theodore Modis]] and Jonathan Huebner have argued—each from different perspectives—that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Korotayev A.

In fact, "[[technological singularity]]" is just one of a few singularities detected through the analysis of a number of characteristics of the [[World Systems Theory|World System]] development, for example, with respect to the [[world population]], world GDP, and some other economic indices.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Johansen, A., and D.

&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] pattern of the world demographic, economic, cultural, urbanistic, and technological growth (observed for many centuries, if not millennia prior to the 1970s) could be accounted for by a rather simple mechanism, the nonlinear second-order [[positive feedback]], that was shown long ago to generate precisely the [[hyperbolic growth]], known also as the "blow-up regime" (implying just [[finite-time singularities]]). In our case this nonlinear second order positive feedback looks as follows: more people – more potential inventors – faster technological growth – the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth grows faster – faster [[population growth]] – more people – more potential inventors  – faster technological growth, and so on. On the other hand, this research has shown that since the 1970s the World System  does not develop hyperbolically any more, its development diverges more and more from the blow-up regime, and at present it is moving "from singularity", rather than "toward singularity".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] calls the Singularity "[[Omega]]", referring to [[Teilhard de Chardin]]'s [[Omega Point]] (1916). For Omega = 2040, he says the series Omega - 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; human lifetimes (n &lt; 10; one lifetime = 80 years) roughly matches the most important events in [[human history]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[Image:Arizonaflagstonewinter.jpg|thumb|Buckskin Arizona Flagstone]]
'''Arizona flagstone''' is composed of rounded grains of [[quartz]] which are cemented by [[silica]]. Other minerals are present, mostly as thin seams of clay, [[mica]], secondary [[calcite]], and [[gypsum]]. Arizona flagstone is mainly quarried from the [[Coconino National Forest|Coconino]] and [[Prescott National Forest]]s.

Although [[flagstone]] and dimension stone are quarried from all over the state of [[Arizona]], the town of [[Ash Fork, Arizona]], is well known as the center of production and has proclaimed itself "The Flagstone Capital of the World". Extensive outcrops of Arizona flagstone are also found in [[Mohave County, Arizona|Mohave]], [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino]], [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai]], [[Navajo County, Arizona|Navajo]], [[Apache County, Arizona|Apache]], and [[Gila County, Arizona|Gila]] counties.

{{Marxism|Schools of thought}}
'''Classical Marxism''' refers to the economic, philosophical and sociological theories expounded by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] as contrasted with later developments in [[Marxism]], especially [[Leninism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]].

==Karl Marx==
[[File:Marx4.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Karl Marx]] in 1861]]
{{details|Karl Marx}}
Karl Heinrich Marx (May 5, 1818, [[Trier]], [[German Confederation|Germany]] &amp;ndash; March 14, 1883, [[London]]) was an immensely influential German [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]], [[political economist]] and [[revolutionary socialist]]. Marx addressed a wide range of issues, including [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and exploitation of the worker, the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] and historical materialism, although he is most famous for his analysis of history in terms of class struggles, summed up in the opening line of the introduction to ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'': "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". The influence of his ideas, already popular during his life, was given added impetus by the victory of the [[Russia]]n [[Bolsheviks]] in the 1917 [[October Revolution]] and there are few parts of the world which were not significantly touched by Marxian ideas in the course of the twentieth century.

As the American Marx scholar [[Hal Draper]] remarked: "[T]here are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike".

===Early influences===
{{main|The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism}}
{{details|Influences on Karl Marx}}
The early influences on Marx are often grouped into three categories: German philosophy, English/Scottish political economy and French socialism.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/mar/x01.htm The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism]''&amp;nbsp;by [[Vladimir I. Lenin]] at the [[Marxists Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====German philosophy====
Main influences include [[Immanuel Kant]]; [[G. W. F. Hegel]]; and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. 

Marx studied under one of Hegel's pupils, [[Bruno Bauer]], a leader of the circle of [[Young Hegelians]] to whom Marx attached himself. However, from 1841 he and Engels came to disagree with Bauer and the rest of the Young Hegelians about socialism and also about the usage of Hegel's dialectic and progressively broke away from [[German idealism]] and the Young Hegelians. Marx's early writings are thus a response towards Hegel, German idealism and a break with the rest of the Young Hegelians. Marx, "stood Hegel on his head", in his own view of his role by turning the idealistic dialectic into a materialistic one, in proposing that material circumstances shape ideas instead of the other way around. In this, Marx was following the lead of Feuerbach. His [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]], developed in the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844|Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (published in 1932), inspired itself from Feuerbach's critique of the alienation of Man in God through the [[objectivation]] of all his inherent characteristics (thus man projected on God all qualities which are in fact man's own quality which defines the "[[human nature]]"). But Marx also criticized Feuerbach for being insufficiently materialistic.

====English and Scottish political economy====
Main influences include [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]. 

Marx built on and critiqued the most well-known political economists of his day, the British classical political economists.

Marx critiqued Smith and Ricardo for not realizing that their economic concepts reflected specifically capitalist institutions, not innate natural properties of human society and could not be applied unchanged to all societies. He proposed a systematic correlation between labour-values and money prices. He claimed that the source of profits under capitalism is value added by workers not paid out in wages. This mechanism operated through the distinction between "labour power", which workers freely exchanged for their wages; and "labour", over which asset-holding capitalists thereby gained control. This practical and theoretical distinction was Marx's primary insight, and allowed him to develop the concept of "surplus value", which distinguished his works from that of Smith and Ricardo.

====French socialism====
Main influences include [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]; [[Charles Fourier]]; [[Henri de Saint-Simon]]; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]; and [[Louis Blanc]].

Rousseau was one of the first modern writers to seriously attack the institution of [[private property]] and therefore is sometimes considered a forebear of modern [[socialism]] and [[communism]], though Marx rarely mentions Rousseau in his writings.

In 1833, France was experiencing a number of social problems arising out of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. A number of sweeping plans of reform were developed by thinkers on the [[Left-wing politics|political left]]. Among the more grandiose were the plans of [[Charles Fourier]] and the followers of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]. Fourier wanted to replace modern cities with utopian communities while the Saint-Simonians advocated directing the economy by manipulating credit. Although these programs did not have much support, they did expand the political and social imagination of Marx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta – France |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568934_23/France.html#p464 |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR60qYA?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568934_23/France.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Blanc]] is perhaps best known for originating the social principle, later adopted by Marx, of how labor and income should be distributed: “From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta – Communism |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572241/Communism.html#p9 |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR6a1r6?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572241/Communism.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] participated in the February 1848 uprising and the composition of what he termed "the first republican proclamation" of the new republic, but he had misgivings about the new government because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of the socio-economic reform, which Proudhon considered basic. Proudhon published his own perspective for reform, ''Solution du problème social'', in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from capitalists and financiers to workers. It was Proudhon's book ''[[What Is Property?]]'' that convinced the young Karl Marx that [[private property]] should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon|first=Pierre-Joseph|title=What is property?|year=2007|publisher=Cosimo Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602060944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other influences on Marx====
Main influences includes [[Friedrich Engels]]; [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] [[materialism]]; [[Giambattista Vico]]; and [[Lewis H. Morgan]].

Marx's revision of [[Hegelianism]] was also influenced by Engels' book  ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844, which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.

Marx was influenced by Antique materialism, especially [[Epicurus]] (to whom Marx dedicated his thesis,  ''[[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature]]'', 1841) for his materialism and theory of [[clinamen]] which opened up a realm of liberty.

[[Giambattista Vico]] propounded a [[cyclical theory]] of history, according to which human societies progress through a series of stages from barbarism to civilization and then return to barbarism. In the first stage—called the Age of the Gods—religion, the family and other basic institutions emerge; in the succeeding Age of Heroes, the common people are kept in subjection by a dominant class of nobles; in the final stage—the Age of Men—the people rebel and win equality, but in the process society begins to disintegrate. Vico's influence on Marx is obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta - Giambattista Vico |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551498/Giambattista_Vico.html |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR5SlMg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551498/Giambattista_Vico.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx drew on [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and his [[social evolution]] theory. He wrote a collection of notebooks from his reading of Lewis Morgan, but they are regarded as being quite obscure and only available in scholarly editions. (However Engels is much more noticeably influenced by Morgan than Marx).

==Friedrich Engels==
{{details|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Friedrich Engels]] was a co-founder and proponent of [[Marxism]]]]
Friedrich Engels (November 28, 1820, [[Wuppertal]] – August 5, 1895, [[London]]) was a nineteenth-century German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]]. He developed [[Communism|communist]] theory alongside his better-known collaborator, [[Karl Marx]].

In 1842, his father sent the young Engels to England to help manage his cotton factory in Manchester. Shocked by the widespread [[poverty]], Engels began writing an account which he published in 1845 as ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' ([http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm]).

In July 1845, Engels went to England, where he met an Irish working-class woman named [[Mary Burns]] ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_4.shtml Crosby]), with whom he lived until her death in 1863 (Carver 2003:19). Later, Engels lived with her sister Lizzie, marrying her the day before she died in 1877 (Carver 2003:42). These women may have introduced him to the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, of whose leaders he met several, including [[George Julian Harney|George Harney]].

Engels actively participated in the [[Revolution of 1848]], taking part in the uprising at [[Elberfeld]]. Engels fought in the [[Baden campaign]] against the [[Prussia]]ns (June/July 1849) as the [[aide-de-camp]] of [[August Willich]], who commanded a Free Corps in the Baden-Palatinate uprising. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/german-imperial/ch01.htm]

===Marx and Engels===
Marx and Engels first met in person in September 1844. They discovered that they had similar views on [[philosophy]] and on [[capitalism]] and decided to work together, producing a number of works including ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After the French authorities deported Marx from France in January 1845, Engels and Marx decided to move to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than some other countries in Europe. Engels and Marx returned to Brussels in January 1846, where they set up the Communist Correspondence Committee.

In 1847, Engels and Marx began writing a pamphlet together, based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. They completed the 12,000-word pamphlet in six weeks, writing it in such a manner as to make communism understandable to a wide audience and published it as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled both Engels and Marx. They moved to Cologne, where they began to publish a radical newspaper, the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]''. By 1849, both Engels and Marx had to leave Germany and moved to London. The Prussian authorities applied pressure on the British government to expel the two men, but [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] refused. With only the money that Engels could raise, the Marx family lived in extreme poverty. The contributions of Marx and Engels to the formation of Marxist theory have been described as inseparable.&lt;ref&gt;For example see [[Franz Mehring]]: “The more their thought and their development became one, the more they each remained a separate entity and a man”, in Mehring: ''Karl Marx: The Story of His Life'' (1918), Chapter 8 Marx and Engels [http://www.marxists.org/archive/mehring/1918/marx/ch08.htm#s2 2. An Incomparable Alliance]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main ideas==
Marx's main ideas included:
* [[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]]: Marx refers to the alienation of people from aspects of their "human nature" ("''Gattungswesen''", usually translated as "species-essence" or "species-being"). He believed that alienation is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and in so doing generate alienated labour.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology'', Article: Alienation&lt;/ref&gt; Alienation describes objective features of a person's situation in capitalism—it is not necessary for them to believe or feel that they are alienated.
* [[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|Base and superstructure]]: Marx and Engels use the “base-structure” concept to explain the idea that the totality of relations among people with regard to “the social production of their existence” forms the economic basis, on which arises a superstructure of political and legal institutions. To the base corresponds the social consciousness which includes religious, philosophical and other main ideas. The base conditions both, the superstructure and the social consciousness. A conflict between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production causes social revolutions and the resulting change in the economic basis will sooner or later lead to the transformation of the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;See Marx: ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface], Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas,
and Engels: ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' (1877), Introduction [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/introduction.htm General]
&lt;/ref&gt; For Marx, this relationship is not a one way process—it is reflexive and the base determines the superstructure in the first instance at the same time as it remains the foundation of a form of social organization which is itself transformed as an element in the overall dialectical process. The relationship between superstructure and base is considered to be a [[dialectics|dialectical]] one, [[ineffability|ineffable]] in a sense except as it unfolds in its material reality in the actual historical process (which [[scientific socialism]] aims to explain and ultimately to guide).
* [[Class consciousness]]: class consciousness refers to the awareness, both of itself and of the social world around it, that a [[social class]] possesses and its capacity to act in its own rational interests based on this awareness. Thus class consciousness must be attained before the class may mount a successful revolution. However, other methods of revolutionary action have been developed, such as [[vanguardism]].
* [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|Exploitation]]: Marx refers to the exploitation of an entire segment or class of society by another. He sees it as being an inherent feature and key element of capitalism and free markets. The profit gained by the capitalist is the difference between the value of the product made by the worker and the actual wage that the worker receives—in other words, capitalism functions on the basis of paying workers less than the full value of their labor in order to enable the capitalist class to turn a profit.
* [[Historical materialism]]: historical materialism was first articulated by Marx, although he himself never used the term. It looks for the causes of developments and changes in human societies in the way in which humans collectively make the means to life, thus giving an emphasis through economic analysis to everything that co-exists with the economic base of society (e.g. social classes, political structures, ideologies).
* [[Means of production]]: the means of production are a combination of the [[means of labor]] and the [[subject of labor]] used by workers to make products. The means of labor include machines, tools, equipment, infrastructure and "all those things with the aid of which man acts upon the subject of labor, and transforms it".&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. (1957). xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of labor includes raw materials and materials directly taken from nature. Means of production by themselves produce nothing— [[labour (economics)|labor power]] is needed for production to take place.
* [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|Ideology]]: without offering a general definition for "ideology",&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCarney:
''[http://marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm Ideology and False Consciousness]'', April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Marx on several instances has used the term to designate the production of images of social reality. According to Engels, “ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a false consciousness. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces”.&lt;ref&gt;Engels: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm Letter] to [[Franz Mehring]], (London July 14, 1893), transl. by Donna Torr, in ''Marx and Engels Correspondence'', International Publishers 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society as well as its ruling ideas will be determined according to what is in the ruling class's best interests. As Marx said famously in ''The German Ideology'', “the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm  Karl Marx, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore the ideology of a society is of enormous importance since it confuses the alienated groups and can create [[false consciousness]] such as commodity fetishism (perceiving labor as capital—a degradation of human life).
* [[Mode of production]]: the mode of production is a specific combination of [[productive forces]] (including human the [[means of production]] and [[labour power]], tools, equipment, buildings and technologies, materials and improved land) and social and technical [[relations of production]] (including the property, power and control relations governing society's productive assets, often codified in law, cooperative work relations and forms of association, relations between people and the objects of their work and the relations between social classes).
* [[Political economy]]: the term "political economy" originally meant the study of the conditions under which production was organized in the nation-states of the new-born capitalist system. Political economy then studies the mechanism of human activity in organizing material and the mechanism of distributing the surplus or deficit that is the result of that activity. Political economy studies the means of production, specifically capital and how this manifests itself in economic activity.

===Marx's concept of class===
{{Ref improve section|date=May 2012}}
Marx believed that class identity was configured in the relations with the mode of production. In other words, a class is a collective of individuals who have a similar relationship with the means of production (as opposed to the more common-sense idea that class is determined by wealth alone, i.e. high class, middle class and poor class).

Marx describes several [[social class]]es in capitalist societies, including primarily:
* The [[proletariat]]: "those individuals who sell their [[labor power]], (and therefore add value to the products), and who, in the capitalist mode of production, do not own the means of production". According to Marx, the capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions for the [[bourgeoisie]] to [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]] the proletariat due to the fact that the worker's [[labor power]] generates an [[Surplus value|added value]] greater than his [[salary]].
* The [[bourgeoisie]]: those who "own the means of production" and buy [[labor power]] from the proletariat, who are recompensed by a salary, thus [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]]ing the proletariat.
The bourgeoisie may be further subdivided into the very wealthy bourgeoisie and the [[petty bourgeoisie]]. The petty bourgeoisie are those who employ labor, but may also work themselves. These may be small proprietors, land-holding peasants, or trade workers. Marx predicted that the petty bourgeoisie would eventually be destroyed by the constant reinvention of the means of production and the result of this would be the forced movement of the vast majority of the petty bourgeoisie to the proletariat. Marx also identified the [[lumpenproletariat]], a stratum of society completely disconnected from the means of production.

Marx also describes the [[communists]] as separate from the oppressed proletariat. The communists were to be a unifying party among the proletariat; they were educated revolutionaries who could bring the proletariat to revolution and help them establish the democratic [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Communist Manifesto]] 80-87&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marx, the communists would support any true revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Thus the communists aide the proletariat in creating the inevitable classless society ([[Vladimir Lenin]] takes this concept a step further by stating that only "professional revolutionaries" can lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie).

===Marx's theory of history===
{{main|Marx's theory of history}}
The Marxist theory of historical materialism understands society as fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time—this means the relationships which people enter into with one another in order to fulfill their basic needs, for instance to feed and clothe themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Marx and Engels identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". (Marx, Karl, Letter to editor of the Russian paper Otetchestvennye Zapiskym, 1877) His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CoandaEffekt2.jpg|thumb|A spinning ping pong ball is held in a diagonal stream of air by the Coandă effect. The ball "sticks" to the lower side of the air stream, which stops the ball from falling down. The jet as a whole keeps the ball some distance from the jet exhaust, and gravity prevents it from being blown away.]]

The '''Coandă effect''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɑː|n|d|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|æ|-}}) is the tendency of a [[fluid]] [[Jet (fluid)|jet]] to stay attached to a convex surface. As described by the eponymous [[Henri Coandă]] in different patents:  "the tendency of a jet of fluid emerging from an orifice to follow an adjacent flat or curved surface and to entrain fluid from the surroundings so that a region of lower pressure develops." The pressure effect, which is usually not indicated, is fundamental for the comprehension of the Coandă effect.&lt;ref&gt;Tritton, D.J., Physical Fluid Dynamics, Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1977 (reprinted 1980), Section 22.7, The Coandă Effect.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Coanda%20effect&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle was named after [[Romanian people|Romanian]] aerodynamics pioneer Henri Coandă, who was the first to recognize the practical application of the phenomenon in aircraft development.&lt;ref&gt;"The Coanda effect is a phenomenon that was first observed in 1910 by a mathematician and engineer named Henri Coandă. He discovered that when air was ejected from a rectangular nozzle, it would attach itself to an inclined flat plate connected to the nozzle exit. Emphasizing the need for a sharp angle between the nozzle and the flat plate, Coandă then applied the principle to a series of deflecting surfaces, each at a sharp angle to the previous one, and succeeded in turning flows through angles as large as 180. He stated that "when a jet of fluid is passed over a curved surface, it bends to follow the surface, entraining large amounts of air as it does so," and this phenomenon has become known as the ''Coandă Effect''. ''On Some Recent Applications of the Coanda Effect'' Caroline Lubert International Journal of Acoustics and Vibration, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2011 http://www.iiav.org/ijav/content/volumes/16_2011_1739941303237209/vol_3/237_firstpage_856831320254369.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coandă effect. (2013). ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia|Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia]]'', 6th Edition. Digital version available here: http://www.answers.com/topic/coanda-effect archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118131611/http://www.answers.com/topic/coanda-effect archivedate=2012-01-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
An early description of this phenomenon was provided by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in a lecture given to [[The Royal Society]] in 1800:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The lateral pressure which urges the flame of a candle towards the stream of air from a blowpipe is probably exactly similar to that pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle. Mark the dimple which a slender stream of air makes on the surface of water. Bring a convex body into contact with the side of the stream and the place of the dimple will immediately
show the current is deflected towards the body; and if the body be at liberty to move in every direction it will be urged towards the current...&lt;ref&gt;
The pressure of the air jet is actually supplementing the pressure of the atmosphere, a.k.a. The Atmospheric Press, which at 14.7psi at sea level makes water or other liquids lay smooth. Blow on a part of the water and the pressure is increased a slight amount which naturally makes the water move away.   Direct a flame parallel over a liquid or submerge a candle almost to its wick and the liquid will be seen to rise slightly as the heat of the flame lessens the Atmospheric Press pressing on the water.
The hotter the flame and the closer to the surface the greater the effect will be seen.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A hundred years later, Henri Coandă identified an application of the effect during experiments with his [[Coandă-1910]] aircraft, which mounted an unusual engine he designed. The motor-driven turbine pushed hot air rearward, and Coandă noticed that the airflow was attracted to nearby surfaces. In 1934 Coandă obtained a patent in [[France]] for a "method and apparatus for deviation of a fluid into another fluid." The effect was described as the "deviation of a plain jet of a fluid that penetrates another fluid in the vicinity of a convex wall." The first official documents that explicitly mention the Coandă effect were two 1936 patents by Henri Coandă.&lt;ref&gt;Coanda, H. "US Patent# 2,052,869." Device for Deflecting a Stream of Elastic Fluid Projected into an Elastic Fluid (1936).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coanda H. (1936a), US Patent n. 3,261,162, Lifting Device Coanda Effect, USA&lt;/ref&gt; This name was accepted by the leading aerodynamicist [[Theodore von Kármán]], who had with Coandă a long scientific relationship on aerodynamics problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Eisner|first=Thomas|title=For Love of Insects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ki9djoKOm-0C&amp;pg=PA177|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-01827-3|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coanda effect 6.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A diagram of a generic engine that harnesses the Coandă Effect to generate lift (or forward motion if tilted 90° on its side). The engine is approximately bullet or inverted bowl shaped, with fluid being expelled horizontally from a circular slit near the top of the bullet. A small step at the lower edge of the slit ensures that a low pressure vortex develops immediately below the point where the fluid exits the slit (see image 5 in the illustration on the left). From there on the Coandă effect causes the sheet of fluid to cling to the curved outer surface of the engine. The entrainment of the ambient fluid into the stream flowing over the bullet, causes a low pressure area above the bullet (see images 1-5 on the left) . This, together with the ambient ("high") pressure below the bullet causes lift, or, if mounted horizontally, forward motion in the direction of the apex of the bullet.&lt;ref name=Reba /&gt;]]

A jet of air will entrain molecules of air from its immediate surroundings, causing a "tube," or "sleeve," of low pressure around the jet (see image 1 in the diagram on the left). Ambient air from around this tube of low pressure will exert a force on the jet, which, when seen in cross section, is equal in all directions. The jet will therefore not deviate from moving in a straight line. However, if a solid surface is placed close, and approximately parallel, to the jet (see image 2 in the diagram on the left), the entrainment (and therefore removal) of air from between the solid surface and the jet causes a reduction in air pressure on that side of the jet that cannot be neutralized as rapidly as the low pressure region on the "open" side of the jet. The pressure difference across the jet causes the jet to deviate towards the nearby surface, and then to adhere to it (image 3 on the left).&lt;ref name=Reba /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thermofluids&gt;[http://www.thermofluids.co.uk/effect.php Coanda Effect] Retrieved 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The jet will then adhere to the surface even if it is curved (image 4 on the left), because each (infinitesimally small) incremental change in direction of the surface will bring about the effects described for the initial bending of the jet towards the surface.&lt;ref name=Thermofluids /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://karmak.org/archive/2003/02/coanda_effect.html Jeff Raskin: Coanda Effect: Understanding how wings work.] Retrieved 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; If the surface is not too sharply curved, the jet can, under the right circumstances, adhere to the surface even after flowing 180° round a cylindrically curved surface, and therefore be traveling in a direction opposite to its initial direction. The forces that cause these changes in the direction of flow of the jet cause an equal and opposite force on the surface along which the jet flows.&lt;ref name=Thermofluids /&gt; These Coandă effect induced forces can be harnessed to cause lift and other forms of motion, depending on the orientation of the jet and the surface to which the jet adheres.&lt;ref name=Reba&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reba |first1=Imants |date=June 1966 |title=Applications of the Coanda effect|journal= Scientific American|volume=214 |issue=6 |pages=84–921 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0666-84|bibcode=1966SciAm.214f..84R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small "lip" on the surface at the point where the jet starts to flow over that surface (see image 5 in the diagram on the left), enhances the initial deviation of the direction of flow of the jet, and its subsequent adherence to the surface. This results from the fact that a low pressure vortex forms behind the lip, promoting the dip of the jet towards the surface.&lt;ref name=Reba /&gt;

The Coandă effect can be induced in any fluid, and is therefore equally effective in water as in air.&lt;ref name=Reba /&gt;

==Conditions of existence==

Early sources provide information, both  theoretical and experimental, needed to derive by comparison a detailed explanation of the Coandă effect and its limits. Coandă effect may occur along a curved wall either in a ''free jet'' or a ''wall jet''.

On the left image of the preceding section: "The mechanism of Coanda effect", the effect as described, in the terms of T. Young as "the lateral pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle", represents a ''free jet'' emerging from an orifice and an obstacle in the surroundings. It includes the tendency of a free jet emerging from an orifice to entrain fluid from the surroundings confined with limited access, without developing any region of lower pressure when there is no obstacle  in the surroundings, as is the case on the opposite side where turbulent mixing occurs at ambient pressure.

On the right image, the effect occurs along the curved wall as a ''wall jet''. The image here on the right represents a ''two dimensional wall jet'' between two parallel plane walls, where the "obstacle" is a quarter cylindrical portion following the flat horizontal rectangular orifice, so that no fluid at all is entrained from the surroundings along the wall, but only on the opposite side in turbulent mixing with ambient air.

1. [[Wall jet]]. To compare experiment with a theoretical model, we first refer to a two-dimensional plane wall jet of width ''h'' along a circular wall of radius ''r''. A wall jet follows a flat horizontal wall, say of infinite radius,or rather  whose radius is the radius of the Earth ''without separation'' because the surface pressure as well as the external pressure in the mixing zone is everywhere equal to the atmospheric pressure and the boundary layer does not separate from the wall.
[[File:Surface pressure of a wall jet along a circular wall.png|thumb|Measurements of surface pressure along a circularly curved wall of radius r = 12 cm, deflecting a [[turbulent]] jet of air ([[Reynolds number]] = 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) of width h. The pressure begins to fall before the origin of the jet, due to local effects at the point of exit of the air from the nozzle which creates the jet. If the h/r ratio (ratio of the width of the jet to the radius of curvature of the wall) is less than 0.5, a true Coandă effect is observed, with the wall pressures along the curved wall remaining at this low (sub-ambient pressure) level until the jet reaches the end of the wall (when the pressure rapidly returns to ambient pressure). If the h/r ratio is more than 0.5, only the local effects occur at the origin of the jet, after which the jet immediately separates from the wall, and there is no Coandă effect. Experiments by M. Kadosch and J. Liermann in  M. Kadosch's  laboratory, SNECMA.&lt;ref name=kadosh /&gt;]]
With a much smaller radius (12 centimeters in the image on the right) a transverse difference arises between external and wall surface pressures of the jet, creating a pressure gradient depending upon ''h/r'', the relative curvature. This pressure gradient can appear in a zone before and  after the origin of the jet where it gradually arises, and disappear at the point  where the jet boundary layer separates from the wall, where the wall pressure reaches atmospheric pressure (and the transverse gradient becomes zero).

Experiments made in 1956 with [[turbulent]] air jets at a [[Reynolds number]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; at various  jet widths ({{mvar|h}}) show the pressures measured along a circularly curved wall (radius {{mvar|r}}) at a series of horizontal distance from the origin of the jet (see the diagram on the right).&lt;ref name=kadosh&gt;Kadosch M., ''Déviation d’un jet par adhérence à une paroi convexe'' in ''Journal de Physique et le Radium'', avril 1958, Paris, pp.1–12A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Gersten&gt;Kadosch M., ''"The curved wall effect"'' in 2nd Cranfield Fluidics Conference, Cambridge, 3 janvier 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

Above a critical {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} ratio of 0.5 only local effects at the origin of the jet are seen extending over a small angle of 18° along the curved wall. The jet then immediately separates from the curved wall. A Coandă effect is therefore not seen here but only a local attachment:  a pressure smaller than atmospheric pressure appears on the wall along a distance corresponding to a small angle of 9°, followed by an equal angle of 9° where this pressure increases up to atmospheric pressure at the separation of the boundary layer, subject to this positive longitudinal gradient. However, if the {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} ratio is smaller than the critical value of 0.5, the lower than ambient pressure measured on the wall seen at the origin of the jet continues along the wall (until the wall ends &amp;mdash; see diagram on the right). This is "a true Coandă effect" as the jet clings to the wall "at a nearly constant pressure" as in a conventional wall jet.

A calculation made by Woods in 1954&lt;ref&gt;L. C. Woods, ''Compressible subsonic flow in two-dimensional channels with mixed boundary conditions'', in ''Quart. Journ. Mech. And Applied Math.'', VII, 3, {{pp.|263–282}}, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; of an [[inviscid]] flow along a circular wall shows that an inviscid solution exists with any curvature {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} and any given deflection angle up to a separation point on the wall, where a singular point appears with an infinite  slope of the surface pressure curve. 
[[File:Pressure distribution along the circular wall of a wall jet.jpg|thumb|Pressure distribution along the circular wall of a wall jet]]

Introducing in the calculation  the angle at separation found in the preceding  experiments for each value of the relative curvature {{math|1=''h''/''r''}}, the image here was recently obtained,&lt;ref&gt;Kadosch M., Illusions créatrices, CreateSpace &amp; Kindle,2015, Ch. 8,  Coandă et le jet qui soulève les aeronefs, {{pp.|91 to 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shows inertial effects represented by the inviscid solution: the calculated  pressure field is similar to the experimental one described above, outside the nozzle. The flow curvature is caused exclusively by the transverse pressure gradient, as described by T. Young. Then, viscosity only produces a boundary layer along the wall and turbulent mixing with ambient air as in a conventional wall jet—except that this boundary layer separates under the action of the difference between the finally ambient pressure and a smaller surface pressure along the wall. According to Van Dyke,&lt;ref&gt;M. Van Dyke (1969), ''Higher-Order Boundary-Layer Theory'', Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics&lt;/ref&gt; quoted in [[Lift (force)]] Wikipedia article, §10.3, the derivation of his equation (4c) also shows that the contribution of viscous stress to flow turning is negligible.

An alternative way would be to calculate the deflection angle at which the boundary layer subjected to the inviscid pressure field separates. A rough calculation has been tried that gives the separation angle as a function of {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} and the Reynolds number:&lt;ref name = Gersten/&gt; The results are reported on the image, e.g., 54° calculated instead of 60° measured for {{math|1=''h''/''r''=0.25}}. More experiments and a more accurate boundary layer calculation would be desirable.

Other experiments made in 2004 with a wall jet along a circular wall show that Coandă effect does not occur in a [[laminar flow]], and the critical h/r ratios for small Reynolds numbers are much smaller than those for turbulent flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=T. |last1=Vit |first2=F. |last2=Marsik |title=Experimental and Theoretical Study of Heated Coandă Jet |journal=XXI International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics |location=Warsaw, Poland |date=August 15–21, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; down to {{math|1=''h''/''r''=0.14}} if {{math|1=Re=500}} and {{math|1=''h''/''r''=0.05}} if {{math|1=Re=100}}.

2. [[Free jet]]. L. C. Woods also made the calculation of the inviscid two-dimensional flow of  a free jet of width h, deflected round a circularly cylindrical surface of radius r, between a first contact A and separation at B, including a deflection angle θ. Again a solution exists for any value of the relative curvature {{math|1=''h''/''r''}} and angle θ. 
Moreover in the case of a free jet the equation can be solved in closed form, giving the distribution of  velocity along the circular wall. The surface pressure distribution is then calculated using Bernoulli equation. Let us note {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} the pressure and {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} the velocity along the free streamline at the ambient pressure, and γ the angle along the wall which is zero in A and θ in B. Then the velocity {{mvar|v}} is found to be:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v}{v_a} = \exp\bigg[{2h \over\pi r} \tan^{-1}\bigg( \big[{\sinh^2 ({\pi\theta r \over 4h}) - \cosh^2({\pi\theta r \over 4h}) \tanh^2({\pi\gamma r \over 4h})}\big]^{1/2}\bigg)\bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

An image of the surface pressure distribution of the jet round the cylindrical surface using the same values of  the relative curvature h/r, and the same angle θ as those  found for the wall jet reported in the image on the right side here has been established: it may be found in reference (15) p. 104 and both images are quite similar : Coanda effect of  a free jet is  inertial, the same as Coanda effect of a wall jet. However, an experimental measurement of the corresponding surface pressure distribution is not known.

Experiments in 1959 by Bourque and Newmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bourque |first1=C. |last2=Newmann |first2=B. G. |title=Reattachment of a two-dimensional, incompressible jet to an adjacent flat Plate |journal=The Aeronautical Quarterly |volume=XI |date=August 1960 |pages=201 ''et seq''}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerning the reattachment of a two-dimensional turbulent jet to an offset parallel plate after enclosing a separation bubble where a low pressure vortex is confined (as in the image 5 in the preceding section) and also for a two-dimensional jet followed by a single flat plate inclined at an angle instead of the circularly curved wall in the diagram on the right here describing the experience of a wall jet: the jet separates from the plate, then curves towards the plate when the surrounding fluid is entrained and pressure lowered, and eventually reattaches to it, enclosing a separation bubble. The jet remains free if the angle is greater than 62°.

In this last case which is the geometry  proposed by Coanda, the claim of the inventor is that the quantity of fluid entrained by the jet  from the surroundings is increased when the jet is deflected, a feature exploited to improve the scavenging of internal combustion engines, and to increase the maximum lift coefficient of a wing, as indicated in the applications below.

The surface pressure distribution as well as the reattachment distance have been duly measured in both cases, and two approximate theories have been developed for the mean pressure within the separation bubble, the position of reattachment and the increase in volume flow from the orifice: the agreement with experiment was satisfactory.

==Applications==
The Coandă effect has important applications in various high-lift devices on [[aircraft]], where air moving over the wing can be "bent down" towards the ground using flaps and a jet sheet blowing over the curved surface of the top of the wing. The bending of the flow results in [[aerodynamic lift]].&lt;ref&gt;"Lift is a force generated by turning a moving fluid." Lift from Flow Turning NASA Glenn Research Center http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/right2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The flow from a high speed jet engine mounted in a [[podded engines|pod]] over the wing produces increased lift by dramatically increasing the velocity [[gradient]] in the [[shear flow]] in the boundary layer. In this velocity gradient, particles are blown away from the surface, thus lowering the pressure there. Closely following the work of Coandă on applications of his research, and in particular the work on his "Aerodina Lenticulară,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phys.ttu.edu/~cmyles/Phys5306/Talks/2004/Fluid%20Dynamics.ppt Fluid Dynamics by Mihaela-Maria Tanasescu, Texas Tech University]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[John Carver Meadows Frost|John Frost]] of [[Avro Canada]] also spent considerable time researching the effect, leading to a series of "inside out" [[hovercraft]]-like aircraft from which the air exited in a ring around the outside of the aircraft and was directed by being "attached" to a flap-like ring.
[[File:Avrocar at factory.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The first Avrocar being readied at the Avro factory in 1958]]
This is as opposed to a traditional hovercraft design, in which the air is blown into a central area, the ''plenum'', and directed down with the use of a fabric "skirt." Only one of Frost's designs was ever built, the [[Avrocar (aircraft)|Avrocar]].

The [[VZ-9 AV Avrocar]] (often listed as '''VZ-9''') was a Canadian [[vertical takeoff and landing|vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL)]] aircraft developed by [[Avro Canada|Avro Aircraft Ltd.]] as part of a secret United States military project carried out in the early years of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Yenne 2003, pp. 281–283.&lt;/ref&gt; The Avrocar intended to exploit the Coandă effect to provide lift and thrust from a single "turborotor" blowing exhaust out the rim of the disk-shaped aircraft to provide anticipated [[VTOL]]-like performance. In the air, it would have resembled a [[flying saucer]]. Two prototypes were built as "proof-of-concept" test vehicles for a more advanced [[USAF|U.S. Air Force]] fighter and also for a [[U.S. Army]] tactical combat aircraft requirement.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;Milberry 1979, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avro's 1956 [[Project 1794]] for the US military designed a larger-scale flying saucer based on the Coandă effect and intended to reach speeds between Mach 3 and Mach 4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/137505-us-air-forces-1950s-supersonic-flying-saucer-declassified, US Air Force's 1950s supersonic flying saucer declassified]&lt;/ref&gt; Project documents remained classified until 2012.
 
The effect was also implemented during the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]'s [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport|AMST]] project. Several aircraft, notably the [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems|Boeing]] [[Boeing YC-14|YC-14]] (the first modern type to exploit the effect), NASA's  [[Quiet Short-Haul Research Aircraft]], and the [[National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan]]'s [[Kawasaki C-1|Asuka]] research aircraft have been built to take advantage of this effect, by mounting [[turbofan]]s on the top of the wings to provide high-speed air even at low flying speeds, but to date only one aircraft has gone into production using this system to a major degree, the [[Antonov]] [[Antonov An-72|An-72 "Coaler."]] The [[Shin Meiwa US-1A]] flying boat utilizes a similar system, only it directs the propwash from its four turboprop engines over the top of the wing to generate low-speed lift. More uniquely, it incorporates a fifth turboshaft engine inside of the wing center-section solely to provide air for powerful [[blown flap]]s. The addition of these two systems gives the aircraft an impressive STOL capability.

Extended slats and flaps are used on commercial aircraft on landing and taking off; but are also used to great effect on fighter aircraft to allow slow airspeeds when necessary. This is not an engineering drawing, but a somewhat exaggerated diagram to emphasize the major points.]]
[[Image:C-17 no169 landing.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|The [[C-17 Globemaster III]] uses the Coandă effect in the same way as the [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] (depicted on the right), but with additional use of the exhaust from the engines over the upper surfaces of the wings to cause lift for a comfortable ride at low flying speeds]]

The [[McDonnell Douglas YC-15]] and its successor, the Boeing [[C-17 Globemaster III]], also employ the effect. The [[NOTAR]] helicopter replaces the conventional [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] tail rotor with a Coandă effect tail (diagram on the left).

A milestone in the direction of a better understanding of Coandă effect has been the large scientific literature produced by ACHEON EU FP7 project&lt;ref&gt;ACHEON-Aerial Coanda High Efficiency Orienting jet Nozzle, European Commission, Project reference: 309041, Funded under: FP7."

An important practical use of the Coandă effect is for inclined [[hydropower]] screens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.harc.edu/Documents/EBS/CEDP/HydropowerPart1.pdf Hydropower in the U.S.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621110923/http://files.harc.edu/Documents/EBS/CEDP/HydropowerPart1.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }}, Coandă effect used in debris screen design.&lt;/ref&gt; which separate debris, fish, etc., otherwise in the input flow to the turbines. Due to the slope, the debris falls from the screens without mechanical clearing, and due to the wires of the screen optimizing the Coandă effect, the water flows through the screen to the [[penstock]]s leading the water to the turbines.

The Coandă effect is used in dual-pattern fluid dispensers in automobile windshield washers.&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|4210283|"Dual pattern windshield washer nozzle"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The operation principle of oscillatory flowmeters also relies on the Coandă phenomenon. The incoming liquid enters a chamber that contains two "islands." Due to the Coandă effect, the main stream splits up and goes under one of the islands. This flow then feeds itself back into the main stream making it split up again, but in the direction of the second isle. This process repeats itself as long as the liquid circulates the chamber, resulting in a self-induced oscillation that is directly proportional to the velocity of the liquid and consequently the volume of substance flowing through the meter. A sensor picks up the frequency of this oscillation and transforms it into an analog signal yielding volume passing through.&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, David W. "Industrial Flow measurement." Instrument Society of America, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[air conditioning]], the Coandă effect is exploited to increase the [[throw (engineering)|throw]] of a ceiling mounted [[diffuser (thermodynamics)|diffuser]]. Because the Coandă effect causes air discharged from the diffuser to "stick" to the ceiling, it travels farther before dropping for the same discharge velocity than it would if the diffuser was mounted in free air, without the neighbouring ceiling. Lower discharge velocity means lower noise levels and, in the case of [[variable air volume]] (VAV) air conditioning systems, permits greater [[turndown ratio]]s. [[Linear diffuser]]s and [[slot diffuser]]s that present a greater length of contact with the ceiling exhibit a greater Coandă effect.

In [[cardiovascular medicine]], the Coandă effect accounts for the separate streams of blood in the [[fetal]] right [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashrafian H. The Coandă effect and preferential right atrial streaming.
Chest. 2006 Jul;130(1):300.&lt;/ref&gt; It also explains why eccentric [[mitral regurgitation]] jets are attracted and dispersed along adjacent left atrial wall surfaces (so called "wall-hugging jets" as seen on echocardiographic color-doppler interrogation). This is clinically relevant because the visual area (and thus severity) of these eccentric wall-hugging jets is often underestimated compared to the more readily apparent central jets. In these cases, volumetric methods such as the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method are preferred to quantify the severity of [[mitral regurgitation]].

In medicine, the Coandă effect is used in ventilators.&lt;ref&gt;http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/100/6/859.full&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fluidic+ventilator&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japi.org/june_2009/16_MP_Anaestheisa_and_Critical_Care.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[meteorology]], the Coandă effect theory has also been applied to some air streams flowing out of mountain ranges such as the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and [[Transylvanian Alps]], where effects on agriculture and vegetation have been noted. It also appears to be an effect in the [[Rhone Valley]] in France and near [[Big Delta]] in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, B.D. Fluidics, The Coandă Effect, and some orographic winds. Arch.Met.Geoph.Biokl. Ser.A. 25, 1977, 273–279&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Formula One]] automobile racing, the Coandă effect has been exploited by the McLaren, Sauber, Ferrari and Lotus teams, after the first introduction by Adrian Newey (Red Bull Team) in 2011, to help redirect exhaust gases to run through the rear diffuser with the intention of increasing downforce at the rear of the car.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.formula1.com/news/technical/2012/0/939.html Formula 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to changes in regulations set in place by the [[FIA]] from the beginning of the [[2014 Formula One season]], the intention of redirecting exhaust gases to use the Coandă effect have been negated, due to the mandatory requirement that the car exhaust must not have bodywork directly behind the exit for use of aerodynamic effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/12877/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fluidics]], the Coandă effect was used to build [[bistable multivibrator]]s, where the working stream (compressed air) stuck to one curved wall or an other and control beams could switch the stream between the walls.

The Coandă effect is also used to mix two different fluids in a '''Coandă effect mixer'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hong|first=Chien-Chong|last2=Choi|first2=Jin-Woo|last3=Ahn|first3=Chong H.|date=2004|title=A novel in-plane passive microfluidic mixer with modified Tesla structures|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b305892a|journal=Lab on a Chip|volume=4|issue=2|pages=109|doi=10.1039/b305892a|issn=1473-0197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hong|first=Chien-Chong|title=A Novel In-Plane Passive Micromixer Using Coanda Effect|date=2001|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-010-1015-3_11|work=Micro Total Analysis Systems 2001|pages=31–33|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401038935|access-date=2018-08-10|last2=Choi|first2=Jin-Woo|last3=Ahn|first3=Chong H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical demonstration ==
The Coandă effect can be demonstrated by directing a small jet of air upwards at an angle over a ping pong ball. The jet is drawn to and follows the upper surface of the ball curving around it, due to the (radial) acceleration (slowing and turning) of the air around the ball. With enough airflow, this change in [[momentum]] is balanced by the equal and opposite force on the ball supporting its weight.  This demonstration can be performed using a vacuum cleaner if the outlet can be attached to the pipe and aimed upwards at an angle.

A common misconception is that Coandă effect is demonstrated when a stream of tap water flows over the back of a spoon held lightly in the stream and the spoon is pulled into the stream (for example, Massey in "Mechanics of Fluids"&lt;ref&gt;"Mechanics of Fluids, 4th edition 1979, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York, {{ISBN|0-442-30245-2}}, Fig, 3.12&lt;/ref&gt; uses the Coandă effect to explain the deflection of water around a cylinder). While the flow looks very similar to the air flow over the ping pong ball above (if one could see the air flow), the cause is not really the Coandă effect. Here, because it is a flow of water into air, there is little entrainment of the surrounding fluid (the air) into the jet (the stream of water). This particular demonstration is dominated by [[surface tension]]. (McLean in "Understanding Aerodynamics"&lt;ref&gt;"Understanding Aerodynamics Arguing from the Real Physics" Doug McLean, 2013, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. Chichester, {{ISBN|978-1-119-96751-4}}, Figure 7.3.6&lt;/ref&gt; states that the water deflection "actually demonstrates molecular attraction and surface tension.")

Another demonstration is to direct the air flow from, e.g., a vacuum cleaner operating in reverse, tangentially past a round cylinder. A waste basket works well. The air flow seems to "wrap around" the cylinder and can be detected at more than 180° from the incoming flow. Under the right conditions, flow rate, weight of the cylinder, smoothness of the surface it sits on, the cylinder actually moves. Note that the cylinder does not move directly into the flow as a misapplication of the Bernoulli effect would predict, but at a diagonal.

The effect can also be seen by placing a can in front of a lit candle. If one blows directly at the can, the air bends around it and extinguishes the candle.

==Problems caused==
The engineering use of Coandă effect has disadvantages as well as advantages.

In marine propulsion, the efficiency of a [[propeller]] or [[Bow thruster|thruster]] can be severely curtailed by the Coandă effect. The force on the vessel generated by a propeller is a function of the speed, volume and direction of
the water jet leaving the propeller. Under certain conditions (e.g., when a ship moves through water) the Coandă effect changes the direction of a propeller jet, causing it to follow the shape of the ship's [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]. The side force from a [[bow thruster|tunnel thruster]] at the bow of a ship decreases rapidly with forward speed.&lt;ref&gt;
This problem can be solved by an accurate design of both the propeller and the hull that is specifically optimized on a fluiddynamic point of view.

If the Coandă effect is applied to symmetrically shaped nozzles, it presents resonation problems. Those problems and how different spins couple has been analyzed in depth.&lt;ref name="Das, Shyam S. 2015"/&gt;

[[File:Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus Muta).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Natural selection]] has driven the [[Rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] to change from [[snow camouflage]] in winter to [[disruptive coloration]] suiting [[moorland]] in summer.]]
[[File:Cornselection.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Selective breeding]] transformed [[teosinte]]'s small spikes (left) into modern [[maize]] (right). [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] argued that [[evolution]] worked in a similar way.]]

[[Animal coloration]] provided important early [[Evidence of common descent|evidence for evolution]] by [[natural selection]], at a time when little direct evidence was available. Three major functions of coloration were discovered in the second half of the 19th century, and subsequently used as [[scientific evidence|evidence]] of selection: [[camouflage]] (protective coloration); [[mimicry]], both [[Batesian]] and [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian]]; and [[aposematism]].

[[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published in 1859, arguing from circumstantial evidence that selection by human breeders could produce change, and that since there was clearly a struggle for existence, that natural selection must be taking place. But he lacked an explanation either for [[genetic variation]] or for [[heredity]], both essential to the theory. Many [[alternatives to natural selection|alternative theories]] were accordingly considered by biologists, threatening to undermine Darwinian evolution.

Some of the first evidence was provided by Darwin's contemporaries, the naturalists [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Fritz Müller]]. They described forms of mimicry that now carry their names, based on their observations of tropical butterflies. These highly specific patterns of coloration are readily explained by natural selection, since predators such as birds which hunt by sight will more often catch and kill insects that are less good mimics of distasteful models than those that are better mimics; but the patterns are otherwise hard to explain. 
Darwinists such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]], and in the 20th century [[Hugh Cott]] and [[Bernard Kettlewell]], sought evidence that natural selection was taking place. Wallace noted that [[snow camouflage]], especially plumage and pelage that changed with the seasons, suggested an obvious explanation as an adaptation for concealment. Poulton's 1890 book, ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', written [[Eclipse of Darwinism|during Darwinism's lowest ebb]], used all the forms of coloration to argue the case for natural selection. Cott described many kinds of camouflage, and in particular his drawings of coincident [[disruptive coloration]] in frogs convinced other biologists that these deceptive markings were products of natural selection. Kettlewell experimented on [[peppered moth evolution]], showing that the species had [[industrial melanism|adapted as pollution changed the environment]]; this provided compelling evidence of Darwinian evolution.

===Snow camouflage===
{{main|Snow camouflage}}

In his 1889 book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'', the naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] considered the white coloration of [[Arctic]] animals. He recorded that the [[Arctic fox]], [[Arctic hare]], [[stoat|ermine]] and [[rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] change their colour seasonally, and gave "the obvious explanation", that it was for concealment.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallace, Alfred Russel |authorlink=Alfred Russel Wallace |title=Darwinism - An Exposition Of The Theory Of Natural Selection - With Some Of Its Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaV9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT180|year=2015 |origyear=1889 |publisher=Read Books |isbn=978-1-4733-7510-9 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In the case of prey animals like the Arctic hare, this is concealment from predators, reducing the chance of being seen and eaten, directly affecting survival. In the case of predators like the Arctic fox, camouflage provides concealment from prey, increasing the change of a successful hunt, and again improving survival chances. Thus whether the camouflage is defensive or aggressive, it would be favoured by natural selection. [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] named the two cases "general protective resemblance" and "general aggressive resemblance" respectively.&lt;ref name=Poulton/&gt;}} The modern ornithologist W. L. N. Tickell, reviewing proposed explanations of white plumage in birds, writes that in the ptarmigan "it is difficult to escape the conclusion that [[crypsis|cryptic]] brown summer plumage becomes a liability in snow, and white plumage is therefore another cryptic adaptation." All the same, he notes, "in spite of winter plumage, many Ptarmigan in NE Iceland are killed by [[Gyrfalcon]]s throughout the winter."&lt;ref name=Tickell&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tickell |first1=W.

More recently, decreasing snow cover in Poland, caused by [[global warming]], is reflected in a reduced percentage of [[Mustela nivalis|white-coated weasels]] that become white in winter. Days with snow cover halved between 1997 and 2007, and as few as 20 percent of the weasels had white winter coats. This was shown to be a result of natural selection by predators making use of camouflage mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knapton |first1=Sarah |title=White-furred animals could die out because of climate change, study suggests |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/05/24/white-animals-could-die-climate-change-study-suggests/ |accessdate=24 May 2018 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atmeh Andruszkiewicz Zub 2018"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Atmeh | first=Kamal | last2=Andruszkiewicz | first2=Anna | last3=Zub | first3=Karol | title=Climate change is affecting mortality of weasels due to camouflage mismatch | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=8 | issue=1 | pages=7648 | date=24 May 2018 | doi=10.1038/s41598-018-26057-5| pmid=29795400 | pmc=5967304 | bibcode=2018NatSR...8.7648A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Coincident disruptive coloration}}

In the words of camouflage researchers [[Innes Cuthill]] and A. Székely, the English zoologist and [[List of camoufleurs|camouflage expert]] [[Hugh Cott]]'s 1940 book ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]'' provided "persuasive arguments for the survival value of coloration, and for [[adaptation]] in general, at [[Eclipse of Darwinism|a time when natural selection was far from universally accepted]] within evolutionary biology."&lt;ref name=Stevens2011&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Innes Cuthill|Cuthill, I. C.]]; Székely, A. |editor=[[Martin Stevens (biologist)|Stevens, Martin]]; Merilaita, Sami |title=Animal Camouflage: Mechanisms and Function |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10TCvK-9v70C&amp;pg=PA50 |year=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-1-139-49623-0 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they argue, "Coincident Disruptive Coloration" (one of Cott's categories) "made Cott's drawings the most compelling evidence for natural selection enhancing survival through [[disruptive camouflage]]."&lt;ref name=Stevens2011/&gt; Cott explained, while discussing "a little frog known as [[Afrixalus fornasini|''Megalixalus fornasinii'']]" in his chapter on coincident disruptive coloration, that "it is only when the pattern is considered in relation to the frog's normal attitude of rest that its remarkable nature becomes apparent... The attitude and very striking colour-scheme thus combine to produce an extraordinary effect, whose deceptive appearance depends upon the breaking up of the entire form into two strongly contrasted areas of brown and white. Considered separately, neither part resembles part of a frog. Together in nature the white configuration alone is conspicuous. This stands out and distracts the observer's attention from the true form and contour of the body and appendages on which it is superimposed".&lt;ref name=Cott1940&gt;{{cite book | author=Cott, Hugh B. | authorlink=Hugh B. Cott | year=1940 | title=Adaptive Coloration in Animals | publisher=Methuen | url=https://archive.org/details/adaptivecolorati00cott | pages=68–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cott concluded that the effect was concealment "so long as the false configuration is recognized in preference to the real one".&lt;ref name=Cott1940/&gt; Such patterns embody, as Cott stressed, considerable precision as the markings must line up accurately for the disguise to work. Cott's description and in particular his drawings convinced biologists that the markings, and hence the camouflage, must have survival value (rather than occurring by chance); and further, as Cuthill and Székely indicate, that the bodies of animals that have such patterns must indeed have been shaped by natural selection.&lt;ref name=Stevens2011/&gt;{{-}}

===Industrial melanism===
{{main|Industrial melanism|Peppered moth evolution}}

Between 1953 and 1956, the geneticist [[Bernard Kettlewell]] experimented on [[peppered moth evolution]]. He presented results showing that in a polluted urban wood with dark tree trunks, dark moths survived better than pale ones, causing [[industrial melanism]], whereas in a clean rural wood with paler trunks, pale moths survived better than dark ones. The implication was that survival was caused by camouflage against suitable backgrounds, where predators hunting by sight (insect-eating birds, such as the [[great tit]]s used in the experiment) selectively caught and killed the less well-camouflaged moths. The results were intensely controversial, and from 2001 [[Michael Majerus]] carefully repeated the experiment. The results were published posthumously in 2012, vindicating Kettlewell's work as "the most direct evidence", and "one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action".&lt;ref name="Cook2012"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Cook, L.

===Batesian===
{{main|Batesian mimicry}}

[[Batesian mimicry]], named for the 19th century naturalist [[Henry Walter Bates]] who first noted the effect in 1861, "provides numerous excellent examples of natural selection"&lt;ref name=Rice2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Rice |first=Stanley A. |title=Encyclopedia of Evolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRcAVvmE6eMC&amp;pg=PA274 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-4381-1005-9 |page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; at work. The evolutionary entomologist [[James Mallet]] noted that [[mimicry]] was "arguably the oldest [[Darwinian]] theory not attributable to Darwin."&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt; Inspired by ''On the Origin of Species'', Bates realized that unrelated Amazonian butterflies resembled each other when they lived in the same areas, but had different coloration in different locations in the Amazon, something that could only have been caused by adaptation.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mallet |first1=James |authorlink=James Mallet |title=Mimicry: An interface between psychology and evolution |journal=PNAS |date=July 2001 |volume=98 |issue=16 |pages=8928–8930 |doi=10.1073/pnas.171326298 |pmid=11481461 |pmc=55348|bibcode=2001PNAS...98.8928M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Müllerian===
{{main|Müllerian mimicry}}

[[Müllerian mimicry]], too, in which two or more distasteful species that share one or more predators have come to mimic each other's warning signals, was clearly adaptive; [[Fritz Müller]] described the effect in 1879, in an account notable for being the first use of [[mathematical biology|a mathematical argument]] in [[evolutionary ecology]] to show how powerful the effect of natural selection would be.{{efn|If one may ignore, as [[James Mallet|Mallet]] comments, [[Malthus]]'s discussion of the effects of [[population growth]] that influenced Darwin.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;{{-}}

==Aposematism==
{{main|Aposematism}}

In 1867, in a letter to Darwin, Wallace [[Aposematism#Wallace, 1867|described warning coloration]]. The evolutionary zoologist [[James Mallet]] notes that this discovery "rather illogically"&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt; followed rather than preceded the accounts of Batesian and Müllerian mimicry, which both rely on the existence and effectiveness of warning coloration.&lt;ref name=Mallet2001/&gt;{{efn|[[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] invented the name [[aposematism]] some years later, in 1890, in his book ''[[The Colours of Animals]]''.&lt;ref name=Poulton&gt;{{cite book |author=Poulton, Edward Bagnall |authorlink=Edward Bagnall Poulton |date=1890 |title=The Colours of Animals |page=Foldout after page 339|title-link=The Colours of Animals }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The conspicuous colours and patterns of animals with strong defences such as toxins are [[advertising in biology|advertised]] to [[predator]]s, [[honest signalling|signalling honestly]] that the animal is not worth attacking. This directly increases the [[reproductive fitness]] of the potential prey, providing a strong selective advantage.

==Defence of Darwinism==
{{further|Eclipse of Darwinism}}
[[File:Brazilian Skunk from Edward Bagnall Poulton Colours of Animals 1890.jpg|thumb|left|Warning coloration of the "Brazilian Skunk" in [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]]'s ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', 1890]]

[[Edward Bagnall Poulton]]'s 1890 book, ''[[The Colours of Animals]]'', renamed Wallace's concept of warning colours "aposematic" coloration, as well as supporting Darwin's then unpopular theories of natural selection and [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/Mim/poulton90.html | title=E.B. Poulton (1890) | publisher=[[University College London]] | accessdate=23 November 2012 | author=Mallet, Jim |authorlink=James Mallet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poulton's explanations of coloration are emphatically Darwinian. For example, on aposematic colouration he wrote that

{{blockquote|At first sight the existence of this group seems to be a difficulty in the way of the general applicability of the theory of natural selection. Warning Colours appear to benefit the would-be enemies rather than the conspicuous forms themselves, and the origin and growth of a character intended solely for the advantage of some other species cannot be explained by the theory of natural selection. But the conspicuous animal is greatly benefited by its Warning Colours. If it resembled its surroundings like the members of the other class, it would be liable to a great deal of accidental or experimental tasting, and there would be nothing about it to impress the memory of an enemy, and thus to prevent the continual destruction of individuals. The object of Warning Colours is to assist the education of enemies, enabling them to easily learn and remember the animals which are to be avoided. The great advantage conferred upon the conspicuous species is obvious when it is remembered that such an easy and successful education means an education involving only a small sacrifice of life."&lt;ref name=Poulton1890/&gt;&lt;!--end blockquote--&gt;}}

Poulton summed up his allegiance to Darwinism as an explanation of Batesian mimicry in one sentence: "Every step in the gradually increasing change of the mimicking in the direction of specially protected form, would have been an advantage in the struggle for existence".&lt;ref name=Poulton1890&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Edward Bagnall Poulton |author=Poulton, Edward Bagnall |date=1890 |url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/edward-bagnall-poulton/the-colours-of-animals-their-meaning-and-use-especially-considered-in-the-case-ala/1-the-colours-of-animals-their-meaning-and-use-especially-considered-in-the-case-ala.shtml |title=The Colours of Animals, their meaning and use, especially considered in the case of insects |publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Trübner |pages=160–161, 220, and whole book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian of science Peter J. Bowler commented that Poulton used his book to complain about experimentalists' lack of attention to what field naturalists (like Wallace, Bates, and Poulton) could readily see were adaptive features. Bowler added that "The fact that the adaptive significance of coloration ''was'' (sic) widely challenged indicates just how far anti-Darwinian feeling had developed.{{efn|In the [[eclipse of Darwinism]].}} Only field naturalists such as Poulton refused to give in, convinced that their observations showed the validity of selection, whatever the theoretical problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |authorlink=Peter J.

'''Contained earth''' (CE) is a structurally designed [[natural building material]] that combines containment, inexpensive reinforcement, and strongly cohesive [[earthen wall]]s. CE is [[earthbag construction]] that can be calibrated for several [[seismic risk]] levels based on building soil strength and plan standards for adequate bracing.

There is a recognized need for structural understanding of alternative building materials.&lt;ref&gt; Schildkamp, Martijn (2015) Outcome of Survey About Simplified Earthquake Research. SmartShelterResearch.com, 74% of almost 90 professional respondents to a 2015 survey expressed a need for structural information about alternative building materials&lt;/ref&gt; Construction guidelines for CE are currently under development, based on the New Zealand's performance-based code for adobe and rammed earth.&lt;ref&gt; Standards New Zealand (1998) 4299: Earth Buildings Not Requiring Specific Design&lt;/ref&gt; 

CE is differentiated from [[contained gravel]] (CG) or [[contained sand]] (CS) by the use of damp, tamped, cured cohesive fill. CE can be modular, built in [[poly-propylene]] [[rice bag]] material containers, or solid, built in mesh tubing that allows earthen fill to solidify between courses. 
[[File:Types of Contained Earth.jpg|thumb|Types of Contained Earth]]

CG, filled with [[pumice]] or ordinary [[gravel]] and/ or small stones, is often used as water-resistant base walls under CE, which also provides an effective [[capillary break]]. Soilbags used mostly in horizontal applications by [[civil engineer]]s contain loose fill which includes both CG and CS. CG courses, like soilbags, may contribute base isolation and/or vibration damping qualities,&lt;ref&gt; Liu, Sihong, Y. Wang, J. Gao, and Y. Jin (2011) [http:www.scientific.net/AMR.243-249.893 Cyclic Simple Shear Tests on Base Isolation Using Soilbags] Advanced Materials Research Vols. 243–249 pp 893–896&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Yamamoto, Haruyuki and H. Cheng (2012) "Development Study on Device To Reduce Seismic Response by Using Soil-bags Assemblies," in Research, Development, and Practice in Structural Engineering and Construction, V. Singh and A. Yazdani (eds.), ASEA-Sec-1, Perth, 28 November – 2 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; although out-of-plane strength needs research. 

For clarity, earthbag built with a low cohesion fill, or filled with dry soil that does not solidify, is not CE but CS. Uncured CE also performs structurally like CS.

==Earthbag variations==
Builders used to working without engineers are proud of earthbag's unlimited variations. Few trainers discuss risk levels of building sites, or recommend accurate tests of soil strength, even though soil strength is a key factor of improved seismic performance for earthen walls.&lt;ref&gt; King, Bruce (2008) The Renaissance of Earthen Architecture&lt;/ref&gt; 

Need for or use of metal components are disputed, including [[rebar]] hammered into walls&lt;ref&gt; Geiger, Owen (2011) Earthbag Building Guide: Vertical Walls Step-by-Step (ebook)&lt;/ref&gt; and barbed wire between courses, although static friction of smooth bag-to-bag surfaces of heavy modular CE walls is 0.4 with no adhesion.&lt;ref&gt; Pelly, Ralph (2009) Plastic Limit Analysis of Earthbag Structures. University of Bath (dissertation) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;   

Engineering knowledge of earthbag has been growing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthbagbuilding.com/testing.htm Earthbag Testing Research Summary]&lt;/ref&gt; More is known about the performance of walls made with sand or dry or uncured soil than about the overwhelming majority of earthbag buildings which have used damp, cohesive soil fill. Reports based on tests of soilbags and loose or granular fill (or uncured fill) assumes that soil strength is less important to wall strength than bag fabric strength for.&lt;ref&gt; Canadell, Samuel, A. Blanco and S. Cavalero (2016) Comprehensive Design Method for Earthbag and Superadobe. Materials and Design 96 (2016) 270- 282&lt;/ref&gt; However, shear tests show clearly that stronger cured, cohesive fill increases contained earth wall strength substantially.&lt;ref&gt; Stouter, P. (May 2017) [https://buildsimple.org/resources/Estimated%20Shear%20Strengths%20CE%205-25-17.pdf Estimated Shear Strengths of Contained Earth Walls]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earthbag for high risk environments==
Earthbag developed gradually without structural analysis, first for small domes,&lt;ref&gt; Hart, K. [http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/history.htm History] EarthbagBuilding.com&lt;/ref&gt; then for vertical wall buildings of many shapes. Although domes passed structural testing in California, no structural information was extracted from tests of the inherently stable shapes.&lt;ref&gt; Khalili and Vittori&lt;/ref&gt; Builders borrowed guidelines for adobe to recommend plan details,&lt;ref&gt; Hunter, K. and D. Kiffmeyer (2004) Earthbag Building: Tools, Tricks and Techniques. New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island Canada&lt;/ref&gt; but code developed in low seismic risk New Mexico does not address issues for higher risk areas.&lt;ref&gt; New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department (2015)
[http://164.64.110.239/nmac/parts/title14/14.007.0004.htm 2015 New Mexico Earthen Building Code]&lt;/ref&gt; California's seismic risk levels are almost three times as high as New Mexico's,&lt;ref&gt; USGS (2014) [ftp://hazards.cr.usgs.gov/web/nshm/conterminous/2014/2014_5Hz2pct.pdf Seismicity: Conterminous US 2% probability in 50 years map of 0.2 second spectral acceleration]&lt;/ref&gt; and risk worldwide rises much higher. 

Earthbag is often tried after disasters in the developing world, including Sri Lanka's [[2004 tsunami]]&lt;ref&gt;Earthbag housing: structural behaviour and applicability in Sri Lanka. Engineering Sustainability [serial online]. December 2011;164(4):261–273. Available from: Academic Search Premier, Ipswich, MA. Accessed 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;, Haiti's [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/projects/haiti.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Nepal's [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|2015 earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt; Nepal Earthquake Clearinghouse (2015) [http://www.eqclearinghouse.org/2015-04-25-nepal/2015/06/08/performance-of-earthbag-schools/ Performance of Earthbag Schools]. Earthquake Engineering Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; 

CE walls fail in [[shear test]]s when barbs flex or bend back or (with weak soil fill) by chipping cured bag fill. CS walls or uncured CE walls fail differently, by slitting bag fabric as barbs move through loose fill.

Because no earthbag buildings were seriously damaged by seismic motion up to 0.8 g in [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|Nepal's 2015 quakes]], [[Nepal's building code]] recognizes earthbag,&lt;ref&gt; Geiger,
 O. (7 April 2017) [http://www.naturalbuildingblog.com/earthbag-building-gains-code-approval-nepal/ Earthbag Building Gains Code Approval in Nepal]&lt;/ref&gt; although the code does not discuss soil strengths or improved reinforcement. Nepal requires buildings to resist 1.5 g risk although hazard maps show higher values. Better trainers assume the use of cohesive soil and barbed wire, and recommend vertical rebar, buttresses, and bond beams,&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.goodearthnepal.org/earthbag-technology/ Earthbag Technology] (website)&lt;/ref&gt; but rule of thumb earthbag techniques should be differentiated from contained earth that follows more complete guidelines.

==CE compared to New Zealand wall strengths==
Earthquake damage results confirm the validity of New Zealand's detailed standards for non-engineered adobe and rammed earth&lt;ref&gt; Morris, Hugh, R. Walker and T. Drupsteen (2011) [https://www.nzsee.org.nz/db/2011/133.pdf Modern and historic earth buildings: Observations of the 4th September 2010 Darfield Earthquake] Proceedings of the Ninth Pacific Conference on Earthquake Engineering,
14- 16 April 2011, Auckland, NZ&lt;/ref&gt; which allow unreinforced buildings to 0.6 g force levels.

Although earthbag without specific guidelines may often be this strong, conventional [[adobe]] can have severe damage at levels below 0.2 g forces.&lt;ref&gt; Tarque Ruiz, Sabino (2008) [http://www.roseschool.it/files/get/id/4480 Seismic Risk Assessment of Adobe Dwellings] University of Pavia (dissertation).&lt;/ref&gt; Non-traditional earthbag built with barbed wire, barely cohesive soil and no rebar can have half the shear strength of NZ's unreinforced adobe.&lt;ref&gt; Stouter, P. (2016) Structural Information for Earthbag/ Contained Earth Walls. Build Simple Inc. www.BuildSimple.org&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhere between 0.3 and 0.6 g forces, CE guidelines become important.

Based on static shear testing (Stouter, P. May 2017):
The following approximate guidelines assume a single story of {{Convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide walls with 2 strands of 4 point [[barbed wire]] per course. Check NZS 4299 for bracing wall spacing and size of bracing walls and/ or buttresses. Vertical rebar must be spaced {{Convert|1.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} on center average and embedded in wall fill while damp. Follow NZS 4299 restrictions on building size, site slope, climate, and uses.
Discuss foundation concerns with an engineer, since NZS 4299 assumes a full reinforced concrete footing.

For comparison to NZS 4299 the following risk levels are based roughly on 0.2 second spectral acceleration (Ss) from 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years. Builders may refer to the Unified Facilities Handbook online&lt;ref&gt; US Army Core of Engineers, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, and Air Force Engineer Center. (2012) [https://www.wbdg.org/ffc/dod/unified-facilities-criteria-ufc/ufc-3-301-01 Unified Facilities Criteria: Structural Engineering]. pp. 134- 158&lt;/ref&gt; for these values for some cities worldwide. These risk levels are based on ultimate strength, but deformation limits may require stiffer detailing or lower risk levels.
[[File:Seismic Risk Levels- Eastern Hemisphere.jpg|thumb|Seismic Risk Levels- Eastern Hemisphere]]
[[File:Seismic Risk Levels-Western hemisphere.jpg|thumb|Seismic Risk Levels-Western hemisphere]]

Medium strength soil: {{Convert|250|psi|MPa|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} unconfined compressive strength
* ±0.75 g risk if 2 separate pieces of rebar are inserted, overlapped
* 1.6 g risk if an entire internal rebar extends from base to bond beam

Strong soil: {{Convert|2.2|MPa|psi|0|abbr=on}} unconfined compressive strength
* ±1.6 g risk if 2 separate pieces of rebar are inserted, overlapped
* ±2.1 g risk if a single rebar extends from base to bond beam

Additional research and engineering analysis is needed to create valid CE manuals.

In [[physics]], the '''Coriolis force''' is an [[fictitious force|inertial force]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mechanical Universe: Mechanics and Heat, Advanced Edition |edition=illustrated |first1=Steven C. |last1=Frautschi |first2=Richard P. |last2=Olenick |first3=Tom M. |last3=Apostol |first4=David L. |last4=Goodstein |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-71590-4 |page=208 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTnxQGJ1fHMC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTnxQGJ1fHMC&amp;pg=PA208 Extract of page 208]&lt;/ref&gt; that seems to act on objects that are in motion within a [[rotating reference frame|frame of reference]] that rotates with respect to an inertial frame. In a reference frame with [[clockwise]] rotation, the force acts to the left of the motion of the object. In one with anticlockwise (or counterclockwise) rotation, the force acts to the right. [[Deflection (physics)|Deflection]] of an object due to the Coriolis force is called the '''Coriolis effect'''. Though recognized previously by others, the mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by French scientist [[Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis]], in connection with the theory of [[water wheel]]s. Early in the 20th century, the term ''Coriolis force'' began to be used in connection with [[meteorology]].

[[Newton's laws of motion]] describe the motion of an object in an [[inertial frame of reference|inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference]]. When Newton's laws are transformed to a rotating frame of reference, the Coriolis force and [[centrifugal force]] appear. Both forces are proportional to the [[mass]] of the object. The Coriolis force is proportional to the rotation rate and the centrifugal force is proportional to the square of the rotation rate. The Coriolis force acts in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis and to the velocity of the body in the rotating frame and is proportional to the object's speed in the rotating frame (more precisely, to the component of its velocity that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation). The centrifugal force acts outwards in the radial direction and is proportional to the distance of the body from the axis of the rotating frame. These additional forces are termed inertial forces, [[fictitious force]]s or ''pseudo forces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Mechanics: With introduction to Nonlinear Oscillations and Chaos|last=Bhatia|first=V.B.|publisher=Narosa Publishing House|year=1997|page=201|isbn=81-7319-105-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allow the application of Newton's laws to a rotating system. They are correction factors that do not exist in a non-accelerating or inertial reference frame.

In popular (non-technical) usage of the term "Coriolis effect", the rotating reference frame implied is almost always the [[Earth]]. Because the Earth spins, Earth-bound observers need to account for the Coriolis force to correctly analyze the motion of objects.  The Earth completes one rotation per day, so for motions of everyday objects the Coriolis force is usually quite small compared to other forces; its effects generally become noticeable only for motions occurring over large distances and long periods of time, such as large-scale movement of air in the atmosphere or water in the ocean. Such motions are constrained by the surface of the Earth, so only the horizontal component of the Coriolis force is generally important. This force causes moving objects on the surface of the Earth to be deflected to the right (with respect to the direction of travel) in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and to the left in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The horizontal deflection effect is greater near the [[Geographical pole|poles]], since the effective rotation rate about a local vertical axis is largest there, and decreases to zero at the [[equator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coriolis Effect: Because the Earth turns – Teacher's guide|url=http://www.ametsoc.org/amsedu/proj_atm/modules/Coriolis.pdf|website=Project ATMOSPHERE|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would in a non-rotating system, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the [[equator]] and to the left of this direction south of it. This effect is responsible for the rotation of large [[Cyclone#Structure|cyclones]] &lt;!--Don't add tornadoes here; the Coriolis effect is not directly responsible for tornadoes--&gt;(see [[#Meteorology|Coriolis effects in meteorology]]).

For an intuitive explanation of the origin of the Coriolis force, consider an object, constrained to follow the Earth's surface and moving northward in the northern hemisphere.  Viewed from outer space, the object does not appear to go due north, but has an eastward motion (it rotates around toward the right along with the surface of the Earth).  The further north you go, the smaller the "horizontal diameter" of the Earth (the minimum distance from the surface point to the axis of rotation, which is in a plane orthogonal to the axis), and so the slower the eastward motion of its surface.  As the object moves north, to higher latitudes, it has a tendency to maintain the eastward speed it started with (rather than slowing down to match the reduced eastward speed of local objects on the Earth's surface), so it veers east (i.e. to the right of its initial motion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Solar Energy at Urban Scale |first1=Benoit |last1=Beckers |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-118-61436-5 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAOnjP4k7SQC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAOnjP4k7SQC&amp;pg=PT116 Extract of page 116]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Energy and the Environment: Resources, Technologies, and Impacts |first1=Reza |last1=Toossi |publisher=Verve Publishers |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4276-1867-2 |page=48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cb2EyrWbg0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-cb2EyrWbg0C&amp;pg=PA48 Extract of page 48]&lt;/ref&gt; Though not obvious from this example, which considers northward motion, the horizontal deflection occurs equally for objects moving east or west (or any other direction).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-090-introduction-to-fluid-motions-sediment-transport-and-current-generated-sedimentary-structures-fall-2006/course-textbook/ch7.pdf MIT: Flow in rotating environments]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ball is released from ''F''. The top of the tower moves faster than its base, so while the ball falls, the base of the tower moves to ''I'', but the ball, which has the eastward speed of the tower's top, outruns the tower's base and lands further to the east at ''L''.]]

Italian scientist [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] and his assistant [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]] described the effect in connection with artillery in the 1651 ''Almagestum Novum'', writing that rotation of the Earth should cause a cannonball fired to the north to deflect to the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1063/PT.3.1195|title=Coriolis effect, two centuries before Coriolis|year=2011|last1=Graney|first1=Christopher M.|journal=Physics Today|volume=64|issue=8|page=8|bibcode= 2011PhT....64h...8G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1674 [[Claude François Milliet Dechales]] described in his ''Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus'' how the rotation of the Earth should cause a deflection in the trajectories of both falling bodies and projectiles aimed toward one of the planet's poles. Riccioli, Grimaldi, and Dechales all described the effect as part of an argument against the heliocentric system of Copernicus. In other words, they argued that the Earth's rotation should create the effect, and so failure to detect the effect was evidence for an immobile Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last= Graney| first = Christopher| date = 24 November 2016| title = The Coriolis Effect Further Described in the Seventeenth Century | arxiv= 1611.07912| doi=10.1063/PT.3.3610| volume=70| issue = 7| journal=Physics Today| pages=12–13| bibcode=2017PhT....70g..12G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coriolis acceleration equation was derived by Euler in 1749&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell, Clifford.

Coriolis divided these supplementary forces into two categories. The second category contained a force that arises from the [[cross product]] of the [[angular velocity]] of a [[coordinate system]] and the projection of a particle's [[velocity]] into a plane [[perpendicular]] to the system's [[axis of rotation]]. Coriolis referred to this force as the "compound centrifugal force" due to its analogies with the [[centrifugal force]] already considered in category one.&lt;ref&gt;Dugas, René and J. R.

==Formula==
{{See also|Fictitious force}}

In non-vector terms: at a given rate of rotation of the observer, the magnitude of the Coriolis acceleration of the object is proportional to the velocity of the object and also to the sine of the angle between the direction of movement of the object and the axis of rotation.

The vector formula for the magnitude and direction of the Coriolis acceleration is derived through vector analysis and is&lt;ref name=Coffin&gt;{{cite book|last=Coffin|first=Joseph George David|title=Vector Analysis: An Introduction to Vector-methods and Their Various Applications to Physics and Mathematics|year=1911|publisher=J. Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|page=198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mgGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_C = 2 \, \boldsymbol{v \times  \Omega}&lt;/math&gt;

where (here and below) &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_C&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of the particle in the rotating system, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{v}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the particle with respect to the rotating system, and '''Ω''' is the [[angular velocity]] vector having magnitude equal to the rotation rate ω, with direction along the axis of rotation of the rotating reference frame, and the &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \times &lt;/math&gt;
symbol represents the [[cross product]] operator.

The equation may be multiplied by the mass of the relevant object to produce the Coriolis force:

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ F}_C = 2 \, m \, \boldsymbol{v \times  \Omega}&lt;/math&gt;.

See ''[[fictitious force]]'' for a derivation.

The ''Coriolis effect'' is the behavior added by the ''Coriolis acceleration''. The formula implies that the Coriolis acceleration is perpendicular both to the direction of the velocity of the moving mass and to the frame's rotation axis. So in particular:
* if the velocity is parallel to the rotation axis, the Coriolis acceleration is zero. (For example, on Earth, this situation occurs for a body on the equator moving north or south relative to Earth's surface.)
* if the velocity is straight inward to the axis, the acceleration is in the direction of local rotation. (For example, on Earth, this situation occurs for a body on the equator falling downward, as in the Dechales illustration above, where the falling ball travels further to the east than does the tower.)
* if the velocity is straight outward from the axis, the acceleration is against the direction of local rotation. (In the tower example, a ball launched upward would move toward the west.)
* if the velocity is in the direction of local rotation, the acceleration is outward from the axis. (For example, on Earth, this situation occurs for a body on the equator moving east relative to Earth's surface. It would move upward as seen by an observer on the surface. This effect (see Eötvös effect below) was discussed by Galileo Galilei in 1632 and by Riccioli in 1651.&lt;ref name=Graney2015&gt;{{cite book|last=Graney|first=Christopher M.|title=Setting Aside All Authority: Giovanni Battista Riccioli and the Science Against Copernicus in the Age of Galileo|year=2015|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|location=Notre Dame, Indiana|pages=115–125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6r_nrQEACAAJ|isbn=9780268029883}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* if the velocity is against the direction of local rotation, the acceleration is inward to the axis. (On Earth, this situation occurs for a body on the equator moving west, which would deflect downward as seen by an observer.)

==Causes==
The Coriolis force exists only when one uses a rotating reference frame. In the rotating frame it behaves exactly like a real force (that is to say, it causes acceleration and has real effects). However, the Coriolis force is a consequence of [[inertia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather |editor1-first=Stephen H. |editor1-last=Schneider |editor2-first=Terry L. |editor2-last=Root |editor3-first=Michael |editor3-last=Mastrandrea |year=2011 |page=310 |volume=3 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is not attributable to an identifiable originating body, as is the case for electromagnetic or nuclear forces, for example. From an analytical viewpoint, to use [[Newton's second law]] in a rotating system, the Coriolis force is mathematically necessary, but it disappears in a non-accelerating, inertial frame of reference. For example, consider two children on opposite sides of a spinning roundabout ([[Merry-go-round]] ), who are throwing a ball to each other. From the children's point of view, this ball's path is curved sideways by the Coriolis force. Suppose the roundabout spins anticlockwise when viewed from above. From the thrower's perspective, the deflection is to the right.&lt;ref name="CalvinandHobbs"&gt;{{cite book|title=Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey|author1=John M. Wallace |author2=Peter V. Hobbs |pages=368–371|year=1977|publisher=Academic Press, Inc.|isbn=0-12-732950-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the non-thrower's perspective, deflection is to the left. ''For a mathematical formulation see [[Fictitious force#Mathematical derivation of fictitious forces|Mathematical derivation of fictitious forces]].'' In meteorology, a rotating frame (the Earth) with its Coriolis force provides a more natural framework for explanation of air movements than a non-rotating, inertial frame without Coriolis forces.&lt;ref name=Barry0&gt;{{Cite book|title=Atmosphere, Weather and Climate |author1=Roger Graham Barry |author2=Richard J.

The acceleration entering the Coriolis force arises from two sources of change in velocity that result from rotation: the first is the change of the velocity of an object in time. The same velocity (in an inertial frame of reference where the normal laws of physics apply) is seen as different velocities at different times in a rotating frame of reference. The apparent acceleration is proportional to the angular velocity of the reference frame (the rate at which the coordinate axes change direction), and to the component of velocity of the object in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This gives a term &lt;math&gt;-\boldsymbol\Omega\times\boldsymbol v&lt;/math&gt;. The minus sign arises from the traditional definition of the cross product ([[right-hand rule]]), and from the sign convention for angular velocity vectors.

The second is the change of velocity in space. Different positions in a rotating frame of reference have different velocities (as seen from an inertial frame of reference). For an object to move in a straight line, it must accelerate so that its velocity changes from point to point by the same amount as the velocities of the frame of reference. The force is proportional to the angular velocity (which determines the relative speed of two different points in the rotating frame of reference), and to the component of the velocity of the object in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation (which determines how quickly it moves between those points). This also gives a term &lt;math&gt;-\boldsymbol\Omega\times\boldsymbol v&lt;/math&gt;.

==Length scales and the Rossby number==
{{Further|Rossby number}}
The time, space and velocity scales are important in determining the importance of the Coriolis force. Whether rotation is important in a system can be determined by its [[Rossby number]], which is the ratio of the velocity, ''U'', of a system to the product of the [[Coriolis parameter]],&lt;math&gt;f = 2 \omega \sin \varphi \,&lt;/math&gt;, and the length scale, ''L'', of the motion:
:&lt;math&gt;Ro = \frac{U}{fL}.&lt;/math&gt;
The Rossby number is the ratio of inertial to Coriolis forces. A small Rossby number indicates a system is strongly affected by Coriolis forces, and a large Rossby number indicates a system in which inertial forces dominate. For example, in tornadoes, the Rossby number is large, in low-pressure systems it is low, and in oceanic systems it is around 1. As a result, in tornadoes the Coriolis force is negligible, and balance is between pressure and centrifugal forces. In low-pressure systems, centrifugal force is negligible and balance is between Coriolis and pressure forces. In the oceans all three forces are comparable.&lt;ref name=Lakshmi&gt;{{Cite book|title=Numerical Models of Oceans and Oceanic Processes |author1=Lakshmi H. Kantha |author2=Carol Anne Clayson |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-434068-7 |year=2000 |page=103 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gps9JXtd3owC&amp;pg=PA103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A baseball pitcher may throw the ball at U&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{convert|45|m/s|mph|sp=us|abbr=on}} for a distance of L&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{convert|18.3|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}}. The Rossby number in this case would be 32,000.

Baseball players don't care about which hemisphere they're playing in. However, an unguided missile obeys exactly the same physics as a baseball, but can travel far enough and be in the air long enough to experience the effect of Coriolis force. Long-range shells in the Northern Hemisphere landed close to, but to the right of, where they were aimed until this was noted. (Those fired in the Southern Hemisphere landed to the left.) In fact, it was this effect that first got the attention of Coriolis himself.&lt;ref name=Butz&gt;{{cite book|title=Science of Earth Systems |author=Stephen D.

{{See also|Fictitious force#Crossing a carousel}}
[[File:Target on turntable.PNG|thumb|300px|Cannon at the center of a rotating turntable. To hit the target located at position 1 on the perimeter at time ''t'' = 0&amp;nbsp;s, the cannon must be aimed ahead of the target at angle θ. That way, by the time the cannonball reaches position 3 on the periphery, the target is also at that position. In an inertial frame of reference, the cannonball travels a straight radial path to the target (curve ''y''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;). However, in the frame of the turntable, the path is arched (curve ''y''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;), as also shown in the figure.]]
[[File:Trajectory for three angles of launch.PNG|thumb|300px|Successful trajectory of cannonball as seen from the turntable for three angles of launch θ. Plotted points are for the same equally spaced times steps on each curve. Cannonball speed ''v'' is held constant and angular rate of rotation ω is varied to achieve a successful "hit" for selected θ. For example, for a radius of 1 m and a cannonball speed of 1 m/s, the time of flight ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 s, and ''ωt''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''θ'' → ''ω'' and ''θ'' have the same numerical value if ''θ'' is expressed in radians. The wider spacing of the plotted points as the target is approached show the speed of the cannonball is accelerating as seen on the turntable, due to fictitious Coriolis and centrifugal forces.]]
[[File:Vector relationships.PNG|thumb|300px|Acceleration components at an earlier time (top) and at arrival time at the target (bottom)]]
[[File:Cannon force components.PNG|thumb|300px|Coriolis acceleration, centrifugal acceleration and net acceleration vectors at three selected points on the trajectory as seen on the turntable.]]

The animation at the top of this article is a classic illustration of Coriolis force. Another visualization of the Coriolis and centrifugal forces is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49JwbrXcPjc this animation clip].

Given the radius ''R'' of the turntable in that animation, the rate of angular rotation ω, and the speed of the cannonball (assumed constant) ''v'', the correct angle θ to aim so as to hit the target at the edge of the turntable can be calculated.

The inertial frame of reference provides one way to handle the question: calculate the time to interception, which is ''t&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''R'' / ''v'' . Then, the turntable revolves an angle ω ''t&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' in this time. If the cannon is pointed an angle θ = ω ''t&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ω ''R'' / ''v'', then the cannonball arrives at the periphery at position number 3 at the same time as the target.

No discussion of Coriolis force can arrive at this solution as simply, so the reason to treat this problem is to demonstrate Coriolis formalism in an easily visualized situation.

The trajectory in the inertial frame (denoted ''A'') is a straight line radial path at angle θ. The position of the cannonball in (''x'', ''y'') coordinates at time ''t'' is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_A (t) = vt\ \left( \cos\theta,\ \sin\theta \right) \ . &lt;/math&gt;
In the turntable frame (denoted ''B''), the ''x''- ''y'' axes rotate at angular rate ω, so the trajectory becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_B (t) = vt\ \left( \cos ( \theta - \omega t), \ \sin ( \theta - \omega t)\right) \ , &lt;/math&gt;
and three examples of this result are plotted in the figure.

=====Accelerations=====

======Components of acceleration======
To determine the components of acceleration, a general expression is used from the article [[fictitious force]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{a}_B =
     \mathbf{a}_A \;-\;
    2\boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{v}_B \;-\;
     \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \left(\boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{r}_B\right) \;-\;
     \frac{d\boldsymbol{\Omega}}{dt} \times \mathbf{r}_B
&lt;/math&gt;

in which the term in '''Ω''' × '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the Coriolis acceleration and the term in '''Ω''' × ('''Ω''' × '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;) is the centrifugal acceleration. The results are (let α = θ − ω''t''):
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{r}_B &amp;=
    \;\begin{vmatrix}
      \boldsymbol{i} &amp; \boldsymbol{j} &amp; \boldsymbol{k} \\
                   0 &amp;              0 &amp;         \omega \\
        tv\cos\alpha &amp;   tv\sin\alpha &amp;              0
    \end{vmatrix}\; =
    \omega t\, v\left(-\sin\alpha, \cos\alpha \right)\ , \\
  \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \left(\boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{r}_B\right) &amp;=
    \;\begin{vmatrix}
            \boldsymbol{i} &amp;      \boldsymbol{j} &amp; \boldsymbol{k} \\
                         0 &amp;                   0 &amp;         \omega \\
      -\omega tv\sin\alpha &amp; \omega tv\cos\alpha &amp;              0
    \end{vmatrix}\; =
    \omega^2 t\, v\left(-\cos\alpha, -\sin\alpha\right),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

======Producing accelerations======
Producing a centrifugal acceleration:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{a}_\text{Cfgl} = \omega^2 vt\left(\cos\alpha, \ \sin\alpha\right) = \omega^2 \mathbf{r}_B(t) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Also:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{v}_B = \frac{d\mathbf{r}_B(t)}{dt} &amp;=
    (v\cos\alpha + \omega tv\sin\alpha, \ v\sin\alpha - \omega tv\cos\alpha, \ 0)\ ,\\
  \boldsymbol{\Omega} \times \mathbf{v}_B &amp;=
    \begin{vmatrix}
              \boldsymbol{i}   &amp;            \boldsymbol{j} &amp;   \boldsymbol{k} \\
                             0 &amp;                         0 &amp;           \omega \\
               v\cos\alpha +{} &amp;           v\sin\alpha -{} &amp;                  \\
      \quad\omega tv\sin\alpha &amp;  \quad\omega tv\cos\alpha &amp;                0
    \end{vmatrix}\ ,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

producing a Coriolis acceleration:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{a}_\text{Cor}
    &amp;= -2\left[ -\omega v\left(\sin\alpha - \omega t\cos\alpha\right), \ \omega v\left(\cos\alpha + \omega t \sin \alpha \right) \right] \\
    &amp;=  2\omega v\left(\sin\alpha, \ -\cos\alpha\right) - 2\omega^2\mathbf{r}_B(t)\ .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These accelerations are shown in the diagrams for a particular example.

It is seen that the Coriolis acceleration not only cancels the centrifugal acceleration, but together they provide a net "centripetal", radially inward component of acceleration (that is, directed toward the center of rotation):&lt;ref name=caution&gt;Here the description "radially inward" means "toward the axis of rotation". That direction is ''not'' toward the [[osculating circle|center of curvature]] of the path, however, which is the direction of the true centripetal force. Hence, the quotation marks on "centripetal".&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a_{\mathrm{Cptl}}} = -\omega^2 \mathbf{r_B}(t) \ , &lt;/math&gt;

and an additional component of acceleration perpendicular to '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{C\perp} = 2\omega v\left(\sin\alpha, \ -\cos\alpha\right)\ .&lt;/math&gt;

The "centripetal" component of acceleration resembles that for [[circular motion]] at radius ''r''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, while the perpendicular component is velocity dependent, increasing with the radial velocity ''v'' and directed to the right of the velocity. The situation could be described as a circular motion combined with an "apparent Coriolis acceleration" of 2ω''v''. However, this is a rough labelling: a careful designation of the true centripetal force refers to a [[Centripetal force#Local coordinates|local reference frame]] that employs the directions normal and tangential to the path, not coordinates referred to the axis of rotation.

These results also can be obtained directly by two time differentiations of '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''). Agreement of the two approaches demonstrates that one could start from the general expression for fictitious acceleration above and derive the trajectories shown here. However, working from the acceleration to the trajectory is more complicated than the reverse procedure used here, which is made possible in this example by knowing the answer in advance.

As a result of this analysis an important point appears: ''all'' the fictitious accelerations must be included to obtain the correct trajectory. In particular, besides the Coriolis acceleration, the [[Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]] plays an essential role. It is easy to get the impression from verbal discussions of the cannonball problem, which focus on displaying the Coriolis effect particularly, that the Coriolis force is the only factor that must be considered,&lt;ref name=Owen&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of Scientific Mathematics |author=George E.

===Tossed ball on a rotating carousel===
[[File:Coriolis construction.JPG|thumb|300px|A carousel is rotating counter-clockwise. ''Left panel'': a ball is tossed by a thrower at 12:00 o'clock and travels in a straight line to the center of the carousel. While it travels, the thrower circles in a counter-clockwise direction. ''Right panel'': The ball's motion as seen by the thrower, who now remains at 12:00 o'clock, because there is no rotation from their viewpoint.]]

The figure illustrates a ball tossed from 12:00 o'clock toward the center of a counter-clockwise rotating carousel. On the left, the ball is seen by a stationary observer above the carousel, and the ball travels in a straight line to the center, while the ball-thrower rotates counter-clockwise with the carousel. On the right the ball is seen by an observer rotating with the carousel, so the ball-thrower appears to stay at 12:00 o'clock. The figure shows how the trajectory of the ball as seen by the rotating observer can be constructed.

On the left, two arrows locate the ball relative to the ball-thrower. One of these arrows is from the thrower to the center of the carousel (providing the ball-thrower's line of sight), and the other points from the center of the carousel to the ball. (This arrow gets shorter as the ball approaches the center.) A shifted version of the two arrows is shown dotted.

On the right is shown this same dotted pair of arrows, but now the pair are rigidly rotated so the arrow corresponding to the line of sight of the ball-thrower toward the center of the carousel is aligned with 12:00 o'clock. The other arrow of the pair locates the ball relative to the center of the carousel, providing the position of the ball as seen by the rotating observer. By following this procedure for several positions, the trajectory in the rotating frame of reference is established as shown by the curved path in the right-hand panel.

The ball travels in the air, and there is no net force upon it. To the stationary observer the ball follows a straight-line path, so there is no problem squaring this trajectory with zero net force. However, the rotating observer sees a ''curved'' path. Kinematics insists that a force (pushing to the ''right'' of the instantaneous direction of travel for a ''counter-clockwise'' rotation) must be present to cause this curvature, so the rotating observer is forced to invoke a combination of centrifugal and Coriolis forces to provide the net force required to cause the curved trajectory.

===Bounced ball===
[[File:Points of view.PNG|thumb|300px|Bird's-eye view of carousel. The carousel rotates clockwise. Two viewpoints are illustrated: that of the camera at the center of rotation rotating with the carousel (left panel) and that of the inertial (stationary) observer (right panel). Both observers agree at any given time just how far the ball is from the center of the carousel, but not on its orientation. Time intervals are 1/10 of time from launch to bounce.]]

The figure describes a more complex situation where the tossed ball on a turntable bounces off the edge of the carousel and then returns to the tosser, who catches the ball. The effect of Coriolis force on its trajectory is shown again as seen by two observers: an observer (referred to as the "camera") that rotates with the carousel, and an inertial observer. The figure shows a bird's-eye view based upon the same ball speed on forward and return paths. Within each circle, plotted dots show the same time points. In the left panel, from the camera's viewpoint at the center of rotation, the tosser (smiley face) and the rail both are at fixed locations, and the ball makes a very considerable arc on its travel toward the rail, and takes a more direct route on the way back. From the ball tosser's viewpoint, the ball seems to return more quickly than it went (because the tosser is rotating toward the ball on the return flight).

On the carousel, instead of tossing the ball straight at a rail to bounce back, the tosser must throw the ball toward the right of the target and the ball then seems to the camera to bear continuously to the left of its direction of travel to hit the rail (''left'' because the carousel is turning ''clockwise''). The ball appears to bear to the left from direction of travel on both inward and return trajectories. The curved path demands this observer to recognize a leftward net force on the ball. (This force is "fictitious" because it disappears for a stationary observer, as is discussed shortly.) For some angles of launch, a path has portions where the trajectory is approximately radial, and Coriolis force is primarily responsible for the apparent deflection of the ball (centrifugal force is radial from the center of rotation, and causes little deflection on these segments). When a path curves away from radial, however, centrifugal force contributes significantly to deflection.

The ball's path through the air is straight when viewed by observers standing on the ground (right panel). In the right panel (stationary observer), the ball tosser (smiley face) is at 12 o'clock and the rail the ball bounces from is at position one (1). From the inertial viewer's standpoint, positions one (1), two (2), three (3) are occupied in sequence. At position 2 the ball strikes the rail, and at position 3 the ball returns to the tosser. Straight-line paths are followed because the ball is in free flight, so this observer requires that no net force is applied.

==Applied to the Earth==
An important case where the Coriolis force is observed involves the rotating Earth together with its atmosphere. The atmosphere rotates in sync with the surface of the earth due to frictional forces between the air molecules of the atmosphere (air viscosity) and the earth's surface which causes the air molecules to be carried along and move in step with the earth's surface. Unless otherwise stated, directions of forces and motion apply to the Northern Hemisphere.

===Intuitive explanation===
As the Earth turns around its axis, everything attached to it, including the atmosphere, turns with it (imperceptibly to our senses). An object that is moving without being dragged along with the surface rotation or atmosphere such as an object in ballistic flight or an independent air mass within the atmosphere, travels in a straight motion over the turning Earth. From our rotating perspective on the planet, the direction of motion of an object in ballistic flight changes as it moves, bending in the opposite direction to our actual motion. When viewed from a stationary point in space directly above the north pole, any land feature in the Northern Hemisphere turns anticlockwise—and, fixing our gaze on that location, any other location in that hemisphere rotates around it the same way. The traced [[ground path]] of a freely moving body in ballistic flight traveling from one point to another therefore bends the opposite way, clockwise, which is conventionally labeled as "right," where it will be if the direction of motion is considered "ahead," and "down" is defined naturally.

===Rotating sphere===
[[File:Earth coordinates.svg|thumb|Coordinate system at latitude φ with ''x''-axis east, ''y''-axis north and ''z''-axis upward (that is, radially outward from center of sphere).]]


Consider a location with latitude ''φ'' on a sphere that is rotating around the north-south axis.&lt;ref name=Menke&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geophysical Theory |author1=William Menke |author2=Dallas Abbott |pages=124–126 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XP3R_pVnOoEC&amp;pg=PA120|isbn=0-231-06792-5 |year=1990 |publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local coordinate system is set up with the ''x'' axis horizontally due east, the ''y'' axis horizontally due north and the ''z'' axis vertically upwards. The rotation vector, velocity of movement and Coriolis acceleration expressed in this local coordinate system (listing components in the order east (''e''), north (''n'') and upward (''u'')) are:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ \Omega} = \omega \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \cos \varphi \\ \sin \varphi \end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_e \\ v_n \\ v_u \end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_C =-2\boldsymbol{\Omega \times v}= 2\,\omega\, \begin{pmatrix} v_n \sin \varphi-v_u \cos \varphi \\ -v_e \sin \varphi \\ v_e \cos\varphi\end{pmatrix}\ .&lt;/math&gt;

When considering atmospheric or oceanic dynamics, the vertical velocity is small, and the vertical component of the Coriolis acceleration is small compared to gravity. For such cases, only the horizontal (east and north) components matter. The restriction of the above to the horizontal plane is (setting ''v&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0):

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{ v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_e \\ v_n\end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_c = \begin{pmatrix} v_n \\ -v_e\end{pmatrix}\ f\ , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f = 2 \omega \sin \varphi \,&lt;/math&gt; is called the Coriolis parameter.

By setting ''v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0, it can be seen immediately that (for positive φ and ω) a movement due east results in an acceleration due south. Similarly, setting ''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0, it is seen that a movement due north results in an acceleration due east. In general, observed horizontally, looking along the direction of the movement causing the acceleration, the acceleration always is turned 90° to the right and of the same size regardless of the horizontal orientation.

As a different case, consider equatorial motion setting φ = 0°. In this case, '''Ω''' is parallel to the north or ''n''-axis, and:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ \Omega} = \omega \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_e \\ v_n \\ v_u \end{pmatrix}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{ a}_C =-2\boldsymbol{\Omega \times v}= 2\,\omega\, \begin{pmatrix}-v_u \\0 \\ v_e \end{pmatrix}\ .&lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, an eastward motion (that is, in the same direction as the rotation of the sphere) provides an upward acceleration known as the [[Eötvös effect]], and an upward motion produces an acceleration due west.

Perhaps the most important impact of the Coriolis effect is in the large-scale dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere. In meteorology and [[oceanography]], it is convenient to postulate a rotating frame of reference wherein the Earth is stationary. In accommodation of that provisional postulation, the [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] and Coriolis forces are introduced. Their relative importance is determined by the applicable [[Coriolis effect#Length scales and the Rossby number|Rossby numbers]]. [[Tornado]]es have high Rossby numbers, so, while tornado-associated centrifugal forces are quite substantial, Coriolis forces associated with tornadoes are for practical purposes negligible.&lt;ref name=Holton2&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology |year=2004 |author=James R.

Because surface ocean currents are driven by the movement of wind over the water's surface, the Coriolis force also affects the movement of ocean currents and [[hurricane|cyclones]] as well. Many of the ocean's largest currents circulate around warm, high-pressure areas called [[gyre]]s. Though the circulation is not as significant as that in the air, the deflection caused by the Coriolis effect is what creates the spiraling pattern in these gyres. The spiraling wind pattern helps the hurricane form. The stronger the force from the Coriolis effect, the faster the wind spins and picks up additional energy, increasing the strength of the hurricane.&lt;ref name="Coriolis effect"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brinney|first=Amanda|title=Coriolis Effect – An Overview of the Coriolis Effect|url=http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/coriolis.htm|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air within high-pressure systems rotates in a direction such that the Coriolis force is directed radially inwards, and nearly balanced by the outwardly radial pressure gradient. As a result, air travels clockwise around high pressure in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Air around low-pressure rotates in the opposite direction, so that the Coriolis force is directed radially outward and nearly balances an inwardly radial [[pressure gradient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/coriolis-effect/|title=Coriolis effect|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-08-17|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

====Flow around a low-pressure area====
{{Main|Low-pressure area}}
If a low-pressure area forms in the atmosphere, air tends to flow in towards it, but is deflected perpendicular to its velocity by the Coriolis force. A system of equilibrium can then establish itself creating circular movement, or a cyclonic flow. Because the Rossby number is low, the force balance is largely between the [[pressure-gradient force]] acting towards the low-pressure area and the Coriolis force acting away from the center of the low pressure.

Instead of flowing down the gradient, large scale motions in the atmosphere and ocean tend to occur perpendicular to the pressure gradient. This is known as [[geostrophic flow]].&lt;ref name=Barry&gt;{{cite book|title=Atmosphere, Weather and Climate |author1=Roger Graham Barry |author2=Richard J. Chorley |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MUQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA115|page=115 |isbn=0-415-27171-1 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a non-rotating planet, fluid would flow along the straightest possible line, quickly eliminating pressure gradients. Note that the geostrophic balance is thus very different from the case of "inertial motions" (see below), which explains why mid-latitude cyclones are larger by an order of magnitude than inertial circle flow would be.

This pattern of deflection, and the direction of movement, is called [[Buys-Ballot's law]]. In the atmosphere, the pattern of flow is called a [[cyclone]]. In the Northern Hemisphere the direction of movement around a low-pressure area is anticlockwise. In the Southern Hemisphere, the direction of movement is clockwise because the rotational dynamics is a mirror image there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Nelson | first = Stephen | title = Tropical Cyclones (Hurricanes) | work = Wind Systems: Low Pressure Centers | publisher = [[Tulane University]] | date = Fall 2014 | url = http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/New_Orleans_and_Hurricanes/tropical_cyclones.htm | accessdate = 2016-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At high altitudes, outward-spreading air rotates in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA04384 Cloud Spirals and Outflow in Tropical Storm Katrina] from [[Earth Observatory]] ([[NASA]])&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclones rarely form along the equator due to the weak Coriolis effect present in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XRxzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA326|title=Encyclopedia of Disaster Relief|last=Penuel|first=K.

====Inertial circles====
An air or water mass moving with speed &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; subject only to the Coriolis force travels in a circular trajectory called an 'inertial circle'. Since the force is directed at right angles to the motion of the particle, it moves with a constant speed around a circle whose radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
: &lt;math&gt;R= \frac {v}{f}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the Coriolis parameter &lt;math&gt;2 \Omega \sin \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, introduced above (where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the latitude). The time taken for the mass to complete a full circle is therefore &lt;math&gt;2\pi/f&lt;/math&gt;. The Coriolis parameter typically has a mid-latitude value of about 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; hence for a typical atmospheric speed of {{convert|10|m/s|mph|sp=us|abbr=on}} the radius is {{convert|100|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}, with a period of about 17&amp;nbsp;hours. For an ocean current with a typical speed of {{convert|10|cm/s|mph|sp=us|abbr=on}}, the radius of an inertial circle is {{convert|1|km|1|sp=us|abbr=on}}. These inertial circles are clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere (where trajectories are bent to the right) and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.

If the rotating system is a parabolic turntable, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is constant and the trajectories are exact circles. On a rotating planet, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; varies with latitude and the paths of particles do not form exact circles. Since the parameter &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; varies as the sine of the latitude, the radius of the oscillations associated with a given speed are smallest at the poles (latitude = ±90°), and increase toward the equator.&lt;ref name=Marshall2&gt;{{Cite book|title=p. 98 |author1=John Marshall |author2=R.

====Other terrestrial effects====
The Coriolis effect strongly affects the large-scale oceanic and [[atmospheric circulation]], leading to the formation of robust features like [[jet stream]]s and [[western boundary current]]s. Such features are in [[geostrophic]] balance, meaning that the Coriolis and ''pressure gradient'' forces balance each other. Coriolis acceleration is also responsible for the propagation of many types of waves in the ocean and atmosphere, including [[Rossby wave]]s and [[Kelvin wave]]s. It is also instrumental in the so-called [[Ekman layer|Ekman]] dynamics in the ocean, and in the establishment of the large-scale ocean flow pattern called the [[Sverdrup balance]].

===Eötvös effect===
{{Main|Eötvös effect}}
The practical impact of the "Coriolis effect" is mostly caused by the horizontal acceleration component produced by horizontal motion.

There are other components of the Coriolis effect. Westward-travelling objects are deflected downwards (feel heavier), while Eastward-travelling objects are deflected upwards (feel lighter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title=Fundamentals of Geophysics |edition=illustrated |first1=William |last1=Lowrie |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-46728-4 |page=45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vR2RJSIGVoC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=7vR2RJSIGVoC&amp;pg=PA45 Extract of page 45]&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the [[Eötvös effect]]. This aspect of the Coriolis effect is greatest near the equator. The force produced by this effect is similar to the horizontal component, but the much larger vertical forces due to gravity and pressure mean that it is generally unimportant dynamically.

In addition, objects travelling upwards (''i.e.'', out) or downwards (''i.e.'', in) are deflected to the west or east respectively. This effect is also the greatest near the equator. Since vertical movement is usually of limited extent and duration, the size of the effect is smaller and requires precise instruments to detect. However, in the case of large changes of momentum, such as a spacecraft being launched into orbit, the effect becomes significant. The fastest and most fuel-efficient path to orbit is a launch from the equator that curves to a directly eastward heading.

====Intuitive example====

Imagine a train that travels through a [[friction]]less railway line along the [[equator]]. Assume that, when in motion, it moves at the necessary speed to complete a trip around the world in one day (465&amp;nbsp;m/s).&lt;ref name=Persson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Persson |first1=Anders |title=The Coriolis Effect – a conflict between common sense and mathematics |page=8 |url=http://met.no/english/topics/nomek_2005/coriolis.pdf |accessdate=6 September 2015 |publisher=The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute |location=[[Norrköping]], [[Sweden]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050906101226/http://met.no/english/topics/nomek_2005/coriolis.pdf |archivedate=6 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coriolis effect can be considered in three cases: when the train travels west, when it is at rest, and when it travels east. In each case, the Coriolis effect can be calculated from the [[Rotating reference frame|rotating frame of reference]] on [[Earth]] first, and then checked against a fixed [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frame]]. The image below illustrates the three cases as viewed by an observer at rest in a (near) inertial frame from a fixed point above the North Pole along the Earth's [[rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]]; the train are a few red pixels, fixed at the left side in the leftmost picture, moving in the others &lt;math&gt;(1\text{day}\; \overset{\land}{=}\; 8\text{s}):&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Earth and train 2FPS.gif|center|Earth and train]]

:1. The train travels toward the west: In that case, it moves against the direction of rotation. Therefore, on the Earth's rotating frame the Coriolis term is pointed inwards towards the axis of rotation (down). This additional force downwards should cause the train to be heavier while moving in that direction.
:*If one looks at this train from the fixed non-rotating frame on top of the center of the Earth, at that speed it remains stationary as the Earth spins beneath it. Hence, the only force acting on it is [[gravity of Earth|gravity]] and the reaction from the track. This force is greater (by 0.34%)&lt;ref name=Persson /&gt; than the force that the passengers and the train experience when at rest (rotating along with Earth). This difference is what the Coriolis effect accounts for in the rotating frame of reference.
:2. The train comes to a stop: From the point of view on the Earth's rotating frame, the velocity of the train is zero, thus the Coriolis force is also zero and the train and its passengers recuperate their usual weight.
:*From the fixed inertial frame of reference above Earth, the train now rotates along with the rest of the Earth. 0.34% of the force of gravity provides the [[centripetal force]] needed to achieve the circular motion on that frame of reference. The remaining force, as measured by a scale, makes the train and passengers "lighter" than in the previous case.
:3. The train travels east. In this case, because it moves in the direction of Earth's rotating frame, the Coriolis term is directed outward from the axis of rotation (up). This upward force makes the train seem lighter still than when at rest.
[[File:Eotvos efect on 10Kg.png|thumb|350 px|Graph of the force experienced by a 10-kilogram object as a function of its speed moving along Earth's equator (as measured within the rotating frame). (Positive force in the graph is directed upward. Positive speed is directed eastward and negative speed is directed westward).|alt=]]
:*From the fixed inertial frame of reference above Earth, the train travelling east now rotates at twice the rate as when it was at rest—so the amount of centripetal force needed to cause that circular path increases leaving less force from gravity to act on the track. This is what the Coriolis term accounts for on the previous paragraph.
:*As a final check one can imagine a frame of reference rotating along with the train. Such frame would be rotating at twice the angular velocity as Earth's rotating frame. The resulting [[centrifugal force]] component for that imaginary frame would be greater. Since the train and its passengers are at rest, that would be the only component in that frame explaining again why the train and the passengers are lighter than in the previous two cases.

This also explains why high speed projectiles that travel west are deflected down, and those that travel east are deflected up. This vertical component of the Coriolis effect is called the [[Eötvös effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rugai|first1=Nick|title=Computational Epistemology: From Reality To Wisdom|date=1 December 2012|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=1300477237|page=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUIJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above example can be used to explain why the Eötvös effect starts diminishing when an object is travelling westward as its [[tangential speed]] increases above Earth's rotation (465&amp;nbsp;m/s). If the westward train in the above example increases speed, part of the force of gravity that pushes against the track accounts for the centripetal force needed to keep it in circular motion on the inertial frame. Once the train doubles its westward speed at 930&amp;nbsp;m/s that centripetal force becomes equal to the force the train experiences when it stops. From the inertial frame, in both cases it rotates at the same speed but in the opposite directions. Thus, the force is the same cancelling completely the Eötvös effect. Any object that moves westward at a speed above 930&amp;nbsp;m/s experiences an upward force instead. In the figure&lt;!--NOW THE FIGURE IS WRONG - PLEASE CORRECT THE GRAPH AND REMOVE THIS COMMENT--&gt;, the Eötvös effect is illustrated for a 10 kilogram object on the train at different speeds. The parabolic shape is because the [[centripetal force]] is proportional to the square of the tangential speed. On the inertial frame, the bottom of the parabola is centered at the origin. The offset is because this argument uses the Earth's rotating frame of reference. The graph shows that the Eötvös effect is not symmetrical, and that the resulting downward force experienced by an object that travels west at high velocity is less than the resulting upward force when it travels east at the same speed.

===Draining in bathtubs and toilets===
Contrary to popular misconception, water rotation in home bathrooms under ''normal'' circumstances is not related to the Coriolis effect or to the rotation of the Earth, and no consistent difference in rotation direction between toilet drainage in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bad Coriolis | url = http://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/Bad/BadCoriolis.html | accessdate = 2016-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Flush Bosh | url = http://www.snopes.com/science/coriolis.asp | accessdate = 2016-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Does the rotation of the Earth affect toilets and baseball games? | url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/rotation-earth-toilet-baseball2.htm | accessdate = 2016-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Can somebody finally settle this question: Does water flowing down a drain spin in different directions depending on which hemisphere you're in?

Any rotation around the plug hole that is initially present accelerates as water moves inward.

The Coriolis force still affects the direction of the flow of water, but only minutely. Only if the water is so still that the effective rotation rate of the Earth is faster than that of the water relative to its container, and if externally applied torques (such as might be caused by flow over an uneven bottom surface) are small enough, the Coriolis effect may indeed determine the direction of the vortex. Without such careful preparation, the Coriolis effect is likely to be much smaller than various other influences on drain direction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8hOLs-bmiYYC&amp;pg=PA168|pages=168–9|title=Physics: A World View|author1=Larry D.

In 1908, the Austrian physicist [[Ottokar Tumlirz]] described careful and effective experiments that demonstrated the effect of the rotation of the Earth on the outflow of water through a central aperture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ein neuer physikalischer Beweis für die Achsendrehung der Erde|year=1908|last=Tumlirz|first=Ottokar|journal=Sitzungsberichte der math.-nat. Klasse der kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften IIa|volume=117|pages=819–841|authorlink=Ottokar Tumlirz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject was later popularized in a famous 1962 article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', which described an experiment in which all other forces to the system were removed by filling a {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us|abbr=on}} tank with {{convert|300|USgal|L|sp=us|abbr=on}} of water and allowing it to settle for 24 hours (to allow any movement due to filling the tank to die away), in a room where the temperature had stabilized. The drain plug was then very slowly removed, and tiny pieces of floating wood were used to observe rotation. During the first 12 to 15 minutes, no rotation was observed. Then, a vortex appeared and consistently began to rotate in an anticlockwise direction (the experiment was performed in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in the Northern Hemisphere). This was repeated and the results averaged to make sure the effect was real. The report noted that the vortex rotated, "about 30,000 times faster than the effective rotation of the Earth in 42° North (the experiment's location)". This shows that the small initial rotation due to the Earth is amplified by gravitational draining and conservation of angular momentum to become a rapid vortex and may be observed under carefully controlled [[laboratory]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/1961080b0|title=Bath-Tub Vortex|year=1962|last1=Shapiro|first1=Ascher H.|journal=Nature|volume=196|pages=1080–1081|bibcode=1962Natur.196.1080S|issue=4859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/fluids/www/Shapiro/ncfmf.html (Vorticity, Part 1)].

===Ballistic trajectories===
The Coriolis force is important in [[External ballistics#Coriolis drift|external ballistics]] for calculating the trajectories of very long-range [[artillery]] shells. The most famous historical example was the [[Paris gun]], used by the Germans during [[World War I]] to bombard [[Paris]] from a range of about {{convert|120|km|sp=us|abbr=on}}. The Coriolis force minutely changes the trajectory of a bullet, affecting accuracy at extremely long distances. It is adjusted for by accurate long-distance shooters, such as snipers. At the latitude of [[Sacramento]] a 1000 yard shot would be deflected 3 inches to the right. There is also a vertical component, explained in the Eötvös effect section above, which causes westward shots to hit low, and eastward shots to hit high.&lt;ref name=Taylor0 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Do Snipers Compensate for the Earth’s Rotation? |url=https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/columns/straight-dope/article/13039128/do-snipers-compensate-for-the-earthrsquos-rotation-what-the-coriolis |accessdate=16 July 2018 |work=Washington City Paper |date=25 June 2010 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of the Coriolis force on ballistic trajectories should not be confused with the curvature of the paths of missiles, satellites, and similar objects when the paths are plotted on two-dimensional (flat) maps, such as the [[Mercator projection]]. The projections of the three-dimensional curved surface of the Earth to a two-dimensional surface (the map) necessarily results in distorted features. The apparent curvature of the path is a consequence of the sphericity of the Earth and would occur even in a non-rotating frame.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

{{anchor|parabolic turntable}}To demonstrate the Coriolis effect, a parabolic turntable can be used.
On a flat turntable, the inertia of a co-rotating object forces it off the edge. However, if the turntable surface has the correct [[paraboloid]] (parabolic bowl) shape (see the figure) and rotates at the corresponding rate, the force components shown in the figure make the component of gravity tangential to the bowl surface exactly equal to the centripetal force necessary to keep the object rotating at its velocity and radius of curvature (assuming no friction). (See [[Centripetal force#Example: The banked turn|banked turn]].) This carefully contoured surface allows the Coriolis force to be displayed in isolation.&lt;ref name=parabola&gt;When a container of fluid is rotating on a turntable, the surface of the fluid naturally assumes the correct [[parabola|parabolic]] shape. This fact may be exploited to make a parabolic turntable by using a fluid that sets after several hours, such as a synthetic [[resin]]. For a video of the Coriolis effect on such a parabolic surface, see [http://www-paoc.mit.edu/labweb/lab5/gfd_v.htm Geophysical fluid dynamics lab demonstration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120121513/http://www-paoc.mit.edu/labweb/lab5/gfd_v.htm |date=20 November 2005 }} John Marshall, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=animation&gt;For a java applet of the Coriolis effect on such a parabolic surface, see [http://mensch.org/physlets/inosc.html Brian Fiedler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321094211/http://www.mensch.org/physlets/inosc.html |date=21 March 2006 }} School of Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discs cut from cylinders of [[dry ice]] can be used as pucks, moving around almost frictionlessly over the surface of the parabolic turntable, allowing effects of Coriolis on dynamic phenomena to show themselves. To get a view of the motions as seen from the reference frame rotating with the turntable, a video camera is attached to the turntable so as to co-rotate with the turntable, with results as shown in the figure. In the left panel of the figure, which is the viewpoint of a stationary observer, the gravitational force in the inertial frame pulling the object toward the center (bottom ) of the dish is proportional to the distance of the object from the center. A centripetal force of this form causes the elliptical motion. In the right panel, which shows the viewpoint of the rotating frame, the inward gravitational force in the rotating frame (the same force as in the inertial frame) is balanced by the outward centrifugal force (present only in the rotating frame). With these two forces balanced, in the rotating frame the only unbalanced force is Coriolis (also present only in the rotating frame), and the motion is an ''[[#Inertial circles|inertial circle]]''. Analysis and observation of circular motion in the rotating frame is a simplification compared to analysis or observation of elliptical motion in the inertial frame.

Because this reference frame rotates several times a minute rather than only once a day like the Earth, the Coriolis acceleration produced is many times larger and so easier to observe on small time and spatial scales than is the Coriolis acceleration caused by the rotation of the Earth.

In a manner of speaking, the Earth is analogous to such a turntable.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;{{cite book|title=Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate Dynamics: An Introductory Text|author1=John Marshall |author2=R. Alan Plumb |page=101 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aTGYbmVaA_gC&amp;pg=PA101|isbn=0-12-558691-4|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rotation has caused the planet to settle on a spheroid shape, such that the normal force, the gravitational force and the centrifugal force exactly balance each other on a "horizontal" surface. (See [[equatorial bulge]].)

The Coriolis effect caused by the rotation of the Earth can be seen indirectly through the motion of a [[Foucault pendulum]].

==Coriolis effects in other areas==

===Coriolis flow meter===
A practical application of the Coriolis effect is the [[mass flow meter]], an instrument that measures the [[mass flow rate]] and [[density]] of a fluid flowing through a tube. The operating principle involves inducing a vibration of the tube through which the fluid passes. The vibration, though not completely circular, provides the rotating reference frame that gives rise to the Coriolis effect. While specific methods vary according to the design of the flow meter, sensors monitor and analyze changes in frequency, phase shift, and amplitude of the vibrating flow tubes. The changes observed represent the mass flow rate and density of the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Omega Engineering|url=http://www.omega.com/literature/transactions/volume4/t9904-10-mass.html|title=Mass Flowmeters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular physics===
In polyatomic molecules, the molecule motion can be described by a rigid body rotation and internal vibration of atoms about their equilibrium position. As a result of the vibrations of the atoms, the atoms are in motion relative to the rotating coordinate system of the molecule. Coriolis effects are therefore present, and make the atoms move in a direction perpendicular to the original oscillations. This leads to a mixing in molecular spectra between the rotational and vibrational [[energy level|levels]], from which Coriolis coupling constants can be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=califano |first1=S |title=Vibrational states |year=1976|publisher=Wiley |isbn=0471129968|pages=226–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gyroscopic precession===

When an external torque is applied to a spinning gyroscope along an axis that is at right angles to the spin axis, the rim velocity that is associated with the spin becomes radially directed in relation to the external torque axis. This causes a Coriolis force to act on the rim in such a way as to tilt the gyroscope at right angles to the direction that the external torque would have tilted it. This tendency has the effect of keeping spinning bodies stably aligned in space.

=== Insect flight ===
Flies ([[Diptera]]) and some moths ([[Lepidoptera]]) exploit the Coriolis effect in flight with specialized appendages and organs that relay information about the [[angular velocity]] of their bodies.

Coriolis forces resulting from linear motion of these appendages are detected within the rotating frame of reference of the insects' bodies. In the case of flies, their specialized appendages are dumbbell shaped organs located just behind their wings called "[[halteres]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fraenkel|first1=G.|last2=Pringle|first2=W.S.|title=Halteres of Flies as Gyroscopic Organs of Equilibrium|journal=Nature|date=21 May 1938|issue=3577|pages=919–920|doi=10.1038/141919a0|volume=141|bibcode = 1938Natur.141..919F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fly's halteres oscillate in a plane at the same beat frequency as the main wings so that any body rotation results in lateral deviation of the halteres from their plane of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dickinson|first1=M.|title=Haltere-mediated equilibrium reflexes of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.|year=1999|issue=1385|pages=903–916|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1692594/pdf/10382224.pdf|pmc=1692594|pmid=10382224|doi=10.1098/rstb.1999.0442|volume=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In moths, their antennae are known to be responsible for the ''sensing'' of Coriolis forces in the similar manner as with the halteres in flies.&lt;ref name="Sane S., Dieudonné, A., Willis, M., Daniel, T.date = February 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Antennal mechanosensors mediate flight control in moths|last = Sane S., Dieudonné, A., Willis, M., Daniel, T.|date = February 2007|journal = Science|doi = 10.1126/science.1133598|volume=315|issue = 5813|pages=863–866|bibcode = 2007Sci...315..863S|pmid=17290001|url=http://www.hep.princeton.edu/%7Emcdonald/examples/mechanics/sane_science_315_863_07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both flies and moths, a collection of mechanosensors at the base of the appendage are sensitive to deviations at the beat frequency, correlating to rotation in the [[Aircraft principal axes#Principal axes|pitch and roll]] planes, and at twice the beat frequency, correlating to rotation in the [[yaw (rotation)|yaw]] plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=J|last2=Daniel|first2=T|title=A neural basis for gyroscopic force measurement in the halteres of Holorusia|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology|year=2008|volume=194|issue=10|pages=887–897|doi=10.1007/s00359-008-0361-z|pmid=18751714}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sane S., Dieudonné, A., Willis, M., Daniel, T.date = February 2007" /&gt;

===Lagrangian point stability===
In astronomy, [[Lagrangian point]]s are five positions in the orbital plane of two large orbiting bodies where a small object affected only by gravity can maintain a stable position relative to the two large bodies. The first three Lagrangian points (L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) lie along the line connecting the two large bodies, while the last two points (L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) each form an equilateral triangle with the two large bodies. The L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; points, although they correspond to maxima of the [[effective potential]] in the coordinate frame that rotates with the two large bodies, are stable due to the Coriolis effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spohn |first1=Tilman |last2=Breuer |first2=Doris |last3=Johnson |first3=Torrence |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0bEMAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1| title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System |year=2014|publisher=Elsevier |isbn=0124160344|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stability can result in orbits around just L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, known as [[tadpole orbit]]s, where [[trojan (astronomy)|trojans]] can be found. It can also result in orbits that encircle L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, known as [[horseshoe orbit]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3292">In [[geodesy]], '''earth orientation parameters''' ('''EOP''') are a collection of [[Parameter#Mathematical_functions|parameters]] that describe irregularities in the [[Earth's rotation|rotation of the Earth]].

The Earth's rotational velocity is not constant over time. Any motion of mass in or on the Earth causes a slowdown or speedup of the rotation speed, or a change of rotation axis. Small motions produce changes too small to be measured, but movements of very large mass, like [[sea current]]s or [[tide]]s, can produce discernible changes in the rotation and can change very precise astronomical observations. Global simulations of atmosphere, ocean, and land dynamics are used to create effective angular momentum (EAM) functions that can be used to predict changes in EOP.&lt;ref name="Dobslaw2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dobslaw |first1=Henryk |last2=Dill |first2=Robert |title=Predicting Earth orientation changes from global forecasts of atmosphere-hydrosphere dynamics |journal=Advances in Space Research |date=February 2018 |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=1047–1054 |doi=10.1016/j.asr.2017.11.044 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027311771730875X?via%3Dihub |accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection of earth orientation parameters is fitted to describe the observed rotation irregularities. Technically, they provide the rotational transform from the [[International Terrestrial Reference System]] (ITRS) to the [[International Celestial Reference System]] (ICRS), or vice versa, as a function of time.

==Components==
;Universal time
[[Universal time]] ([[UT1]]) tracks the Earth's rotation in time, which performs one revolution in about 24 hours. The Earth's rotation is uneven, so UT is not linear with respect to [[atomic time]]. It is practically proportional to the [[sidereal time]], which is also a direct measure of Earth rotation. The excess revolution time is called [[Day length|length of day (LOD)]].

;Coordinates of the pole
Due to the very slow pole motion of the Earth, the Celestial Ephemeris Pole (CEP, or [[celestial pole]]) does not stay still on the surface of the Earth. The Celestial Ephemeris Pole is calculated from observation data, and is &lt;!-- somehow --&gt; averaged, so it differs from the instantaneous rotation axis by quasi-diurnal terms, which are as small as under 0.01" (see &lt;ref&gt;Seidelmann, P.K. 1982: Celest. Mech., 27, 79.&lt;/ref&gt;).  In setting up a coordinate system, a static terrestrial point called the IERS Reference Pole, or IRP, is used as the origin; the x-axis is in the direction of IRM, the IERS Reference Meridian; the y-axis is in the direction 90 degrees [[West longitude]]. x and y are the coordinates of the CEP relative to the IRP.

;Celestial pole offsets
[[Celestial pole]] offsets are described in the [[IAU]] [[Precession]] and [[Nutation]] models. The observed differences with respect to the conventional celestial pole position defined by the models are monitored and reported by the [[IERS]].

An '''earth structure''' is a building or other structure made largely from [[soil]]. Since soil is a widely available material, it has been used in construction since prehistoric times.
It may be combined with other materials, compressed and/or baked to add strength. 
Soil is still an economical material for many applications, and may have low environmental impact both during and after construction.

Earth structure materials may be as simple as [[mud]], or mud mixed with straw to make [[Cob (material)|cob]]. Sturdy dwellings may be also built from [[sod]] or turf. Soil may be stabilized by the addition of lime or cement, and may be compacted into [[rammed earth]]. Construction is faster with pre-formed [[adobe]] or [[mudbrick]]s, [[compressed earth block]]s, [[Earthbag construction|earthbag]]s or [[brick|fired clay brick]]s.{{efn|Fired bricks and concrete are derived from earth, but structures built from these materials are usually not considered earth structures.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=9}} }}

Types of earth structure include [[earth sheltering|earth shelters]], where a dwelling is wholly or partly embedded in the ground or encased in soil. Native American [[earth lodge]]s are examples. [[Wattle and daub]] houses use a "wattle" of  poles interwoven with sticks to provide stability for mud walls. [[Sod house]]s were built on the northwest coast of Europe, and later by European settlers on the North American prairies. Adobe or mud-brick buildings are built around the world and include houses, apartment buildings, mosques and churches. [[Fujian Tulou]]s are large fortified rammed earth buildings in southeastern China that shelter as many as 80 families. Other types of earth structure include mounds and pyramids used for religious purposes, [[levee]]s, [[mechanically stabilized earth]] retaining walls, forts, trenches and [[embankment dam]]s.

==Soil==
[[File:SoilTexture USDA.png|thumb|[[Soil type]]s by clay, silt and sand composition as used by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]]]
Soil is created from rock that has been chemically or physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated.{{sfn|USDA|1974|p=112-113}}
Soil particles include [[sand]], [[silt]] and [[clay]].  Sand particles are the largest at {{convert|2|to|0.05|mm}} in diameter and clay the smallest at less than {{convert|0.002|mm}} in diameter.{{sfn|Soil Composition and Formation, SCDNR}}
Both sand and silt are mostly inert rock particles, including  [[quartz]], [[calcite]], [[feldspar]] and [[mica]].{{sfn|Shah|Shroff|2003|p=22}}

Clays typically are [[phyllosilicate]] minerals with a sheet-like structure.{{sfn|Soil Composition and Formation, SCDNR}}
The very small clay particles interact with each other physically and chemically. 
Even a small proportion of clay affects the physical properties of the soil much more than might be expected.{{sfn|Shah|Shroff|2003|p=22}}
Clays such as [[kaolinite]] do not expand or contract when wetted or dried, and are useful for brick-making. 
Others, such as [[smectite]]s, expand or contract considerably when wet or dry, and are not suitable for building.{{sfn|Soil Composition and Formation, SCDNR}}

[[Loam]] is a mix of sand, silt and clay in which none predominates. 
Soils are given different names depending on the relative proportions of sand, silt and clay such as "Silt Loam", "Clay Loam" and "Silty Clay".{{sfn|Ball|Norton|2002|p=219}}
Loam construction, the subject of this article, referred to as adobe construction when it uses unfired clay bricks, is an ancient building technology. It was used in the early civilizations of the [[Mediterranean]], [[Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]], in the [[Indus]], [[Ganges]] and [[Yellow River|Yellow]] river valleys, in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. 
As of 2005 about 1.5 billion people lived in houses built of loam.{{sfn|Koch|Koch|Seidl|2005|p=1}}{{efn|One source estimates that as many as three billion people live in earth buildings.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=9}} }}

In recent years, interest in loam construction has revived in the developed world. It is seen as a way to minimize use of fossil fuels and pollution, particularly carbon dioxide, during manufacture, and to create a comfortable living environment through the high mass and high absorption of the material.{{sfn|Koch|Koch|Seidl|2005|p=2}}
The two main technologies are stamped or rammed earth, clay or loam, called ''pise de terre'' in French, and [[adobe]], typically using sun-dried bricks made of a mud and straw mixture.{{sfn|Koch|Koch|Seidl|2005|p=2}}{{efn|The word "adobe" is derived from the ancient Egyptian "tob", meaning "brick". The Arabs adopted the word as "at-tub" or "attuba", and the Spanish made this "adobe".{{sfn|Koch|Koch|Seidl|2005|p=2}} }}

[[File:Mud houses are commonly found in various regions of Afghanistan..jpg|thumb|Mud houses in [[Kandahar]], Afghanistan]]
Earth usually requires some sort of processing for use in construction. It may be combined with water to make [[mud]], straw may be added, some form of stabilizing material such as lime or cement may be used to harden the earth, and the earth may be compacted to increase strength.{{Sfn|Watson|1993|p=290}}

===Mud===

Coursed mud construction is one of the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter mud and allowed to dry.{{sfn|Cornerstones Community Partnerships|2006|p=72}}
In Iran, puddled mud walls are called ''chine'' construction. Each course is about {{convert|18|to|24|in}} thick, and about {{convert|18|to|24|in}} high. Typically the technique is used for garden walls but not for house construction, presumably because of concern about the strength of walls made in this way.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=110}}
A drawback to the approach is that a lot of time can be spent waiting for each course to dry.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=4}}
Another technique, used in areas where wood is plentiful, is to build a wood frame house and to infill it with mud, primarily to provide insulation. In parts of England a similar technique was used with cob.{{sfn|Cornerstones Community Partnerships|2006|p=72}}

===Cob===
[[File:Cob wall in Harwell - geograph.org.uk - 1483279.jpg|thumb|Cob wall in [[Harwell, Oxfordshire]], England, hundreds of years old, thatched to protect it from water]]
[[Cob (material)|Cob]], sometimes referred to as "monolithic adobe",{{sfn|ICAEN|2004|p=114}} is a [[natural building]] material made from soil that includes clay, sand or small stones and an organic material such as [[straw]]. Cob walls are usually built up in courses, have no mortar joints and need 30% or more clay in the soil. Cob can be used as in-fill in post-and-beam buildings, but is often used for load bearing walls, and can bear up to two stories.  A cob wall should be at least {{convert|16|in}} thick, and the ratio of width to height should be no more than one to ten.{{sfn|ICAEN|2004|p=114}} It will typically be plastered inside and out with a mix of lime, soil and sand. Cob is fireproof, and its thermal mass helps stabilize indoor temperatures.{{sfn|ICAEN|2004|p=114}} 
Tests have shown that cob has some resistance to seismic activity. However, building codes in the developed world may not recognize cob as an approved material.{{sfn|Goodnow|2007}}

===Sod or turf===
[[File:Sod House Detail (4245555122).jpg|thumb|Sod bricks in a house wall]]
Cut [[sod]] bricks, called ''terrone'' in Spanish, can be used to make tough and durable walls. The sod is cut from soil that has a heavy mat of grass roots, which may be found in river bottom lands. It is stood on edge to dry before being used in construction.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=4}}
European settlers on the North American Prairies found that the sod least likely to deteriorate due to freezing or rain came from dried sloughs.{{sfn|Rollings-Magnusson|2012|p=28}} Turf was once extensively used for the walls of houses in Ireland, Scotland and Iceland, where some turf houses may still be found. A turf house may last fifty years or longer if well-maintained in a cold climate.{{sfn|Berge|2009|p=232}}
The Icelanders find that the best quality turf is the ''Strengur'', the top {{convert|5|cm}} of the grass turf.{{sfn|Berge|2009|p=233}}

===Stabilized earth===

Clay is usually hard and strong when dry, but becomes very soft when it absorbs water. The dry clay helps hold an earth wall together, but if the wall is directly exposed to rain, or to water leaking down from the roof, it may become saturated and collapse.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=4}}
Earth may be "stabilized" to make it more weather resistant. The practice of stabilizing earth by adding burnt lime is centuries old.{{sfn|Teter|Liu|Kent|1964|p=1}}
[[Portland cement]] or [[bitumen]] may also be added to earth intended for construction which adds strength, although the stabilized earth is not as strong as fired clay or concrete.{{sfn|Teter|Liu|Kent|1964|p=1}} Mixtures of cement and lime, or [[pozzolana]] and lime, may also be used for stabilization.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=5}}

Preferably the sand content of the soil will be 65% – 75%. Soils with low clay content, or with no more than 15% non-expansive clay, are suitable for stabilized earth.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=6}} The clay percentage may be reduced by adding sand, if available.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=8}}
If there is more than 15% clay it may take more than 10% cement to stabilize the soil, which adds to the cost.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=6}}
If earth contains little clay and holds 10% or more cement, it is in effect concrete.
Cement is not particularly environmentally friendly, since the manufacturing process generates large amounts of carbon dioxide.{{sfn|Keable|2012}}
Low-density stabilized earth will be porous and weak. The earth must therefore be compacted either by a machine that makes blocks or within the wall using the "rammed earth" technique.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=5}}

===Rammed earth===
[[File:Alte Schule Bonbaden 1.jpg|thumb|Old school built of rammed earth in 1836–37 in [[Bonbaden]], Hesse, Germany ]]
Rammed earth is a technique for building walls using natural raw materials such as earth, [[chalk]], [[Lime (material)|lime]] or [[gravel]].
A rammed earth wall is built by placing damp soil in a temporary form. The soil is manually or mechanically compacted and then the form is removed.{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1966}}
Rammed earth is generally made without much water, and so does not need much time to dry as the building rises. It is susceptible to moisture, so must be laid on a course that stops rising dampness, must be roofed or covered to keep out water from above, and may need protection through some sort of plaster, paint or sheathing.{{sfn|Keable|2012}}

In China, rammed earth walls were built by the [[Longshan culture|Longshan people]] in 2600–1900 BC, during the period when cities first appeared in the region. Thick sloping walls made of rammed earth became a characteristic of traditional Buddhist monasteries throughout the Himalayas and became very common in northern Indian areas such as [[Sikkim]].{{sfn|Outlook|2008|p=38}} The technique spread to the Middle East, and to North Africa, and the city of [[Carthage]] was built of rammed earth. From there the technology was brought to Europe by the Romans.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=17}}
Rammed earth structures may be long lasting. Most of the [[Great Wall of China]] was made from rammed earth, as was the [[Alhambra]] in the [[Kingdom of Granada]]. In Northern Europe there are rammed earth buildings up to seven stories high and two hundred years old.{{sfn|Keable|2012}}

===Concrete===

The Romans made durable concrete strong enough for load-bearing walls.{{sfn|Snell|2004|pp=27-28}} Roman concrete contains a rubble of broken bricks and rocks set in mortar. The mortar included lime and ''pozzolana'', a volcanic material that contributed significantly to its strength.{{sfn|Lancaster|2005|p=3}} Roman concrete structures such as the [[Colosseum]], completed in 80 AD, still stand.{{sfn|Snell|2004|p=28}}
Their longevity may be explained by the fact that the builders used a relatively dry mix of mortar and aggregate and compacted it by pounding it down to eliminate air pockets.{{sfn|Snell|2004|p=29}} Although derived from earth products, concrete structures would not usually be considered earth structures.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=9}}

==Building units==

===Mud brick or adobe brick===
[[File:Milyanfan-adobe-bricks-8038.jpg|thumb|Adobe bricks near a construction site in [[Milyanfan]], Kyrgyzstan]]
[[File:Working mudbrick press 5.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Making mudbricks near [[Cooktown, Australia]]]]
{{Main|Mudbrick|Adobe}}
Mudbricks or Adobe bricks are preformed modular masonry units of sun-dried mud that were invented at different times in different parts of the world as civilization developed.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=3}} Construction with bricks avoids the delays while each course of puddled mud dries. Wall murals show that adobe production techniques were highly advanced in Egypt by 2500 BC.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=4}} 
Adobe construction is common throughout much of Africa today.{{Sfn|Elleh|1998|p=47}} 
Adobe bricks are traditionally made from sand and clay mixed with water to a plastic consistency, with straw or grass as a binder.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=49}}{{efn|The straw and grass in adobe does not make the brick any stronger in the long term, but helps ensure that the bricks shrink uniformly as they dry.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=49}} }}
The mud is prepared, placed in wooden forms, tamped and leveled, and then turned out of the mold to dry for several days. 
The bricks are then stood on end to air-cure for a month or more.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=49}}

In the southwest United States and Mexico adobe buildings had massive walls and were rarely more than two stories high. 
Adobe mission churches were never more than about {{convert|35|ft}}.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=50}}
Since adobe surfaces are fragile, coatings are used to protect them. 
These coatings, periodically renewed, have included mud plaster, lime plaster, whitewash{{efn|Whitewash, made of ground [[gypsum]] mixed with water and clay, has been used to protect earth walls since ancient times.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=51}} }} or stucco.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=51}}
Adobe walls were historically made by laying the bricks with mud mortar, which swells and shrinks at the same rate as the bricks when wetted or dried, heated or cooled. Modern adobe may be stabilized with cement and bonded with cement mortars, but cement mortars will cause unstabilized adobe bricks to deteriorate due to the different rates of thermal expansion and contraction.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=50}}

===Compressed earth block===
[[File:Cebhomes.jpg|thumb|[[Compressed earth block]] housing being built in [[Midland, Texas]] in 2006]]
[[Compressed earth block]]s (CEB) were traditionally made by using a stick to ram soil into a wooden mold. Today they are usually made from subsoil compressed in a hand-operated or powered machine. In the developing world, manual machines can be a cost-effective solution for making uniform building blocks, while the more complex and expensive motorized machines are less likely to be appropriate. 
Although labor-intensive, CEB construction avoids the cost of buying and transporting materials.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=138}}
Block-making machines may form blocks that have interlocking shapes to reduce the requirement for mortar.
The block may have holes or grooves so rods such as bamboo can be inserted to improve earthquake resistance.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=139}}

Suitable earth must be used, with enough clay to hold the block together and resist erosion, but not too much expansive clay.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=140}}
When the block has been made from stabilized earth, which contains cement, the concrete must be given perhaps three weeks to cure.
During this time the blocks should be stacked and kept from drying out by sprinkling water over them. 
This may be a problem in hot, dry climates where water is scarce.
Closely stacking the blocks and covering them with a polythene sheet may help reduce water loss.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=24}}

===Earthbags===

[[Earthbag construction]] is a [[natural building]] technique that has evolved from historic military construction techniques for [[bunker]]s.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=149}}
Local subsoil of almost any composition can be used, although an adobe mix would be preferable.
The soil is moistened so it will compact into a stable structure when packed into woven polypropylene or burlap sacks or tubes. Plastic mesh is sometimes used. Polypropylene (pp) sacks are most common, since they are durable when covered, cheap, and widely available.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=149}}
The bags are laid in courses, with barbed wire between each course to prevent slipping. Each course is tamped after it is laid.{{sfn|Calkins|2008|p=162}}
The structure in pp bags is similar to adobe but more flexible. With mesh tubing the structure is like rammed earth.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=149}}
Earthbags may be used to make dome-shaped or vertical wall buildings. With soil stabilization they may also be used for retaining walls.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=152}}

===Fired clay brick===
[[File:English Bond - geograph.org.uk - 702506.jpg|thumb|English bond bricks from 1454 at the Old College in [[Tattershall]], Lincolnshire, England]]
The technique of firing clay [[brick]]s in a kiln dates to about 3500 BC. 
Fired bricks were being used to build durable masonry across Europe, Asia and North Africa by 1200 BC and still remain an important building material.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=163}} Modern fired clay bricks are formed from clays or shales, shaped and then fired in a kiln for 8–12 hours at a temperature of 900–1150&amp;nbsp;°C.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=164}}{{efn|Yellow [[Dutch brick]]s were made from clay or mud dredged from the [[IJssel]] and other rivers, which was molded and burned in peat-fired kilns for three or four weeks. The bricks were then given about three weeks to cool before being removed.{{sfn|Manufacture of Brick – Yellow Dutch Brick 1840|p=290}} 
Modern processes use higher temperatures and much shorter firing times.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=164}} }}
The result is a [[ceramic]] that is mainly composed of silica and alumina, with other ingredients such as quartz sand. The porosity of the brick depends on the materials and on the firing temperature and duration. The bricks may vary in color depending on the amount of iron and calcium carbonate in the materials used, and the amount of oxygen in the kiln.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=164}}
Bricks may decay due to crystallization of salts on the brick or in its pores, from frost action and from acidic gases.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=166}}

Bricks are laid in courses bonded with mortar, a combination of Portland cement, lime and sand.{{sfn|Kreh|1997|p=72}}
A wall that is two bricks thick will include stretcher bricks with their long, narrow side exposed and header bricks crossing from side to side. 
There are various [[brickwork]] "bonds", or patterns of stretchers and headers, including the English, Dutch and Flemish bonds.{{sfn|Lloyd|1929|p=81}}

==Examples==

===Earth sheltering===
[[File:Iceland Keldur Earth covered homes.JPG|thumb|[[Icelandic turf house|Turf houses]] in [[Keldur]], [[Iceland]], an example of [[Earth sheltering]]]]
[[Earth sheltering]] has been used for thousands of years to make energy-efficient dwellings.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=3}}
There are various configurations. At one extreme, an earth sheltered dwelling is completely underground, with perhaps an open courtyard to provide air and light. 
An [[earth house]] may be set into a slope, with windows or door openings in one or more of its sides, or the building may be on ground level, but with earth mounded against the walls, and perhaps with an earth roof.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=8}}

Pit houses made by [[Hohokam]] farmers between 100 and 900 AD, in what is now the southwest of the US, were bermed structures, partially embedded in south-facing slopes. Their successful design was used for hundreds of years.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=2}}
At [[Matmata, Tunisia]], most of the ancient homes were built {{convert|12|m}} below ground level, and surrounded courtyards about {{convert|12|m}} square.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=4}}{{efn|The opening scenes of ''[[Star Wars]]'' were shot in the Hotel Sidi Driss in [[Matmata, Tunisia]], an earth sheltered dwelling around a deeply sunken courtyard.{{sfn|Robb|2012|p=33}} }}
The homes were reached through tunnels. Other examples of subterranean, semi-subterranean or cliff-based dwellings in both hot and cold climates are found in Turkey, northern China and the Himalayas, and the southwest USA.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=4}} A number of Buddhist monasteries built from earth and other materials into cliff sides or caves in Himalayan areas such as [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]] and northern India are often perilously placed. Starting in the 1970s, interest in the technique has revived in developed countries.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=3}} By setting an earth house into the ground, the house will be cooler in the warm season and warmer in the cool season.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=8}}

===Native American earth lodge===

An [[earth lodge]] is a circular building made by some of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of North America. 
They have wood post and beam construction and are dome-shaped.{{sfn|Earth Lodge, Random House}}
A typical structure would have four or more central posts planted in the ground and connected at the top by cross beams. The smoke hole would be left open in the center. Around the central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts, also connected by cross beams. Rafters radiated from the central cross beams to the outside cross beams, and then split planks or beams formed the slanting or vertical side walls.{{sfn|Nabokov|1989|p=126}}
The structure was covered by sticks and brush or grass, covered in turn by a heavy layer of earth or [[sod]].
Some groups plastered the whole structure with mud, which dried to form a shell.{{sfn|Nabokov|1989|p=126}}
[[File:School in a Maasai village on the A109 road, Kenya.jpg|thumb|School in a [[Maasai people|Maasai]] village on the A109 road, Kenya]]

===Wattle and daub===
[[Wattle and daub]] is an old building technique in which vines or smaller sticks are interwoven between upright poles, and then mud mixed with straw and grass is plastered over the wall.{{sfn|Young|Fowler|2000|p=46}}
The technique is found around the world, from the Nile Delta to Japan, where bamboo was used to make the wattle.{{sfn|Racusin|McArleton|2012|p=252}}
In [[Cahokia]], now in Illinois, USA, wattle and daub houses were built with the floor lowered by {{convert|1|to|3|ft}} below the ground. 
A variant of the technique is called ''bajareque'' in [[Colombia]].{{sfn|Young|Fowler|2000|p=46}}
In prehistoric Britain simple circular wattle and daub shelters were built wherever adequate clay was available.{{sfn|Sunshine|2006|p=5}}
Wattle and daub is still found as the panels in timber-framed buildings.{{sfn|Sunshine|2006|p=Back cover}} Generally the walls are not structural, and in interior use the technique in the developed world was replaced by lath and plaster, and then by [[gypsum wallboard]].{{sfn|Racusin|McArleton|2012|p=252}}

===Prairie sod house===
[[File:Omer Kem's sod house.jpg|thumb|[[Omer Madison Kem]], (later, Representative to the United States Congress) in front of his sod house in Nebraska (1886)]]
European pioneer farmers in the prairies of North America, where there is no wood for construction, often made their first home in a dug-out cave in the side of a hill or ravine, with a covering over the entrance. When they had time, they would build a [[sod house]]. The farmer would use a plow to cut the sod into bricks {{convert|1|by|2|ft}}, which were then piled up to form the walls.{{sfn|White|1991|p=228}}
The sod strips were piled grass-side down, staggered in the same way as brickwork, in three side-by-side rows, resulting in a wall over {{convert|3|ft}} thick. The sod wall was built around door and window frames, and the corners of the wall were secured by rods driven vertically through them. The roof was made with poles or brush, covered with prairie grass, and then sealed with a layer of sod.{{sfn|Porterfield|2004|p=39}}
Sod houses were strong and often lasted many years, but they were damp and dirty unless the interior walls were plastered.{{sfn|White|1991|p=228}}
The roofs tended to leak, and sometimes collapsed in a rainstorm.{{sfn|Porterfield|2004|p=39}}

===Mud brick buildings===

There are innumerable examples of mud brick or adobe building around the world. The walled city of [[Shibam]] in Yemen, designated a World Heritage Site in 1982, is known fr its ten-story unreinforced mud-brick buildings.{{sfn|Jerome|2006|p=144}}
The [[Djinguereber Mosque]] of [[Timbuktu]], Mali, was first built at the start of the 14th century AD (8th century AH) from round mud bricks and a stone-mud misture, and was rebuilt several times afterwards, steadily growing in size.{{sfn|Sliwoski|2007|p=70}}
Further south in Mali, the [[Great Mosque of Djenné|Great Mosque]] of [[Djenné]], a dramatic example of Sahel mudbrick architecture. was built in 1907, based on the design of an earlier Great Mosque first built on the site in 1280. Mudbrick requires maintenance, and the fundamentalist ruler [[Seku Amadu]] had let the previous mosque collapse.{{sfn|Ham|2009|p=498}}

The [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruins]], now a national monument in Arizona protected by a modern roof, is a massive four-story adobe structure built by Hohokam people between 1200 and 1450 AD.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=13}}
The first European to record the great house was a Jesuit priest, Father [[Eusebio Kino]], who visited the site in 1694. 
At that time it had long been abandoned.{{sfn|Houk|1996|p=6}}
By the time a temporary roof was installed in 1903 the adobe building had been standing empty and unmaintained for hundreds of years.{{sfn|Houk|1996|p=9}}

[[Huaca de la Luna]] in what is now northern Peru is a large adobe temple built by the [[Moche culture|Moche people]]. The building went through a series of construction phases, growing eventually to a height of about {{convert|32|m}}, with three main platforms, four plazas and many smaller rooms and enclosures. The walls were covered by striking multi-colored murals and friezes; those visible today date from about 400–610 AD.{{sfn|Jackson|2008|p=22}}

===Toulous===
[[File:Snail pit tulou.jpg|thumb|[[Tianluokeng Tulou cluster]] in [[Fujian]] province, China]]
A [[Fujian Tulou]] is a type of rural dwelling of the [[Hakka people]] in the mountainous areas in southeastern [[Fujian]], China.{{sfn|Needham|1971|pp=133–134}}
They were mostly built between the 13th and the 20th centuries.{{sfn|Fujian Tulou, UNESCO}} 
A tulou is a large, enclosed and fortified earth building, rectangular or circular, with very thick load-bearing [[rammed earth]] walls between three and five stories high.
A toulou might house up to 80 families. Smaller interior buildings are often enclosed by these huge peripheral walls which can contain halls, storehouses, wells and living areas.
The structure resembles a small fortified city.{{sfn|Earthen Houses (Tulou), Fujian Province}}
The walls are formed by compacting earth mixed with stone, bamboo, wood and other readily available materials, and are to {{convert|6|ft}} thick. 
The result is a well-lit, well-ventilated, windproof and earthquake-proof building that is warm in winter and cool in summer.{{sfn|Earthen Houses (Tulou), Fujian Province}}

===Mounds and pyramids===
[[File:Ancient ziggurat at Ali Air Base Iraq 2005.jpg|thumb|Ziggurat at [[Ali Air Base]] in Iraq]]
[[Ziggurat]]s were elevated temples constructed by the [[Sumer]]ians between the end of the 4th millennium BC and the 2nd millennium BC, rising in a series of terraces to a temple up to {{convert|200|ft}} above ground level. The [[Ziggurat of Ur]] contained about three million bricks, none more than {{convert|15|in}} in length, so construction would have been a huge project.{{sfn|Forrest|1969|p=6}}
The largest ziggurat was in Babylon, and is thought by some to be the [[Tower of Babel]] mentioned in the [[Bible]]. It was destroyed by [[Alexander the Great]] and only the foundations remain, but originally it stood {{convert|300|ft}} high on a base about {{convert|660|ft}} square.{{sfn|Faiella|2005|p=17}}
Sun-dried bricks were used for the interior and kiln-fired bricks for the facing. 
The bricks were held together by clay or bitumen.{{sfn|Faiella|2005|p=18}}

Many pre-Columbian Native American societies of ancient North America built large [[pyramid]]al earth structures known as [[platform mound]]s. Among the largest and best-known of these structures is [[Monks Mound]] at the site of [[Cahokia]] in what became Illinois, completed around 1100 AD, which has a base larger than that of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Many of the mounds underwent multiple episodes of mound construction at periodic intervals, some becoming quite large. They are believed to have played a central role in the mound-building peoples' religious life and documented uses include semi-public [[Tribal chief|chief]]'s house platforms, public [[temple]] platforms, [[mortuary]] platforms, [[charnel house]] platforms, [[earth lodge]]/town house platforms, residence platforms, square ground and rotunda platforms, and dance platforms.{{sfn|Lindauer|Blitz|1997|p=169ff}}{{sfn|Fogelson|2004|p=741}}

The {{convert|207|ft}} [[Pyramid of the Sun]] in [[Teotihuacan]], Mexico, was started in 100 AD. 
The stone-faced structure contains two million tons of rammed earth.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=17}}

===Earthworks===
[[File:Retaining wall, Ramsden Wood Road - geograph.org.uk - 1268429.jpg|thumb|Retaining wall near [[Todmorden]], West Yorkshire, England]]
[[Earthworks (engineering)|Earthworks]] are engineering works created through moving or processing quantities of soil or unformed rock. 
The material may be moved to another location and formed into a desired shape for a purpose.{{sfn|Merritt|Loftin|Ricketts|1995|p=13.1}}
[[Levee]]s, embankments and dams are types of earthwork.
A levee, floodbank or stopbank is an elongated natural ridge or artificially constructed [[fill dirt|dirt fill]] wall that regulates water levels. It is usually earthen and often runs parallel to the course of a river in its [[floodplain]] or along low-lying coastlines.{{sfn|Petroski|2006|pp=7–11}}

[[Mechanically stabilized earth]] (MSE) retaining walls may be used for embankments.{{sfn|Alfaro|Balasubramaniam|Bergado|Chai|1994|p=131}}
MSE walls combine a concrete leveling pad, wall facing panels, coping, soil reinforcement and select backfill.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=3}}
A variety of designs of wall facing panels may be used.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=3}}
After the leveling pad has been laid and the first row of panels has been placed and braced, the first layer of earth backfill is brought in behind the wall and compacted.
The first set of reinforcements is then laid over the earth.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=15}}
The reinforcements, which may be tensioned polymer or galvanized metal strips or grids, are attached to the facing panels.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=2}}
This process is repeated with successive layers of panels, earth and reinforcements.
The panels are thus tied into the earth embankment to make a stable structure with balanced stresses.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=16-17}}

Although construction using the basic principles of MSE has a long history, MSE was developed in its current form in the 1960s. The reinforcing elements used can vary but include [[steel]] and [[geosynthetic]]s. The term MSE is usually used in the US to distinguish it from "Reinforced Earth", a trade name of the Reinforced Earth Company, but elsewhere Reinforced Soil is the generally accepted term.{{sfn|Alfaro|Balasubramaniam|Bergado|Chai|1994|p=131}} MSE construction is relatively fast and inexpensive, and although labor-intensive, it does not demand high levels of skill. It is therefore suitable for developing as well as developed countries.{{sfn|Alfaro|Balasubramaniam|Bergado|Chai|1994|p=132-133}}

===Forts and trenches===
[[File:Soldiers in trench.jpg|thumb|Soldiers in a trench on [[Gallipoli]] during World War I]]
Earth has been used to construct fortifications for thousands of years, including strongholds and walls, often protected by ditches.
Aerial photography in Europe has revealed traces of earth fortifications from the Roman era, and later medieval times.{{sfn|Bourgeois|Meganck|2005|p=323}}
[[Offa's Dyke]] is a huge earthwork that stretches along the disputed border between England and Wales.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=31}}
Little is known about the period or the builder, King [[Offa of Mercia]], who died in 796 AD.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=32}}
An early timber and earth fortification might later be succeeded by a brick or stone structure on the same site.{{sfn|Pluskowski|2013|p=118}}

Trenches were used by besieging forces to approach a fortification while protected from missiles.
Sappers would build "saps", or trenches, that zig-zagged towards the fortress being attacked.
They piled the excavated dirt to make a protective wall or gabion. The combined trench depth and gabion height might be {{convert|8|to|10|ft}}. 
Sometimes the sap was a tunnel, dug several feet below the surface. Sappers were highly skilled and highly paid due to the extreme danger of their work.{{sfn|Nolan|2008|p=417}}

In the [[American Civil War]] (1861−1865) trenches were used for defensive positions throughout the struggle, but played an increasingly important role in the campaigns of the last two years.{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=xiv}}
Military earthworks perhaps culminated in the vast network of trenches built during [[World War I]] (1914−1918) that stretched from [[Switzerland]] to the [[North Sea]] by the end of 1914.{{sfn|Hamilton|2010|p=6}}
The two lines of trenches faced each other, manned by soldiers living in appalling conditions of cold, damp and filth.{{sfn|Hamilton|2010|p=7}}
Conditions were worst in the Allied trenches. The Germans were more willing to accept the trenches as long-term positions, and used concrete blocks to build secure shelters deep underground, often with electrical lighting and heating.{{sfn|Horne|2011|p=214}}

===Embankment dams===
[[Image:MicaDam.JPG|thumb|The [[Mica Dam]] in [[Canada]]]]
An [[embankment dam]] is a massive artificial [[dam|water barrier]]. It is typically created by the emplacement and [[soil compaction|compaction]] of a complex semi-[[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]] mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such a dam impervious to surface or [[Seepage#Permeability and seepage|seepage]] [[erosion]].{{sfn|Dam Basics, PBS}}
The force of the impoundment creates a downward thrust upon the mass of the dam, greatly increasing the weight of the dam on its foundation. This added force effectively seals and makes waterproof the underlying foundation of the dam, at the interface between the dam and its [[stream bed]].{{sfn|Embankment dam: forces, PBS}} 
Such a dam is composed of fragmented independent material particles. 
The friction and interaction of particles binds the particles together into a stable mass rather than by the use of a cementing substance.{{sfn|Graham|1997}}

The [[Syncrude Tailings Dam|Syncrude Mildred Lake Tailings Dyke]] in [[Alberta]], Canada, is an embankment dam about {{convert|18|km}} long and from {{convert|40|to|88|m}} high. By volume of fill, as of 2001 it was believed to be the largest earth structure in the world.{{sfn|Morgenstern|2001|p=58}}

==Structural Issues==
===Designing for Earthquakes===
Regions with low seismic risk are safe for most earth buildings, but historic construction techniques often cannot resist even medium earthquake levels effectively because of earthen buildings' three highly undesirable qualities as a seismic building material: being relatively 'weak, heavy and brittle'. However, earthen buildings can be built to resist seismic loads.&lt;ref&gt;King, Bruce (2008) The Renaissance of Earthen Architecture: A fresh and updated look at clay-based construction&lt;/ref&gt;

Key factors to improved seismic performance are soil strength, construction quality, robust layout and seismic reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Langenbach, Randolph (2005) Collapse from the Inside Out. SismoAdobe 2005, Catholic University of Peru&lt;/ref&gt;

Stronger soils make stronger walls. Adobe builders can test cured blocks for strength by dropping from a specific height or by breaking them with a lever.&lt;ref&gt;Standards New Zealand (1998) 4298:1998 [http://studylib.net/doc/18328751/nzs-4298--materials-and-workmanship-for-earth-buildings Materials and Workmanship for Earth Buildings] pp. 64-65, 67-68&lt;/ref&gt; Builders using immediate techniques like earthbag, cob, or rammed earth may prefer approximate crushing tests on smaller samples that can be oven-dried and crushed under a small lever.&lt;ref&gt;Stouter, Patti (2017) Field Tests for Strength of Building Soils, Build Simple Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Builders must understand construction processes and be able to produce consistent quality for strong buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Smart Shelter Foundation [http://www.smartshelterfoundation.org/smart-shelter-techniques/21-improving-building-quality/ Improving the Overall Construction Quality] (website)&lt;/ref&gt;

Robust layout means buildings more square than elongated, and symmetrical not L-shaped,&lt;ref&gt;Totten,
 Craig (ed.) (2010) [http://aidg.org/documents/CM-Handout%20MASTER%20v3%20English.pdf Confined Masonry Workshop Handbook], 3rd edition, AIDG AWB and Haiti Rewired&lt;/ref&gt; as well as no 'soft' first stories (stories with large windows, buildings on unbraced columns). New Zealand's earthen building guidelines check for enough bracing wall length in each of the two principal directions, based on wall thickness, story height, bracing wall spacing, and the roof, loft and second story weight above earthen walls.&lt;ref&gt;Standards New Zealand (1998) [http://www.eastue.org/project/linea-adobe/norme/NZD4299-1998-Earth_Buildings_Not_Requiring_Specific_Design.pdf 4299:1998 Earth Buildings Not Requiring Specific Design]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seismic-Resistant Construction Techniques===
Building techniques that are more ductile than brittle, like the [[contained earth]] type of earthbag, or tire walls of [[earthships]], may better avoid collapse than brittle unreinforced earth. Contained gravel base courses may add [[base isolation]] potential.

Wall containment can be added to techniques like adobe to resist loss of material that leads to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Blondet, Marcial, G. Villa Garcia M., S. Brzev and A. Rubinos (2011) [http://www.world-housing.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Adobe_Tutorial.pdf Earthquake Resistant Construction of Adobe Buildings: A Tutorial] Earthquake Engineering Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Confined masonry is effective for adobe against quake forces of 0.3 g&lt;ref&gt;San Bartolome, A., E. Delgado and D. Quiun (2009) Seismic Behavior of a Two Story Model of Confined Adobe Masonry. 11th Canadian Masonry Symposium, Toronto, Ontario, May 31- June 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez,
 Mario (undated) [http://www.world-housing.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Confined-Masonry_Rodriguez.pdf Confined Masonry Construction] Earthquake Engineering Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; may be useful with earthen masonry.

Many types of reinforcement can increase wall strength, such as plastic or wire mesh and reinforcing rods of steel or fiberglass or bamboo. Earth resists compression well but is weak when twisted. Tensile reinforcement must span potential damage points and be well-anchored to increase out-of-plane stability. Bond beams at wall tops are vital and must be well attached to walls.&lt;ref&gt;King, Bruce. (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Builders should be aware that organic reinforcements embedded in walls may be destroyed before the building is retired. Attachment details of reinforcement are critical to resist higher forces. Best adobe shear strength came from horizontal reinforcement attached directly to vertical rebar spanning from footing to bond beam.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Hugh (1993) The Strength of Engineered Earth Buildings. Ipenz Annual Conference 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Interlaced wood in earthen walls reduces quake damage if wood is not damaged by dry rot or insects. Timberlacing includes finely webbed Dhajji,&lt;ref&gt;Schacher, Tom and Q. Ali (2009) [http://www.world-housing.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Dhajji_English.pdf Dhajji Construction for One and Two Story Earthquake Resistant Houses], United Nations Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt; and other types.&lt;ref&gt;Langenbach, Rudolph [https://www.conservationtech.com/RL%27s%20resume&amp;%20pub%27s/RL-publications/Eq-pubs/2010-Kingdom-Of-Bhutan/Langenbach-BHUTAN.pdf Earthquake Resistant Traditional Construction is not an Oxymoron] Bhutan International Conference on Disaster Management and Cultural Heritage, 12–14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy monitoring and targeting''' (M&amp;T) is an energy efficiency technique based on the standard [[management]] axiom stating that “you cannot manage what you cannot measure”. M&amp;T techniques provide [[Energy engineering|energy manager]]s with feedback on operating practices, results of energy management projects, and guidance on the level of energy use that is expected in a certain period. Importantly, they also give early warning of unexpected excess consumption caused by equipment malfunctions, operator error, unwanted user behaviours, lack of effective maintenance and the like.

The foundation of M&amp;T lies in determining the normal relationships of energy consumptions to relevant driving factors (HVAC equipment, production though puts, weather, occupancy available daylight, etc.) and the goal is to help business managers:

* Identify and explain excessive energy use
* Detect instances when consumption is unexpectedly higher or lower than would usually have been the case
* Visualize energy consumption trends (daily, weekly, seasonal, operational…)
* Determine future energy use and costs when planning changes in the business
* Diagnose specific areas of wasted energy
* Observe how changes to relevant driving factors impact energy efficiency
* Develop performance targets for energy management programs
* Manage energy consumption, rather than accept it as a fixed cost

The ultimate goal is to reduce energy costs through improved [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and energy management control. Other benefits generally include increased resource efficiency, improved [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] budgeting and reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions.

==History==
M&amp;T is an established technique that was first launched as a national program in the [[UK]] in 1980, and has since then spread throughout Europe. These techniques are now{{When|date=July 2014}} also rapidly growing in America.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Goals and benefits==
Throughout the numerous M&amp;T projects implemented since the 1980s, a certain number of benefits have proved to be recurrent:
* Energy cost savings: generally 5% of the original energy expenses, according to [[The Carbon Trust]]. Carbon Trust has conducted a study over 1000 [[Small Business|small businesses]] and has concluded that on average an organization could save 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced metering for SMEs |url=https://www.carbontrust.com/media/77244/ctc713_advanced_metering_for_smes.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209000820/https://www.carbontrust.com/media/77244/ctc713_advanced_metering_for_smes.pdf |archivedate=December 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduction in [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions: lower energy consumption helps reduce emissions
* Financing: measured energy reductions help obtain [[grant (money)|grants]] for energy efficiency projects
* Improved product and service costing: [[Utility submeter|sub-metering]] allows the division of the energy bill between the different processes of an [[industry]], and can be calculated as a [[production cost]]
* Improved [[budgeting]]: M&amp;T techniques can help forecast energy expenses in the case of changes in the business, for example
* Waste avoidance: helps diagnose energy waste in any process.

==Technique==

=== Key principles ===
Monitoring and Targeting techniques rely on three main principles, which form a constant [[feedback]] cycle, therefore improving control of energy use.

====Monitoring====
Monitoring [[information]] of energy use, in order to establish a basis for energy management and explain [[deviation (statistics)|deviations]] from an established pattern. Its primary goal is to maintain said pattern, by providing all the necessary data on energy consumption, as well as certain [[driving factors]], as identified during preliminary investigation ([[production, costs, and pricing|production]], weather, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodengineeringmag.com/articles/90655-energy-management-crunching-the-numbers|title=Energy management: crunching the numbers|last=Labs|first=Wayne|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Food Engineering Magazine|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reporting====
The final principle is the one which enables ongoing control of energy use, achievement of targets and verification of savings: reports must be issued to the appropriate managers. This in turn allows [[decision-making]] and actions to be taken in order to achieve the targets, as well as confirmation or denial that the targets have been reached.

===Procedures===
Before the M&amp;T measures themselves are implemented, a few preparatory steps are necessary. First of all, key energy consumers on the site must be identified. Generally, most of the energy consumption is concentrated in a small number of processes, like heating, or certain [[machinery]]. This normally requires a certain survey of the [[building]] and the equipment to estimate their energy consumption level.

It is also necessary to assess what other [[measurements]] will be required to [[analysis|analyze]] the consumption appropriately. This data will be used to [[chart]] against the energy consumption: these are underlying factors which influence the consumption, often [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] (for industry processes) or exterior [[temperature]] (for heating processes), but may include many other variables.

Once all variables to be measured have been established, and the necessary meters installed, it is possible to initiate the M&amp;T procedures.

====Measure====
The first step is to compile the data from the different meters.  Low-cost energy feedback displays have become available. The frequency at which the data is compiled varies according to the desired reporting interval, but can go once every 30 seconds to once every 15 minutes. Some measurements can be taken directly from the meters, others must be calculated. These different measurements are often called streams or channels.

Driving factors such as production or [[degree day]]s also constitute streams and must be collected at intervals to match.

====Define the base-line====
The data compiled must then be plotted on a [[chart|graph]] in order to define the general consumption base-line. Consumption rates are plotted in a [[scatter plot]] against [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] or any other variable previously identified, and the [[best fit line]] is identified. This graph is the image of the business’ average energy performance, and conveys a lot of information:

* The [[y-intercept]] gives the minimal consumption in the absence of the variable (no [[production, costs, and pricing|production]], zero [[degree-day]]...). This is the base load of the system, the minimal consumption when it is not operating.
* The [[slope]] represents the relationship between the consumption and the previously identified [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. This represents the efficiency of the process.
* The scatter is the degree of variability of the consumption with operational factors.
The [[slope]] is not used quite as often for M&amp;T purposes. However, a high [[y-intercept]] can mean that there is a fault in the process, causing it to use too much energy with no performance, unless there are specific distinctive features which lead to high base loads. Very scattered points, on the other hand, may reflect other significant factors playing in the variation of the energy consumption, other than the one plotted in the first place, but it can also be the illustration of a lack of control over the process.

====Monitor variations====
The next step is to monitor the difference between the expected consumption and the actual measured consumption. One of the tools most commonly used for this is the [[control chart|CUSUM]], which is the CUmulative SUM of differences. This consists in first calculating the difference between the expected and actual performances (the [[best fit line]] previously identified and the points themselves).

The [[CUSUM]] can then be plotted against time on a new [[chart|graph]], which then yields more information for the energy efficiency specialist. [[Variance]]s scattered around zero usually mean that the process is operating normally. Marked variations, increasing or decreasing steadily usually reflect a modification in the conditions of the process.

[[Image:CUSUM graph.jpg|right|Example of a CUSUM graph]]In the case of the [[control chart|CUSUM]] graph, the [[slope]] becomes very important, as it is the main indicator of the [[savings]] achieved. A [[slope]] going steadily down indicates steady [[savings]]. Any variation in the [[slope]] indicates a change in the process. For example, in the graph on the right, the first section indicated no [[savings]]. However, in September (beginning of the yellow line), an energy efficiency measure must have been implemented, as [[savings]] start to occur. The green line indicates an increase in the [[savings]] (as the [[slope]] is becoming steeper), whereas the red line must reflect a modification in the process having occurred in November, as [[savings]] have decreased slightly.

====Identify causes====
Energy efficiency specialists, in collaboration with building [[managers]], will decipher the [[control chart|CUSUM]] graph and identify the causes leading to variations in the consumption. This can be a change in [[behaviour]], a modification to the process, different exterior conditions, etc. These changes must be monitored and the causes identified in order to promote and enhance good behaviour, and discourage bad ones.

====Set targets====
Once the base line has been established, and causes for variations in energy consumption have been identified, it is time to set targets for the future. Now with all this information in hand, the targets are more realistic, as they are based on the building’s actual consumption.
Targeting consists in two main parts: the measure to which the consumption can be reduced, and the [[timeframe]] during which the compression will be achieved.

A good initial target is the [[best fit line]] identified during step 2. This line represents the [[average]] historical performance. Therefore, keeping all consumption below or equal to the historical average is an achievable target, yet remains a challenge as it involves eliminating high consumption peaks.

Some companies, as they improve their energy consumption, might even decide to bring their [[average]] performance down to their historical best. This is considered a much more challenging target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicenergy.com/live-energy-monitoring/building-energy-use/case-studies/|title=Building Energy Generation &amp; Usage|work=Case Studies|publisher=Logic Energy|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Monitor results====
This brings us back to step 1: measure consumption. One of the specificities of M&amp;T is that it is an ongoing process, requiring constant [[feedback]] in order to consistently improve performance. Once the targets are set and the desired measures are implemented, repeating the procedure from the start ensures that the managers are aware of the success or failure of the measures, and can then decide on further action.

===Examples===
An example with some features of an M&amp;T application is the [[ASU Campus Metabolism]], which provides real-time and historic energy use and generation data for facilities of [[Arizona State University]] on a public web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cm.asu.edu/|title=DGLux5 by DGLogik|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many utilities also offer customers electric interval data monitoring services. [[Xcel Energy]] is an example of an investor owned utility that offers its customer electric and natural gas monitoring services under the product name InfoWise from Xcel Energy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xcelenergy.com/infowise/|title=InfoWise from Xcel Energy - Xcel Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is administered by Power TakeOff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.PowerTakeOff.com|title=PowerTakeOff – EMIS Behavioral Programming|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a third party partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xcelenergy.com/infowise/|title=InfoWise from Xcel Energy - Xcel Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flight''' is the process by which an [[object (physics)|object]] [[Motion (physics)|moves]] through an [[atmosphere]] (or beyond it, as in the case of [[spaceflight]]) without contact with the surface. This can be achieved by generating [[Lift (force)|aerodynamic lift]] associated with [[Air propulsion|propulsive thrust]], [[Lighter than air|aerostatically]] using [[buoyancy]], or by [[ballistics|ballistic]] movement.

Many things can fly, from natural aviators such as [[bird]]s, [[bat]]s, and [[insect]]s, to human inventions like [[aircraft]], including [[airplane]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[balloon]]s, and [[rocket]]s which may carry [[spacecraft]].

The engineering aspects of flight are the purview of [[aerospace engineering]] which is subdivided into [[aeronautics]], the study of vehicles that travel through the air, and [[astronautics]], the study of vehicles that travel through space, and in [[ballistics]], the study of the flight of projectiles.

==Types of flight==
===Buoyant flight===

{{main article|Aerostat}}
[[File:Goodyear-blimp.jpg|thumb|An airship flies because the upward force, from air displacement, is equal to or greater than the force of gravity]]
Humans have managed to construct lighter than air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly, due to their [[buoyancy]] in air.

An '''aerostat''' is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of [[buoyancy]] to give an aircraft the same overall density as air. Aerostats include [[balloon (aircraft)|free balloons]], [[airship]]s, and [[moored balloon]]s. An aerostat's main structural component is its [[wikt:envelope|envelope]], a lightweight [[skin]] that encloses a volume of [[lifting gas]]&lt;ref&gt;Walker 2000, p. 541. Quote: the gas-bag of a balloon or airship.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulson-Thomas 1976, p. 281. Quote: fabric enclosing gas-bags of airship.&lt;/ref&gt; to provide [[buoyancy]], to which other components are attached.

Aerostats are so named because they use "aerostatic" lift, a [[buoyant]] force that does not require lateral movement through the surrounding air mass to effect a lifting force. By contrast, [[Aircraft#Heavier than air .E2.80.93 aerodynes|aerodynes]] primarily use [[aerodynamic]] [[lift (force)|lift]], which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the [[aircraft]] through the surrounding air mass.

===Aerodynamic flight===

====Unpowered flight versus powered flight====
{{main article| Unpowered flight}}
Some things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air, for example, the [[flying squirrel]]. This is termed [[gliding (flight)|gliding]]. Some other things can exploit rising air to climb such as [[Bird of prey|raptors]] (when gliding) and [[glider (sailplane)|man-made sailplane gliders]]. This is termed [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]]. However most other birds and all [[powered aircraft]] need a source of [[propulsion]] to climb. This is termed powered flight.

====Animal flight====

{{Main article|Flying and gliding animals}}

The only groups of [[Flying and gliding animals|living things that use powered flight]] are [[bird]]s, [[insect]]s, and [[bat]]s, while many groups have evolved gliding.

{{main article|Aviation}}

[[File:flight.rob.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|Mechanical flight: A [[Robinson R22]] Beta [[helicopter]]]]

'''Mechanical flight''' is the use of a [[machine]] to fly. These machines include [[aircraft]] such as [[airplane]]s, [[glider aircraft|gliders]], [[helicopter]]s, [[autogyro]]s, [[airship]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[ornithopters]] as well as [[spacecraft]]. [[glider aircraft|Gliders]] are capable of unpowered flight. Another form of mechanical flight is para-sailing where a parachute-like object is pulled by a boat. In an airplane, lift is created by the wings; the shape of the wings of the airplane are designed specially for the type of flight desired. There are different types of wings: tempered, semi-tempered, sweptback, rectangular and elliptical. An aircraft wing is sometimes called an [[airfoil]], which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it.

=====Supersonic=====
{{main article|Supersonic speed}}
Supersonic flight is flight faster than the [[speed of sound]]. Supersonic flight is associated with the formation of [[shock wave]]s that form a [[sonic boom]] that can be heard from the ground,&lt;ref&gt;Bern, Peter. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/3207470.stm "Concorde: You asked a pilot."] ''BBC'', October 23, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and is frequently startling. This shockwave takes quite a lot of energy to create and this makes supersonic flight generally less efficient than subsonic flight at about 85% of the speed of sound.

=====Hypersonic=====
{{main article|Hypersonic speed}}
Hypersonic flight is very high speed flight where the heat generated by the compression of the air due to the motion through the air causes chemical changes to the air. Hypersonic flight is achieved by reentering spacecraft such as the [[Space Shuttle]] and [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]].
[[File:ISS after STS-117 in June 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[International Space Station]] in earth [[orbit]]]]

===Ballistic===
{{main article|Ballistics}}

====Atmospheric====
Some things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum, gravity, air drag and in some cases thrust. This is termed ''ballistic flight''. Examples include [[ball]]s, [[archery|arrows]], [[bullet]]s, [[firework]]s etc.

====Spaceflight====
{{main article|Spaceflight}}
Essentially an extreme form of ballistic flight, '''spaceflight''' is the use of [[space technology]] to achieve the flight of [[spacecraft]] into and through [[outer space]]. Examples include [[ballistic missile]]s, [[orbital spaceflight]] etc.

Spaceflight is used in [[space exploration]], and also in commercial activities like [[space tourism]] and [[telecommunications satellite|satellite telecommunications]]. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include [[Space observatory|space observatories]], [[reconnaissance satellite]]s and other [[earth observation satellite]]s.

A spaceflight typically begins with a [[rocket]] [[rocket launch|launch]], which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of [[gravity]] and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=kjVGAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=A+spaceflight+typically+begins+with+a+rocket+launch,+which+provides+the+initial+thrust+to+overcome+the+force+of+gravity | title=Astronautics: A Historical Perspective of Mankind's Efforts to Conquer the Cosmos | last=Spitzmiller | first=Ted | date=2007 | page=467 | publisher=Apogee Books | isbn=9781894959667 | language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called [[astrodynamics]]. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during [[atmospheric reentry]], and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.

==Physics==
[[File:Luftschiff small.jpg|thumb|Lighter-than-air [[airship]]s are able to fly without any major input of energy]]
{{main article|Aerodynamics}}

There are different approaches to flight. If an object has a lower [[density]] than air, then it is [[buoyancy|buoyant]] and is able to [[aerostat|float in the air]] without expending energy. A [[heavier than air]] craft, known as an [[Aircraft#Heavier than air .80.93 aerodynes|aerodyne]], includes flighted animals and insects, [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[rotorcraft]]. Because the craft is heavier than air, it must generate [[lift (force)|lift]] to overcome its [[weight]]. The wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called [[drag (physics)|drag]] and is overcome by [[Air propulsion|propulsive thrust]] except in the case of [[gliding (flight)|gliding]].

Some vehicles also use thrust for flight, for example [[rocket]]s and [[Harrier Jump Jet]]s.

Finally, [[momentum]] dominates the flight of ballistic flying objects.

===Forces===
[[File:Forces2.gif|thumb|Main forces on a heavier-than-air aircraft]]
{{main article|Aerodynamics}}

Forces relevant to flight are&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/forces.html "Four forces on an aeroplane."] ''NASA.'' Retrieved: January 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Air propulsion|Propulsive thrust]] (except in gliders)
* [[Lift (force)|Lift]], created by the reaction to an airflow
* [[Drag (physics)|Drag]], created by aerodynamic [[friction]]
* [[Weight]], created by gravity
* [[Buoyancy]], for lighter than air flight

These forces must be balanced for stable flight to occur.

====Thrust====
{{main|Thrust}}
[[File:aeroforces.svg|thumb|Forces on an [[aerofoil]] cross section]]

A [[fixed-wing aircraft]] generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight.  This can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]], or a rotating [[Mechanical fan|fan]] pushing air out from the back of a [[jet engine]], or by ejecting hot gases from a [[rocket engine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/newton3.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The forward thrust is proportional to the [[mass]] of the airstream multiplied by the difference in [[velocity]] of the airstream. Reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by reversing the pitch of variable-pitch propeller blades, or using a [[Thrust reversal|thrust reverser]] on a jet engine. [[Rotary wing aircraft]] and [[thrust vectoring]] [[V/STOL]] aircraft use engine thrust to support the weight of the aircraft, and vector sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed.

====Lift====
{{main article|lift (force)}}
[[File:Airfoil lift and drag.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lift is defined as the component of the total aerodynamic force perpendicular to the flow direction, and drag is the component parallel to the flow direction]]
In the context of an [[fluid flow|air flow]] relative to a flying body, the '''lift''' force is the [[Vector (geometric)#Vector components|component]] of the [[aerodynamic force]] that is [[perpendicular]] to the flow direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/aerosim/Manual/fsim0020.htm "Definition of lift."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203074439/http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/aerosim/Manual/fsim0020.htm |date=2009-02-03 }} ''NASA.'' Retrieved: May 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Aerodynamic lift results when the wing causes the surrounding air to be deflected - the air then causes a force on the wing in the opposite direction, in accordance with [[Newton's third law of motion]].

Lift is commonly associated with the [[wing]] of an [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]], although lift is also generated by [[Helicopter rotor|rotors]] on [[rotorcraft]] (which are effectively rotating wings, performing the same function without requiring that the aircraft move forward through the air). While common meanings of the word "[[wikt:lift#English|lift]]" suggest that lift opposes gravity, aerodynamic lift can be in any direction. When an aircraft is [[cruise (flight)|cruising]] for example, lift does oppose gravity, but lift occurs at an angle when climbing, descending or banking. On high-speed cars, the lift force is directed downwards (called "down-force") to keep the car stable on the road.

Lift can also occur in a different way if the air is not still, especially if there is an updraft due to heat ("thermals") or wind blowing along sloping terrain or other meteorological conditions. This form of lift permits [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]] and is particularly important for gliding. It is used by birds and gliders to stay in the air for long periods with little effort.

====Drag====
{{main article|Drag (physics)}}
For a solid object moving through a fluid, the drag is the component of the [[Net force|net]] [[Aerodynamic force|aerodynamic]] or [[hydrodynamics|hydrodynamic]] [[force]] acting opposite to the direction of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;French 1970, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/flight/physics.html "Basic flight physics."] ''Berkeley University.''

Retrieved: May 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, drag opposes the motion of the object, and in a powered vehicle it must be overcome by [[thrust]]. The process which creates lift also causes some drag.

====Lift-to-drag ratio====
[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|thumb|Speed and drag relationships for a typical aircraft]]
{{main article|Lift-to-drag ratio}}
Aerodynamic lift is created by the motion of an aerodynamic object (wing) through the air, which due to its shape and angle deflects the air. For sustained straight and level flight, lift must be equal and opposite to weight. In general, long narrow wings are able deflect a large amount of air at a slow speed, whereas smaller wings need a higher forward speed to deflect an equivalent amount of air and thus generate an equivalent amount of lift. Large cargo aircraft tend to use longer wings with higher angles of attack, whereas supersonic aircraft tend to have short wings and rely heavily on high forward speed to generate lift.

However, this lift (deflection) process inevitably causes a retarding force called drag. Because lift and drag are both aerodynamic forces, the ratio of lift to drag is an indication of the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane. The lift to drag ratio is the L/D ratio, pronounced "L over D ratio." An airplane has a high L/D ratio if it produces a large amount of lift or a small amount of drag. The lift/drag ratio is determined by dividing the lift coefficient by the drag coefficient, CL/CD. &lt;ref&gt;The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/ldrat.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The lift coefficient Cl is equal to the lift L divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the wing area A). [Cl = L / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] The lift coefficient is also affected by the compressibility of the air, which is much greater at higher speeds, so velocity V is not a linear function. Compressibility is also affected by the shape of the aircraft surfaces.
&lt;ref&gt;The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/liftco.html &lt;/ref&gt;

The drag coefficient Cd is equal to the drag D divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the reference area A). [Cd = D / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] 
&lt;ref&gt;The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/dragco.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Lift-to-drag ratios for practical aircraft vary from about 4:1 for vehicles and birds with relatively short wings, up to 60:1 or more for vehicles with very long wings, such as gliders. A greater angle of attack relative to the forward movement also increases the extent of deflection, and thus generates extra lift. However a greater angle of attack also generates extra drag. 

Lift/drag ratio also determines the glide ratio and gliding range. Since the glide ratio is based only on the relationship of the aerodynamics forces acting on the aircraft, aircraft weight will not affect it. The only effect weight has is to vary the time that the aircraft will glide for – a heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time. &lt;ref&gt;The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   
https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/ldrat.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buoyancy====
{{main article|Buoyancy}}
Air pressure acting up against an object in air is greater than the pressure above pushing down. The buoyancy, in both cases, is equal to the weight of fluid displaced - [[Archimedes' principle]] holds for air just as it does for water.

A cubic meter of air at ordinary [[atmospheric pressure]] and room temperature has a mass of about 1.2 kilograms, so its weight is about 12 newtons. Therefore, any 1-cubic-meter object in air is buoyed up with a force of 12 newtons. If the mass of the 1-cubic-meter object is greater than 1.2 kilograms (so that its weight is greater than 12 newtons), it falls to the ground when released. If an object of this size has a mass less than 1.2 kilograms, it rises in the air. Any object that has a mass that is less than the mass of an equal volume of air will rise in air - in other words, any object less dense than air will rise.

====Thrust to weight ratio====
{{main article|Thrust-to-weight ratio}}
'''Thrust-to-weight ratio''' is, as its name suggests, the ratio of instantaneous [[thrust]] to [[weight]] (where weight means weight at the [[Earth]]'s standard acceleration &lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="sutton"&gt;Sutton and Biblarz 2000, p. 442. Quote: "thrust-to-weight ratio F/W&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a dimensionless parameter that is identical to the acceleration of the rocket propulsion system (expressed in multiples of g0) if it could fly by itself in a gravity free vacuum."&lt;/ref&gt; It is a dimensionless parameter characteristic of [[rocket]]s and other jet engines and of vehicles propelled by such engines (typically space [[launch vehicle]]s and jet [[aircraft]]).

If the [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] is greater than the local gravity strength (expressed in ''g''s), then flight can occur without any forward motion or any aerodynamic lift being required.

If the thrust-to-weight ratio times the lift-to-drag ratio is greater than local gravity then [[takeoff]] using aerodynamic lift is possible.

===Flight dynamics===

[[File:Aileron roll.gif|thumb|[[Aerobatic maneuver|Roll]]]]
[[File:dihedral.airliner.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|The upward tilt of the wings and tailplane of an aircraft, as seen on this [[Boeing 737]], is called dihedral angle]]{{main article|Flight dynamics}}
'''Flight dynamics''' is the science of [[aircraft|air]] and [[spacecraft|space]] vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three [[dimensions]] about the vehicle's [[center of mass]], known as ''pitch'', ''roll'' and ''yaw'' (See [[Tait-Bryan rotations]] for an explanation).

The control of these dimensions can involve a [[horizontal stabilizer]] (i.e. "a tail"), [[ailerons]] and other movable aerodynamic devices which control angular stability i.e. flight attitude (which in turn affects [[altitude]], [[Aircraft heading|heading]]). Wings are often angled slightly upwards- they have "positive [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral angle]]" which gives inherent roll stabilization.

===Energy efficiency===
{{main article|propulsive efficiency}}
To create thrust so as to be able to gain height, and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy. Different objects and creatures capable of flight vary in the efficiency of their muscles, motors and how well this translates into forward thrust.

Propulsive efficiency determines how much energy vehicles generate from a unit of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm ch10-3 "History."] ''NASA.'' Retrieved: May 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Honicke et al. 1968 {{Page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Range===
{{main article|range (aircraft)}}
The range that powered flight articles can achieve is ultimately limited by their drag, as well as how much energy they can store on board and how efficiently they can turn that energy into propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node98.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For powered aircraft the useful energy is determined by their [[fuel fraction]]- what percentage of the takeoff weight is fuel, as well as the [[specific energy]] of the fuel used.

===Power-to-weight ratio===
{{main article|power-to-weight ratio}}
All animals and devices capable of sustained flight need relatively high power-to-weight ratios to be able to generate enough lift and/or thrust to achieve take off.

==Takeoff and landing==
{{main article|takeoff and landing}}
Vehicles that can fly can have different ways to '''takeoff and land'''. Conventional aircraft accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for [[takeoff]], and reverse the process for [[landing]]. Some aircraft can take off at low speed; this is called a short takeoff. Some aircraft such as helicopters and Harrier jump jets can take off and land vertically. Rockets also usually take off and land vertically, but some designs can land horizontally.

==Guidance, navigation and control==
{{main article|Guidance, navigation and control}}

===Navigation===
[[Navigation]] is the systems necessary to calculate current position (e.g. [[compass]], [[GPS]], [[LORAN]], [[star tracker]], [[inertial measurement unit]], and [[altimeter]]).

In aircraft, successful [[air navigation]] involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost, breaking the laws applying to aircraft, or endangering the safety of those on board or on the [[Earth|ground]].

The techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the [[visual flight rules]] (VFR) or the [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR). In the latter case, the [[aviator|pilot]] will navigate exclusively using [[flight instruments|instruments]] and [[radio navigation aid]]s such as beacons, or as directed under [[radar]] control by [[air traffic control]]. In the VFR case, a pilot will largely navigate using [[dead reckoning]] combined with visual observations (known as [[pilotage]]), with reference to appropriate maps. This may be supplemented using radio navigation aids.

===Guidance===
{{main article|Guidance system}}
A '''guidance system''' is a device or group of devices used in the [[navigation]] of a [[ship]], [[aircraft]], [[missile]], [[rocket]], [[satellite]], or other moving object. Typically, guidance is responsible for the calculation of the vector (i.e., direction, velocity) toward an objective.

===Control===

{{main article|Flight control system}}
A conventional fixed-wing '''aircraft flight control system''' consists of [[flight control surfaces]], the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft's direction in flight. [[Aircraft engine controls]] are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.

====Traffic====
In the case of aircraft, air traffic is controlled by [[air traffic control]] systems.

[[Collision avoidance (spacecraft)|Collision avoidance]] is the process of controlling spacecraft to try to prevent collisions.

==Flight safety==
{{main article|aviation safety}}
'''Air safety''' is a term encompassing the theory, investigation and categorization of [[Aviation accidents and incidents|flight failures]], and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of [[air travel]].

The five main [[latitude]] regions of the Earth's surface comprise '''geographical zones''', divided by the major [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]]. The differences between them relate to [[climate]]. They are as follows: 

#The [[Arctic|North frigid zone]], between the [[Arctic Circle]] 66.5° N and the [[North Pole]] 90° N. Covers 4.12% of Earth's surface.
#The [[North temperate zone]], between the  [[Tropic of Cancer]] 23.5° N and the Arctic Circle 66.5° N. Covers 25.99% of Earth's surface.
#The [[Tropics|Torrid zone]], between the Tropic of Cancer 23.5° N and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] 23.5° S. Covers 39.78% of Earth's surface.
#The [[South temperate zone]], between the Tropic of Capricorn 23.5° S and the [[Antarctic Circle]] 66.5° S. Covers 25.99% of Earth's surface.
#The [[Antarctic|South frigid zone]], from Antarctic Circle 66.5° S and the [[South Pole]] 90° S. Covers 4.12% of Earth's surface.

On the basis of latitudinal extent, the globe is divided into three broad heat zones.

==Torrid Zone==

The Torrid is also known as the [[Tropics]]. The zone is bounded on the north by the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and on the south by the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]; these latitudes mark the northern and southern extremes in which the sun seasonally passes directly overhead. This happens annually, but in the region between, the sun passes overhead twice a year.

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], in the sun's apparent northward migration after the March [[equinox]], it passes overhead once, then after the [[June solstice]], at which time it reaches the [[Tropic of Cancer]], it passes over again on its apparent southward journey. After the September equinox the sun passes into the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. It then passes similarly over the southern tropical regions until it reaches the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] at the [[December solstice]], and back again as it returns northwards to the [[Equator]].

==Temperate Zones==

In the two Temperate Zones also known as tropical zone not, consisting of the [[tepid]] [[latitudes]], the Sun is never directly overhead, and the climate is mild, generally ranging from warm to cool. The four annual seasons, [[Spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]] and [[winter]], occur in these areas. The North Temperate Zone includes [[Europe]], [[Northern Asia]], and [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]]. The South Temperate Zone includes Southern [[Australasia]], southern [[South America]], and [[Southern Africa]].

==Frigid Zones==

The two Frigid Zones, or [[polar regions of Earth|polar region]]s, experience the [[midnight sun]] and the [[polar night]] for part of the year - at the edge of the zone there is one day at the winter solstice when the Sun is invisible, and one day at the summer solstice when the sun remains above the horizon for 24 hours. In the center of the zone (the [[Geographical pole|pole]]) the day is one year long with six months of daylight and six months of night. The Frigid Zones are the coldest regions of Earth and are generally covered in ice and snow.It receives slanting rays of the sun as this region lies farthest from the equator. Summer season in this region lies lasts for about 2 to 3 months and there is almost 24 hour sunlight during summer.

==History==
The concept of a geographical zone was first hypothesized by the ancient Greek scholar [[Parmenides]]&lt;ref&gt;Strab. 2,2,1-2 in: A. H. Coxon and R. D. McKirahan (eds), The Fragments of Parmenides: A Critical Text With Introduction, and Translation, the Ancient Testimonia and a Commentary, 2nd edn (Phronesis: Supplementary Volumes 3; Assen, Dover (NH), 2009), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and lastingly modified by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]], [[Corpus Aristotelicum#Bekker numbers|Bekker numbers]] 362a33-362b29&lt;/ref&gt; Both philosophers theorized the Earth divided into three types of climatic zones based on their distance from the equator.

Like Parmeneides, thinking that the area near the equator was too hot for habitation, Aristotle dubbed the region around the equator (from 23.5° N to 23.5° S) the "Torrid Zone." Both philosophers reasoned the region from the Arctic Circle to the pole to be permanently frozen. This region, thought uninhabitable, was called the "Frigid Zone." The only area believed to be habitable was the northern "Temperate Zone" (the southern one not having been discovered), lying between the "Frigid Zones" and the "Torrid Zone". However, humans have inhabited almost all climates on Earth, including inside the Arctic Circle.

As knowledge of the Earth's geography improved, a second "Temperate Zone" was discovered south of the equator, and a second "Frigid Zone" was discovered around the [[Antarctic]]. Although Aristotle's map was oversimplified, the general idea was correct. Today, the most commonly used climate map is the [[Köppen climate classification]], developed by Russian climatologist of German descent and amateur botanist [[Wladimir Köppen]] (1846–1940), which divides the world into five major climate regions, based on average annual precipitation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly temperature.

The '''gravity of Earth''', denoted by '''{{mvar|g}}''', is the [[net force|net]] [[acceleration]] that is imparted to objects due to the combined effect of [[gravitation]] (from distribution of mass within [[Earth]]) and the [[centrifugal force]] (from the [[Earth's rotation]]).&lt;ref name="Boynton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In [[International System of Units|SI units]] this acceleration is measured in [[metre per second squared|metres per second squared]] (in symbols, [[metre|m]]/[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) or equivalently in [[Newton (unit)|newtons]] per [[kilogram]] (N/kg or N·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Near Earth's surface, [[gravitational acceleration]] is approximately 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which means that, ignoring the effects of [[drag (physics)|air resistance]], the [[speed]] of an object [[free fall|falling freely]] will increase by about 9.8 metres per second every second. This quantity is sometimes referred to informally as ''little {{mvar|g}}'' (in contrast, the [[gravitational constant]] {{mvar|G}} is referred to as ''big {{mvar|G}}'').

The precise strength of Earth's gravity varies depending on location. The nominal "average" value at Earth's surface, known as {{nowrap|[[standard gravity]]}} is, by definition, 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |editor1-first=Barry N.|editor1-last=Taylor|editor2-first=Ambler|editor2-last=Thompson |author-link= |date=March 2008 |title=The international system of units (SI) |url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication330e2008.pdf|format=pdf |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |page=52 |docket=NIST special publication 330, 2008 edition |access-date= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This quantity is denoted variously as {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} (though this sometimes means the normal equatorial value on Earth, 9.78033&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, gee, or simply {{mvar|g}} (which is also used for the variable local value). 

The [[weight]] of an object on Earth's surface is the downwards force on that object, given by [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s second law|Newton's second law of motion]], or {{nowrap|{{math|''F'' {{=}} ''ma''}}}} ({{nowrap|''force'' {{=}} ''mass'' × ''acceleration''}}). Gravitational acceleration contributes to the total gravity acceleration, but other factors, such as the rotation of Earth, also contribute, and, therefore, affect the weight of the object.
Gravity does not normally include the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun, which are accounted for in terms of [[tide|tidal effects]].
It is a [[vector (physics)]] quantity, whose direction coincides with a [[plumb bob]].

==Variation in magnitude==
A non-rotating perfect [[sphere]] of uniform mass density, or whose density varies solely with distance from the centre ([[spherical symmetry]]), would produce a gravitational field of uniform magnitude at all points on its [[planetary surface|surface]]. The Earth is rotating and is also not spherically symmetric; rather, it is slightly flatter at the poles while bulging at the Equator: an [[oblate spheroid]]. There are consequently slight deviations in the magnitude of gravity across its surface.

Gravity on the Earth's surface varies by around 0.7%, from 9.7639&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on the [[Nevado Huascarán]] mountain in Peru to 9.8337&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the surface of the [[Arctic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirt|first1=Christian|last2=Claessens|first2=Sten|last3=Fecher|first3=Thomas|last4=Kuhn|first4=Michael|last5=Pail|first5=Roland|last6=Rexer|first6=Moritz|title=New ultrahigh-resolution picture of Earth's gravity field|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=August 28, 2013|volume=40|issue=16|pages=4279–4283|doi=10.1002/grl.50838|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/grl.50838/abstract|bibcode=2013GeoRL..40.4279H}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Comparative gravities in various cities around the world|In large cities, it ranges]] from 9.7760&lt;ref name="Wolfram Alpha"&gt;[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=gravity+in+kuala+lampur "Wolfram|Alpha Gravity in Kuala Lumpur", Wolfram Alpha, accessed May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Mexico City]], and [[Singapore]] to 9.825 in [[Oslo]] and [[Helsinki]].

===Conventional value===
In 1901 the third [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] defined a standard gravitational acceleration for the surface of the Earth: ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It was based on measurements done at the [[Pavillon de Breteuil]] near Paris in 1888, with a theoretical correction applied in order to convert to a latitude of 45° at sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Artefacts to Atoms: The BIPM and the Search for Ultimate Measurement Standards |author=Terry Quinn |page=127 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19-530786-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is thus not a value of any particular place or carefully worked out average, but an agreement for a value to use if a better actual local value is not known or not important.&lt;ref&gt;Resolution of the 3rd CGPM (1901), page 70 (in cm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). [http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/3/2/ BIPM – Resolution of the 3rd CGPM]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to define the units [[kilogram force]] and [[pound force]].

===Latitude===
[[Image:Southern ocean gravity hg.png|thumb|upright=1.4|The differences of Earth's gravity around the Antarctic continent.]]
The surface of the Earth is rotating, so it is [[Non-inertial reference frame|not an inertial frame of reference]]. At latitudes nearer the Equator, the outward [[Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]] produced by Earth's rotation is larger than at polar latitudes. This counteracts the Earth's gravity to a small degree – up to a maximum of 0.3% at the Equator – and reduces the apparent downward acceleration of falling objects.

The second major reason for the difference in gravity at different latitudes is that the Earth's [[equatorial bulge]] (itself also caused by centrifugal force from rotation) causes objects at the Equator to be farther from the planet's centre than objects at the poles. Because the force due to gravitational attraction between two bodies (the Earth and the object being weighed) varies inversely with the square of the distance between them, an object at the Equator experiences a weaker gravitational pull than an object at the poles.

In combination, the equatorial bulge and the effects of the surface centrifugal force due to rotation mean that sea-level gravity increases from about 9.780&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the Equator to about 9.832&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the poles, so an object will weigh about 0.5% more at the poles than at the Equator.&lt;ref name="Boynton"&gt;{{cite conference

===Altitude===
[[Image:Erdgvarp.png|thumb|The graph shows the variation in gravity relative to the height of an object above the surface]]
Gravity decreases with altitude as one rises above the Earth's surface because greater altitude means greater distance from the Earth's centre. All other things being equal, an increase in altitude from sea level to {{convert|30000|ft|m|sigfig=1|order=flip}} causes a weight decrease of about 0.29%. (An additional factor affecting apparent weight is the decrease in air density at altitude, which lessens an object's buoyancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/faqs/i-feel-'lighter'-when-up-a-mountain-but-am-i-(faq-mass-and-density) "I feel 'lighter' when up a mountain but am I?"], National Physical Laboratory FAQ&lt;/ref&gt; This would increase a person's apparent weight at an altitude of 9,000 metres by about 0.08%)

It is a common misconception that astronauts in orbit are weightless because they have flown high enough to escape the Earth's gravity. In fact, at an altitude of {{convert|400|km|mi}}, equivalent to a typical orbit of the [[International Space Station|ISS]], gravity is still nearly 90% as strong as at the Earth's surface. Weightlessness actually occurs because orbiting objects are in [[free-fall]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/24jan_micro-g/ "The G's in the Machine"], NASA, see "Editor's note #2"&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of ground elevation depends on the density of the ground (see [[#Slab correction|Slab correction]] section). A person flying at 30 000&amp;nbsp;ft above sea level over mountains will feel more gravity than someone at the same elevation but over the sea. However, a person standing on the earth's surface feels less gravity when the elevation is higher.

The following formula approximates the Earth's gravity variation with altitude:
:&lt;math&gt;g_h=g_0\left(\frac{r_\mathrm{e}}{r_\mathrm{e}+h}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Where
*{{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the gravitational acceleration at height {{mvar|h}} above sea level.
*{{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Earth radius|Earth's mean radius]].
*{{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[standard gravitational acceleration]].

The formula treats the Earth as a perfect sphere with a radially symmetric distribution of mass; a more accurate mathematical treatment is discussed below.

===Depth===
{{See also|Shell theorem}}
An approximate value for gravity at a distance {{mvar|r}} from the center of the Earth can be obtained by assuming that the Earth's density is spherically symmetric. The gravity depends only on the mass inside the sphere of radius {{mvar|r}}. All the contributions from outside cancel out as a consequence of the [[inverse-square law]] of gravitation. Another consequence is that the gravity is the same as if all the mass were concentrated at the center. Thus, the gravitational acceleration at this radius is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tipler|first=Paul A.|title=Physics for scientists and engineers.|date=1999|publisher=W.H. Freeman/Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781572594913|pages=336&amp;ndash;337|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(r) = -\frac{GM(r)}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|G}} is the [[gravitational constant]] and {{math|''M''(''r'')}} is the total mass enclosed within radius {{mvar|r}}. If the Earth had a constant density {{mvar|ρ}}, the mass would be {{math|''M''(''r'') {{=}} (4/3)π''ρr''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and the dependence of gravity on depth would be
:&lt;math&gt;g(r) = \frac{4\pi}{3} G \rho r.&lt;/math&gt;
{{mvar|g}} at depth {{mvar|d}} is given by
{{math|''g'''{{=}}''g''(1-''d''/''R'')}} where {{mvar|g}} is acceleration due to gravity on surface of the earth, {{mvar|d}} is depth and {{mvar|R}} is radius of [[Earth]].
If the density decreased linearly with increasing radius from a density {{math|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} at the center to {{math|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} at the surface, then {{math|''ρ''(''r'') {{=}} ''&amp;rho;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − (''&amp;rho;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − ''&amp;rho;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ''r'' / ''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and the dependence would be
:&lt;math&gt;g(r) = \frac{4\pi}{3} G \rho_0 r - \frac{4\pi}{3} G \left(\rho_0-\rho_1\right) \frac{r^2}{r_{\mathrm{e}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The actual depth dependence of density and gravity, inferred from seismic travel times (see [[Adams–Williamson equation]]), is shown in the graphs below.

===Local topography and geology===
{{See also|Physical geodesy}}
Local differences in [[topography]] (such as the presence of mountains), [[geology]] (such as the density of rocks in the vicinity), and deeper [[Plate tectonics|tectonic structure]] cause local and regional differences in the Earth's gravitational field, known as [[Gravity anomaly|gravitational anomalies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A. B. |last1=Watts |first2=S. F. |last2=Daly |title=Long wavelength gravity and topography anomalies |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=9 |pages=415–418 |date=May 1981 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.09.050181.002215 |bibcode=1981AREPS...9..415W |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1981AREPS...9..415W&amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;filetype=.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these anomalies can be very extensive, resulting in bulges in [[sea level]], and throwing [[pendulum]] clocks out of synchronisation.

The study of these anomalies forms the basis of gravitational [[geophysics]]. The fluctuations are measured with highly sensitive [[gravimeter]]s, the effect of topography and other known factors is subtracted, and from the resulting data conclusions are drawn. Such techniques are now used by [[prospectors]] to find [[oil]] and [[mineral deposits]]. Denser rocks (often containing mineral [[ore]]s) cause higher than normal local gravitational fields on the Earth's surface. Less dense [[sedimentary rock]]s cause the opposite.

===Other factors===
In air, objects experience a supporting [[buoyancy]] force which reduces the apparent strength of gravity (as measured by an object's weight). The magnitude of the effect depends on air density (and hence air pressure); see [[Apparent weight]] for details.

The gravitational effects of the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]] (also the cause of the [[tide]]s) have a very small effect on the apparent strength of Earth's gravity, depending on their relative positions; typical variations are 2&amp;nbsp;µm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.2 [[Gal (unit)|mGal]]) over the course of a day.

==Variation in direction==
Gravity acceleration is a [[vector quantity]]. In a spherically symmetric Earth, gravity would point directly towards the sphere's centre. As the Earth is slightly flatter, there are consequently slight deviations in the direction of gravity.

==Comparative values in worldwide==
Tools exist for calculating the strength of gravity at various cities around the world.&lt;ref name=wolfram&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/widgets/view.jsp?id=d34e8683df527e3555153d979bcda9cf Gravitational Fields Widget as of Oct 25th, 2012]  – [[WolframAlpha]]&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of latitude can be clearly seen with gravity in high-latitude cities: Anchorage (9.826&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), Helsinki (9.825&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), being about 0.5% greater than that in cities near the equator: Kuala Lumpur (9.776&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), Manila (9.780&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;!-- (| V1 - V2 | / ((V1 + V2)/2)) * 100 = 0.52038% --&gt;  The effect of altitude can be seen in Mexico City (9.776&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; altitude {{convert|2240|m|ft|}}), and by comparing Denver (9.798&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; {{convert|1616|m|ft}}) with Washington, D.C.

==Mathematical models==

===Latitude model===
{{main article|Theoretical gravity}}

If the terrain is at sea level, we can estimate &lt;math&gt;g\{\phi\}&lt;/math&gt;, the acceleration at latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
g\{\phi\} &amp; = 9.780327\,\,\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2} \,\, \left(1 + 0.0053024\,\sin^2\phi - 0.0000058\,\sin^2 2\phi         \right), \\
          &amp; = 9.780327\,\,\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2} \,\, \left(1 + 0.0052792\,\sin^2\phi + 0.0000232\,\sin^4  \phi         \right), \\
          &amp; = 9.780327\,\,\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2} \,\, \left(1.0053024 - 0.0053256\,\cos^2\phi + 0.0000232\,\cos^4  \phi \right), \\
          &amp; = 9.780327\,\,\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2} \,\, \left(1.0026454 - 0.0026512\,\cos 2\phi + 0.0000058\,\cos^2 2\phi \right) 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

This is the [[International Gravity Formula]] 1967, the 1967 Geodetic Reference System Formula, Helmert's equation or Clairaut's formula.&lt;ref name="IGF"&gt;[http://geophysics.ou.edu/solid_earth/notes/potential/igf.htm International Gravity formula] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820093812/http://geophysics.ou.edu/solid_earth/notes/potential/igf.htm |date=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative formula for ''g'' as a function of latitude is the WGS ([[World Geodetic System]]) 84 Ellipsoidal [[gravity formula|Gravity Formula]]:&lt;ref name="DoD-WGS84"&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/wgs84fin.pdf '''''Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1984 ― Its Definition and Relationships with Local Geodetic Systems''''',NIMA TR8350.2, 3rd ed., Tbl. 3.4, Eq. 4-1]
&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g\{\phi\}= \mathbb{G}_e\left[\frac{1+k\sin^2\phi}{\sqrt{1-e^2\sin^2\phi}}\right],\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where,

*&lt;math&gt;a,\,b&lt;/math&gt; are the equatorial and polar semi-axes, respectively;
*&lt;math&gt;e^2 = 1 - (b/a)^2&lt;/math&gt; is the spheroid's [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]], squared;
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_e,\,\mathbb{G}_p\,&lt;/math&gt; is the defined gravity at the equator and poles, respectively;
*&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{b\,\mathbb{G}_p - a\,\mathbb{G}_e}{a\,\mathbb{G}_e}&lt;/math&gt; (formula constant);

then, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_p = 9.8321849378 \,\,\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="DoD-WGS84"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g\{\phi\}= 9.7803253359\,\,\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2} \left[\frac{1 + 0.00193185265241\,\sin^2\phi}{\sqrt{1 - 0.00669437999013\,\sin^2\phi}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

The difference between the WGS-84 formula and Helmert's equation is less than 0.68&amp;nbsp;&amp;mu;m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Free air correction===
{{main article|Free-air anomaly}}

The first correction to be applied to the model is the free air correction (FAC) that accounts for heights above sea level. Near the surface of the Earth (sea level), gravity decreases with height such that linear extrapolation would give zero gravity at a height of one half of the earth's radius - (9.8&amp;nbsp;m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; per 3,200&amp;nbsp;km.)&lt;ref&gt;The rate of decrease is calculated by differentiating ''g''(''r'') with respect to ''r'' and evaluating at ''r''=''r''&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the mass and radius of the [[Earth]]:
:&lt;math&gt;r_\mathrm{Earth}= 6.371 \cdot 10^{6}\,\mathrm{m} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{Earth}= 5.9722 \cdot 10^{24}\,\mathrm{kg} &lt;/math&gt;

The FAC correction factor (Δ''g'') can be derived from the definition of the acceleration due to gravity in terms of G, the [[Gravitational Constant]] (see Estimating ''g'' from the law of universal gravitation, below):
:&lt;math&gt;g_0 = G \, m_\mathrm{Earth} / r_\mathrm{Earth}^2 = 9.8196\,\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;G = 6.67384 \cdot 10^{-11}\,\frac{\mathrm{m}^3}{\mathrm{kg}\cdot\mathrm{s}^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

At a height ''h'' above the nominal surface of the earth ''g&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;g_h = G \, m_\mathrm{Earth} / \left(r_\mathrm{Earth} + h \right) ^2&lt;/math&gt;

So the FAC for a height ''h'' above the nominal earth radius can be expressed:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_h = \left [ G \, m_\mathrm{Earth} / \left(r_\mathrm{Earth} + h \right) ^2 \right ] - \left[G \, m_\mathrm{Earth} / r_\mathrm{Earth}^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

This expression can be readily used for programming or inclusion in a spreadsheet. Collecting terms, simplifying and neglecting small terms (''h''&lt;&lt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;), however yields the good approximation:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_h \approx - \, \dfrac{ G \, m_\mathrm{Earth}}{ r_\mathrm{Earth} ^2} \cdot \dfrac{ 2 \,h}{r_\mathrm{Earth}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the numerical values above and for a height ''h'' in metres:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta g_h \approx - 3.086 \cdot 10^{-6}\, h&lt;/math&gt;

Grouping the latitude and FAC altitude factors the expression most commonly found in the literature is:
:&lt;math&gt;g\{\phi,h\}=g\{\phi\}-3.086 \cdot 10^{-6}h&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;g\{\phi,h\}&lt;/math&gt; = acceleration in m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; at latitude &lt;math&gt;\ \phi&lt;/math&gt; and altitude ''h'' in metres.

===Slab correction===
{{main article|Bouguer anomaly}}

::&lt;small&gt;Note: The section uses the [[Galileo (unit)|galileo]] (symbol: "Gal"), which is a cgs unit for acceleration of 1&amp;nbsp;centimetre/second&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;

For flat terrain above sea level a second term is added for the gravity due to the extra mass; for this purpose the extra mass can be approximated by an infinite horizontal slab, and we get 2π''G'' times the mass per unit area, i.e. 4.2{{e|−10}}&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (0.042&amp;nbsp;μGal·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) (the Bouguer correction). For a mean rock density of 2.67 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; this gives 1.1{{e|−6}}&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.11&amp;nbsp;mGal·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Combined with the free-air correction this means a reduction of gravity at the surface of ca. 2&amp;nbsp;µm·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.20&amp;nbsp;mGal) for every metre of elevation of the terrain. (The two effects would cancel at a surface rock density of 4/3 times the average density of the whole earth. The density of the whole earth is 5.515 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, so standing on a slab of something like iron whose density is over 7.35 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; would increase one's weight.)

For the gravity below the surface we have to apply the free-air correction as well as a double Bouguer correction. With the infinite slab model this is because moving the point of observation below the slab changes the gravity due to it to its opposite. Alternatively, we can consider a [[Shell theorem|spherically symmetrical Earth]] and subtract from the mass of the Earth that of the shell outside the point of observation, because that does not cause gravity inside. This gives the same result.

==Estimating ''g'' from the law of universal gravitation==
From the [[law of universal gravitation]], the force on a body acted upon by Earth's gravity is given by
:&lt;math&gt;F = G\, \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} = \left(G\,\frac{m_1}{r^2}\right) m_2&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the distance between the centre of the Earth and the body (see below), and here we take ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to be the mass of the Earth and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be the mass of the body.

Additionally, [[Newton's second law]], ''F'' = ''ma'', where ''m'' is mass and ''a'' is acceleration, here tells us that
:&lt;math&gt;F = m_2\,g\,&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the two formulas it is seen that:
:&lt;math&gt;g = G\, \frac {m_1}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

So, to find the acceleration due to gravity at sea level, substitute the values of the [[gravitational constant]], ''G'', the Earth's [[mass]] (in kilograms), ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the Earth's [[radius]] (in metres), ''r'', to obtain the value of ''g'':
:&lt;math&gt;g = G\, \frac {m_1}{r^2} = 6.67384 \cdot 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{m}^3\cdot\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2} \,\,\,\frac{5.9722 \cdot 10^{24} \,\mathrm{kg}}{(6.371 \cdot 10^6\,\mathrm{m})^2} = 9.8196 \,\,\mbox{m} \cdot \mbox{s}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this formula only works because of the mathematical fact that the gravity of a uniform spherical body, as measured on or above its surface, is the same as if all its mass were concentrated at a point at its centre. This is what allows us to use the Earth's radius for ''r''.

The value obtained agrees approximately with the measured value of ''g''. The difference may be attributed to several factors, mentioned above under "Variations":
*The Earth is not [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]]
*The Earth is not a perfect sphere, and an average value must be used for its radius
*This calculated value of ''g'' only includes true gravity. It does not include the reduction of constraint force that we perceive as a reduction of gravity due to the rotation of Earth, and some of gravity being counteracted by centrifugal force.
There are significant uncertainties in the values of ''r'' and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as used in this calculation, and the value of ''[[Gravitational constant|G]]'' is also rather difficult to measure precisely.

If ''G'', ''g'' and ''r'' are known then a reverse calculation will give an estimate of the mass of the Earth. This method was used by [[Henry Cavendish]].

'''Henry David Thoreau''' (see [[Henry David Thoreau#Pronunciation of his name|name pronunciation]]; July 12, 1817&amp;nbsp;– May 6, 1862) was an American [[essay]]ist, [[poet]], [[philosopher]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]], [[tax resistance|tax resister]], [[development criticism|development critic]], [[surveying|surveyor]], and [[historian]]. A leading [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]],&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Daniel Walker, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815–1848''. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507894-7}}, p. 623.&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay "[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]" (originally published as "Resistance to Civil Government"), an argument for disobedience to an unjust state.

Thoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry amount to more than 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions are his [[nature writing|writings on natural history]] and philosophy, in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and [[environmental history]], two sources of modern-day [[environmentalism]]. His [[Literary language|literary]] style interweaves close observation of nature, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, [[symbol]]ic meanings, and historical lore, while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical [[Asceticism|austerity]], and Yankee attention to practical detail.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Thoreau, Henry David. ''A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers''&amp;nbsp;/ ''Walden''&amp;nbsp;/ ''The Maine Woods''&amp;nbsp;/ ''Cape Cod''. Library of America. {{ISBN|0-940450-27-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay; at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and [[illusion]] in order to discover life's true essential needs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

He was a lifelong abolitionist, delivering lectures that attacked the [[fugitive slave laws|Fugitive Slave Law]] while praising the writings of [[Wendell Phillips]] and defending the abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. Thoreau's philosophy of [[civil disobedience]] later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Thoreau is sometimes referred to as an [[anarchism|anarchist]].&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, Edwin Robert Anderson; Johnson, Alvin Saunders, eds. (1937). ''Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gross, David, ed. ''The Price of Freedom: Political Philosophy from Thoreau's Journals''. p. 8. {{ISBN|978-1-4348-0552-2}}. "The Thoreau of these journals distrusted doctrine, and, though it is accurate I think to call him an anarchist, he was by no means doctrinaire in this either."&lt;/ref&gt; Though "Civil Disobedience" seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government—"I ask for, not at once no government, but ''at once'' a better government"&lt;ref name="resistance"&gt;Thoreau, H. D. "[http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p03 Resistance to Civil Government]".&lt;/ref&gt;—the direction of this improvement contrarily points toward anarchism: "'That government is best which governs not at all;' and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have."&lt;ref name="resistance" /&gt;

==Pronunciation of his name==
[[Amos Bronson Alcott]] and Thoreau's aunt each wrote that "Thoreau" is pronounced like the word ''thorough'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|ʌr|oʊ}} {{respell|THURR|oh}}—in [[General American]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoreau.eserver.org/pronounce THUR-oh or Thor-OH? And How Do We Know?] ''Thoreau Reader''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/walden/ Thoreau's Walden]'', under the sidebar "Pronouncing Thoreau".&lt;/ref&gt; but more precisely {{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|ɔːr|oʊ}} {{respell|THOR|oh}}—in 19th-century New England). [[Edward Waldo Emerson]] wrote that the name should be pronounced "Thó-row", with the ''h'' sounded and stress on the first syllable.&lt;ref&gt;See the note on pronouncing the name at [http://www.walden.org/Thoreau#Name the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods].&lt;/ref&gt; Among modern-day American speakers, it is perhaps more commonly pronounced {{IPAc-en|θ|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ}} {{respell|thə|ROH}}—with stress on the second syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thoreau|publisher=Dictionary.com|date=2013|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/thoreau}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, J. C. (1990) ''Pronunciation Dictionary'', s.v. "Thoreau". Essex, U.K.: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical appearance==
Thoreau had a distinctive appearance, with a nose that he called his "most prominent feature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cape Cod|last=Thoreau|first=Henry David|publisher=|year=1865|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 10-A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;His face, once seen, could not be forgotten. The features were quite marked: the nose aquiline or very Roman, like one of the portraits of Caesar (more like a beak, as was said); large overhanging brows above the deepest set blue eyes that could be seen, in certain lights, and in others gray,—eyes expressive of all shades of feeling, but never weak or near-sighted; the forehead not unusually broad or high, full of concentrated energy and purpose; the mouth with prominent lips, pursed up with meaning and thought when silent, and giving out when open with the most varied and unusual instructive sayings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The traditional professions open to college graduates—law, the church, business, medicine—did not interest Thoreau,&lt;ref name="sattelmeyer"&gt;Sattelmeyer, Robert (1988).

Upon graduation Thoreau returned home to Concord, where he met [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] through a mutual friend.&lt;ref name=McElroy/&gt; Emerson, who was 14 years his senior, took a paternal and at times patron-like interest in Thoreau, advising the young man and introducing him to a circle of local writers and thinkers, including [[William Ellery Channing (poet)|Ellery Channing]], [[Margaret Fuller]], [[Amos Bronson Alcott|Bronson Alcott]], and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and his son [[Julian Hawthorne]], who was a boy at the time.

Emerson urged Thoreau to contribute essays and poems to a quarterly periodical, ''[[The Dial]]'', and lobbied the editor, Margaret Fuller, to publish those writings. Thoreau's first essay published in ''The Dial'' was "Aulus Persius Flaccus,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.walden.org/documents/file/Library/About%20Thoreau/D/Dial/AulusPersiusFlaccus.pdf|title=Aulus Persius Flaccus|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925021512/http://www.walden.org/documents/file/Library/About%20Thoreau/D/Dial/AulusPersiusFlaccus.pdf|archive-date=September 25, 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an essay on the Roman playwright, in July 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau's_Life_and_Writings:_The_Research_Collections/The_Dial |title=''The Dial'' |publisher=Walden.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018151944/http://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau%27s_Life_and_Writings%3A_The_Research_Collections/The_Dial |archivedate=October 18, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of revised passages from his journal, which he had begun keeping at Emerson's suggestion. The first journal entry, on October 22, 1837, reads, "'What are you doing now?' he asked. 'Do you keep a journal?' So I make my first entry to-day."&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David (2007). ''I to Myself: An Annotated Selection from the Journal of Henry D. Thoreau''. Jeffrey S. Cramer, ed. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoreau was a philosopher of nature and its relation to the human condition. In his early years he followed [[Transcendentalism]], a loose and eclectic [[Idealism|idealist]] philosophy advocated by Emerson, Fuller, and Alcott. They held that an ideal spiritual state transcends, or goes beyond, the physical and empirical, and that one achieves that insight via personal intuition rather than religious doctrine. In their view, Nature is the outward sign of inward spirit, expressing the "radical correspondence of visible things and human thoughts", as Emerson wrote in ''Nature'' (1836).

Thoreau returned to Concord and worked in his family's [[pencil]] factory, which he would continue to do alongside his writing and other work for most of his adult life. He rediscovered the process of making good pencils with inferior [[graphite]] by using clay as the binder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Pencil.html?id=GZ1CuD619GwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Pencil: A History of Design and Circumstance|last=Petroski|first=Henry|publisher=Knopf|year=1992|isbn=9780679734154|location=New York|pages=104–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; This invention allowed profitable use of a graphite source found in [[New Hampshire]] that had been purchased in 1821 by Thoreau's brother-in-law, Charles Dunbar. The process of mixing graphite and clay, known as the Conté process, had been first patented by [[Nicolas-Jacques Conté]] in 1795. The company's other source of graphite had been [[Tantiusques]], a mine operated by Native Americans in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]]. Later, Thoreau converted the pencil factory to produce plumbago, a name for graphite at the time, which was used in the [[electrotyping]] process.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, Randall. (Fall 2005).

Once back in Concord, Thoreau went through a restless period. In April 1844 he and his friend Edward Hoar accidentally set a fire that consumed {{convert|300|acre|km2}} of Walden Woods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calliope.org/thoreau/thorotime.html ''A Chronology of Thoreau's Life, with Events of the Times''].

Thoreau felt a need to concentrate and work more on his writing. In March 1845, Ellery Channing told Thoreau, "Go out upon that, build yourself a hut, &amp; there begin the grand process of devouring yourself alive. I see no other alternative, no other hope for you."&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 1833.&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, Thoreau embarked on a two-year experiment in [[simple living]] on July 4, 1845, when he moved to a small house he had built on land owned by Emerson in a [[secondary forest|second-growth forest]] around the shores of [[Walden Pond]]. The house was in "a pretty pasture and woodlot" of {{convert|14|acre|m2}} that Emerson had bought,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson.

[[File:Walden Thoreau.jpg|thumb|Original title page of ''Walden'', with an illustration from a drawing by Thoreau's sister Sophia]]

On July 24 or July 25, 1846, Thoreau ran into the local [[tax collector]], Sam Staples, who asked him to pay six years of delinquent [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]]. Thoreau refused because of his opposition to the [[Mexican–American War]] and [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], and he spent a night in jail because of this refusal. The next day Thoreau was freed when someone, likely to have been his aunt, paid the tax, against his wishes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Rosenwald, Lawrence.

In January and February 1848, he delivered lectures on "The Rights and Duties of the Individual in relation to Government",&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, H. D., letter to Ralph Waldo Emerson, February 23, 1848.&lt;/ref&gt; explaining his tax resistance at the [[Concord Lyceum]]. Bronson Alcott attended the lecture, writing in his journal on January 26:

{{quote|Heard Thoreau's lecture before the Lyceum on the relation of the individual to the State—an admirable statement of the rights of the individual to self-government, and an attentive audience. His allusions to the Mexican War, to Mr. [[Samuel Hoar|Hoar]]'s expulsion from Carolina, his own imprisonment in Concord Jail for refusal to pay his tax, Mr. Hoar's payment of mine when taken to prison for a similar refusal, were all pertinent, well considered, and reasoned. I took great pleasure in this deed of Thoreau's.|Bronson Alcott|''Journals''&lt;ref&gt;Alcott, Bronson (1938). ''Journals''. Boston: Little, Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thoreau revised the lecture into an essay titled "[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Resistance to Civil Government]]" (also known as "Civil Disobedience"). It was published by [[Elizabeth Peabody]] in the ''Aesthetic Papers'' in May 1849. Thoreau had taken up a version of [[Percy Shelley]]'s principle in the political poem "[[The Mask of Anarchy]]" (1819), which begins with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf |title=Morrissociety.org |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105232938/http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf |archivedate=January 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Walden Pond, Thoreau completed a first draft of ''[[A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers]]'', an [[elegy]] to his brother John, describing their trip to the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] in 1839. Thoreau did not find a publisher for the book and instead printed 1,000 copies at his own expense; fewer than 300 were sold.&lt;ref name="Cheever" /&gt;{{Rp|234}} He self-published the book on the advice of Emerson, using Emerson's publisher, Munroe, who did little to publicize the book.

In August 1846, Thoreau briefly left Walden to make a trip to [[Mount Katahdin]] in [[Maine]], a journey later recorded in "Ktaadn", the first part of ''The Maine Woods''.

Thoreau left Walden Pond on September 6, 1847.&lt;ref name="Cheever" /&gt;{{Rp|244}} At Emerson's request, he immediately moved back to the Emerson house to help Emerson's wife, Lidian, manage the household while her husband was on an extended trip to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thoreausociety.org/_news_abouthdt.htm |title=Thoreausociety.org |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129085846/http://thoreausociety.org/_news_abouthdt.htm |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over several years, as he worked to pay off his debts, he continuously revised the manuscript of what he eventually published as ''[[Walden|Walden, or Life in the Woods]]'' in 1854, recounting the two years, two months, and two days he had spent at Walden Pond. The book compresses that time into a single calendar year, using the passage of the four seasons to symbolize human development. Part [[memoir]] and part spiritual quest, ''Walden'' at first won few admirers, but later critics have regarded it as a classic American work that explores natural simplicity, harmony, and beauty as models for just social and cultural conditions.

The American poet [[Robert Frost]] wrote of Thoreau, "In one book ... he surpasses everything we have had in America."&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Robert (1968). Letter to Wade Van Dore, June 24, 1922, in ''Twentieth Century Interpretations of Walden''. Richard Ruland, ed. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall. p. 8. {{LCCN|6814480}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American author [[John Updike]] said of the book, "A century and a half after its publication, Walden has become such a totem of the back-to-nature, preservationist, anti-business, civil-disobedience mindset, and Thoreau so vivid a protester, so perfect a crank and hermit saint, that the book risks being as revered and unread as the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;Updike, John (2004). "A Sage for All Seasons". [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/26/classics ''The Guardian''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoreau moved out of Emerson's house in July 1848 and stayed at a house on nearby Belknap Street. In 1850, he and his family moved into a house at [[Thoreau-Alcott House|255 Main Street]], where he lived until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Eugene; Carruth, Gorton (1982).

In the summer of 1850, Thoreau and Channing journeyed from Boston to Montreal and Quebec City. These would be Thoreau's only travels outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weisman|first1=Adam Paul|title=Postcolonialism in North America: Imaginative Colonization in Henry David Thoreau's "A Yankee in Canada" and Jacques Poulin's "Volkswagen Blues"|journal=The Massachusetts Review|date=Autumn 1995|volume=36|issue=3|pages=478–479}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is as a result of this trip that he developed lectures that eventually became ''A Yankee in Canada''.

===Later years, 1851–1862===
[[File:VII. Rowse.jpg|thumb|Thoreau in 1854]]
In 1851, Thoreau became increasingly fascinated with [[natural history]] and narratives of travel and expedition. He read avidly on [[botany]] and often wrote observations on this topic into his journal. He admired [[William Bartram]] and [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Voyage of the Beagle]]''. He kept detailed observations on Concord's nature lore, recording everything from how the fruit ripened over time to the fluctuating depths of Walden Pond and the days certain birds migrated. The point of this task was to "anticipate" the seasons of nature, in his word.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walden.org/documents/file/Library/Thoreau/writings/correspondence/LettersBlake.pdf#page34 Letters to H.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;O.

He became a [[Surveying|land surveyor]] and continued to write increasingly detailed observations on the natural history of the town, covering an area of {{convert|26|sqmi|km2}}, in his journal, a two-million-word document he kept for 24 years. He also kept a series of notebooks, and these observations became the source of his late writings on natural history, such as "Autumnal Tints", "The Succession of Trees", and "Wild Apples", an essay lamenting the destruction of indigenous wild apple species.

Until the 1970s, literary critics{{Who|date=July 2009}} dismissed Thoreau's late pursuits as amateur science and philosophy. With the rise of [[environmental history]] and [[ecocriticism]] as academic disciplines, several new readings of Thoreau began to emerge, showing him to have been both a philosopher and an analyst of ecological patterns in fields and woodlots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorson|first1=Robert M.|title=Walden's Shore: Henry David Thoreau and Nineteenth-Century Science|date=December 6, 2013|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=067472478X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Primack|first1=Richard B.|title=Tracking Climate Change with the Help of Henry David Thoreau|url=http://www.elsevier.com/connect/tracking-climate-change-with-the-help-of-henry-david-thoreau|accessdate=23 September 2015|date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, his late essay "The Succession of Forest Trees" shows that he used experimentation and analysis to explain how forests regenerate after fire or human destruction, through the dispersal of seeds by winds or animals.

He traveled to [[Canada East]] once, [[Cape Cod]] four times, and Maine three times; these landscapes inspired his "excursion" books, ''[[A Yankee in Canada]]'', ''Cape Cod'', and ''The Maine Woods'', in which travel itineraries frame his thoughts about geography, history and philosophy. Other travels took him southwest to [[Philadelphia]] and New York City in 1854 and west across the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] in 1861, when he visited [[Niagara Falls]], Detroit, Chicago, [[Milwaukee]], [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] and [[Mackinac Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David (1970).

He processed everything he read, in the local laboratory of his Concord experience. Among his famous aphorisms is his advice to "live at home like a traveler."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau:_The_Digital_Collection/Correspondence Letters of H.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;O.

After [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]], many prominent voices in the abolitionist movement distanced themselves from Brown or [[Damn with faint praise|damned him with faint praise]]. Thoreau was disgusted by this, and he composed a key speech, ''[[A Plea for Captain John Brown]]'', which was uncompromising in its defense of Brown and his actions. Thoreau's speech proved persuasive: the abolitionist movement began to accept Brown as a martyr, and by the time of the [[American Civil War]] entire armies of the North were [[John Brown's Body|literally singing Brown's praises]]. As a biographer of Brown put it, "If, as Alfred Kazin suggests, without John Brown there would have been no Civil War, we would add that without the Concord Transcendentalists, John Brown would have had little cultural impact."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, David S.

===Death===
Thoreau contracted [[tuberculosis]] in 1835 and suffered from it sporadically afterwards. In 1860, following a late-night excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm, he became ill with [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau's_Life_and_Writings:_The_Research_Collections/Thoreau,_the_Man About Thoreau: Thoreau, the Man] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620045648/http://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau%27s_Life_and_Writings%3A_The_Research_Collections/Thoreau%2C_the_Man |date=June 20, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoreau.eserver.org/wfchron.html Thoreau Chronology].&lt;/ref&gt; His health declined, with brief periods of remission, and he eventually became bedridden. Recognizing the terminal nature of his disease, Thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works, particularly ''The Maine Woods'' and [[Excursions (anthology)|''Excursions'']], and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of ''A Week'' and ''Walden''. He wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue. His friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death. When his aunt Louisa asked him in his last weeks if he had made his peace with God, Thoreau responded, "I did not know we had ever quarreled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Simon|last= Critchley|title=The Book of Dead Philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ME-6IKs4a2sC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181 |p= 181|location=New York|publisher= Random House |date=2009|isbn=9780307472632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grave of Henry David Thoreau.jpeg|thumb|Grave of Thoreau at [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery (Concord, Massachusetts)|Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]] in Concord]]
Aware he was dying, Thoreau's last words were "Now comes good sailing", followed by two lone words, "moose" and "Indian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/programs/2008/05/05/|title=The Writer's Almanac|publisher=American Public Media|access-date=June 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708225006/http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/programs/2008/05/05/|archive-date=July 8, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He died on May 6, 1862, at age 44. [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] planned the service and read selections from Thoreau's works, and Channing presented a hymn.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, Barbara L. (2007). ''The Transcendentalists''.

Thoreau's friend [[William Ellery Channing (poet)|William Ellery Channing]] published his first biography, ''Thoreau the Poet-Naturalist'', in 1873.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Channing and another friend, [[Harrison Blake]], edited some poems, essays, and journal entries for posthumous publication in the 1890s. Thoreau's journals, which he often mined for his published works but which remained largely unpublished at his death, were first published in 1906 and helped to build his modern reputation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} A new, expanded edition of the journals is under way, published by [[Princeton University Press]]. Today, Thoreau is regarded as one of the foremost American writers, both for the modern clarity of his prose style and the prescience of his views on nature and politics. His memory is honored by the international [[Thoreau Society]] and his legacy honored by the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods, established in 1998 in Lincoln, Massachusetts.

===Nature and human existence===
{{quote|Most of the luxuries and many of the so-called comforts of life are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.| Thoreau&lt;ref&gt;''Walden, or Life in the Woods'' (Chapter 1: "Economy")&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thoreau was an early advocate of recreational hiking and [[canoeing]], of conserving natural resources on private land, and of preserving wilderness as public land. He was himself a highly skilled canoeist; [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], after a ride with him, noted that "Mr. Thoreau managed the boat so perfectly, either with two paddles or with one, that it seemed instinct with his own will, and to require no physical effort to guide it." &lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Hawthorne, Passages From the American Note-Books, entry for September 2, 1842.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was not a strict vegetarian, though he said he preferred that diet&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Van Wyck. ''The Flowering of New England''. New York: E. P. Dutton and Company, Inc., 1952. p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; and advocated it as a means of self-improvement. He wrote in ''Walden'', "The practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness; and besides, when I had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to have fed me essentially. It was insignificant and unnecessary, and cost more than it came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well, with less trouble and filth."&lt;ref name="Cheever241"&gt;Cheever, Susan (2006).

[[File:Thoreaus quote near his cabin site, Walden Pond.jpg|thumb|Thoreau's famous quotation, near his cabin site at Walden Pond]]
Thoreau neither rejected civilization nor fully embraced wilderness. Instead he sought a middle ground, the [[pastoral]] realm that integrates nature and culture. His philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in North America. He decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs to be close to those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them. The wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred "partially cultivated country." His idea of being "far in the recesses of the wilderness" of Maine was to "travel the logger's path and the Indian trail", but he also hiked on pristine land. In the essay "Henry David Thoreau, Philosopher" [[Roderick Nash]] wrote, "Thoreau left Concord in 1846 for the first of three trips to northern Maine. His expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine, primeval America. But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord. Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance."&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Roderick. ''Wilderness and the American Mind: Henry David Thoreau: Philosopher''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Of alcohol, Thoreau wrote, "I would fain keep sober always. ... I believe that water is the only drink for a wise man; wine is not so noble a liquor. ... Of all ebriosity, who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes?"&lt;ref name="Cheever241" /&gt;

===Sexuality===
Thoreau [[bachelor|never married]] and was [[childless]]. He strove to portray himself as an ascetic puritan. However, his sexuality has long been the subject of speculation, including by his contemporaries. Critics have called him heterosexual, homosexual, or asexual.&lt;ref name=harding/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=18_EHFSqSwwC&amp;lpg=PA68 | title=Millennial Seduction | author=Quinby, Lee | page=68| isbn=0801486017 | year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence to suggest he had physical relations with anyone, man or woman. Some scholars have suggested that homoerotic sentiments run through his writings and concluded that he was homosexual.&lt;ref name=harding&gt;Harding, Walter (1991). "Thoreau's Sexuality".

New York: Routledge. pp. 157–73.&lt;/ref&gt; The elegy ''Sympathy'' was inspired by the eleven-year-old Edmund Sewell, with whom he hiked for five days in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robbins|first= Paula Ivaska|title=The Natural Thoreau|work= ''The Gay And Lesbian Review'', September–October 2011|url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/890209875}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar has suggested that he wrote the poem to Edmund because he could not bring himself to write it to Edmund's sister,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Robert; Moser, Barry (1986). ''Henry Thoreau: A Life of the Mind''. University of California Press. pp. 58–63.&lt;/ref&gt; and another that Thoreau's "emotional experiences with women are memorialized under a camouflage of masculine pronouns",&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Henry Seidel (1939).

''Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the USA''. New York: Meridian. pp. 481–92.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the long paean in ''Walden'' to the French-Canadian woodchopper Alek Therien, which includes allusions to [[Achilles and Patroclus]], is an expression of conflicted desire.&lt;ref&gt;López, Robert Oscar (2007).

In him are the spaces which my orbit traverses".&lt;ref&gt;Bergman, David, ed. (2009). ''Gay American Autobiography: Writings From Whitman to Sedaris''. University of Wisconsin Press. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau was strongly influenced by the moral reformers of his time, and this may have instilled anxiety and guilt over sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Lebeaux, Richard (1984). ''Thoreau's Seasons''. University of Massachusetts Press. p. 386, n. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
{{Green anarchism |expanded=People}}
[[File:John Brown - Treason broadside, 1859.png|thumb|left|John Brown "Treason" Broadside, 1859]]

Thoreau was fervently against [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and actively supported the abolitionist movement.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; He participated in the [[Underground Railroad]], delivered lectures that attacked the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]], and in opposition to the popular opinion of the time, supported radical abolitionist militia leader [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and his party.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Furtak|first=Rick|title=Henry David Thoreau|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thoreau/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks after the ill-fated [[raid on Harpers Ferry]] and in the weeks leading up to Brown's execution, Thoreau regularly delivered a speech to the citizens of Concord, Massachusetts, in which he compared the American government to [[Pontius Pilate]] and likened Brown's execution to the [[crucifixion of Jesus Christ]]:

{{quote|Some eighteen hundred years ago Christ was crucified; this morning, perchance, Captain Brown was hung. These are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links. He is not Old Brown any longer; he is an angel of light.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;}}

In ''[[The Last Days of John Brown]]'', Thoreau described the words and deeds of John Brown as noble and an example of heroism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau:_The_Digital_Collection/Essays The Last Days of John Brown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222023007/http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau%3A_The_Digital_Collection/Essays |date=December 22, 2010 }} from the Writings of Henry David Thoreau: The Digital Collection&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he lamented the newspaper editors who dismissed Brown and his scheme as "crazy".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Thoreau was a proponent of [[limited government]] and [[individualism]]. Although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have, through self-betterment, the kind of government which "governs not at all", he distanced himself from contemporary "no-government men" ([[anarchists]]), writing: "I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government."&lt;ref name="resistance" /&gt;

Thoreau deemed the evolution from [[absolute monarchy]] to [[limited monarchy]] to [[democracy]] as "a progress toward true respect for the individual" and theorized about further improvements "towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man."&lt;ref name="resistance" /&gt; Echoing this belief, he went on to write: "There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly."&lt;ref name="resistance" /&gt;

It is on this basis that Thoreau could so strongly inveigh against British and Catholic power in ''A Yankee in Canada''. Despotic authority had crushed the people's sense of ingenuity and enterprise; the Canadian ''habitants'' had been reduced, in his view, to a perpetual childlike state. Ignoring the recent Rebellions, he argued that there would be no revolution in the St. Lawrence River valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thoreau|first1=Henry David|title=A Yankee in Canada|date=1961|publisher=Harvest House|location=Montreal|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Although Thoreau believed resistance to unjustly exercised authority could be both violent (exemplified in his support for John Brown) and nonviolent (his own example of [[tax resistance]] displayed in ''Resistance to Civil Government''), he regarded [[Pacifism|pacifist]] [[nonresistance]] as temptation to passivity,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau:_The_Digital_Collection/Essays The Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222023007/http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau%3A_The_Digital_Collection/Essays |date=December 22, 2010 }} from the Writings of Henry David Thoreau: The Digital Collection&lt;/ref&gt; writing: "Let not our Peace be proclaimed by the rust on our swords, or our inability to draw them from their scabbards; but let her at least have so much work on her hands as to keep those swords bright and sharp."&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Furthermore, in a formal lyceum debate in 1841, he debated the subject "Is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance?", arguing the affirmative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoreau.eserver.org/mjf/MJF1.html Transcendental Ethos] from The Thoreau Reader&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, his condemnation of the [[Mexican–American War]] did not stem from pacifism, but rather because he considered Mexico "unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army" as a means to expand the slave territory.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Thoreau was [[ambivalence|ambivalent]] towards [[industrialization]] and [[capitalism]]. On one hand he regarded commerce as "unexpectedly confident and serene, adventurous, and unwearied"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; and expressed admiration for its associated [[cosmopolitanism]], writing:

{{quote|I am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me, and I smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from Long Wharf to Lake Champlain, reminding me of foreign parts, of coral reefs, and Indian oceans, and tropical climes, and the extent of the globe. I feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palm-leaf which will cover so many flaxen New England heads the next summer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;}}

On the other hand, he wrote disparagingly of the factory system:

{{quote|I cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing. The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly clad, but, unquestionably, that corporations may be enriched.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;}}

Thoreau also favored [[bioregionalism]], the protection of animals and wild areas, [[free trade]], and taxation for schools and highways.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; He disapproved of the subjugation of Native Americans, slavery, [[technological utopianism]], [[consumerism]], [[philistinism]], mass entertainment, and frivolous applications of technology.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

===Intellectual interests, influences, and affinities===

====Indian sacred texts and philosophy====
Thoreau was influenced by [[Hindu texts|Indian spiritual thought]]. In ''Walden'', there are many overt references to the sacred texts of India. For example, in the first chapter ("Economy"), he writes: "How much more admirable the [[Bhagvat-geeta|Bhagvat-Geeta]] than all the ruins of the East!"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; ''American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia'' classes him as one of several figures who "took a more [[Pantheism|pantheist]] or [[Pandeism|pandeist]] approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia |author = [[John Lachs]] and [[Robert Talisse]] |date = 2007 |isbn = 0415939267 |page = 310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also a characteristic of Hinduism.

Furthermore, in "The Pond in Winter", he equates Walden Pond with the sacred [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganges river]], writing:

[[File:Bhagavata Gita Bishnupur Arnab Dutta 2011.JPG|thumb|right|Krishna teaching Arjuna from ''[[Bhagavata Gita]], ''a text Thoreau read at Walden Pond ]]

{{quote|In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Brahmin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;}}

Thoreau was aware his Ganges imagery could have been factual. He wrote about ice harvesting at Walden Pond. And he knew that New England's [[Ice trade|ice merchants]] were shipping ice to foreign ports, including [[Calcutta]].

Additionally, Thoreau followed various [[Hinduism|Hindu]] customs, including following a [[Rice diet|diet of rice]] ("It was fit that I should live on rice, mainly, who loved so well the philosophy of India."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;), [[Flute-playing|flute playing]] (reminiscent of the favorite musical pastime of [[Krishna]]), and [[yoga]].

In an 1849 letter to his friend H.G.O. Blake, he wrote about yoga and its meaning to him:

{{quote|Free in this world as the birds in the air, disengaged from every kind of chains, those who practice yoga gather in Brahma the certain fruits of their works. Depend upon it that, rude and careless as I am, I would fain practice the yoga faithfully. The yogi, absorbed in contemplation, contributes in his degree to creation; he breathes a divine perfume, he hears wonderful things. Divine forms traverse him without tearing him, and united to the nature which is proper to him, he goes, he acts as animating original matter. To some extent, and at rare intervals, even I am a yogi.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Barbara S. "Why Did Henry David Thoreau Take the Bhagavad-Gita to Walden Pond?" ''Parabola'' 12.1 (Spring 1986): 58–63.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Biology====
[[File:Eggs BSNH 1930.png|thumb|right|Bird eggs found by Thoreau and given to the [[Boston Society of Natural History]]. Those in the nest are of [[yellow warbler]], the other two of [[red-tailed hawk]].]]
Thoreau read contemporary works in the new science of biology, including the works of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Asa Gray]] (Charles Darwin's staunchest American ally).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thoreau was deeply influenced by Humboldt, especially his work [[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]].&lt;ref&gt;Wulf, Andrea. ''The Invention of Nature: Alexander Humboldt's New World''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf 2015, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, Thoreau purchased and read Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. Unlike many natural historians at the time, including [[Louis Agassiz]] who publicly opposed Darwinism in favor of a static view of nature, Thoreau was immediately enthusiastic about the theory of [[evolution by natural selection]] and endorsed it,&lt;ref&gt;Cain, William E. ''A Historical Guide to Henry David Thoreau''. {{ISBN|0195138635}}, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; stating:

{{quote|1=The development theory implies a greater vital force in Nature, because it is more flexible and accommodating, and equivalent to a sort of constant new creation. (A quote from ''On the Origin of Species'' follows this sentence.)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Berger, Michael Benjamin.

{{quote|text=Thoreau's careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time, becoming stronger as the weaknesses Thoreau noted have become more pronounced ...

Thoreau's political writings had little impact during his lifetime, as "his contemporaries did not see him as a theorist or as a radical," viewing him instead as a naturalist. They either dismissed or ignored his political essays, including ''Civil Disobedience''. The only two complete books (as opposed to essays) published in his lifetime, ''Walden'' and ''A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers'' (1849), both dealt with nature, in which he loved to wander."&lt;ref name=McElroy/&gt; His obituary was lumped in with others rather than as a separate article in an 1862 yearbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|date=1863|publisher=D.

Political leaders and reformers like [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]], U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], American civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]], and [[Russian (citizen)|Russian]] author [[Leo Tolstoy]] all spoke of being strongly affected by Thoreau's work, particularly ''Civil Disobedience'', as did "[[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] theorist [[Frank Chodorov]] [who] devoted an entire issue of his monthly, ''Analysis'', to an appreciation of Thoreau."&lt;ref name=Rothbard&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]].

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] noted in his autobiography that his first encounter with the idea of nonviolent resistance was reading "On Civil Disobedience" in 1944 while attending [[Morehouse College]]. He wrote in his autobiography that it was,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, in this courageous New Englander's refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slavery's territory into Mexico, I made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance. Fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system, I was so deeply moved that I reread the work several times. I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau. As a result of his writings and personal witness, we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest. The teachings of Thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement; indeed, they are more alive than ever before. Whether expressed in a sit-in at lunch counters, a freedom ride into Mississippi, a peaceful protest in Albany, Georgia, a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, these are outgrowths of Thoreau's insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice.&lt;ref&gt;King, M.L.

American psychologist B. F. Skinner wrote that he carried a copy of Thoreau's ''Walden'' with him in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F., ''A Matter of Consequences''&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1945, wrote ''[[Walden Two]]'', a fictional utopia about 1,000 members of a community living together inspired by the life of Thoreau.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F., ''Walden Two'' (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau and his fellow [[Transcendentalists]] from [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] were a major inspiration of the composer [[Charles Ives]]. The 4th movement of the [[Concord Sonata]] for piano (with a part for flute, Thoreau's instrument) is a character picture and he also set Thoreau's words.&lt;ref&gt;Burkholder, James Peter.

Thoreau's ideas have impacted and resonated with various strains in the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movement, with [[Emma Goldman]] referring to him as "the greatest American anarchist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Emma Goldman|Goldman, Emma]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5ZYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|title=Anarchism and Other Essays|page=62|year=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green anarchism]] and [[anarcho-primitivism]] in particular have both derived inspiration and ecological points-of-view from the writings of Thoreau. [[John Zerzan]] included Thoreau's text "Excursions" (1863) in his edited compilation of works in the anarcho-primitivist tradition titled ''Against civilization: Readings and reflections''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.fr/dp/toc/0922915989|title=Against Civilization: Readings And Reflections|first=John|last=Zerzan|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Murray Rothbard]], the founder of [[anarcho-capitalism]], has opined that Thoreau was one of the "great intellectual heroes" of his movement.&lt;ref name="Rothbard" /&gt; Thoreau was also an important influence on late-19th-century [[anarchist]] [[naturist|naturism]].&lt;ref name="naturismolibertario"&gt;[http://www.soliobrera.org/pdefs/cuaderno4.pdf#search=%22Antonia%20Maym%C3%B3n%22 El naturismo libertario en la Península Ibérica (1890–1939) by Jose Maria Rosello] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102181805/http://www.soliobrera.org/pdefs/cuaderno4.pdf |date=January 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ortega"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naturismo.org/adn/ediciones/2003/invierno/7e.html|title=Anarchism, Nudism, Naturism|first=Carlos |last=Ortega|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, Thoreau's concepts also held importance within [[individualist anarchist]] circles&lt;ref name="spanishind"&gt;[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html "La insumisión voluntaria.

==Criticism==
Although his writings would receive widespread acclaim, Thoreau's ideas were not universally applauded. Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] judged Thoreau's endorsement of living alone and apart from modern society in natural simplicity to be a mark of "unmanly" [[effeminacy]] and "womanish solitude", while deeming him a self-indulgent "skulker".&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Robert Louis. [http://thoreau.eserver.org/stevens1.html "Henry David Thoreau: His Character and Opinions"]. Cornhill Magazine. June 1880.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] had mixed feelings about Thoreau. He noted that "He is a keen and delicate observer of nature—a genuine observer—which, I suspect, is almost as rare a character as even an original poet; and Nature, in return for his love, seems to adopt him as her especial child, and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness." &lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Hawthorne, ''Passages From the American Note-Books'', entry for September 2, 1842.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he also wrote that Thoreau "repudiated all regular modes of getting a living, and seems inclined to lead a sort of Indian life among civilized men".&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne, ''The Heart of Hawthorne's Journals'', p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borst, Raymond R. ''The Thoreau Log: A Documentary Life of Henry David Thoreau, 1817–1862.'' New York: G.K. Hall, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] detested what he deemed to be the "wicked" and "heathenish" message of ''Walden'', claiming that Thoreau wanted man to "lower himself to the level of a [[woodchuck]] and walk on four legs".&lt;ref&gt;Wagenknecht, Edward. ''John Greenleaf Whittier: A Portrait in Paradox''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1967: 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to such criticisms, English novelist [[George Eliot]], writing for the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', characterized such critics as uninspired and narrow-minded:
{{quote|text=People—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every man's life ordered according to a particular pattern, and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them, may pooh-pooh Mr. Thoreau and this episode in his history, as unpractical and dreamy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New England Quarterly]]'', Vol. 6, No. 4 (Dec., 1933), pp. 733–46&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work ''Walden'' by illustrating the irrelevance of their inquiries:

{{quote|text=I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained. ... Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; ... I trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau ''Walden'' (1854)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Recent criticism has accused Thoreau of hypocrisy, misanthropy, and being sanctimonious, based on his writings in ''Walden'',&lt;ref name=neworker1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum |title=Henry David Thoreau, Hypocrite |last1=Schultz |first1=Kathryn |date=October 19, 2015 |work=The New Yorker |access-date=October 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019170355/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum |archivedate=October 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this criticism has been perceived as highly selective.&lt;ref name=medium1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@TheNewThoreau/why-do-we-love-thoreau-because-he-was-right-175251814c |title=Why do we love Thoreau?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5629">'''Infrasonic Passive Seismic Spectroscopy (IPSS)''' is a Passive Seismic Low Frequency technique used for mapping potential oil and gas hydrocarbon accumulations.

It is part of the geophysical techniques also known under the generic naming [[passive seismic]] which includes also the [[Seismic tomography|Passive Seismic Tomography]] and Micro Seismic Monitoring for petroleum, gas and geothermal applications. In a larger scale, Passive Seismic includes the [[IRIS Consortium|Global Seismic Network]] earthquakes monitoring (GSN).

Regarding petroleum and geothermal exploration (within a small scale), effect of fluid distribution on P- wave propagation in partially saturated rocks is the main responsible for the low frequency reservoir-related [http://www.pgexploration.com/resources/publications/ wavefield absorption].
 
The high level of attenuation, within the infrasonic bandwidth (below 10&amp;nbsp;Hz) of the seismic field observed in natural oil-saturated porous media during the last years (successfully explained by [https://books.google.it/books?id=_TkPCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=mesoscopic+homogeneous+seismic+models&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EJtCq_D0ip&amp;sig=uPNi3LY5j98O84W-7Sdntefr0sU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXuKqmqazXAhVPahoKHbHdBsAQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=mesoscopic%20homogeneous%20seismic%20models&amp;f=false mesoscopic homogeneous models]) is the main responsible of the passive seismic wave field shifting within a low frequency range.
 
Pressure differences between regions with different fluid/solid properties induce frequency-dependency of the attenuation (Qp and Qs reservoir factors) and velocity dispersion (Vp, Vs) of the low frequency wave field.

Infrasonic Passive Seismic Spectroscopy techniques quantifies then the absorption and the wave field dispersion within the low frequency bandwidth giving the most predominant areas linked with possible oil-saturated and porous media.

The low frequency seismic field is not usually reachable by the active seismic surveys being either the explosive waves mainly in the high frequency and the vibroseis currently built not to reach such a low frequencies.

Referred to as an "acclaimed Southern naturalist,"&lt;ref name="barnes_touching"&gt;[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/touching-earth-janet-lembke/1004542082?ean=9781580800884 Barnes &amp; Noble review of ''Touching Earth'' by Janet Lembke]&lt;/ref&gt; she was equally (as [[The Chicago Tribune]] described her) a "classicist, a noted Oxford University Press translator of the works of Sophocles, Euripides and Aeschylus".&lt;ref name="chicago_tribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-01-26/features/9501260188_1_skinny-dipping-essay-water-flows|title=Janet Lembke's Essays Get The Skinny On Essentials|last=Leardi|first=Jeanette|date=26 January 1995|work=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to translate [[Virgil]]'s [[Georgics]],&lt;ref name="poets_writers" /&gt; having already translated [[Euripides]]' ''Electra'' and ''Hecuba'', and [[Aeschylus]]'s ''Persians'' and ''Suppliants''.

Janet Lembke's first book was ''Bronze and Iron: Old Latin Poetry from Its Beginnings to 100 B.C.'' (1973), but beyond  translations and essays about classics, there were more than a dozen books on nature, works for which the author acquired a base of admirers. Her articles were printed in [[The New York Times]], ''[http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/ Sierra Magazine]'' ([[The Sierra Club]]), [[Oxford American]], [[Audubon (magazine)|Audubon]], [[Raleigh News and Observer]], [[Southern Review]] and other publications. The writing style was eclectic and personal, meditative and detailed, and though she was at least once accused of "taking poetic license too far"&lt;ref name="bryn_mawr"&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005-08-06.html Criticism of Lembke's translation of ''The Georgics'']. ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in her translation of ''Georgics'', readers were often charmed and seduced by her way of weaving scientific fact, history and culture, with personal anecdote, mythological allusion and poetic feeling. "The author's ability to pull together disparate elements in her writing is impressive, and her passionate connection with the natural world is displayed in line after line," wrote [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref name="skinnydipping_nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/books/in-short-nonfiction-040029.html|title=SKINNY DIPPING And Other Immersions in Water, Myth, and Being Human. By Janet Lembke.|last=Hanson|first=Elizabeth|date=18 December 1994|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[Annie Proulx]] expressed a similar perception, observing that "Lembke's writing tacks between three points: the stuff of her late-twentieth-century life; the tangle of creature and plant in every dimension of tide and river flow; and the haunting, connecting wires of mythos that still knot us  to the ancient beginnings."&lt;ref name="Lembke2003"&gt;Annie Proulx on Lembke: {{cite book|author=Janet Lembke|title=The Quality of Life: Living Well, Dying Well|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDNtM_f1tdEC&amp;pg=PA214|year=2003|publisher=[[Lyons Press]]|isbn=978-1-59228-128-2|pages=214–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Janet Lembke's noted titles were ''Because the Cat Purrs: How We Relate to Other Species and Why It Matters'' (2008); ''Skinny Dipping: And Other Immersions in Water, Myth, and Being Human'' (2004); ''Dangerous Birds'' (1996); ''River Time'' (1997); ''Despicable Species: On Cowbirds, Kudzu, Hornworms, and Other Scourges'' (1999); and ''The Quality of Life: Living Well, Dying Well'' (2004)-- a sober and unflinching account of the death of the author's mother. At the time of her own death at age 80 in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], [[Virginia (state)|Virginia]], Janet Lembke was working on a memoir, ''I Married an Arsonist''. She had married twice, and had four children and six grandchildren.&lt;ref name="janet_obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsleader.com/article/20130905/OBITUARIES/309050008 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140110102633/http://www.newsleader.com/article/20130905/OBITUARIES/309050008 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 January 2014 |title=Obituary: Janet N.

'''Loren Eiseley''' (September 3, 1907 – July 9, 1977) was an American [[anthropologist]], [[educator]], [[philosopher]], and [[natural science]] writer, who taught and published books from the 1950s through the 1970s. He received many [[honorary degree]]s and was a fellow of multiple professional societies. At his death, he was Benjamin Franklin Professor of Anthropology and History of Science at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

He was a "scholar and writer of imagination and grace," whose reputation and accomplishments extended far beyond the campus where he taught for 30 years. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' referred to him as "the modern [[Thoreau]]." The broad scope of his writing reflected upon such topics as the mind of [[Sir Francis Bacon]], the [[prehistoric]] origins of man, and the contributions of [[Charles Darwin]].

Eiseley's reputation was established primarily through his books, including ''The Immense Journey'' (1957), ''Darwin's Century'' (1958), ''The Unexpected Universe'' (1969), ''The Night Country'' (1971), and his memoir, ''All the Strange Hours'' (1975). Science author [[Orville Prescott]] praised him as a scientist who "can write with poetic sensibility and with a fine sense of wonder and of reverence before the mysteries of life and nature." Naturalist author Mary Ellen Pitts saw his combination of literary and nature writings as his "quest, not simply for bringing together science and literature... but a continuation of what the 18th and 19th century British naturalists and Thoreau had done." In praise of "The Unexpected Universe", [[Ray Bradbury]] remarked, "[Eiseley] is every writer's writer, and every human's human... One of us, yet most uncommon..."  
 
According to his obituary in the ''[[New York Times]]'', the feeling and philosophical motivation of the entire body of Eiseley's work was best expressed in one of his essays, ''The Enchanted Glass:'' "The anthropologist wrote of the need for the contemplative [[naturalist]], a man who, in a less frenzied era, had time to observe, to speculate, and to dream."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Blum, Howard. ''Loren Eiseley, Anthropologist, 69; Eloquent Writer on Man and Nature'', ''New York Times'', (Obituary) July 11, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death he received an award from the [[Boston Museum of Science]] for his "outstanding contribution to the public understanding of science" and another from the U.S. [[Humane Society]] for his "significant contribution for the improvement of life and environment in this country."

==Early life==
Born in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]], Eiseley lived his childhood with a hardworking father and deaf mother who may have suffered from [[mental illness]]. Their home was located on the outskirts of town where, as author Naomi Brill writes, it was "removed from the people and the community from which they felt set apart through poverty and family misfortune."&lt;ref name=Brill&gt;Brill, Naomi. [http://www.eiseley.org/biography.php Loren Eiseley Society (LES)]&lt;/ref&gt; His autobiography, ''All the Strange Hours'', begins with his "childhood experiences as a sickly afterthought, weighed down by the loveless union of his parents."&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt;

His father, Clyde, was a hardware salesman who worked long hours for little pay, writes Brill. However, as an amateur [[Shakespearean]] actor, he was able to give his son a "love for beautiful language and writing."&lt;ref name=Brill /&gt; His mother, Daisey Corey, was a self-taught prairie artist who was considered a beautiful woman. She lost her hearing as a child and sometimes exhibited irrational and destructive behavior. This left Eiseley feeling distant from her and may have contributed to his parents' unhappy marriage.

Living at the edge of town, however, led to Eiseley's early interest in the natural world, to which he turned when being at home was too difficult. There, he would play in the caves and creek banks nearby.&lt;ref name=Minn&gt;[[Minnesota State University, Mankato|Minnesota State University]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20100603182329/https://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/abcde/eiseley_loren.html EMuseum's Eiseley biography] ([[Internet Archive]] of website defunct since 2011), Retrieved 2015-10-16&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, there were others who opened the door to a happier life. His half-brother, Leo, for instance, gave him a copy of ''[[Robinson Crusoe (novel)|Robinson Crusoe]]'', with which he taught himself to read. Thereafter, he managed to find ways to get to the public library and became a voracious reader.&lt;ref name=Brill/&gt;

Eiseley later attended the Lincoln Public Schools; in high school, he wrote that he wanted to be a [[nature writer]]. He would later describe the lands around Lincoln as "flat and grass-covered and smiling so serenely up at the sun that they seemed forever youthful, untouched by mind or time&amp;mdash;a sunlit, timeless prairie over which nothing passed but antelope or wandering bird."&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt; But, disturbed by his home situation and the illness and recent death of his father, he dropped out of school and worked at menial jobs.

Eiseley enrolled in the [[University of Nebraska]], where he wrote for the newly formed journal, ''[[Prairie Schooner]]'', and went on [[archaeology]] digs for the school's [[natural history]] [[museum]], [[University of Nebraska State Museum|Morrill Hall]].&lt;ref name=Brill/&gt;  In 1927, however, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and left the university to move to the western [[desert]], believing the drier air would improve his condition. While there, he soon became restless and unhappy, which led him to hoboing around the country by hopping on freight trains (as many did during the [[Great Depression]]).&lt;ref name=Strange&gt;Eiseley, Loren. ''All the Strange Hours'', (1975) Scribner&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor of religion, Richard Wentz, writes about this period:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Loren Eiseley had been a drifter in his youth. From the plains of Nebraska he had wandered across the American West. Sometimes sickly, at other times testing his strength with that curious band of roving exiles who searched the land above the rippling railroad ties, he explored his soul as he sought to touch the distant past. He became a naturalist and a bone hunter because something about the landscape had linked his mind to the birth and death of life itself.&lt;ref name=Wentz&gt;Wentz, Richard E., [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1391 The American Spirituality of Loren Eiseley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007182240/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1391 |date=2009-10-07 }} ''Christian Century'', April 25, 1984,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Academic career==
Eiseley eventually returned to the University of Nebraska and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in [[English studies|English]] and a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in [[Geology]]/[[Anthropology]]. While at the university, he served as editor of the literary magazine ''The Prairie Schooner'', and published his poetry and short stories. Undergraduate expeditions to western Nebraska and the southwest to hunt for fossils and human artifacts provided the inspiration for much of his early work. He later noted that he came to anthropology from paleontology, preferring to leave human burial sites undisturbed unless destruction threatened them.

Eiseley received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1937 and wrote his dissertation entitled "Three Indices of Quaternary Time and Their Bearing Upon Pre-History: a Critique", which launched his academic career.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He began teaching at the [[University of Kansas]] that same year. During [[World War II]], Eiseley taught anatomy to reservist pre-med students at Kansas.

In 1944 he left the University of Kansas to assume the role of head of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at [[Oberlin College]] in [[Ohio]]. In 1947 he returned to the University of Pennsylvania to head its Anthropology Department. He was elected president of the American Institute of Human [[Paleontology]] in 1949. From 1959 to 1961, he was [[Provost (education)|provost]] at the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1961 the University of Pennsylvania created a special interdisciplinary professorial chair for him.

Eiseley was also a fellow of many distinguished professional societies, including the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

At the time of his death in 1977, he was Benjamin Franklin Professor of Anthropology and History of Science, and the curator of the Early Man section at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]].&lt;ref name=Penn&gt;University of Pennsylvania Almanac, [http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/volumes/v54/n10/eiseley.html Loren Eiseley’s 100th Birthday Celebration at the Penn Museum] October 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  He had received thirty-six [[honorary degrees]] over a period of twenty years, and was the most honored member of the University of Pennsylvania since [[Benjamin Franklin]]. In 1976 he won the [[Bradford Washburn]] Award of the [[Boston Museum of Science]] for his "outstanding contribution to the public understanding of science" and the [[Joseph Wood Krutch]] Medal from the [[Humane Society of the United States]] for his "significant contribution for the improvement of life and the environment in this country."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Books==
In addition to his scientific and academic work, Eiseley began in the mid-1940s to publish the essays which brought him to the attention of a wider audience. Anthropologist Pat Shipman writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;the words that flowed from his pen... the images and insights he revealed, the genius of the man as a writer, outweigh his social disability. The words were what kept him in various honored posts; the words were what caused the students to flock to his often aborted courses; the words were what earned him esteemed lectureships and prizes. His contemporaries failed to see the duality of the man, confusing the deep, wise voice of Eiseley's writings with his own personal voice. He was a natural fugitive, a fox at the wood's edge (in his own metaphor)...&lt;ref name=Shipman&gt;Shipman, Pat. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D7113EF93AA2575BC0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print An Anthropologist With Bite]''New York Times'', August 19, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eiseley published works in a number of different genres including poetry, autobiography, history of science, biography, and nonfictional essays. In each piece of writing, he consistently used a poetic writing style. Eiseley's style mirrors what he called the concealed essay—a piece of writing that unites the personal dimension with more scientific thoughts.&lt;ref name=Wisner&gt;Wisner, William. "The Perilous Self: Loren Eiseley And The Reticence Of Autobiography." Sewanee Review 113.1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; His writing was unique in that it could convey complex ideas about human origin and the relationship between humans and the natural world to a nonscientific audience. Robert G. Franke describes Eiseley's essays as theatrical and dramatic. He also notes the influence his father's hobby as an amateur [[Shakespearean]] actor may have had on Eiseley's writing, pointing out that his essays often contain dramatic elements that are usually present in plays.&lt;ref name=Franke&gt;Franke, Robert. Journal of American Culture. "A Great Stage, A Great Play: The Theatrical And Tragic In Loren Eiseley's Essays.", 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing Eiseley's writing, Richard Wentz wrote, "As the works of any naturalist might, Eiseley's essays and poems deal with the flora and fauna of [[North America]]. They probe the concept of evolution, which consumed so much of his scholarly attention, examining the bones and shards, the arrowpoints and buried treasures. Every scientific observation leads to reflection." &lt;ref name=Wentz /&gt;

In an interview on [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), author [[Michael Lind]] said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before the rise of a self-conscious intelligentsia, most educated people &amp;ndash; as well as the unlettered majority &amp;ndash; spent most of their time in the countryside or, if they lived in cities, were a few blocks away from farmland or wilderness... At the risk of sounding countercultural, I suspect that thinkers who live in sealed, air-conditioned boxes and work by artificial light (I am one) are as unnatural as apes in cages at zoos. Naturalists like Eiseley in that sense are the most normal human beings to be found among intellectuals, because they spend a lot of time outdoors and know the names of the plants and animals they see... For all of his scientific erudition, Eiseley has a poetic, even cinematic, imagination.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;Lind, Michael. [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5634196&amp;live=1 NPR radio interview], October 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Purposes of his writings===
Richard Wentz describes what he feels are the significance and purposes of Eiseley's writings:&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;"For Loren Eiseley, writing itself becomes a form of contemplation. Contemplation is a kind of human activity in which the mind, spirit and body are directed in solitude toward some other. Scholars and critics have not yet taken the full measure of contemplation as an art that is related to the purpose of all scholarly activity &amp;ndash; to see things as they really are... Using narrative, parable and exposition, Eiseley has the uncanny ability to make us feel that we are accompanying him on a journey into the very heart of the universe. Whether he is explicating history or commenting on the ideas of a philosopher, a scientist or a theologian, he takes us with him on a personal visit."

However, because of Eiseley's intense and poetic writing style and his focus on nature and [[cosmology]], he was not accepted or understood by most of his colleagues. "You," a friend told him, "are a freak, you know. A God-damned freak, and life is never going to be easy for you. You like scholarship, but the scholars, some of them, anyhow, are not going to like you because you don't stay in the hole where God supposedly put you. You keep sticking your head out and looking around. In a university that's inadvisable." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

===1950s===
;''The Immense Journey'' (1957)
His first book, ''The Immense Journey'', was a collection of writings about the history of humanity, and it proved to be that rare science book that appealed to a mass audience. It has sold over a million copies and has been published in at least 16 languages.&lt;ref name=proclamation/&gt; Besides being his first book, ''The Immense Journey'' was also Eiseley's most well known book and established him as a writer with the ability to combine science and humanity in a poetic way.&lt;ref name=Brill /&gt; This book was originally published in 1946.&lt;ref name=Brill /&gt; Then, it was published again in 1957, a few years after the [[Piltdown Man]] hoax discovery.

In the book Eiseley conveys his sense of wonder at the depth of time and the vastness of the universe. He uses his own experiences, reactions to the paleontological record, and wonderment at the world to address the topic of evolution. More specifically, the text concentrates on human evolution and human ignorance. In ''The Immense Journey'', Eiseley follows the journey from human ignorance at the beginning of life to his own wonderment about the future of mankind. [[Marston Bates]] writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems to me... that Eiseley is looking at man in a quite hard-headed fashion, because he is willing to sketch problems for which he has no present and sure solution. We are not going to find the answers in human evolution until we have framed the right questions, and the questions are difficult because they involve both body and mind, physique and culture—tools and symbols as well as cerebral configurations.&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;Bates, Marston. "Science", 1958&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author Orville Prescott wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Consider the case of Loren Eiseley, author of ''The Immense Journey'', who can sit on a mountain slope beside a prairie-dog town and imagine himself back in the dawn of the [[Age of mammals]] eighty million years ago:  'There by a tree root I could almost make him out, that shabby little [[Paleocene]] rat, eternal tramp and world wanderer, father of all mankind.' ... his prose is often lyrically beautiful, something that considerable reading in the works of anthropologists had not led me to expect. ... The subjects discussed here include the human ancestral tree, water and its significance to life, the mysteries of cellular life, 'the secret and remote abysses' of the sea, the riddle of why human beings alone among living creatures have brains capable of abstract thought and are far superior to their mere needs for survival, the reasons why Dr. Eiseley is convinced that there are no men or man-like animals on other planets, ....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He offers an example of Eiseley's style: "There is no logical reason for the existence of a snowflake any more than there is for evolution. It is an apparition from that mysterious shadow world beyond nature, that final world which contains&amp;mdash;if anything contains&amp;mdash;the explanation of men and catfish and green leaves."&lt;ref name=Prescott&gt;Prescott, Orville. "Books of the Times," ''New York Times'', December 27, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Darwin's Century'' (1958)
This book's subtitle is, "Evolution and the Men Who Discovered It." Eiseley documented that animal variation, extinction, and a lengthy history of the earth were observed from the 1600s onward. Scientists groped towards a theory with increasingly detailed observations. They became aware that evolution had occurred without knowing how. Evolution was "in the air" and part of the intellectual discourse both before and after ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published. The publisher describes it thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the heart of the account is Charles Darwin, but the story neither begins nor ends with him. Starting with the seventeenth-century notion of the [[Great Chain of Being]], Dr. Eiseley traces the achievements and discoveries of men in many fields of science who paved the way for Darwin; and the book concludes with an extensive discussion of the ways in which Darwin's work has been challenged, improved upon, and occasionally refuted during the past hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Century,'' back cover&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Persons whose contributions are discussed include [[Sir Thomas Browne]], [[Sir Francis Bacon]], [[Carl Linnaeus]],  [[Benoît de Maillet]], the [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]], [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[Louis Agassiz]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[James Hutton]], [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[Georges Cuvier]], [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Sir Charles Lyell]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], [[William Charles Wells|William Wells]], [[Patrick Matthew]], [[Karl von Baer]], [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], [[John Richardson (naturalist)|Sir John Richardson]], [[Alexander Humboldt]], [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Hugo De Vries]], [[Wilhelm Johannsen|W. L. Johannsen]], [[Adolphe Quetelet|Lambert Quételet]], and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]. Critics discussed include [[Fleeming Jenkin]], [[Alfred William Bennett|A.W. Bennett]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], and [[Adam Sedgwick]], both a mentor and a critic.&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Century'' as a whole&lt;/ref&gt;

According to naturalist author Mary Ellen Pitts, in the "seminal" ''Darwin's Century'', Eiseley was studying the history of evolutionary thinking, and he came to see that "as a result of scientific studies, nature has become externalized, particularized, mechanized, separated from the human and fragmented, reduced to conflict without consideration of cooperation, confined to [[reductionist]] and [[positivist]] study." The results for humankind, "as part of the '[[Biota (ecology)|biota]]' &amp;ndash; Eiseley's concern as a writer &amp;ndash; are far reaching." In the book, his unique impact as a thinker and a literary figure emerges as he reexamines science and the way man understands science. She concludes that, for Eiseley, "Nature emerges as a [[metonym]] for a view of the physical world, of the 'biota,' and of humankind that must be reexamined if life is to survive."&lt;ref name=Pitts&gt;Pitts, Mary Ellen. ''Toward a Dialogue of Understandings: Loren Eiseley and the Critique of Science'', Lehigh University Press (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his conclusion, Eiseley quotes Darwin: "If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, disease, suffering and famine&amp;mdash;our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements&amp;mdash;they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor&amp;mdash;we may be all melted together." Eiseley adds, "If he had never conceived of natural selection, if he had never written the ''Origin,'' it would still stand as a statement of almost clairvoyant perception."&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Century,'' page 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book won the [[Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science|Phi Beta Kappa prize for best book in science]] in 1958.

In discussing ''The Firmament of Time'', Professor of Zoology Leslie Dunn wrote, "How can man of 1960, burdened with the knowledge of the world external to him, and with the consciousness that scientific knowledge is attained through continually interfering with nature, 'bear his part' and gain the hope and confidence to live in the new world to which natural science has given birth? ... The answer comes in the eloquent, moving central essay of his new book."&lt;ref name=Dunn&gt;Dunn, Leslie C. "Natural Law and Science," ''The New York Times'', August 7, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New Yorker'' wrote, "Dr. Eiseley describes with zest and admiration the giant steps that have led man, in a scant three hundred years, to grasp the nature of his extraordinary past and to substitute a natural world for a world of divine creation and intervention... An irresistible inducement to partake of the almost forgotten excitements of reflection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0803267398|title=The Firmament of Time|first1=Loren|last1=Eiseley|first2=Gary|last2=Holthaus|date=1 May 1999|publisher=Bison Books|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''The Chicago Tribune'' added, "[This book] has a warm feeling for all natural phenomena; it has a rapport with man and his world and his problems; ... it has hope and belief.

{{see also|The Star Thrower}}

Poet [[W.H. Auden]] wrote, "The main theme of ''The Unexpected Universe'' is Man as the Quest Hero, the wanderer, the voyager, the seeker after adventure, knowledge, power, meaning, and righteousness."&lt;ref name=Auden&gt;Auden, W.H.[http://southerncrossreview.org/44/auden-eiseley.htm Introduction to ''The Star Thrower'']&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes from the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every time we walk along a beach some ancient urge disturbs us so that we find ourselves shedding shoes and garments or scavenging among seaweed and whitened timbers like the homesick refugees of a long war... Mostly the animals understand their roles, but man, by comparison, seems troubled by a message that, it is often said, he cannot quite remember or has gotten wrong... Bereft of instinct, he must search continually for meanings... Man was a reader before he became a writer, a reader of what [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] once called the mighty alphabet of the universe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Evolutionary biologist [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] described Dr. Eiseley as

{{quote|...a [[Proust]] miraculously turned into an evolutionary anthropologist...", and science fiction novelist [[Ray Bradbury]] wrote glowing reviews of many of his books including this one. ... "Here he writes from a naturalist's perspective on the unexpected and symbolic aspects of the universe. Read about seeds, [[hieroglyphs]] on shells, the [[Ice Age]], lost tombs, city dumps and primitive Man. The underlying theme is the desolation and renewal of our planet's history and experience.

Loren Eiseley's dark, brooding prose is unique in the annals of nature writing. ''The Unexpected Universe'' features some of what are considered Eiseley's best essays. Heavily autobiographical and deeply personal, these essays are not cheerful ramblings on the joy of communing with nature. They are bleak, lonely musings on the human condition.}}

===1970s===
;''The Invisible Pyramid (1971) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ukuhJFtLugcC Read excerpts online]
Gregory McNamee of Amazon.com writes, "In 1910 young Loren Eiseley watched the passage of [[Halley's Comet]] with his father. The boy who became a famous naturalist was never again to see the spectacle except in his imagination. That childhood event contributed to the profound sense of time and space that marks ''The Invisible Pyramid''. This collection of essays, first published shortly after Americans landed on the moon, explores inner and outer space, the vastness of the cosmos, and the limits of what can be known. Bringing poetic insight to scientific discipline, Eiseley makes connections between civilizations past and present, multiple universes, humankind, and nature.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eiseley took the occasion of the lunar landing to consider how far humans had to go in understanding their own small corner of the universe, their home planet, much less what he called the 'cosmic prison' of space. Likening humans to the microscopic phagocytes that dwell within our bodies, he grumpily remarks, 'We know only a little more extended reality than the hypothetical creature below us. Above us may lie realms it is beyond our power to grasp.' Science, he suggests, would be better put to examining that which lies immediately before us, although he allows that the quest to explore space is so firmly rooted in Western technological culture that it was unlikely to be abandoned simply because of his urging. Eiseley's opinion continues to be influential among certain environmentalists, and these graceful essays show why that should be so.&lt;ref&gt;McNamee, Gregory [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/080326738X Amazon.com book description]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Book excerpt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Man would not be man if his dreams did not exceed his grasp. ... Like [[John Donne]], man lies in a close prison, yet it is dear to him. Like Donne's, his thoughts at times overleap the sun and pace beyond the body. If I term humanity a [[slime mold]] organism it is because our present environment suggest it. If I remember the sunflower forest it is because from its hidden reaches man arose. The green world is his sacred center. In moments of sanity he must still seek refuge there. ... If I dream by contrast of the eventual drift of the star voyagers through the dilated time of the universe, it is because I have seen [[thistle]]down off to new worlds and am at heart a voyager who, in this modern time, still yearns for the lost country of his birth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Kirkus Reviews]] wrote,

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;like the medievalists, Eiseley reads nature as the second book of God's revelation, mysterious and heavy with latent, lurking fertility. His sizable audience should welcome the latest voyage in search of the secret springs of creativity - evolutionary, cosmic, mental - as a muted adumbration of temporal mortality." Other reviews: "Eiseley has met strange creatures in the night country, and he tells marvelous stories about them ... For Eiseley, storytelling is never pure entertainment.

&lt;blockquote&gt;An old man who had done almost all of his writing late, late at night, was speaking to a younger man who liked to read in those same dark hours.

I, who do not sleep, can tell you this.'

"In ''All the Strange Hours''," states Amazon.com,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eiseley turns his considerable powers of reflection and discovery on his own life to weave a compelling story, related with the modesty, grace, and keen eye for a telling anecdote that distinguish his work. His story begins with his childhood experiences as a sickly afterthought, weighed down by the loveless union of his parents. From there he traces the odyssey that led to his search for early postglacial man—and into inspiriting philosophical territory—culminating in his uneasy achievement of world renown. Eiseley crafts an absorbing self-portrait of a man who has thought deeply about his place in society as well as humanity's place in the natural world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just before his death Eiseley asked his wife to destroy the personal notebooks which he had kept since 1953. However, she compromised by disassembling them so they couldn't be used. Later, after great effort, his good friend Kenneth Heuer managed to reassemble most of his notebooks into readable form. ''The Lost Notebooks of Loren Eiseley'' includes a variety of Eiseley's writings including childhood stories, sketches while he was a vagabond, old family pictures, unpublished poems, portions of unfinished novels, and letters to and from literary admirers like [[W.H. Auden]], [[Howard Nemerov]], [[Lewis Mumford]] and [[Ray Bradbury]].

In a review of the book, author Robert Finch writes, "Like [[Herman Melville|Melville]], Eiseley thought of himself, and by extension all mankind, as 'an orphan, a wood child, a changeling,' a cosmic outcast born into a world that afforded him no true home." He adds that his "distinctive gift as a writer was to take powerfully formative personal influences of family and place and fuse them with his intellectual meditations on universal topics such as evolution, human consciousness and the weight of time. ... he found metaphors that released a powerful view of man's fate in the modern world." As Kenneth Heuer writes, "there are countless examples of Eiseley's empathy with life in all its forms, and particularly with its lost outcasts...the love that transcends the boundaries of species was the highest spiritual expression he knew.&lt;ref name=Notebook&gt;Finch, Robert. ''New York Times'', September 20, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Finch adds, "We are grateful for a life and a sensibility that would be welcome in any age, but never more so than in our increasingly depersonalized world. ... he made a generation of readers 'see the world through his eyes.' In an undated passage, circa 1959, Eiseley wrote, 'Man is alone in the universe...Only in the act of love, in rare and hidden communion with nature, does man escape himself.'" ''The Lost Notebooks'' contains numerous examples of his "creative and sympathetic imagination, even when that creation takes place in the solitude of journals never meant for public eyes."&lt;ref name=Notebook/&gt;

From other reviews: "Eiseley has rightly been called 'the modern [[Thoreau]].'" –''Publishers Weekly;'' "[an] extensive and enlightening glimpses ... into the intellectual and emotional workshop of one of the most original and influential American essayists of this century." –''New York Times Book Review;''  "Eiseley's great genius for the art of the word coupled with a poetic insight into the connection between science and humanism shines through in page after page... This is a book that will be read and quoted and whose pages will grow thin with wear from hands in continued search of new meaning within its words and images." –''Los Angeles Times;''  "it will enhance any dedicated reader's knowledge of this most remarkable literary naturalist... They provide more than a glimpse into Eiseley's mind and imagination." –''The Bloomsbury Review;''   "It is a joy, like finding a lost Rembrandt in the attic, to discover that Eiseley left behind a legacy." –''San Francisco Examiner-Chronicle.''&lt;ref&gt;Book review of ''The Lost Notebooks'' [http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/catalog/productinfo.aspx?id=672121&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 University of Nebraska Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612073946/http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/catalog/productinfo.aspx?id=672121&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |date=2011-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical significance ==

===Religion ===
Richard Wentz, professor of religious studies, noted that ''The Christian Century'' magazine called attention to a study of Loren Eiseley by saying: "The religious chord did not sound in him, but he vibrated to many of the concerns historically related to religion." Wentz adds, "Although Eiseley may not have considered his writing as an expression of American spiritually, one feels that he was quite mindful of its religious character. As an heir of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Thoreau]], he is at home among the poets and [[philosopher]]s and among those scientists whose observations also were a form of contemplation of the universe."

But Wentz considered the inherent contradictions in the statements: "We do not really know what to do with religiousness when it expresses itself outside those enclosures which historians and social scientists have carefully labeled religions. What, after all, does it mean to say, "the religious chord does not sound in someone," but that the person vibrates to the concerns historically related to religion? If the person vibrates to such concerns, the chord is religious whether or not it manages to resound in the temples and prayer houses of the devout."&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

Wentz quotes Eiseley, from ''All the Strange Hours'' and ''The Star Thrower'', to indicate that he was, in fact, a religious thinker:

{{quote|I am treading deeper and deeper into leaves and silence. I see more faces watching, non-human faces. Ironically, I who profess no religion find the whole of my life a religious pilgrimage.

The religious forms of the present leave me unmoved. My eye is round, open, and undomesticated as an owl's in a primeval forest -- a world that for me has never truly departed.

Like the toad in my shirt we were in the hands of God, but we could not feel him; he was beyond us, totally and terribly beyond our limited- senses.

Man is not as other creatures and. . . without the sense of the holy, without compassion, his brain can become a gray stalking horror -- the deviser of [[Belsen]].}}

Wentz encompasses such quotes in his partial conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was indeed a scientist – a bone hunter, he called himself. [[Archaeologist]], [[anthropologist]] and naturalist, he devoted a great deal of time and reflection to the detective work of scientific observation. However, if we are to take seriously his essays, we cannot ignore the evidence of his constant meditation on matters of ultimate order and meaning.&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt; Science writer Connie Barlow says Eiseley wrote eloquent books from a perspective that today would be called [[Religious Naturalism]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metanexus.net/blog/ritualizing-big-history  |title=Ritualizing Big History March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Evolution===
Wentz writes, "Loren Eiseley is very much in the tradition of [[Henry David Thoreau]]. He takes the circumstances of whatever "business" he is about as the occasion for new questioning, new searching for some sign, some glimpse into the meaning of the unknown that confronts him at every center of existence." He quotes Eiseley from ''The Star Thrower'', "We are, in actuality, students of that greater order known as nature. It is into nature that man vanishes." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

In comparing Eiseley with Thoreau, he discusses clear similarities in their life and philosophies. He notes that Eiseley was, like Thoreau, a 'spiritual wanderer through the deserts of the modern world.' However, notes Wentz, "Thoreau had left the seclusion of [[Walden Pond]] in order to pace the fields of history, sorting out the artifacts that people had dropped along the way." But "it was those 'fossil thoughts' and 'mindprints' that Eiseley himself explored in his wanderings. These explorations gave depth, a tragic dimension and catharsis to what he called the 'one great drama that concerns us most, the supreme mystery, man.'"&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

Eiseley's writing often includes his belief that mankind does not have enough evidence to determine exactly how humans came to be. In ''The Immense Journey'', he writes, "…many lines of seeming relatives, rather than merely one, lead to man. It is as though we stood at the heart of a maze and no longer remembered how we had come there." According to Wentz, Eiseley realized that there is nothing below a certain depth that can truly be explained, and quotes Eiseley as saying that there is "nothing to explain the necessity of life, nothing to explain the hunger of the elements to become life . . . ."  and that "the human version of evolutionary events [is] perhaps too simplistic for belief." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

===Science and progress===
Eiseley talked about the illusions of science in his book, ''The Firmament of Time'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;A scientist writing around the turn of the century remarked that all of the past generations of men have lived and died in a world of illusion. The unconscious irony in his observation consists in the fact that this man assumed the progress of science to have been so great that a clear vision of the world without illusion was, by his own time, possible. It is needless to add that he wrote before [[Einstein]]... at a time when [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]] was just about to be rediscovered, and before the advances in the study of radioactivity...&lt;ref&gt;Templeton, Robert L. ''Is God the Only Reality?'', Templeton Foundation Press (1994), quoted by, pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wentz noted Eiseley's belief that science may have become misguided in its goals: "Loren Eiseley thought that much of the modern scientific enterprise had removed humanity ever farther from its sense of responsibility to the natural world it had left in order to create an artificial world to satisfy its own insatiable appetites." Interpreting Eiseley's messages, he adds, "It would be well, he tells us, to heed the message of the [[Buddha]], who knew that 'one cannot proceed upon the path of human [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] until one has made interiorly in one's soul a road into the future.' Spaces within stretch as far as those without." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

===Purpose for mankind===
"In essay after essay," writes Wentz, "he writes as a [[magus]], a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] master or a [[shaman]] who has seen into the very heart of the universe and shares his healing vision with those who live in a world of feeble sight. We must learn to see again, he tells us; we must rediscover the true center of the self in the otherness of nature."  &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

==Death and burial==
[[Image:Eiseley-headstone.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Loren Eiseley's headstone in West Laurel Hill Cemetery - "We loved the earth but could not stay"]]
Loren Eiseley died July 9, 1977, of cardiac arrest following surgery at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E3DD1F39E334BC4952DFB166838C669EDE |title=Loren Eiseley, Anthropologist, 69; Eloquent Writer on Man and Nature |publisher=Blum, Howard, ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 11, 1977 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in [[West Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in [[Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania]]. Eiseley's wife, Mabel Langdon Eiseley, died July 27, 1986, and is buried next to him, in the Westlawn section of the cemetery, in Lot 366. The inscription on their headstone reads, "We loved the earth but could not stay", which is a line from his poem ''The Little Treasures''.

A library in the [[Lincoln City Libraries]] [[public library]] system is named after Eiseley.

Loren Eiseley was awarded the Distinguished Nebraskan Award and inducted into the [[Nebraska Hall of Fame]]. A bust of his likeness resides in the [[Nebraska State Capitol]].

==Legacy==
In summarizing some of Eiseley's contributions, the editor of ''The Bloomsbury Review'' wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no question that Loren Eiseley maintains a place of eminence among nature writers. His extended explorations of human life and mind, set against the backdrop of our own and other universes are like those to be found in every book of nature writing currently available... We now routinely expect our nature writers to leap across the chasm between science, natural history, and poetry with grace and ease. Eiseley made the leap at a time when science was science, and literature was, well, literature... His writing delivered science to nonscientists in the lyrical language of earthly metaphor, irony, simile, and narrative, all paced like a good mystery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On October 25, 2007, the Governor of Nebraska, [[Dave Heineman]], officially declared that year "The Centennial Year of Loren Eiseley."  In a written proclamation, he encouraged all Nebraskans

&lt;blockquote&gt;to read Loren Eisely's writings and to appreciate in those writings the richness and beauty of his language, his ability to depict the long, slow passage of time and the meaning of the past in the present, his portrayal of the relationships among all living things and his concern for the future.&lt;ref name=proclamation&gt;Heineman, Dave, Governor of Nebraska.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10442">The '''Marangoni effect''' (also called the '''Gibbs–Marangoni effect''') is the [[mass transfer]] along an [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] between two fluids due to a [[gradient]] of the [[surface tension]]. In the case of temperature dependence, this phenomenon may be called '''thermo-capillary convection'''&lt;ref name="comsol1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comsol.com/showroom/gallery/110/ |title=Marangoni Convection |publisher=COMSOL |date= |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or '''Bénard–Marangoni convection''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Getling|first1=A.V.|title=Rayleigh-Bénard convection : structures and dynamics|date=1998|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|location=Singapore|isbn=981-02-2657-8|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This phenomenon was first identified in the so-called "[[tears of wine]]" by physicist [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]] ([[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]]'s brother) in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;James Thomson (1855) [https://books.google.com/books?id=MVIwAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA330#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "On certain curious Motions observable at the Surfaces of Wine and other Alcoholic Liquors,"] ''Philosophical Magazine'', '''10''' : 330-333.&lt;/ref&gt; The general effect is named after [[Italy|Italian]] physicist [[Carlo Marangoni]], who studied it for his doctoral dissertation at the [[University of Pavia]] and published his results in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;C. Marangoni, ''Sull'espansione delle goccie d'un liquido galleggianti sulla superficie di altro liquido'' (On the expansion of a droplet of a liquid floating on the surface of another liquid) (Pavia, Italy:  fratelli Fusi (Fusi brothers), 1869).&lt;/ref&gt; A complete theoretical treatment of the subject was given by [[J. Willard Gibbs]] in his work ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]'' (1875-8).&lt;ref&gt;Josiah Willard Gibbs (1878) "On the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances.  Part II," ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences'', '''3''' :  343-524.  The equation for the energy that's required to create a surface between two phases appears on [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsQAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA483#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 483].  Reprinted in:  Josiah Willard Gibbs with Henry Andrews Bumstead and Ralph Gibbs van Name, ed.s, ''The Scientific Papers of J. Willard Gibbs, ...'', vol. 1, (New York, New York:  Longmans, Green and Co., 1906), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8RhWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA315#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 315].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:Marangoni effect experimental demonstration.ogv|thumb|Marangoni effect experimental demonstration]]
[[File:Wine legs shadow.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Tears of wine]] show clearly in the shadow of this glass of wine with a 13.5% alcohol content]]

Since a liquid with a high surface tension pulls more strongly on the surrounding liquid than one with a low surface tension, the presence of a gradient in surface tension will naturally cause the liquid to flow away from regions of low surface tension. The surface tension gradient can be caused by concentration gradient or by a temperature gradient (surface tension is a function of temperature).

As an example, [[wine]] may exhibit a visible effect called "tears", as shown in the photograph. The effect is a consequence of the fact that alcohol has a lower surface tension and higher volatility than water. The water/alcohol solution rises up the surface of the glass due to [[capillary action]]. Alcohol evaporates from the film leaving behind liquid with a higher surface tension (more water, less alcohol). This region with a lower concentration of alcohol (greater surface tension) pulls on the surrounding fluid more strongly than the regions with a higher alcohol concentration (lower in the glass). The result is the liquid is pulled up until its own weight exceeds the force of the effect, and the liquid drips back down the vessel's walls. This can also be easily demonstrated by spreading a thin film of water on a smooth surface and then allowing a drop of alcohol to fall on the center of the film. The liquid will rush out of the region where the drop of alcohol fell.

The [[Marangoni number]], a dimensionless value, can be used to characterize the relative effects of surface tension and viscous forces.

A very detailed mathematical treatment of this from the point of view of the [[Navier–Stokes equation]]s and the equations of [[thermodynamics]] can be found in the first third of [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar|Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar's]] Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandrasekhar|first1=S.|title=Hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability|date=1981|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=978-0486640716|edition=[Dover ed.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally published in 1961 by Oxford, and republished by Dover in 1981.

==Significance to transport phenomena==
{{main|Transport phenomena (engineering &amp; physics)}}

Under earth conditions, the effect of gravity causing [[natural convection]] in a system with a temperature gradient along a fluid/fluid interface is usually much stronger than the Marangoni effect. Many experiments ([[ESA]] MASER 1-3) have been conducted under [[Micro-g environment|microgravity conditions]] aboard [[sounding rockets]] to observe the Marangoni effect without the influence of gravity. Research on [[heat pipes]] performed on the [[International Space Station]] revealed that whilst heat pipes exposed to a temperature gradient on Earth cause the inner fluid to evaporate at one end and migrate along the pipe, thus drying the hot end, in space (where the effects of gravity can be ignored) the opposite happens and the hot end of the pipe is flooded with liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Overview article: http://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.146105?referer=rss Technical research paper: http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.146105&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the Marangoni effect, together with [[capillary action]]. The fluid is drawn to the hot end of the tube by capillary action. But the bulk of the liquid still ends up as a droplet a short distance away from the hottest part of the tube, explained by Marangoni flow. The temperature gradients in axial and radial directions makes the fluid flow away from the hot end and the walls of the tube, towards the center axis. The liquid forms a droplet with a small contact area with the tube walls, a thin film circulating liquid between the cooler droplet and the liquid at the hot end.

The effect of the Marangoni effect on heat transfer in the presence of gas bubbles on the heating surface (e.g., in subcooled nucleate boiling) has long been ignored, but it is currently a topic of ongoing research interest because of its potential fundamental importance to the understanding of heat transfer in boiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petrovic|first1=Sanja|last2=Robinson|first2=Tony|last3=Judd|first3=Ross L.|title=Marangoni heat transfer in subcooled nucleate pool boiling|journal=International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer|date=November 2004|volume=47|issue=23|pages=5115–5128|doi=10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2004.05.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and application==
A familiar example is in [[soap film]]s: the Marangoni effect ''stabilizes'' soap films. Another instance of the Marangoni effect appears in the behavior of convection cells, the so-called [[Bénard cells]].

One important application of the Marangoni effect is the use for drying [[silicon]] [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]]s after a wet processing step during the manufacture of [[integrated circuits]]. Liquid spots left on the wafer surface can cause oxidation that damages components on the wafer. To avoid spotting, an [[alcohol]] [[vapor]] (IPA) or other organic compound in gas, vapor, or aerosol form is blown through a [[nozzle]] over the wet wafer surface (or at the meniscus formed between the cleaning liquid and wafer as the wafer is lifted from an immersion bath), and the subsequent Marangoni effect causes a surface-tension gradient in the liquid allowing gravity more easily to pull the liquid completely off the wafer surface, effectively leaving a dry wafer surface.

A similar phenomenon has been creatively utilized to self-assemble nanoparticles into ordered arrays&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cai|first1=Yangjun|last2=Zhang Newby|first2=Bi-min|title=Marangoni Flow-Induced Self-Assembly of Hexagonal and Stripelike Nanoparticle Patterns|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=May 2008|volume=130|issue=19|pages=6076–6077|doi=10.1021/ja801438u|pmid=18426208}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to grow ordered nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Wei Cheat|last2=Fang|first2=Yuanxing|last3=Kler|first3=Rantej|last4=Canciani|first4=Giacomo E.|last5=Draper|first5=Thomas C.|last6=Al-Abdullah|first6=Zainab T.Y.|last7=Alfadul|first7=Sulaiman M.|last8=Perry|first8=Christopher C.|last9=He|first9=Heyong|title=Marangoni ring-templated vertically aligned ZnO nanotube arrays with enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S025405841400697X|journal=Materials Chemistry and Physics|volume=149-150|pages=12–16|doi=10.1016/j.matchemphys.2014.10.046}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alcohol containing nanoparticles is spread on the substrate, followed by blowing the substrate with a humid air flow. The alcohol is evaporated under the flow. Simultaneously, water condenses and forms microdroplets on the substrate. Meanwhile, the nanoparticles in alcohol are transferred into the microdroplets and finally form numerous coffee rings on the substrate after drying.

The Marangoni effect is also important to the fields of [[welding]], [[crystal growth]] and [[electron beam]] melting of metals.&lt;ref name="comsol1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2227">In [[chemistry]], '''metal vapor synthesis''' (MVS) is a method for preparing [[metal complex]]es by combining freshly produced metal atoms or small particles with [[ligand]]s.  In contrast to the high reactivity of such freshly produced metal atoms, bulk metals typically are unreactive toward neutral ligands.  The method has been used to prepare compounds that cannot be prepared by traditional synthetic methods, e.g. Ti(η&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-toluene)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The technique relies on a reactor that evaporates the metal, allowing the vapor to impinge on a cold reactor wall that is coated with the organic ligand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.verdampfer-test.de/aspire-cleito/|title=Aspire Cleito Verdampfer Test|last=|first=|date=|access-date=2017-08-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metal evaporates upon being [[resistive heating|heated resistively]] or irradiated with an [[electron beam]].  The apparatus operates under high vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;E. Schmidt, K. J. Klabunde, A. Ponce, A. Smetana, D. Heroux "Metal Vapor Synthesis of Transition Metal Compounds" Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry 2006, John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{DOI|10.1002/0470862106.ia137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a common implementation, the metal vapor and the organic ligand are co-condensed at liquid nitrogen temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Timms "Transition metal vapors in chemical synthesis. The direct preparation of dibenzene chromium as an undergraduate experiment" J. Chem. Educ., 1972, volume 49, p 782. {{DOI| 10.1021/ed049p782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several case where compounds are prepared by MVS, related preparations employ conventional routes.  Thus, tris(butadiene)molybdenum was first prepared by co-condensation of butadiene and Mo vapor, but yields are higher for the reduction of [[molybdenum(V) chloride]] in the presence of the diene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Stephan, G.

==Chicago nature==
MacDonald's work primarily focuses on the natural habitats of the Chicago area. In 2015, MacDonald authored the [[coffee-table book]] ''My Journey into the Wilds of Chicago: A Celebration of Chicagoland's Startling Natural Wonders'', a collection built over two decades of more than 200 photographs and 30 profiles of Chicago area prairies, savannas, beaches and forests.&lt;ref name=Trib&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/downers-grove/news/ct-downers-grove-nature-author-0201-20160201-story.html |title=New book by Downers Grove resident offers look at area's natural gems |last=Ruzich |first=Joseph |date=February 21, 2016 |website=Chicago Tribune |publisher=Tronk |access-date=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called the book "''celebratory, soulful and poetic,''" and its photos "''glorious''."&lt;ref name=PW/&gt;

A '''mineral''' is a naturally occurring [[chemical compound]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hans-Rudolf |last1=Wenk |first2=Andrei |last2=Bulakh |title=Minerals: Their Constitution and Origin |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn= 9780521529587|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually of [[crystal]]line form and [[abiogenic|not produced by life processes]]. A  mineral has one specific [[chemical composition]], whereas a [[rock (geology)|rock]] can be an [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]] of different minerals or [[mineraloid]]s. The study of minerals is called [[mineralogy]].

Minerals are classified by variety, species, series and group, in order of increasing generality. As of November 2018, there are [[List of minerals (complete)|more than 5,500]] known mineral ''species'';&lt;ref name="rruff1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://rruff.info/ima/ |title=IMA Database of Mineral Properties/ RRUFF Project |accessdate=2 November 2018 |publisher=Department of Geosciences, University of Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5,389 of these have been approved by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] (IMA).&lt;ref name="IMAMineralsCount"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nrmima.nrm.se//imalist.htm | title=The New IMA List of Minerals  – A Work in Progress | publisher=[[International Mineralogical Association|IMA]] – CNMNC (Commission on New Minerals Nomenclature and Classification) | work=The New IMA List of Minerals | date=September 2018 | accessdate=2 November 2018 | author=Pasero, Marco et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Minerals are distinguished by various [[Chemical property|chemical]] and [[physical property|physical properties]]. Differences in [[chemical composition]] and [[crystal structure]] distinguish the various species, which were determined by the mineral's geological environment when formed. Changes in the temperature, pressure, or bulk composition of a rock mass cause changes in its minerals. Within a mineral species there may be variation in physical properties or minor amounts of impurities that are recognized by mineralogists or wider society as a mineral ''variety'',&lt;ref name="MinVar1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mindat.org/glossary/mineral_variety | title=Definition of mineral variety | publisher=mindat.org | accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[amethyst]], a purple variety of the mineral species [[quartz]].

Minerals can be described by their various physical properties, which are related to their chemical structure and composition. Common distinguishing characteristics include crystal structure and [[Crystal habit|habit]], [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]], [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]], [[diaphaneity]], colour, [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]], [[Tenacity (mineralogy)|tenacity]], [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[Fracture (mineralogy)|fracture]], parting, [[specific gravity]], [[magnetism]], taste or smell, [[radioactivity]], and [[acid|reaction to acid]].

Minerals are classified by key chemical constituents; the two dominant systems are the Dana classification and the Strunz classification. [[Silicon]] and [[oxygen]] constitute approximately 75% of the Earth's crust, which translates directly into the predominance of [[silicate minerals]]. The silicate minerals compose over 90% of the [[Earth's crust]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/science/mineral-chemical-compound/Silicates&lt;/ref&gt; The silicate class of minerals is subdivided into six subclasses by the degree of [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymerization]] in the chemical structure. All silicate minerals have a base unit of a [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; silica tetrahedron—that is, a silicon cation coordinated by four oxygen [[anion]]s, which gives the shape of a [[tetrahedron]]. These tetrahedra can be polymerized to give the subclasses: orthosilicates (no polymerization, thus single tetrahedra), disilicates (two tetrahedra bonded together), cyclosilicates (rings of tetrahedra), inosilicates (chains of tetrahedra), phyllosilicates (sheets of tetrahedra), and tectosilicates (three-dimensional network of tetrahedra). Other important mineral groups include the [[Native element minerals|native elements]], [[Sulfide minerals|sulfides]], [[Oxide minerals|oxides]], [[Halide minerals|halides]], [[Carbonate minerals|carbonates]], [[Sulfate minerals|sulfates]], and [[Phosphate minerals|phosphates]].

==Definition==

===Basic definition===
One definition of a mineral encompasses the following criteria:&lt;ref name="DG2_4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mineralogy and Optical Mineralogy|last = Dyar, Gunter, and Tasa|first = |publisher = Mineralogical Society of America|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0939950812|location = |pages = 2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Formed by a natural process ([[wikt:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]] compounds are excluded).
#[[thermodynamic stability|Stable or metastable]] at [[room  temperature]] (25&amp;nbsp;°C). In the simplest sense, this means the mineral must be solid. Classical examples of exceptions to this rule include native [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which crystallizes at −39&amp;nbsp;°C, and water ice, which is solid only below 0&amp;nbsp;°C; because these two minerals were described before 1959, they were grandfathered by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] (IMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2647.html |title=Mercury |publisher=Mindat.org |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2001.html |title=Ice |publisher=Mindat.org |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern advances have included extensive study of [[liquid crystals]], which also extensively involve mineralogy.
#Represented by a [[chemical formula]]. Minerals are chemical compounds, and as such they can be described by fixed or a variable formula. Many mineral groups and species are composed of a solid solution; pure substances are not usually found because of contamination or chemical substitution. For example, the [[olivine]] group is described by the variable formula (Mg, Fe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a solid solution of two end-member species, magnesium-rich [[forsterite]] and iron-rich [[fayalite]], which are described by a fixed chemical formula. Mineral species themselves could have a variable composition, such as the sulfide [[mackinawite]], (Fe, Ni)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, which is mostly a ferrous sulfide, but has a very significant nickel impurity that is reflected in its formula.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2512.html|title=Mackinawite|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Ordered atomic arrangement. This generally means [[crystallinity|crystalline]]; however, crystals are also periodic, so the broader criterion is used instead.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt; An ordered atomic arrangement gives rise to a variety of [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] physical properties, such as crystal form, hardness, and cleavage.&lt;ref name="CL13-14"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several recent proposals to classify biogenic or [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]] substances as minerals. The formal definition of a mineral approved by the IMA in 1995: "A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes."&lt;ref name=Nickel&gt;{{cite journal |last = Nickel |first = Ernest H. |title = The definition of a mineral |journal = The Canadian Mineralogist |volume = 33 |issue = 3 |pages = 689–90 |date = 1995 |url = https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/canmin/article-abstract/33/3/689/12679/the-definition-of-a-mineral?redirectedFrom=fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Usually [[abiogenic]] (not resulting from the activity of living organisms). Biogenic substances are explicitly excluded by the IMA: "Biogenic substances are chemical compounds produced entirely by biological processes without a geological component (e.g., urinary calculi, oxalate crystals in plant tissues, shells of marine molluscs, etc.) and are not regarded as minerals. However, if geological processes were involved in the genesis of the compound, then the product can be accepted as a mineral."&lt;ref name=Nickel /&gt;

The first three general characteristics are less debated than the last two.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt;

===Recent advances===
Mineral classification schemes and their definitions are evolving to match recent advances in mineral science. Recent changes have included the addition of an organic class, in both the new Dana and the [[Strunz classification]] schemes.&lt;ref name=Dana&gt;{{cite web|title=Dana Classification 8th edition – Organic Compounds|url=http://www.mindat.org/dana.php?a=50|website=mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strunz&gt;{{cite web|title=Nickel-Strunz Classification - silicates (Germanates) 10th edition|url=https://www.mindat.org/strunz.php?a=9|website=mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organic class includes a very rare group of minerals with [[hydrocarbons]]. The IMA Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names adopted in 2009 a hierarchical scheme for the naming and classification of mineral groups and group names and established seven commissions and four working groups to review and classify minerals into an official listing of their published names.&lt;ref name="Mills09" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ima-mineralogy.org/sciactivities.html IMA divisions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810045840/http://www.ima-mineralogy.org/sciactivities.html |date=2011-08-10 }}. Ima-mineralogy.org (2011-01-12). Retrieved on 2011-10-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to these new rules, "mineral species can be grouped in a number of different ways, on the basis of chemistry, crystal structure, occurrence, association, genetic history, or resource, for example, depending on the purpose to be served by the classification."&lt;ref name="Mills09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mills | first1=J. S. | last2=Hatert | first2=F. | last3=Nickel | first3=E. H. | last4=Ferraris | first4=G. | title=The standardisation of mineral group hierarchies: application to recent nomenclature proposals | journal=European Journal of Mineralogy | volume=21 | pages=1073–80 | doi=10.1127/0935-1221/2009/0021-1994 | date=2009 | issue=5 | bibcode=2009EJMin..21.1073M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nickel (1995){{huh|date=September 2017}} exclusion of biogenic substances was not universally adhered to. For example, Lowenstam (1981) stated that "organisms are capable of forming a diverse array of minerals, some of which cannot be formed inorganically in the biosphere."&lt;ref name="Lowenstam81"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Lowenstam | last1=H. A. | title=Minerals formed by organisms | journal=Science | date=1981 | volume=211 | issue=4487 | pages=1126–31 | doi=10.1126/science.7008198 | jstor=1685216 | pmid=7008198|bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1126L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is a matter of classification and less to do with the constituents of the minerals themselves. Skinner (2005) views all solids as potential minerals and includes [[Biomineralization|biominerals]] in the mineral kingdom, which are those that are created by the metabolic activities of organisms. Skinner expanded the previous definition of a mineral to classify "element or compound, amorphous or crystalline, formed through ''[[Biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] '' processes," as a mineral.&lt;ref name="Skinner05" /&gt;

Recent advances in high-resolution [[genetics]] and [[X-ray absorption spectroscopy]] are providing revelations on the biogeochemical relations between [[microorganism]]s and minerals that may make Nickel's (1995) biogenic mineral exclusion obsolete and Skinner's (2005) biogenic mineral inclusion a necessity.&lt;ref name=Nickel /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinner05"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Skinner | first1=H. C.

===Rocks, ores, and gems===
[[File:Sillimanite-199671.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Schist]] is a [[metamorphic rock]] characterized by an abundance of platy minerals. In this example, the rock has prominent [[sillimanite]] [[porphyroblast]]s as large as {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}.]]
Minerals are not equivalent to rocks. A [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is an aggregate of one or more minerals&lt;ref name="ChL15-16"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;  or mineraloids. Some rocks, such as [[limestone]] or [[quartzite]], are composed primarily of one mineral—[[calcite]] or [[aragonite]] in the case of limestone, and [[quartz]] in the latter case.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 719–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 747–48&lt;/ref&gt; Other rocks can be defined by relative abundances of key (essential) minerals; a [[granite]] is defined by proportions of quartz, [[alkali feldspar]], and [[plagioclase feldspar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 694–96&lt;/ref&gt; The other minerals in the rock are termed accessory, and do not greatly affect the bulk composition of the rock. Rocks can also be composed entirely of non-mineral material; [[coal]] is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of organically derived carbon.&lt;ref name="ChL15-16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 728–30&lt;/ref&gt;

In rocks, some mineral species and groups are much more abundant than others; these are termed the rock-forming minerals. The major examples of these are quartz, the [[feldspar]]s, the [[mica]]s, the [[amphibole]]s, the [[pyroxene]]s, the [[olivine]]s, and calcite; except for the last one, all of these minerals are silicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, around 150 minerals are considered particularly important, whether in terms of their abundance or aesthetic value in terms of collecting.&lt;ref name="ChL14"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercially valuable minerals and rocks are referred to as [[industrial minerals]]. For example, [[muscovite]], a white mica, can be used for windows (sometimes referred to as isinglass), as a filler, or as an insulator.&lt;ref&gt;Chesterman and Cole, pp. 531–32&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ore]]s are minerals that have a high concentration of a certain element, typically a metal. Examples are [[cinnabar]] (HgS), an ore of mercury, [[sphalerite]] (ZnS), an ore of zinc, or [[cassiterite]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), an ore of tin. [[gemstone|Gem]]s are minerals with an ornamental value, and are distinguished from non-gems by their beauty, durability, and usually, rarity. There are about 20 mineral species that qualify as gem minerals, which constitute about 35 of the most common gemstones. Gem minerals are often present in several varieties, and so one mineral can account for several different gemstones; for example, [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]] are both [[corundum]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="ChL14-15"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nomenclature and classification===
Minerals are classified by variety, species, series and group, in order of increasing generality. The basic level of definition is that of mineral species, each of which is distinguished from the others by unique chemical and physical properties. For example, quartz is defined by its [[Chemical formula|formula]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and a specific [[Crystal structure|crystalline structure]] that distinguishes it from other minerals with the same chemical formula (termed [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]). When there exists a range of composition between two minerals species, a mineral series is defined. For example, the [[biotite]] series is represented by variable amounts of the [[endmembers]] [[phlogopite]], [[siderophyllite]], [[annite]], and [[eastonite]]. In contrast, a mineral group is a grouping of mineral species with some common chemical properties that share a crystal structure. The [[pyroxene]] group has a common  formula of XY(Si,Al)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, where X and Y are both cations, with X typically [[ionic radius|bigger]] than Y; the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates that crystallize in either the [[orthorhombic]] or [[monoclinic]] crystal systems. Finally, a mineral variety is a specific type of mineral species that differs by some physical characteristic, such as colour or crystal habit. An example is [[amethyst]], which is a purple variety of quartz.&lt;ref name="DG20-22"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Two common classifications, Dana and Strunz, are used for minerals; both rely on composition, specifically with regards to important chemical groups, and structure. [[James Dwight Dana]], a leading geologist of his time, first published his ''System of Mineralogy'' in 1837; as of 1997, it is in its eighth edition. The Dana classification assigns a four-part number to a mineral species. Its class number is based on important compositional groups; the type gives the ratio of cations to anions in the mineral, and the last two numbers group minerals by structural similarity within a given type or class. The less commonly used [[Strunz classification]], named for German mineralogist [[Karl Hugo Strunz]], is based on the Dana system, but combines both chemical and structural criteria, the latter with regards to distribution of chemical bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp 558–59&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|11}}, 5,389 mineral species are approved by the IMA.&lt;ref name="IMAMineralsCount"/&gt; They are most commonly named after a person (45%), followed by discovery location (23%); names based on chemical composition (14%) and physical properties (8%) are the two other major groups of mineral name etymologies.&lt;ref name="DG20-22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "species" (from the Latin ''species'', "a particular sort, kind, or type with distinct look, or appearance")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/species|website=etymonline|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the classification scheme in ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]]. He divided the natural world into three kingdoms &amp;ndash; plants, animals, and minerals &amp;ndash; and classified each with the same hierarchy.&lt;ref name="wilk"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilk|first1=H|editor1-last=Wilk|editor1-first=H|title=The Magic of Minerals|date=1986|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-642-64783-3|page=154|format=Hardcover|chapter=Systematic Classification of Minerals|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-61304-3|chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-61304-3_7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In descending order, these were Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Tribe, Genus, and Species.

==Chemistry==
[[File:Hubnerite-Quartz-216455.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Hübnerite]], the manganese-rich end-member of the [[wolframite]] series, with minor quartz in the background]]
The abundance and diversity of minerals is controlled directly by their chemistry, in turn dependent on elemental abundances in the Earth. The majority of minerals observed are derived from the Earth's crust. Eight elements account for most of the key components of minerals, due to their abundance in the crust. These eight elements, summing to over 98% of the crust by weight, are, in order of decreasing abundance: [[oxygen]], [[silicon]], [[aluminium]], [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]] and [[potassium]]. Oxygen and silicon are by far the two most important – oxygen composes 47% of the crust by weight, and silicon accounts for 28%.&lt;ref name="DG4-7"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The minerals that form are directly controlled by the bulk chemistry of the parent body. For example, a [[magma]] rich in iron and magnesium will form [[mafic]] minerals, such as olivine and the pyroxenes; in contrast, a more silica-rich magma will crystallize to form minerals that incorporate more SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as the feldspars and quartz. In a [[limestone]], [[calcite]] or [[aragonite]] (both CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) form because the rock is rich in calcium and carbonate.  A corollary is that a mineral will not be found in a rock whose bulk chemistry does not resemble the bulk chemistry of a given mineral with the exception of trace minerals. For example, [[kyanite]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; forms from the [[metamorphism]] of aluminium-rich [[shale]]s; it would not likely occur in aluminium-poor rock, such as [[quartzite]].

The chemical composition may vary between [[Endmember (mineralogy)|end member]] species of a [[solid solution]] series. For example, the [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]]s comprise a continuous series from [[sodium]]-rich end member [[albite]] (NaAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) to [[calcium]]-rich [[anorthite]] (CaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) with four recognized intermediate varieties between them (given in order from sodium- to calcium-rich): [[oligoclase]], [[andesine]], [[labradorite]], and [[bytownite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of series include the olivine series of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite, and the [[wolframite]] series of [[manganese]]-rich [[hübnerite]] and iron-rich [[ferberite]].

Chemical substitution and coordination polyhedra explain this common feature of minerals. In nature, minerals are not pure substances, and are contaminated by whatever other elements are present in the given chemical system. As a result, it is possible for one element to be substituted for another.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical substitution will occur between ions of a similar size and charge; for example, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; will not substitute for Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; because of chemical and structural incompatibilities caused by a big difference in size and charge. A common example of chemical substitution is that of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, which are close in charge, size, and abundance in the crust. In the example of plagioclase, there are three cases of substitution. Feldspars are all framework silicates, which have a silicon-oxygen ratio of 2:1, and the space for other elements is given by the substitution of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to give a base unit of [AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;; without the substitution, the formula would be charge-balanced as SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, giving quartz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of this structural property will be explained further by coordination polyhedra. The second substitution occurs between Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;; however, the difference in charge has to accounted for by making a second substitution of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 585&lt;/ref&gt;

Coordination polyhedra are geometric representations of how a cation is surrounded by an anion. In mineralogy, coordination polyhedra are usually considered in terms of oxygen, due its abundance in the crust. The base unit of silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron – one Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; surrounded by four O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. An alternate way of describing the coordination of the silicate is by a number: in the case of the silica tetrahedron, the silicon is said to have a coordination number of 4. Various cations have a specific range of possible coordination numbers; for silicon, it is almost always 4, except for very high-pressure minerals where the compound is compressed such that silicon is in six-fold (octahedral) coordination with oxygen. Bigger cations have a bigger coordination numbers because of the increase in relative size as compared to oxygen (the last [[Atomic orbital|orbital subshell]] of heavier atoms is different too). Changes in coordination numbers leads to physical and mineralogical differences; for example, at high pressure, such as in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], many minerals, especially silicates such as olivine and [[garnet]], will change to a [[perovskite structure]], where silicon is in octahedral coordination. Other examples are the aluminosilicates [[kyanite]], [[andalusite]], and [[sillimanite]] (polymorphs, since they share the formula Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), which differ by the coordination number of the Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;; these minerals transition from one another as a response to changes in pressure and temperature.&lt;ref name="DG4-7"/&gt; In the case of silicate materials, the substitution of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; allows for a variety of minerals because of the need to balance charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 12–17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kaolinite-Orthoclase-lw18c.jpg|thumb|When minerals react, the products will sometimes assume the shape of the reagent; the product mineral is termed a pseudomorph of (or after) the reagent. Illustrated here is a pseudomorph of [[kaolinite]] after [[orthoclase]]. Here, the pseudomorph preserved the Carlsbad [[Crystal twinning|twinning]] common in orthoclase.]]

Changes in temperature and pressure and composition alter the mineralogy of a rock sample. Changes in composition can be caused by processes such as [[weathering]] or [[metasomatism]] ([[hydrothermal alteration]]). Changes in temperature and pressure occur when the host rock undergoes [[tectonic]] or [[magmatic]] movement into differing physical regimes. Changes in [[thermodynamic]] conditions make it favourable for mineral assemblages to react with each other to produce new minerals; as such, it is possible for two rocks to have an identical or a very similar bulk rock chemistry without having a similar mineralogy. This process of mineralogical alteration is related to the [[rock cycle]]. An example of a series of mineral reactions is illustrated as follows.&lt;ref name="DG549"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 549&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orthoclase]] feldspar (KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) is a mineral commonly found in [[granite]], a [[plutonic]] [[igneous rock]]. When exposed to weathering, it reacts to form [[kaolinite]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, a sedimentary mineral, and [[silicic acid]]):

:2 KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Under low-grade metamorphic conditions, kaolinite reacts with quartz to form [[pyrophyllite]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):

:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

As metamorphic grade increases, the pyrophyllite reacts to form kyanite and quartz:

:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Alternatively, a mineral may change its crystal structure as a consequence of changes in temperature and pressure without reacting. For example, quartz will change into a variety of its SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]], such as [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]] at high temperatures, and [[coesite]] at high pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
Classifying minerals ranges from simple to difficult. A mineral can be identified by several physical properties, some of them being sufficient for full identification without equivocation. In other cases, minerals can only be classified by more complex [[Optical mineralogy|optical]], chemical or [[X-ray diffraction]] analysis; these methods, however, can be costly and time-consuming.  Physical properties applied for classification include crystal structure and habit, hardness, lustre, diaphaneity, colour, streak, cleavage and fracture, and specific gravity. Other less general tests include [[fluorescence]], [[phosphorescence]], [[magnetism]], [[radioactivity]], tenacity (response to mechanical induced changes of shape or form), [[piezoelectricity]] and reactivity to dilute [[acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Topaz-235220.jpg|right|thumb|[[Topaz]] has a characteristic orthorhombic elongated crystal shape.]]
[[Crystal structure]] results from the orderly geometric spatial arrangement of atoms in the internal structure of a mineral. This crystal structure is based on regular internal atomic or [[ion]]ic arrangement that is often expressed in the geometric form that the crystal takes. Even when the mineral grains are too small to see or are irregularly shaped, the underlying crystal structure is always periodic and can be determined by [[X-ray]] diffraction.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt; Minerals are typically described by their symmetry content. Crystals are [[crystallographic restriction theorem|restricted]] to [[Crystallographic point group|32 point groups]], which differ by their symmetry. These groups are classified in turn into more broad categories, the most encompassing of these being the six crystal families.&lt;ref name="DG69-80"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 69–80&lt;/ref&gt;

These families can be described by the relative lengths of the three crystallographic axes, and the angles between them; these relationships correspond to the symmetry operations that define the narrower point groups. They are summarized below; a, b, and c represent the axes, and α, β, γ represent the angle opposite the respective crystallographic axis (e.g. α is the angle opposite the a-axis, [[wikt:viz.|viz.]] the angle between the b and c axes):&lt;ref name="DG69-80" /&gt;

The hexagonal crystal family is also split into two crystal ''systems'' – the [[trigonal]], which has a three-fold axis of symmetry, and the hexagonal, which has a six-fold axis of symmetry.

Chemistry and crystal structure together define a mineral. With a restriction to 32 point groups, minerals of different chemistry may have identical crystal structure. For example, [[halite]] (NaCl), [[galena]] (PbS), and [[periclase]] (MgO) all belong to the hexaoctahedral point group (isometric family), as they have a similar [[stoichiometry]] between their different constituent elements. In contrast, [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] are groupings of minerals that share a chemical formula but have a different structure. For example, [[pyrite]] and [[marcasite]], both iron sulfides, have the formula FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; however, the former is isometric while the latter is orthorhombic. This polymorphism extends to other sulfides with the generic AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formula; these two groups are collectively known as the pyrite and marcasite groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 654–55&lt;/ref&gt;

Polymorphism can extend beyond pure symmetry content. The aluminosilicates are a group of three minerals – [[kyanite]], [[andalusite]], and [[sillimanite]] – which share the chemical formula Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Kyanite is triclinic, while andalusite and sillimanite are both orthorhombic and belong to the dipyramidal point group. These differences arise corresponding to how aluminium is coordinated within the crystal structure. In all minerals, one aluminium ion is always in six-fold coordination with oxygen. Silicon, as a general rule, is in four-fold coordination in all minerals; an exception is a case like [[stishovite]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an ultra-high pressure quartz polymorph with rutile structure).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 581&lt;/ref&gt; In kyanite, the second aluminium is in six-fold coordination; its chemical formula can be expressed as Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, to reflect its crystal structure. Andalusite has the second aluminium in five-fold coordination (Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;Al&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and sillimanite has it in four-fold coordination (Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;Al&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 631–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in crystal structure and chemistry greatly influence other physical properties of the mineral. The carbon allotropes [[diamond]] and [[graphite]] have vastly different properties; diamond is the hardest natural substance, has an adamantine lustre, and belongs to the isometric crystal family, whereas graphite is very soft, has a greasy lustre, and crystallises in the hexagonal family. This difference is accounted for by differences in bonding. In diamond, the carbons are in sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals, which means they form a framework where each carbon is covalently bonded to four neighbours in a tetrahedral fashion; on the other hand, graphite is composed of sheets of carbons in sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals, where each carbon is bonded covalently to only three others. These sheets are held together by much weaker [[van der Waals force]]s, and this discrepancy translates to large macroscopic differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinel-4mb4c.jpg|Contact twins, as seen in [[spinel]]|left|thumb]]

[[Crystal twinning|Twinning]] is the intergrowth of two or more crystals of a single mineral species. The geometry of the twinning is controlled by the mineral's symmetry. As a result, there are several types of twins, including contact twins, reticulated twins, geniculated twins, penetration twins, cyclic twins, and polysynthetic twins. Contact, or simple twins, consist of two crystals joined at a plane; this type of twinning is common in spinel. Reticulated twins, common in rutile, are interlocking crystals resembling netting. Geniculated twins have a bend in the middle that is caused by start of the twin. Penetration twins consist of two single crystals that have grown into each other; examples of this twinning include cross-shaped [[staurolite]] twins and Carlsbad twinning in orthoclase. Cyclic twins are caused by repeated twinning around a rotation axis. This type of twinning occurs around three, four, five, six, or eight-fold axes, and the corresponding patterns are called threelings, fourlings, fivelings, sixlings, and eightlings. Sixlings are common in aragonite. Polysynthetic twins are similar to cyclic twins through the presence of repetitive twinning; however, instead of occurring around a rotational axis, polysynthetic twinning occurs along parallel planes, usually on a microscopic scale.&lt;ref name="DG4143"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 41–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal habit refers to the overall shape of crystal. Several terms are used to describe this property. Common habits include acicular, which describes needlelike crystals as in [[natrolite]], bladed, dendritic (tree-pattern, common in [[native copper]]), equant, which is typical of garnet, prismatic (elongated in one direction), and tabular, which differs from bladed habit in that the former is platy whereas the latter has a defined elongation. Related to crystal form, the quality of crystal faces is diagnostic of some minerals, especially with a petrographic microscope. Euhedral crystals have a defined external shape, while anhedral crystals do not; those intermediate forms are termed subhedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 32–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardness===
{{main article|Mohs scale of mineral hardness}}
[[File:Rough diamond.jpg|right|thumb|Diamond is the hardest natural material, and has a Mohs hardness of 10.]]
The hardness of a mineral defines how much it can resist scratching. This physical property is controlled by the chemical composition and crystalline structure of a mineral. A mineral's hardness is not necessarily constant for all sides, which is a function of its structure; crystallographic weakness renders some directions softer than others.&lt;ref name="DG2829"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this property exists in kyanite, which has a Mohs hardness of 5½ parallel to [001] but 7 parallel to [100].&lt;ref name="Kyanite"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2303.html|title=Kyanite|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=[[Mindat.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common scale of measurement is the ordinal Mohs hardness scale. Defined by ten indicators, a mineral with a higher index scratches those below it. The scale ranges from talc, a [[phyllosilicate]], to diamond, a carbon polymorph that is the hardest natural material. The scale is provided below:&lt;ref name="DG2829"/&gt;

===Lustre and diaphaneity===
{{main article|Lustre (mineralogy)}}
[[File:Pyrite 2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Pyrite]] has a metallic lustre.]]
Lustre indicates how light reflects from the mineral's surface, with regards to its quality and intensity. There are numerous qualitative terms used to describe this property, which are split into metallic and non-metallic categories. Metallic and sub-metallic minerals have high reflectivity like metal; examples of minerals with this lustre are [[galena]] and pyrite. Non-metallic lustres include: adamantine, such as in [[diamond]]; vitreous, which is a glassy lustre very common in silicate minerals; pearly, such as in [[talc]] and [[apophyllite]]; resinous, such as members of the garnet group; silky which is common in fibrous minerals such as asbestiform [[chrysotile]].&lt;ref name="DG2628"&gt;Dyar and Darby, pp. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[diaphaneity]] of a mineral describes the ability of light to pass through it. Transparent minerals do not diminish the intensity of light passing through them. An example of a transparent mineral is [[muscovite]] (potassium mica); some varieties are sufficiently clear to have been used for windows. Translucent minerals allow some light to pass, but less than those that are transparent. [[Jadeite]] and [[nephrite]] (mineral forms of [[jade]] are examples of minerals with this property). Minerals that do not allow light to pass are called opaque.&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DG25"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The diaphaneity of a mineral depends on the thickness of the sample. When a mineral is sufficiently thin (e.g., in a [[thin section]] for [[petrography]]), it may become transparent even if that property is not seen in a hand sample. In contrast, some minerals, such as [[hematite]] or pyrite, are opaque even in thin-section.&lt;ref name="DG25" /&gt;

===Colour and streak===
{{main article|Streak (mineralogy)}}
{{double image|right|Quartz-Uvarovite-LTH15C.JPG|150|Grossular-ww51a.jpg|161|Colour is typically not a diagnostic property of minerals.

&lt;!--[[File:Tourmaline.xtal.750pix.jpg|Watermelon [[elbaite]]|left|thumb]]--&gt;
Colour is the most obvious property of a mineral, but it is often non-diagnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by [[electromagnetic radiation]] interacting with electrons (except in the case of [[incandescence]], which does not apply to minerals).&lt;ref name="DG131144"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 131–44&lt;/ref&gt; Two broad classes of elements (idiochromatic and allochromatic) are defined with regards to their contribution to a mineral's colour: Idiochromatic elements are essential to a mineral's composition; their contribution to a mineral's colour is diagnostic.&lt;ref name="B72"&gt;{{harvnb|Busbey et al.|2007}}, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DG24"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such minerals are [[malachite]] (green) and [[azurite]] (blue). In contrast, allochromatic elements in minerals are present in trace amounts as impurities. An example of such a mineral would be the [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]] varieties of the mineral [[corundum]].&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt;
The colours of pseudochromatic minerals are the result of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of light waves. Examples include [[labradorite]] and [[bornite]].

In addition to simple body colour, minerals can have various other distinctive optical properties, such as play of colours, [[Asterism (gemmology)|asterism]], [[chatoyancy]], [[iridescence]], tarnish, and [[pleochroism]]. Several of these properties involve variability in colour. Play of colour, such as in [[opal]], results in the sample reflecting different colours as it is turned, while pleochroism describes the change in colour as light passes through a mineral in a different orientation. Iridescence is a variety of the play of colours where light scatters off a coating on the surface of crystal, cleavage planes, or off layers having minor gradations in chemistry.&lt;ref name="DG2426"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the play of colours in opal is caused by light refracting from ordered microscopic silica spheres within its physical structure.&lt;ref name="B73"&gt;{{harvnb|Busbey et al.|2007}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Chatoyancy ("cat's eye") is the wavy banding of colour that is observed as the sample is rotated; asterism, a variety of chatoyancy, gives the appearance of a star on the mineral grain. The latter property is particularly common in gem-quality corundum.&lt;ref name="DG2426" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B73"/&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:Streak plate with Pyrite and Rhodochrosite.jpg|thumb|Streak plates with [[pyrite]] (left) and [[rhodochrosite]] (right)|left]]--&gt;
The streak of a mineral refers to the colour of a mineral in powdered form, which may or may not be identical to its body colour.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt; The most common way of testing this property is done with a streak plate, which is made out of porcelain and coloured either white or black. The streak of a mineral is independent of trace elements&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt; or any weathering surface.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt; A common example of this property is illustrated with [[hematite]], which is coloured black, silver, or red in hand sample, but has a cherry-red&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt; to reddish-brown streak.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt; Streak is more often distinctive for metallic minerals, in contrast to non-metallic minerals whose body colour is created by allochromatic elements.&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt; Streak testing is constrained by the hardness of the mineral, as those harder than 7 powder the ''streak plate'' instead.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt;

===Cleavage, parting, fracture, and tenacity===
{{main article|Cleavage (crystal)|Fracture (mineralogy)}}
[[File:Biotite-Orthoclase-229808.jpg|left|thumb|Perfect basal cleavage as seen in [[biotite]] (black), and good cleavage seen in the matrix (pink [[orthoclase]]).]]
By definition, minerals have a characteristic atomic arrangement. Weakness in this crystalline structure causes planes of weakness, and the breakage of a mineral along such planes is termed cleavage. The quality of cleavage can be described based on how cleanly and easily the mineral breaks; common descriptors, in order of decreasing quality, are "perfect", "good", "distinct", and "poor". In particularly transparent minerals, or in thin-section, cleavage can be seen as a series of parallel lines marking the planar surfaces when viewed from the side. Cleavage is not a universal property among minerals; for example, quartz, consisting of extensively interconnected silica tetrahedra, does not have a crystallographic weakness which would allow it to cleave. In contrast, micas, which have perfect basal cleavage, consist of sheets of silica tetrahedra which are very weakly held together.&lt;ref name="DG39-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChL30-31"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

As cleavage is a function of crystallography, there are a variety of cleavage types. Cleavage occurs typically in either one, two, three, four, or six directions. Basal cleavage in one direction is a distinctive property of the [[mica]]s. Two-directional cleavage is described as prismatic, and occurs in minerals such as the amphiboles and pyroxenes. Minerals such as galena or halite have cubic (or isometric) cleavage in three directions, at 90°; when three directions of cleavage are present, but not at 90°, such as in calcite or [[rhodochrosite]], it is termed rhombohedral cleavage. Octahedral cleavage (four directions) is present in [[fluorite]] and diamond, and [[sphalerite]] has six-directional dodecahedral cleavage.&lt;ref name="DG39-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChL30-31"/&gt;

Minerals with many cleavages might not break equally well in all of the directions; for example, calcite has good cleavage in three directions, but gypsum has perfect cleavage in one direction, and poor cleavage in two other directions. Angles between cleavage planes vary between minerals. For example, as the amphiboles are double-chain silicates and the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates, the angle between their cleavage planes is different. The pyroxenes cleave in two directions at approximately 90°, whereas the amphiboles distinctively cleave in two directions separated by approximately 120° and 60°. The cleavage angles can be measured with a contact goniometer, which is similar to a protractor.&lt;ref name="DG39-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChL30-31"/&gt;

Parting, sometimes called "false cleavage", is similar in appearance to cleavage but is instead produced by structural defects in the mineral, as opposed to systematic weakness. Parting varies from crystal to crystal of a mineral, whereas all crystals of a given mineral will cleave if the atomic structure allows for that property. In general, parting is caused by some stress applied to a crystal. The sources of the stresses include deformation (e.g. an increase in pressure), exsolution, or twinning. Minerals that often display parting include the pyroxenes, hematite, magnetite, and corundum.&lt;ref name="DG39-40"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

When a mineral is broken in a direction that does not correspond to a plane of cleavage, it is termed to have been fractured. There are several types of uneven fracture. The classic example is conchoidal fracture, like that of quartz; rounded surfaces are created, which are marked by smooth curved lines. This type of fracture occurs only in very homogeneous minerals. Other types of fracture are fibrous, splintery, and hackly. The latter describes a break along a rough, jagged surface; an example of this property is found in [[native copper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenacity is related to both cleavage and fracture. Whereas fracture and cleavage describes the surfaces that are created when a mineral is broken, tenacity describes how resistant a mineral is to such breaking. Minerals can be described as brittle, ductile, malleable, sectile, flexible, or elastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific gravity===
[[File:Calcite-Galena-elm56c.jpg|right|thumb|Galena, PbS, is a mineral with a high specific gravity.]]
[[Specific gravity]] numerically describes the [[density]] of a mineral. The dimensions of density are mass divided by volume with units: kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Specific gravity measures how much water a mineral sample displaces. Defined as the quotient of the mass of the sample and difference between the weight of the sample in air and its corresponding weight in water, specific gravity is a unitless ratio. Among most minerals, this property is not diagnostic. Rock forming minerals – typically silicates or occasionally carbonates – have a specific gravity of 2.5–3.5.&lt;ref name="DG4344"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

High specific gravity is a diagnostic property of a mineral. A variation in chemistry (and consequently, mineral class) correlates to a change in specific gravity. Among more common minerals, oxides and sulfides tend to have a higher specific gravity as they include elements with higher atomic mass. A generalization is that minerals with metallic or adamantine lustre tend to have higher specific gravities than those having a non-metallic to dull lustre. For example, hematite, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, has a specific gravity of 5.26&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-1856.html|title=Hematite|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[galena]], PbS, has a specific gravity of 7.2–7.6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-1641.html|title=Galena|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a result of their high iron and lead content, respectively. A very high specific gravity becomes very pronounced in [[native metal]]s; [[kamacite]], an iron-nickel alloy common in [[iron meteorite]]s has a specific gravity of 7.9,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webmineral.com/data/Kamacite.shtml#.WsQTQGbn9SM|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Webmineral.com|title=Kamacite|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gold has an observed specific gravity between 15 and 19.3.&lt;ref name="DG4344" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-1720.html|title=Gold|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other properties===
[[File:Carnotite-201050.jpg|left|thumb|Carnotite (yellow) is a radioactive uranium-bearing mineral.]]
Other properties can be used to diagnose minerals. These are less general, and apply to specific minerals.

Dropping dilute acid (often 10% [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]]) onto a mineral aids in distinguishing carbonates from other mineral classes. The acid reacts with the carbonate ([CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) group, which causes the affected area to [[effervesce]], giving off [[carbon dioxide]] gas. This test can be further expanded to test the mineral in its original crystal form or powdered form. An example of this test is done when distinguishing calcite from [[dolomite]], especially within rocks (limestone and dolostone respectively). Calcite immediately effervesces in acid, whereas acid must be applied to powdered dolomite (often to a scratched surface in a rock), for it to effervesce.&lt;ref name="DG4445"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeolite]] minerals will not effervesce in acid; instead, they become frosted after 5–10 minutes, and if left in acid for a day, they dissolve or become a silica gel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minsocam.org/MSA/collectors_corner/id/mineral_id_keyi11.htm|title=Mineral Identification Key: Radioactivity, Magnetism, Acid Reactions|publisher=[[Mineralogical Society of America]]|accessdate=2012-08-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922231836/http://minsocam.org/MSA/collectors_corner/id/mineral_id_keyi11.htm|archivedate=2012-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When tested, [[magnetism]] is a very conspicuous property of minerals. Among common minerals, [[magnetite]] exhibits this property strongly, and magnetism is also present, albeit not as strongly, in [[pyrrhotite]] and [[ilmenite]].&lt;ref name="DG4445" /&gt; Some minerals exhibit electrical properties – for example, quartz is piezoelectric – but electrical properties are rarely used as diagnostic criteria for minerals because of incomplete data and natural variation.&lt;ref name="Helman2016"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Symmetry-based electricity in minerals and rocks: A summary of extant data, with examples of centrosymmetric minerals that exhibit pyro- and piezoelectricity | author=Helman, Daniel S. | journal=Periodico di Mineralogia | year=2016 | volume=85 | doi=10.2451/2016PM590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minerals can also be tested for taste or smell. Halite, NaCl, is table salt; its potassium-bearing counterpart, [[sylvite]], has a pronounced bitter taste. Sulfides have a characteristic smell, especially as samples are fractured, reacting, or powdered.&lt;ref name="DG4445" /&gt;

[[Radioactivity]] is a rare property; minerals may be composed of radioactive elements. They could be a defining constituent, such as uranium in [[uraninite]], [[autunite]], and [[carnotite]], or as trace impurities. In the latter case, the decay of a radioactive element damages the mineral crystal; the result, termed a ''radioactive halo'' or ''[[pleochroic halo]]'', is observable with various techniques, such as thin-section petrography.&lt;ref name="DG4445" /&gt;

==Classification==
As the composition of the Earth's crust is dominated by silicon and oxygen, silicate elements are by far the most important class of minerals in terms of rock formation and diversity. However, non-silicate minerals are of great economic importance, especially as ores.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 641&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 681"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 681&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-silicate minerals are subdivided into several other classes by their dominant chemistry, which includes native elements, sulfides, halides, oxides and hydroxides, carbonates and nitrates, borates, sulfates, phosphates, and organic compounds. Most non-silicate mineral species are rare (constituting in total 8% of the Earth's crust), although some are relatively common, such as calcite, [[pyrite]], [[magnetite]], and [[hematite]]. There are two major structural styles observed in non-silicates: close-packing and silicate-like linked tetrahedra. [[Close-packing of equal spheres|close-packed structures]] is a way to densely pack atoms while minimizing interstitial space. Hexagonal close-packing involves stacking layers where every other layer is the same ("ababab"), whereas cubic close-packing involves stacking groups of three layers ("abcabcabc"). Analogues to linked silica tetrahedra include SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (sulfate), PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (phosphate), AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (arsenate), and VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (vanadate). The non-silicates have great economic importance, as they concentrate elements more than the silicate minerals do.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 641–43&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest grouping of minerals by far are the [[Silicate minerals|silicates]]; most rocks are composed of greater than 95% silicate minerals, and over 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of these minerals.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 104"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The two main constituents of silicates are silicon and oxygen, which are the two most abundant elements in the Earth's crust. Other common elements in silicate minerals correspond to other common elements in the Earth's crust, such as aluminium, magnesium, iron, calcium, sodium, and potassium.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Some important rock-forming silicates include the [[feldspar]]s, quartz, [[olivine]]s, [[pyroxene]]s, [[amphibole]]s, [[garnet]]s, and [[mica]]s.

===Silicates===
{{main article|Silicate minerals}}
[[File:Aegirine-233494.jpg|right|thumb|[[Aegirine]], an iron-sodium clinopyroxene, is part of the inosilicate subclass.]]
The base unit of a silicate mineral is the [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedron. In the vast majority of cases, silicon is in four-fold or tetrahedral coordination with oxygen. In very high-pressure situations, silicon will be in six-fold or octahedral coordination, such as in the [[perovskite structure]] or the quartz polymorph [[stishovite]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In the latter case, the mineral no longer has a silicate structure, but that of [[rutile]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and its associated group, which are simple oxides. These silica tetrahedra are then polymerized to some degree to create various structures, such as one-dimensional chains, two-dimensional sheets, and three-dimensional frameworks. The basic silicate mineral where no polymerization of the tetrahedra has occurred requires other elements to balance out the base 4- charge. In other silicate structures, different combinations of elements are required to balance out the resultant negative charge. It is common for the Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; to be substituted by  Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; because of similarity in ionic radius and charge; in those cases, the [AlO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;5−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedra form the same structures as do the unsubstituted tetrahedra, but their charge-balancing requirements are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 104–20&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of polymerization can be described by both the structure formed and how many tetrahedral corners (or coordinating oxygens) are shared (for aluminium and silicon in tetrahedral sites).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Orthosilicates (or nesosilicates) have no linking of polyhedra, thus tetrahedra share no corners. Disilicates (or sorosilicates) have two tetrahedra sharing one oxygen atom. Inosilicates are chain silicates; single-chain silicates have two shared corners, whereas double-chain silicates have two or three shared corners. In phyllosilicates, a sheet structure is formed which requires three shared oxygens; in the case of double-chain silicates, some tetrahedra must share two corners instead of three as otherwise a sheet structure would result. Framework silicates, or tectosilicates, have tetrahedra that share all four corners. The ring silicates, or cyclosilicates, only need tetrahedra to share two corners to form the cyclical structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 104–17&lt;/ref&gt;

The silicate subclasses are described below in order of decreasing polymerization.

====Tectosilicates====
[[File:Natroliteinde1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Natrolite]] is a mineral series in the zeolite group; this sample has a very prominent acicular crystal habit.]]
Tectosilicates, also known as framework silicates, have the highest degree of polymerization. With all corners of a tetrahedra shared, the silicon:oxygen ratio becomes 1:2. Examples are quartz, the [[feldspar]]s, [[feldspathoid]]s, and the [[zeolite]]s. Framework silicates tend to be particularly chemically stable as a result of strong covalent bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Chesterman and Cole, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt;

Forming 12% of the Earth's crust, [[quartz]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the most abundant mineral species. It is characterized by its high chemical and physical resistivity. Quartz has several polymorphs, including [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]] at high temperatures, high-pressure [[coesite]], and ultra-high pressure [[stishovite]]. The latter mineral can only be formed on Earth by meteorite impacts, and its structure has been composed so much that it had changed from a silicate structure to that of [[rutile]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The silica polymorph that is most stable at the Earth's surface is α-quartz. Its counterpart, β-quartz, is present only at high temperatures and pressures (changes to α-quartz below 573&amp;nbsp;°C at 1 bar). These two polymorphs differ by a "kinking" of bonds; this change in structure gives β-quartz greater symmetry than α-quartz, and they are thus also called high quartz (β) and low quartz (α).&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 104"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 578–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldspars are the most abundant group in the Earth's crust, at about 50%. In the feldspars, Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; substitutes for Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, which creates a charge imbalance that must be accounted for by the addition of cations. The base structure becomes either [AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or [Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  There are 22 mineral species of feldspars, subdivided into two major subgroups – alkali and plagioclase – and two less common groups – [[celsian]] and [[banalsite]]. The alkali feldspars are most commonly in a series between potassium-rich orthoclase and sodium-rich [[albite]]; in the case of plagioclase, the most common series ranges from albite to calcium-rich [[anorthite]]. Crystal twinning is common in feldspars, especially polysynthetic twins in plagioclase and Carlsbad twins in alkali feldspars. If the latter subgroup cools slowly from a melt, it forms exsolution lamellae because the two components – orthoclase and albite – are unstable in solid solution. Exsolution can be on a scale from microscopic to readily observable in hand-sample; perthitic texture forms when Na-rich feldspar exsolve in a K-rich host. The opposite texture (antiperthitic), where K-rich feldspar exsolves in a Na-rich host, is very rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 583–88&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldspathoids are structurally similar to feldspar, but differ in that they form in Si-deficient conditions, which allows for further substitution by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, feldspathoids cannot be associated with quartz. A common example of a feldspathoid is [[nepheline]] ((Na, K)AlSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;); compared to alkali feldspar, nepheline has an Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio of 1:2, as opposed to 1:6 in the feldspar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 588&lt;/ref&gt; Zeolites often have distinctive crystal habits, occurring in needles, plates, or blocky masses. They form in the presence of water at low temperatures and pressures, and have channels and voids in their structure. Zeolites have several industrial applications, especially in waste water treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 589–93&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phyllosilicates====
[[File:Muscovite-Albite-122886.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|Muscovite, a mineral species in the mica group, within the phyllosilicate subclass]]
Phyllosilicates consist of sheets of polymerized tetrahedra. They are bound at three oxygen sites, which gives a characteristic silicon:oxygen ratio of 2:5. Important examples include the [[mica]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], and the [[kaolinite]]-[[Serpentine group|serpentine]] groups. The sheets are weakly bound by [[van der Waals forces]] or [[hydrogen bond]]s, which causes a crystallographic weakness, in turn leading to a prominent basal cleavage among the phyllosilicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 525&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the tetrahedra, phyllosilicates have a sheet of octahedra (elements in six-fold coordination by oxygen) that balance out the basic tetrahedra, which have a negative charge (e.g. [Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;) These tetrahedra (T) and octahedra (O) sheets are stacked in a variety of combinations to create phyllosilicate groups. Within an octahedral sheet, there are three octahedral sites in a unit structure; however, not all of the sites may be occupied. In that case, the mineral is termed dioctahedral, whereas in other case it is termed trioctahedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

The kaolinite-serpentine group consists of T-O stacks (the 1:1 clay minerals); their hardness ranges from 2 to 4, as the sheets are held by hydrogen bonds. The 2:1 clay minerals (pyrophyllite-talc) consist of T-O-T stacks, but they are softer (hardness from 1 to 2), as they are instead held together by van der Waals forces. These two groups of minerals are subgrouped by octahedral occupation; specifically, kaolinite and pyrophyllite are dioctahedral whereas serpentine and talc trioctahedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 110–13&lt;/ref&gt;

Micas are also T-O-T-stacked phyllosilicates, but differ from the other T-O-T and T-O-stacked subclass members in that they incorporate aluminium into the tetrahedral sheets (clay minerals have Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in octahedral sites). Common examples of micas are [[muscovite]], and the [[biotite]] series. The chlorite group is related to mica group, but a [[brucite]]-like (Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) layer between the T-O-T stacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 602–05&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their chemical structure, phyllosilicates typically have flexible, elastic, transparent layers that are electrical insulators and can be split into very thin flakes. Micas can be used in electronics as insulators, in construction, as optical filler, or even cosmetics. Chrysotile, a species of serpentine, is the most common mineral species in industrial asbestos, as it is less dangerous in terms of health than the amphibole asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 593–95&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inosilicates====
[[File:Asbestos with muscovite.jpg|left|thumb|[[Asbestiform]] [[tremolite]], part of the amphibole group in the inosilicate subclass]]
Inosilicates consist of tetrahedra repeatedly bonded in chains. These chains can be single, where a tetrahedron is bound to two others to form a continuous chain; alternatively, two chains can be merged to create double-chain silicates. Single-chain silicates have a silicon:oxygen ratio of 1:3 (e.g. [Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;), whereas the double-chain variety has a ratio of 4:11, e.g. [Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt;. Inosilicates contain two important rock-forming mineral groups; single-chain silicates are most commonly [[pyroxene]]s, while double-chain silicates are often [[amphibole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 537&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-order chains exist (e.g. three-member, four-member, five-member chains, etc.) but they are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webmineral.com/strunz/strunz.php?class=09&amp;subclass=09.D|title=09.D Inosilicates|publisher=Webmineral.com|accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pyroxene group consists of 21 mineral species.&lt;ref name="DG112" /&gt; Pyroxenes have a general structure formula of XY(Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), where X is an octahedral site, while Y can vary in coordination number from six to eight. Most varieties of pyroxene consist of permutations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to balance the negative charge on the backbone. Pyroxenes are common in the Earth's crust (about 10%) and are a key constituent of mafic igneous rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}} pp. 612–13&lt;/ref&gt;

Amphiboles have great variability in chemistry, described variously as a "mineralogical garbage can" or a "mineralogical shark swimming a sea of elements". The backbone of the amphiboles is the [Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt;; it is balanced by cations in three possible positions, although the third position is not always used, and one element can occupy both remaining ones. Finally, the amphiboles are usually hydrated, that is, they have a hydroxyl group ([OH]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), although it can be replaced by a fluoride, a chloride, or an oxide ion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 606–12&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the variable chemistry, there are over 80 species of amphibole, although variations, as in the pyroxenes, most commonly involve mixtures of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="DG112"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Several amphibole mineral species can have an [[asbestiform]] crystal habit. These asbestos minerals form long, thin, flexible, and strong fibres, which are electrical insulators, chemically inert and heat-resistant; as such, they have several applications, especially in construction materials. However, asbestos are known carcinogens, and cause various other illnesses, such as [[asbestosis]]; amphibole asbestos ([[anthophyllite]], [[tremolite]], [[actinolite]], [[grunerite]], and [[riebeckite]]) are considered more dangerous than [[chrysotile]] serpentine asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 611–12&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyclosilicates====
[[File:Elbaite-121353.jpg|right|thumb|An example of elbaite, a species of tourmaline, with distinctive colour banding.]]
Cyclosilicates, or ring silicates, have a ratio of silicon to oxygen of 1:3. Six-member rings are most common, with a base structure of [Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt;; examples include the [[tourmaline]] group and [[beryl]]. Other ring structures exist, with 3, 4, 8, 9, 12 having been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 113–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Cyclosilicates tend to be strong, with elongated, striated crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourmalines have a very complex chemistry that can be described by a general formula XY&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Z&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W. The T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; is the basic ring structure, where T is usually Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, but substitutable by Al&lt;sub&gt;3+&lt;/sub&gt; or B&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Tourmalines can be subgrouped by the occupancy of the X site, and from there further subdivided by the chemistry of the W site. The Y and Z sites can accommodate a variety of cations, especially various transition metals; this variability in structural transition metal content gives the tourmaline group greater variability in colour. Other cyclosilicates include beryl, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;, whose varieties include the gemstones emerald (green) and aquamarine (bluish). [[Cordierite]] is structurally similar to beryl, and is a common metamorphic mineral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 617–21&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sorosilicates====
[[File:Epidote Oisans.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Epidote often has a distinctive pistachio-green colour.]]
Sorosilicates, also termed disilicates, have tetrahedron-tetrahedron bonding at one oxygen, which results in a 2:7 ratio of silicon to oxygen. The resultant common structural element is the [Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6−&lt;/sup&gt; group. The most common disilicates by far are members of the [[epidote]] group. Epidotes are found in variety of geologic settings, ranging from mid-ocean ridge to granites to [[pelite|metapelites]]. Epidotes are built around the structure [(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;10−&lt;/sup&gt; structure; for example, the mineral ''species'' epidote has calcium, aluminium, and ferric iron to charge balance: Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Al)(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)O(OH). The presence of iron as Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; helps understand oxygen [[fugacity]], which in turn is a significant factor in petrogenesis.&lt;ref name="DG612-627"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 612–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of sorosilicates include [[lawsonite]], a  metamorphic mineral forming in the [[blueschist]] facies (subduction zone setting with low temperature and high pressure), [[vesuvianite]], which takes up a significant amount of calcium in its chemical structure.&lt;ref name="DG612-627" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 565–73&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthosilicates====
[[File:Andradite-172390.jpg|right|thumb|Black andradite, an end-member of the orthosilicate garnet group.]]
Orthosilicates consist of isolated tetrahedra that are charge-balanced by other cations.&lt;ref name="DG116-117"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 116–17&lt;/ref&gt; Also termed nesosilicates, this type of silicate has a silicon:oxygen ratio of 1:4 (e.g. SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Typical orthosilicates tend to form blocky equant crystals, and are fairly hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 573&lt;/ref&gt; Several rock-forming minerals are part of this subclass, such as the aluminosilicates, the olivine group, and the garnet group.

The aluminosilicates –bkyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite, all Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; – are structurally composed of one [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedron, and one Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in octahedral coordination. The remaining Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; can be in six-fold coordination (kyanite), five-fold (andalusite) or four-fold (sillimanite); which mineral forms in a given environment is depend on pressure and temperature conditions. In the olivine structure, the main olivine series of (Mg, Fe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; consist of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite. Both iron and magnesium are in octahedral by oxygen. Other mineral species having this structure exist, such as [[tephroite]], Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 574–75&lt;/ref&gt; The garnet group has a general formula of X&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where X is a large eight-fold coordinated cation, and Y is a smaller six-fold coordinated cation. There are six ideal endmembers of garnet, split into two group. The pyralspite garnets have Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in the Y position: [[pyrope]] (Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[almandine]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[spessartine]] (Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The ugrandite garnets have Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the X position: [[uvarovite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[grossular]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[andradite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). While there are two subgroups of garnet, solid solutions exist between all six end-members.&lt;ref name="DG116-117"/&gt;

Other orthosilicates include [[zircon]], [[staurolite]], and [[topaz]]. Zircon (ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is useful in geochronology as the Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; can be substituted by U&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;; furthermore, because of its very resistant structure, it is difficult to reset it as a chronometer. Staurolite is a common metamorphic intermediate-grade index mineral. It has a particularly complicated crystal structure that was only fully described in 1986. Topaz (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(F, OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, often found in granitic pegmatites associated with [[tourmaline]], is a common gemstone mineral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 627–34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-silicates===

====Native elements====
{{main article|Native element minerals}}
[[File:Gold-mz4b.jpg|left|thumb|Native gold. Rare specimen of stout crystals growing off of a central stalk, size 3.7 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm, from Venezuela.]]
[[native element minerals|Native elements]] are those that are not chemically bonded to other elements. This mineral group includes [[native metal]]s, semi-metals, and non-metals, and various alloys and solid solutions. The metals are held together by metallic bonding, which confers distinctive physical properties such as their shiny metallic lustre, ductility and malleability, and electrical conductivity. Native elements are subdivided into groups by their structure or chemical attributes.

The gold group, with a cubic close-packed structure, includes metals such as gold, silver, and copper. The platinum group is similar in structure to the gold group. The iron-nickel group is characterized by several iron-nickel alloy species. Two examples are [[kamacite]] and [[taenite]], which are found in iron meteorites; these species differ by the amount of Ni in the alloy; kamacite has less than 5–7% nickel and is a variety of [[telluric iron|native iron]], whereas the nickel content of taenite ranges from 7–37%. Arsenic group minerals consist of semi-metals, which have only some metallic traits; for example, they lack the malleability of metals. Native carbon occurs in two allotropes, graphite and diamond; the latter forms at very high pressure in the mantle, which gives it a much stronger structure than graphite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 644–48&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sulfides====
{{main article|Sulfide minerals}}

The [[sulfide minerals]] are chemical compounds of one or more metals or semimetals with a sulfur; tellurium, arsenic, or selenium can substitute for the sulfur. Sulfides tend to be soft, brittle minerals with a high specific gravity. Many powdered sulfides, such as pyrite, have a sulfurous smell when powdered. Sulfides are susceptible to weathering, and many readily dissolve in water; these dissolved minerals can be later redeposited, which creates enriched secondary ore deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfides are classified by the ratio of the metal or semimetal to the sulfur, such as M:S equal to 2:1, or 1:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 649&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[sulfide mineral]]s are economically important as metal [[ore]]s; examples include [[sphalerite]] (ZnS), an ore of zinc, [[galena]] (PbS), an ore of lead, [[cinnabar]] (HgS), an ore of mercury, and [[molybdenite]] (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an ore of molybdenum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 651–54&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), is the most commonly occurring sulfide, and can be found in most geological environments. It is not, however, an ore of iron, but can be instead oxidized to produce sulfuric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 654&lt;/ref&gt; Related to the sulfides are the rare [[Sulfosalt mineral|sulfosalts]], in which a metallic element is bonded to sulfur and a semimetal such as [[antimony]], [[arsenic]], or [[bismuth]]. Like the sulfides, sulfosalts are typically soft, heavy, and brittle minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oxides====
{{main article|Oxide minerals}}
[[Oxide minerals]] are divided into three categories: simple oxides, hydroxides, and multiple oxides. Simple oxides are characterized by O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; as the main anion and primarily ionic bonding. They can be further subdivided by the ratio of oxygen to the cations. The [[periclase]] group consists of minerals with a 1:1 ratio. Oxides with a 2:1 ratio include [[cuprite]] (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and water ice. Corundum group minerals have a 2:3 ratio, and includes minerals such as [[corundum]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[hematite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Rutile group minerals have a ratio of 1:2; the eponymous species, rutile (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the chief ore of [[titanium]]; other examples include [[cassiterite]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; ore of [[tin]]), and [[pyrolusite]] (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; ore of [[manganese]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 400–03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 657–60&lt;/ref&gt;  In hydroxides, the dominant anion is the hydroxyl ion, OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Bauxite]]s are the chief aluminium ore, and are a heterogeneous mixture of the hydroxide minerals [[diaspore]], [[gibbsite]], and [[bohmite]]; they form in areas with a very high rate of chemical weathering (mainly tropical conditions).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 663–64&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, multiple oxides are compounds of two metals with oxygen. A major group within this class are the [[spinel group|spinels]], with a general formula of X&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Examples of species include [[spinel]] (MgAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chromite]] (FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The latter is readily distinguishable by its strong magnetism, which occurs as it has iron in two [[oxidation state]]s (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which makes it a multiple oxide instead of a single oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 660–63&lt;/ref&gt;

====Halides====
{{main article|Halide minerals}}
[[File:Halite-Nahcolite-51411.jpg|left|thumb|Pink cubic [[halite]] (NaCl; halide class) crystals on a [[nahcolite]] matrix (NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; a carbonate, and mineral form of sodium bicarbonate, used as [[baking soda]]).]]

The [[halide minerals]] are compounds in which a [[halogen]] (fluorine, chlorine, iodine, or bromine) is the main anion. These minerals tend to be soft, weak, brittle, and water-soluble. Common examples of halides include halite (NaCl, table salt), [[sylvite]] (KCl), [[fluorite]] (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Halite and sylvite commonly form as [[evaporite]]s, and can be dominant minerals in chemical sedimentary rocks. [[Cryolite]], Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, is a key mineral in the extraction of aluminium from [[bauxite]]s; however, as the only significant occurrence at [[Ivittuut]], [[Greenland]], in a granitic pegmatite, was depleted, synthetic cryolite can be made from fluorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 425–30&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbonates====
{{main article|Carbonate minerals}}
The [[carbonate minerals]] are those in which the main anionic group is carbonate, [CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. Carbonates tend to be brittle, many have rhombohedral cleavage, and all react with acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the last characteristic, field geologists often carry dilute hydrochloric acid to distinguish carbonates from non-carbonates. The reaction of acid with carbonates, most commonly found as the polymorph calcite and [[aragonite]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), relates to the dissolution and precipitation of the mineral, which is a key in the formation of limestone caves, features within them such as stalactite and stalagmites, and [[karst]] landforms. Carbonates are most often formed as biogenic or chemical sediments in marine environments. The carbonate group is structurally a triangle, where a central C&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cation is surrounded by three O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; anions; different groups of minerals form from different arrangements of these triangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 667&lt;/ref&gt; The most common carbonate mineral is calcite, which is the primary constituent of sedimentary limestone and metamorphic marble. Calcite, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, can have a high magnesium impurity. Under high-Mg conditions, its polymorph aragonite will form instead; the marine geochemistry in this regard can be described as an [[aragonite sea|aragonite]] or [[calcite sea]], depending on which mineral preferentially forms. [[Dolomite]] is a double carbonate, with the formula CaMg(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Secondary dolomitization of limestone is common, in which calcite or aragonite are converted to dolomite; this reaction increases pore space (the unit cell volume of dolomite is 88% that of calcite), which can create a reservoir for oil and gas. These two mineral species are members of eponymous mineral groups: the calcite group includes carbonates with the general formula XCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and the dolomite group constitutes minerals with the general formula XY(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 668–69&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sulfates====
{{main article|Sulfate minerals}}
[[File:Roses des Sables Tunisie.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Gypsum desert rose]]
The [[sulfate mineral]]s all contain the sulfate anion, [SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. They tend to be transparent to translucent, soft, and many are fragile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfate minerals commonly form as [[evaporite]]s, where they precipitate out of evaporating saline waters. Sulfates can also be found in hydrothermal vein systems associated with sulfides,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 456–57&lt;/ref&gt; or as oxidation products of sulfides.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 674&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfates can be subdivided into anhydrous and hydrous minerals. The most common hydrous sulfate by far is [[gypsum]], CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;⋅2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It forms as an evaporite, and is associated with other evaporites such as calcite and halite; if it incorporates sand grains as it crystallizes, gypsum can form [[Desert rose (crystal)|desert rose]]s. Gypsum has very low thermal conductivity and maintains a low temperature when heated as it loses that heat by dehydrating; as such, gypsum is used as an insulator in materials such as plaster and drywall. The anhydrous equivalent of gypsum is [[anhydrite]]; it can form directly from seawater in highly arid conditions. The barite group has the general formula XSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where the X is a large 12-coordinated cation. Examples include [[barite]] (BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Celestine (mineral)|celestine]] (SrSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[anglesite]] (PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;); anhydrite is not part of the barite group, as the smaller Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is only in eight-fold coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 672–73&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phosphates====
{{main article|Phosphate minerals}}
The [[phosphate minerals]] are characterized by the tetrahedral [PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; unit, although the structure can be generalized, and phosphorus is replaced by antimony, arsenic, or vanadium. The most common phosphate is the [[apatite]] group; common species within this group are fluorapatite (Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F), chlorapatite (Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl) and hydroxylapatite (Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)). Minerals in this group are the main crystalline constituents of teeth and bones in vertebrates. The relatively abundant [[monazite]] group has a general structure of ATO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where T is phosphorus or arsenic, and A is often a [[rare-earth element]] (REE). Monazite is important in two ways: first, as a REE "sink", it can sufficiently concentrate these elements to become an ore; secondly, monazite group elements can incorporate relatively large amounts of uranium and thorium, which can be used in [[monazite geochronology]] to date the rock based on the decay of the U and Th to lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 675–80&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organic minerals====
{{main article|Organic mineral}}
The Strunz classification includes a class for [[Strunz classification#Class: organic compounds|organic minerals]]. These rare compounds contain [[Organic compound|organic carbon]], but can be formed by a geologic process. For example, [[whewellite]], CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;⋅H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is an [[oxalate]] that can be deposited in hydrothermal ore veins. While hydrated calcium oxalate can be found in coal seams and other sedimentary deposits involving organic matter, the hydrothermal occurrence is not considered to be related to biological activity.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 681"/&gt;

==Astrobiology==
It has been suggested that [[Biomineralization|biominerals]] could be important indicators of [[extraterrestrial life]] and thus could play an important role in the search for past or present life on the planet [[Mars]].  Furthermore, [[Organic compounds (minerals)|organic components]] ([[biosignature]]s) that are often associated with biominerals are believed to play crucial roles in both pre-biotic and [[Biotic material|biotic]] reactions.&lt;ref name=SSG &gt;{{Cite book |editor2-first=David |editor2-last= Beaty |contribution=Final report of the MEPAG Astrobiology Field Laboratory Science Steering Group (AFL-SSG)| title=The Astrobiology Field Laboratory |editor1-first=Andrew |editor1-last=Steele |publisher=[[Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group]] (MEPAG) – NASA |place= |page=72 |date=September 26, 2006 |id= |contribution-url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports/AFL_SSG_WHITE_PAPER_v3.doc |format=.doc |accessdate=2009-07-22 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moisture expansion''' is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in moisture content. The macroscopic effect is similar to that of [[thermal expansion]] but the microscopic causes are very different. Moisture expansion is caused by [[hygroscopy]].

A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wrangell St. Elias National Park.jpg|thumb| [[Glacier]] on the border between [[Alaska]], US, and Canada: [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system]]
Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11876">'''Nature writing''' is [[nonfiction]] or [[fiction]] [[prose]] or [[poetry]] about the natural environment. Nature writing encompasses a wide variety of works, ranging from those that place primary emphasis on natural history facts (such as field guides) to those in which philosophical interpretation predominate. It includes [[natural history]] essays, poetry, essays of solitude or escape, as well as travel and adventure writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Lyon|first=Thomas Jefferson|publisher=Milkweed Editions|date=2001|title=This Incomparable Land: A Guide to American Nature Writing|ISBN=978-1571312563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nature writing often draws heavily on scientific information and facts about the natural world; at the same time, it is frequently written in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] and incorporates personal observations of and philosophical reflections upon nature.

Modern nature writing traces its roots to the works of [[natural history]] that were popular in the second half of the 18th century and throughout the 19th. An important early figures was the "[[parson-naturalist]]" [[Gilbert White]] (1720 – 1793),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosse|first=Edmund|year=1903|title=English Literature: From Milton to Johnson|chapter="Gilbert White"|location=London|publisher=William Heinemann|pages=375–378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUAOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA375}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneering [[England|English]] [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[Ornithology|ornithologist]]. He is best known for his ''[[Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]'' (1789).

[[William Bartram]] (1739 – 1823) is a significant early American pioneer naturalist who first work was published in 1791.

==Pioneers==
Gilbert White is regarded by many as [[England]]'s first [[ecologist]], and one of those who shaped the modern attitude of respect for nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hazell, D.L., Heinsohn, R.G. and Lindenmayer, D.B. 2005. Ecology. pp. 97-112 in R.Q. Grafton, L. Robin and R.J. Wasson (eds.), ''Understanding the Environment: Bridging the Disciplinary Divides''. Sydney, NSW: University of New South Wales Press, (p. 99).&lt;/ref&gt; He said of the [[earthworm]]: "Earthworms, though in appearance a small and despicable link in the chain of nature, yet, if lost, would make a lamentable chasm. [...] worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation, which would proceed but lamely without them"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z_YVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA205 Letter LXVII] (1777)&lt;/ref&gt; White and [[William Markwick]] collected records of the dates of emergence of more than 400 plant and animal species in [[Hampshire]] and [[Sussex]] between 1768 and 1793, which was summarised in ''The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne'', as the earliest and latest dates for each event over the 25-year period, are among the earliest examples of modern [[phenology]].

The tradition of [[Parson-naturalist|clerical naturalists]] predates White and can be traced back to some monastic writings of the Middle Ages, although some argue that their writings about animals and plants cannot be correctly classified as natural history. Notable early parson-naturalists were William Turner (1508–1568), John Ray (1627–1705), William Derham (1657–1735).

William Bertram, in 1773, embarked on a four year journey through eight southern American colonies. Bartram made many drawings and took notes on the native [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and the [[Native Americans in the United States|native American Indians]]. In [[Timeline of Florida History|1774]], he explored the St. Johns River.&lt;ref&gt;Bartram, William. ''The Travels of William Bartram, Naturalist Edition''. Edited with Commentary and an Annotated Index by Francis Harper. University of Georgia Press, Athens, 1998,  p118&lt;/ref&gt; William Bartram wrote of his experiences exploring the Southeast in his book known today as ''[[Bartram's Travels]]'', published in 1791. [[Ephraim George Squier]] and [[Edwin Hamilton Davis]], in their book, ''[[Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley]]'', name Bartram as "the first naturalist who penetrated the dense tropical forests of Florida."&lt;ref name=Squier&gt;{{cite book|last=Squier|first=E.G.|title=Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley|year=1848|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|location=Washington, D.C.|page=46|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4301/view/1/46/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gilbert White and William Bertram, other significant writers include American [[ornithologist]] [[John James Audubon]] (1785 – 1851), [[Charles Darwin]]( (1809 – 1882),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosse|first=Edmund|year=1906|title=English Literature: From the Age of Johnson to the Age of Tennyson|chapter=CHARLES DARWIN|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan Co|pages=298–302|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zn3gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA298}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Jefferies]] (1848 – 1887), [[Susan Fenimore Cooper]] (1813 – 1894), mother of American nature writting, and [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817 – 1862), who is often considered the father of modern American nature writing, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803 – 1882) [[John Burroughs]], [[John Muir]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[Rachel Carson]], [[M. Krishnan]], and [[Edward Abbey]] (although he rejected the term for himself).

Another important early work is ''[[A History of British Birds]]''  by [[Thomas Bewick]], published in two volumes. Volume 1, "Land Birds", appeared in 1797. Volume 2, "Water Birds", appeared in 1804.  The book was effectively the first "[[field guide]]" for non-specialists. Bewick provides an accurate illustration of each species, from life if possible, or from skins. The common and scientific name(s) are listed, citing the naming authorities. The bird is described, with its distribution and behaviour, often with extensive quotations from printed sources or correspondents. Critics note Bewick's skill as a [[naturalist]] as well as an engraver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://britishbirds.co.uk/article/thomas-bewick-the-complete-illustrative-work-by-nigel-tattersfield/|title=Thomas Bewick: the complete illustrative work, by Nigel Tattersfield - British Birds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Europe==
Some important contemporary figures in Britain include [[Richard Mabey]], [[Roger Deakin]], [[Mark Cocker]], and [[Oliver Rackham]]. Rackham's books included ''Ancient Woodland'' (1980) and ''The History of the Countryside'' (1986). Richard Maybey has been involved with radio and television programmes on nature, and his book ''Nature Cure'', describes his experiences and recovery from depression in the context of man’s relationship with landscape and nature. He has also edited and introduced editions of Richard Jefferies, Gilbert White, [[Flora Thompson]] and [[Peter Matthiessen]]. Mark Crocker has written extensively for British newspapers and magazines and his books include [[Birds Britannica]] (with Richard Mabey) (2005). and ''Crow Country'' (2007). He frequently writes about modern responses to the wild, whether found in landscape, human societies or in other species. Roger Deakin was an English writer, documentary-maker and environmentalist. In 1999, Deakin's acclaimed book ''Waterlog'' was published.&lt;ref name="Archive"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/08/archive-environmentalist-roger-deakin-university?INTCMP=SRCH|title= Archives of environmentalist Roger Deakin given to university|date= 8 May 2010|publisher=Guardian |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired in part by the short story ''[[The Swimmer (short story)|The Swimmer]]'' by [[John Cheever]],&lt;ref&gt;Subsequently made into [[The Swimmer (1968 film)|a film]] starring [[Burt Lancaster]].&lt;/ref&gt; it describes his experiences of '[[Open water swimming|wild swimming]]' in Britain's rivers and lakes and advocates [[Freedom to roam|open access]] to the countryside and waterways.  Deakin's book ''Wildwood'' appeared posthumously in 2007. It describes a series of journeys across the globe that Deakin made to meet people whose lives are intimately connected to trees and wood.

In 2017 the German book publishing company [[Matthes &amp; Seitz Berlin]] started to grant the [[Deutscher Preis für Nature Writing|German Award for Nature Writing]], an annual literary award for writers in German language that excellently fulfil the criteria of the literary genre. It comes with a price money of 10.000 Euro and additionallly an [[artist in residency]] grant of six weeks at the International Academy for Nature Conservation of Germany on the German island [[Vilm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boersenblatt.net/artikel-preis_fuer_nature_writing_2018.1492164.html |title= Preis für Nature Writing 2018: Sabine Scho und Christian Lehnert ausgezeichnet |date=2018-07-13 |website=boersenblatt.net |access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Council]] in 2018 is offering an education bursary and workshops to six young German authors dedicated to Nature writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britishcouncil.de/uk-germany-2018/writers-nature-stipendium |title=Writers by Nature: Stipendium |date=2018 |website=britishcouncil.de |access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Nevadaite is a pale-green to turquoise colored mineral belonging to the phosphate group. It exhibits a radial crystal habit consisting of prismatic crystals covering areas up to 2&amp;nbsp;cm. It has a pale-blue streak, a [[Glass|vitreous]] luster, and is not [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]]. Nevadaite is in the orthorhombic crystal system and displays conchoidal fracture.&lt;ref name="webmineral"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nevadaite Mineral Data|url = http://webmineral.com/data/Nevadaite.shtml#.Vl-wN3arTIV|website = webmineral.com|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
[[File:Sedimentary-rock hosted gold deposits in Nevada.gif|left|thumb|269x269px]]
Nevadaite was first discovered in the Gold Quarry mine near the town of Carlin, Eureka County, Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nevadaite: Nevadaite mineral information and data.|url = http://www.mindat.org/min-25696.html|website = www.mindat.org|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unique conditions and amounts of phosphate, vanadate, arsenate, and uranate in this area led to the formation of two new minerals; one being nevadaite and the other being goldquarryite. The Gold Quarry mine has been operated by The Newmont Mining Corporation since 1985 for the extraction of [[Carlin–type gold deposit|Carlin-type gold deposits]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Nevadaite was discovered in February 1992 by Martin C. Jensen and was approved by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is also found in a copper mine in Kyrgyzstan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28607">In [[metaphysics]], '''nominalism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] view which denies the existence of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] and [[abstract object]]s, but affirms the existence of general or abstract terms and [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]].&lt;ref&gt;Mill (1872); Bigelow (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least two main versions of nominalism. One version denies the existence of universals – things that can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things (e.g., strength, humanity). The other version specifically denies the existence of abstract objects – objects that do not exist in space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez-Pereyra (2008) writes: "The word 'Nominalism', as used by contemporary philosophers in the Anglo-American tradition, is ambiguous. In one sense, its most traditional sense deriving from the Middle Ages, it implies the rejection of universals. In another, more modern but equally entrenched sense, it implies the rejection of abstract objects" (§1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most nominalists have held that only physical particulars in space and time are real, and that universals exist only ''post res'', that is, subsequent to particular things.&lt;ref&gt;Feibleman (1962), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some versions of nominalism hold that some particulars are abstract entities (e.g., numbers), while others are concrete entities – entities that do exist in space and time (e.g., pillars, snakes, bananas).

Nominalism is primarily a position on the [[problem of universals]], which dates back at least to [[Plato]], and is opposed to [[Philosophical realism|realist]] philosophies, such as [[Platonic realism]], which assert that universals do exist over and above particulars. However, the name "nominalism" emerged from debates in medieval philosophy with [[Roscellinus]].

The term 'nominalism' stems from the [[Latin]] ''nomen'', "name". For example, [[John Stuart Mill]] once wrote, that "there is nothing general except names".

In [[philosophy of law]], nominalism finds its application in what is called '''constitutional nominalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;An overview of the philosophical problems and an application of the concept to a case of the Supreme Court of the State of California, gives Thomas Kupka, 'Verfassungsnominalismus', in: ''Archives for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy'' 97 (2011), 44–77, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2343741 PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{also|Anti-realism}}
===Ancient Greek philosophy===
[[Plato]] was perhaps the first&lt;ref name="Penner 1987, p. 24"&gt;Penner (1987), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; writer in [[Western philosophy]] to clearly state a non-nominalist position:
&lt;blockquote&gt; ...We customarily hypothesize a single form in connection with each of the many things to which we apply the same name.  ...  For example, there are many beds and tables.  ...  But there are only two forms of such furniture, one of the bed and one of the table.  ([[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] 596a-b, trans. Grube) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What about someone who believes in beautiful things, but doesn't believe in the beautiful itself…? Don't you think he is living in a dream rather than a wakened state? (''Republic'' 476c)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Platonic universals corresponding to the names "bed" and "beautiful" were the [[Theory of Forms|Form]] of the Bed and the Form of the Beautiful, or the ''Bed Itself'' and the ''Beautiful Itself''.  Platonic Forms were the first universals posited as such in philosophy.&lt;ref name="Penner 1987, p. 24"/&gt;

Our term "universal" is due to the English translation of [[Aristotle]]'s technical term ''katholou'' which he coined specially for the purpose of discussing the problem of universals.&lt;ref&gt;Peters (1967), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Katholou'' is a contraction of the phrase ''kata holou'', meaning "on the whole".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/dict?name=lsj&amp;lang=el&amp;word=kaqo%2flou&amp;filter=GreekXlit "katholou"] in [[Harvard]]'s Archimedes Project online version of [[Henry Liddell|Liddell]] &amp; [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott]]'s ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle famously rejected certain aspects of Plato's Theory of Forms, but he clearly rejected nominalism as well:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...'Man', and indeed every general predicate, signifies not an individual, but some quality, or quantity or relation, or something of that sort.  (''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'' xxii, 178b37, trans. Pickard-Cambridge)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first philosophers to explicitly describe nominalist arguments were the [[Stoics]], especially [[Chrysippus]].&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84–85: "[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ... For Chrysippus there are no universal entities, whether they be conceived as substantial [[Platonic Forms]] or in some other manner.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/ Chrysippus (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval philosophy===
In [[medieval philosophy]], the French philosopher and [[Theology|theologian]] [[Roscellinus]] (c. 1050 – c. 1125) was an early, prominent proponent of nominalism. Nominalist ideas can be found in the work of [[Peter Abelard]] and reached their flowering in [[William of Ockham]], who was the most influential and thorough nominalist. Abelard's and Ockham's version of nominalism is sometimes called [[conceptualism]], which presents itself as a middle way between nominalism and realism, asserting that there ''is'' something in common among like individuals, but that it is a concept in the mind, rather than a real entity existing independently of the mind. Ockham argued that only individuals existed and that universals were only mental ways of referring to sets of individuals. "I maintain", he wrote, "that a universal is not something real that exists in a subject... but that it has a being only as a thought-object in the mind [objectivum in anima]". As a general rule, Ockham argued against assuming any entities that were not necessary for explanations.  Accordingly, he wrote, there is no reason to believe that there is an entity called "humanity" that resides inside, say, Socrates, and nothing further is explained by making this claim. This is in accord with the analytical method that has since come to be called [[Ockham's razor]], the principle that the explanation of any phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible. Critics argue that conceptualist approaches only answer the psychological question of universals. If the same concept is ''correctly'' and non-arbitrarily applied to two individuals, there must be some resemblance or shared property between the two individuals that justifies their falling under the same concept and that is just the metaphysical problem that universals were brought in to address, the starting-point of the whole problem (MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein, 2006, §3d). If resemblances between individuals are asserted, conceptualism becomes moderate realism; if they are denied, it collapses into nominalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friesian.com/universl.htm|title=Meaning and the Problem of Universals|author=|date=|website=www.friesian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern and contemporary philosophy===
In [[modern philosophy]], nominalism was revived by [[Thomas Hobbes]]&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes/ Thomas Hobbes (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Gassendi]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gassendi/ Pierre Gassendi (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[analytic philosophy]], it has been defended by [[Rudolf Carnap]],&lt;ref name=:0&gt;[https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/resemblance-nominalism-a-solution-to-the-problem-of-universals/ "Review of Gonzalo Rodriguez-Pereyra, ''Resemblance Nominalism: A Solution to the Problem of Universals''" – ndpr.nd.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nelson Goodman]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goodman/supplement.html "Nelson Goodman: The Calculus of Individuals in its different versions", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[H. H. Price]],&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; and [[D. C. Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-dc/ Donald Cary Williams, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The problem of universals==

Nominalism arose in reaction to the [[problem of universals]], specifically accounting for the fact that some things are of the same type.  For example, Fluffy and Kitzler are both cats, or, the fact that certain properties are repeatable, such as: the grass, the shirt, and Kermit the Frog are green. One wants to know by virtue of ''what'' are Fluffy and Kitzler both cats, and ''what'' makes the grass, the shirt, and Kermit green.

The [[Platonic realism|Platonist]] answer is that all the green things are green in virtue of the [[existence]] of a universal; a single [[Abstraction|abstract]] thing that, in this case, is a [[part (mathematics)|part]] of all the green things. With respect to the color of the grass, the shirt and Kermit, one of their parts is identical. In this respect, the three parts are literally one. Greenness is repeatable because there is one thing that [[exemplification|manifests]] itself wherever there are green things.

Nominalism denies the existence of universals. The motivation for this flows from several concerns, the first one being where they might exist. [[Plato]] famously held, on one interpretation, that there is a realm of abstract forms or universals apart from the physical world (see [[theory of the forms]]). Particular physical objects merely exemplify or instantiate the universal. But this raises the question: Where is this universal realm?  One possibility is that it is outside space and time. A view sympathetic with this possibility holds that, precisely because some form is immanent in several physical objects, it must also transcend each of those physical objects; in this way, the forms are "transcendent" only insofar as they are "immanent" in many physical objects. In other words, immanence implies transcendence; they are not opposed to one another. (Nor, in this view, would there be a separate "world" or "realm" of forms that is distinct from the physical world, thus shirking much of the worry about where to locate a "universal realm".) However, [[metaphysical naturalism|naturalists]] assert that nothing is outside of space and time. Some [[Neoplatonists]], such as the pagan philosopher [[Plotinus]] and the Christian philosopher [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], imply (anticipating [[conceptualism]]) that universals are contained within the [[Preformation theory|''mind'' of God]]. To complicate things, what is the nature of the [[instantiation principle|instantiation]] or [[exemplification]] [[logic of relatives|relation]]?

[[Conceptualism|Conceptualists]] hold a position intermediate between nominalism and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], saying that universals exist only within the [[mind]] and have no external or substantial reality.

[[Moderate realism|Moderate realists]] hold that there is no realm in which universals exist, but rather universals are located in space and time wherever they are manifest. Now, recall that a universal, like greenness, is supposed to be a single thing. Nominalists consider it unusual that there could be a single thing that exists in multiple places simultaneously. The realist maintains that all the instances of greenness are held together by the exemplification relation, but this relation cannot be explained.

Finally, many philosophers prefer simpler [[ontology|ontologies]] populated with only the bare minimum of types of entities, or as [[W. V. O. Quine]] said "They have a taste for 'desert landscapes.'" They try to express everything that they want to explain without using universals such as "catness" or "greenness."

==Varieties&lt;!--Predicate nominalism', 'Resemblance nominalism', and 'Class nominalism' redirect here--&gt;==
There are various forms of nominalism ranging from extreme to almost-realist. One extreme is '''predicate nominalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, which states that Fluffy and Kitzler, for example, are both cats simply because the predicate 'is a cat' applies to both of them. And this is the case for all similarity of attribute among objects. The main criticism of this view is that it does not provide a sufficient solution to the problem of universals. It fails to provide an account of what makes it the case that a group of things warrant having the same predicate applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §3a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of '''resemblance nominalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; believe that 'cat' applies to both cats because Fluffy and Kitzler resemble an [[wikt:exemplar|exemplar]] cat closely enough to be classed together with it as members of its [[natural kind|kind]], or that they differ from each other (and other cats) quite less than they differ from other things, and this warrants classing them together.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §3b.&lt;/ref&gt; Some resemblance nominalists will concede that the resemblance relation is itself a universal, but is the only universal necessary. Others argue that each resemblance relation is a particular, and is a resemblance relation simply in virtue of its resemblance to other resemblance relations. This generates an infinite regress, but many argue that it is not [[virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, H. H. Price (1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Class nominalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; argues that class membership forms the metaphysical backing for property relationships: two particular red balls share a property in that they are both members of classes corresponding to their properties—that of being red and being balls. A version of class nominalism that sees some classes as "natural classes" is held by [[Anthony Quinton, Baron Quinton|Anthony Quinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Properties and Classes|first=Anthony|last=Quinton|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|volume=58|year=1957|pages=33–58|jstor=4544588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conceptualism]] is a philosophical theory that explains universality of particulars as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind.&lt;ref&gt;Strawson, P. F. "Conceptualism." Universals, concepts and qualities: new essays on the meaning of predicates. Ashgate Publishing, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of universals from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside of the mind's perception of them.&lt;ref&gt;"Conceptualism." The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy. Simon Blackburn. Oxford University Press, 1996. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 8 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of nominalism is [[trope nominalism]].  A trope is a particular instance of a property, like the specific greenness of a shirt.  One might argue that there is a primitive, [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] resemblance relation that holds among like tropes.  Another route is to argue that all apparent tropes are constructed out of more primitive tropes and that the most primitive tropes are the entities of complete [[physics]].  Primitive trope resemblance may thus be accounted for in terms of causal [[indiscernibility]]. Two tropes are exactly resembling if substituting one for the other would make no difference to the events in which they are taking part. Varying degrees of resemblance at the macro level can be explained by varying degrees of resemblance at the micro level, and micro-level resemblance is explained in terms of something no less robustly physical than causal power.  [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], perhaps the most prominent contemporary realist, argues that such a trope-based  variant of nominalism has promise, but holds that it is unable to account for the laws of nature in the way his theory of universals can.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[Ian Hacking]] has also argued that much of what is called [[social constructionism]] of science in contemporary times is actually motivated by an unstated nominalist metaphysical view.  For this reason, he claims, scientists and constructionists tend to "shout past each other".&lt;ref&gt;Hacking (1999), pp. 80-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytic philosophy and mathematics===
A notion that philosophy, especially [[ontology]] and the [[philosophy of mathematics]] should abstain from [[set theory]] owes much to the writings of [[Nelson Goodman]] (see especially Goodman 1940 and 1977), who argued that concrete and abstract entities having no parts, called ''individuals'' exist. Collections of individuals likewise exist, but two collections having the same individuals are the same collection. Goodman was himself drawing heavily on the work of [[Stanisław Leśniewski]], especially his [[mereology]], which was itself a reaction to the paradoxes associated with Cantorian set theory. Leśniewski denied the existence of the [[empty set]] and held that any [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] was identical to the individual inside it. Classes corresponding to what are held to be species or genera are concrete sums of their concrete constituting individuals. For example, the class of philosophers is nothing but the sum of all concrete, individual philosophers.

The principle of [[extensionality]] in set theory assures us that any matching pair of curly braces enclosing one or more instances of the same individuals denote the same set. Hence {''a'', ''b''}, {''b'', ''a''}, {''a'', ''b'', ''a'', ''b''} are all the same set. For Goodman and other nominalists, {''a'', ''b''} is also identical to {''a'', {''b''} }, {''b'', {''a'', ''b''} }, and any combination of matching curly braces and one or more instances of ''a'' and ''b'', as long as ''a'' and ''b'' are names of individuals and not of collections of individuals. Goodman, [[Richard Milton Martin]], and [[Willard Quine]] all advocated reasoning about collectivities by means of a theory of ''virtual sets'' (see especially Quine 1969), one making possible all elementary operations on sets except that the [[universe]] of a quantified variable cannot contain any virtual sets.

In the [[foundation of mathematics]], nominalism has come to mean doing mathematics without assuming that [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] in the mathematical sense exist. In practice, this means that [[Quantifier (logic)|quantified variables]] may range over [[universe]]s of [[number]]s, [[point (geometry)|points]], primitive [[ordered pair]]s, and other abstract ontological primitives, but not over sets whose members are such individuals. To date, only a small fraction of the corpus of modern mathematics can be rederived in a nominalistic fashion.

==Criticisms==
;Critique of the historical origins of the term
As a category of late medieval thought, the concept of 'nominalism' has been increasingly queried. Traditionally, the fourteenth century has been regarded as the heyday of nominalism, with figures such as [[John Buridan]] and [[William of Ockham]] viewed as founding figures. However, the concept of 'nominalism' as a movement (generally contrasted with 'realism'), first emerged only in the late fourteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;The classic starting point of nominalism has been the edict issued by [[Louis XI]] in 1474 commanding that realism alone (as contained in scholars such as [[Averroes]], [[Albert the Great]], [[Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]] and [[Bonaventure]]) be taught at the University of Paris, and ordering that the books of various 'renovating scholars', including Ockham, [[Gregory of Rimini]], Buridan and [[Peter of Ailly]] be removed. The edict used the word 'nominalist' to describe those students at Paris who 'are not afraid to imitate' the renovators. These students then made a reply to Louis XI, defending nominalism as a movement going back to Ockham, which had been persecuted repeatedly, but which in fact represents the truer philosophy.  See Robert Pasnau, ''Metaphysical Themes, 1274-1671'', (New York: OUP, 2011), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; and only gradually became widespread during the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;For example, when [[Jerome of Prague]] visited the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1406, he described the nominalists as those who deny the reality of universals outside the human mind, and realists as those who affirm that reality. Also, for instance, in a 1425 document from the [[University of Cologne]] which draws a distinction between the via of Thomas Aquinas, Albert the Great, and the via of the 'modern masters' John Buridan and Marsilius of Inghen. See Robert Pasnau, ''Metaphysical Themes, 1274-1671'', (New York: OUP, 2011), p84.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of two distinct ways, a ''via antiqua'', associated with realism, and a ''via moderna'', associated with nominalism, became widespread only in the later fifteenth century – a dispute which eventually dried up in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="See Robert Pasnau 2011 p84"&gt;See Robert Pasnau, ''Metaphysical Themes, 1274-1671'', (New York: OUP, 2011), p84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aware that explicit thinking in terms of a divide between 'nominalism' and 'realism' only emerged in the fifteenth century, scholars have increasingly questioned whether a fourteenth-century school of nominalism can really be said to have existed. While one might speak of family resemblances between Ockham, Buridan, Marsilius and others, there are also striking differences. More fundamentally, Robert Pasnau has questioned whether any kind of coherent body of thought that could be called 'nominalism' can be discerned in fourteenth century writing.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert Pasnau, ''Metaphysical Themes, 1274-1671'', (New York: OUP, 2011), p86.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it difficult, it has been argued, to follow the twentieth century narrative which portrayed late scholastic philosophy as a dispute which emerged in the fourteenth century between the ''via moderna'', nominalism, and the ''via antiqua'', realism, with the nominalist ideas of [[William of Ockham]] foreshadowing the eventual rejection of scholasticism in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="See Robert Pasnau 2011 p84"/&gt;

;Critique of nominalist reconstructions in mathematics
A critique of nominalist reconstructions in mathematics was undertaken by Burgess (1983) and Burgess and Rosen (1997). Burgess distinguished two types of nominalist reconstructions.  Thus, ''hermeneutic nominalism'' is the hypothesis that science, properly interpreted, already dispenses with mathematical objects
(entities) such as numbers and sets.  Meanwhile, ''revolutionary nominalism'' is the project of replacing current scientific theories by alternatives dispensing with mathematical objects (see Burgess, 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;96).  A recent study extends the Burgessian critique to three nominalistic reconstructions: the reconstruction of analysis by [[Georg Cantor]], [[Richard Dedekind]], and [[Karl Weierstrass]] that dispensed with [[infinitesimal]]s; the [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] re-reconstruction of Weierstrassian analysis by [[Errett Bishop]] that dispensed with the [[law of excluded middle]]; and the hermeneutic reconstruction, by [[Carl Boyer]], [[Judith Grabiner]], and others, of [[Cauchy]]'s foundational contribution to analysis that dispensed with Cauchy's infinitesimals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Usadi Katz | first1 = Karin | authorlink2 = Mikhail Katz | last2 = Katz | first2 = Mikhail G. | year = 2011 | title = A Burgessian Critique of Nominalistic Tendencies in Contemporary Mathematics and its Historiography | url = | journal = [[Foundations of Science]] | volume = | issue = | page = | doi = 10.1007/s10699-011-9223-1 | arxiv = 1104.0375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pebbleswithquarzite.jpg|thumb|Pebbles on a [[shingle beach]] in [[Somerset]], England]]

A '''pebble''' is a [[clastic rocks|clast]] of [[rock (geology)|rock]] with a [[grain size|particle size]] of 2 to 64 millimetres based on the [[Particle size (grain size)|Krumbein phi scale]] of [[sedimentology]]. Pebbles are generally considered larger than [[Granule (geology)|granules]] (2&amp;nbsp;to 4 millimetres diameter) and smaller than [[Cobble (geology)|cobbles]] (64&amp;nbsp;to 256 millimetres diameter). A rock made predominantly of pebbles is termed a [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]].  [[oldowan|Pebble tools]] are among the earliest known man-made artifacts, dating from the [[Palaeolithic]] period of human history.

A beach composed chiefly of surface pebbles is commonly termed a [[shingle beach]]. This type of beach has [[armor (hydrology)|armoring characteristics]] with respect to wave [[erosion]], as well as ecological niches that provide [[habitat]] for animals and plants.

Inshore banks of shingle (large quantities of pebbles) exist in some locations, such as the entrance to the [[River Ore]], where the moving banks of shingle give notable navigational challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitmyharbour.com/harbours/east-coast/ore-alde-rivers/|title=Ore and Alde, Rivers - East Coast: pilotage, charts, photos and marine business listings|author=|date=|website=www.visitmyharbour.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pebbles come in various colors and textures and can have streaks, known as [[Vein (geology)|vein]]s, of [[quartz]] or other [[mineral]]s. Pebbles are mostly smooth but, dependent on how frequently they come in contact with the sea, they can have marks of contact with other rocks or other pebbles. Pebbles left above the [[tide|high water mark]] may have growths of organisms such as [[lichen]] on them, signifying the lack of contact with [[seawater]].

== Location ==

Pebbles are found in two locations – on the beaches of various oceans and seas, and inland where ancient seas used to cover the land. When then the seas retreated, the rocks became landlocked. They can also be found in lakes and ponds. Pebbles can also form in [[river]]s, and travel into [[estuary|estuaries]] where the smoothing continues in the sea.

Beach pebbles and river pebbles (also known as river rock) are distinct in their geological formation and appearance.

=== Beach ===
[[File:Pebbles in Rethymno's beach.jpg|alt= Pebbles in Rethymno's beach, Crete.|thumb|Pebbles in [[Rethymno]]'s beach, [[Crete]].]]
Beach pebbles form gradually over time as the ocean water washes over loose rock particles. The result is a smooth, rounded appearance.  The typical size range is from 2&amp;nbsp;mm to 50&amp;nbsp;mm. The colors range from translucent white to black, and include shades of yellow, brown, red and green.  Some of the more plentiful pebble beaches are found along the coast of the [[Pacific Ocean]], beginning in the United States and extending down to the tip of South America in Argentina. Other pebble beaches are found in northern Europe (particularly on the beaches of the [[Norwegian Sea]]), along the coast of the U.K. and Ireland, on the shores of Australia, and around the islands of Indonesia and Japan.

=== Inland ===

Inland pebbles (river pebbles of river rock) are usually found along the shores of large rivers and lakes. These pebbles form as the flowing water washes over rock particles on the bottom and along the shores of the [[river]]. The smoothness and color of river pebbles depends on several factors, such as the composition of the [[soil]] of the river banks, the chemical characteristics of the water, and the speed of the [[Water current|current]].  Because river current is gentler than the [[Wind wave|ocean waves]], river pebbles are usually not as smooth as beach pebbles. The most common colors of river rock are black, grey, green, brown and white.

== Human use ==
[[File:Pebble lane.JPG|thumb|A walkway decorated with pebbles set into concrete.]]
Beach pebbles and river pebbles are used for a variety of purposes, both outdoors and indoors.  They can be sorted by colour and size, and they can also be polished to improve the texture and colour. Outdoors, beach pebbles are often used for [[landscaping]], [[building construction|construction]] and as decorative elements. Beach pebbles are often used to cover walkways and driveways, around pools, in and around plant containers, on patios and decks. Beach and river pebbles are also used to create water-smart gardens in areas where water is scarce. Small pebbles are also used to create living spaces and gardens on the rooftops of buildings. Indoors, pebbles can be used as [[bookend]]s and [[paperweight]]s. Large pebbles are also used to create "[[pet rocks]]" for children.

==  Extraterrestrial occurrences ==
On [[Mars]], slabs of pebbly conglomerate rock have been found and have been interpreted by scientists as having formed in an ancient streambed. The gravels, which were discovered by [[NASA]]'s Mars rover [[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]], range from the size of sand particles to the size of golf balls. Analysis has shown that the pebbles were deposited by a stream that flowed at walking pace and was ankle- to hip-deep.&lt;ref name="Mars1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2012-305 | title=NASA Rover Finds Old Streambed on Martian Surface | publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] / [[California Institute of Technology]] | work=News | date=27 September 2012 | accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Photophoresis''' denotes the phenomenon that small particles suspended in [[gas]] (aerosols) or [[liquids]] (hydrocolloids) start to migrate when illuminated  by a sufficiently intense beam of [[light]]. The existence of this phenomenon is owed to a non-uniform distribution of temperature of an illuminated particle in a [[fluid]] medium.&lt;ref&gt;Shahram Tehranian et al. 2001. Photophoresis of micrometer-sized particles in the free-molecular regime. International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 44, 1649.&lt;/ref&gt; Separately from photophoresis, in a fluid mixture of different kinds of particles, the migration of some kinds of particles may be due to differences in their absorptions of thermal radiation and other thermal effects collectively known as [[thermophoresis]]. In laser photophoresis, particles migrate once they have a refractive index different from their surrounding  medium. The migration of particles is usually possible when the laser is slightly or not focused. A particle with a higher refractive index compared to its surrounding  molecule moves away from the light source due to momentum transfer from absorbed and scattered light photons. This is referred to as a [[radiation pressure]] force. This force depends on light intensity and particle size but has nothing to do with the surrounding medium. Just like in [[Crookes radiometer]], light can heat up one side and gas molecules bounce from that surface with greater velocity, hence push the particle to the other side. Under certain conditions, with particles of diameter comparable to the wavelength of light, the phenomenon of a negative indirect photophoresis occurs, due to the unequal heat generation on the laser irradiation between the back and front sides of particles, this produces a temperature gradient in the medium around the particle such that molecules at the far side of the particle from the light source may get to heat up more, causing the particle to move towards the light source.&lt;ref&gt;Hitoshi WATARAI et al. 2004.Migration Analysis of Micro-Particles in Liquids Using Microscopically Designed External Fields. Analytical Sciences, Vol 20, p 423.re&lt;/ref&gt;

If the suspended particle is rotating, it will also experience the [[Yarkovsky effect]].

Discovery of photophoresis is usually attributed to [[Felix Ehrenhaft]] in the 1920s, though earlier observations were made by others including [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]].

==Applications of photophoresis==

The applications of photophoresis expand into the various divisions of science, thus physics, chemistry as well as in biology. Photophoresis is applied in particle trapping  and levitation,&lt;ref&gt;M. Rosenberg, D.A. Mendis, D.P. Sheehan.1999. Positively charged dust crystals induced by radiative heating, IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci.27, 239-242&lt;/ref&gt; in the field flow fractionation of particles,&lt;ref&gt;V.L. Kononenko, J.K. Shimkus, J.C. Giddings, M.N. Myers. (1997). Feasibility studies on photophoretic effect in field flow fractionation of particles, J. Liquid Chromatogr.  Related Technol. 20, 2907-2929&lt;/ref&gt; in the determination of thermal conductivity and temperature of microscopic grains&lt;ref&gt;X.F. Zhang, E. Bar-Ziv. (1997). A novel approach to determine thermal conductivity of micrometre-sized fuel particles, Combust. Sci.Technol.130, 79-95.&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the  transport of soot  particles in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;H. Rohatschek. (1997). Levitation of stratospheric and mesospheric aerosols by gravito-photophoresis, J. Aerosol Sci. 27,467-475.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of light in the separation of particles [[aerosols]] based on their optical properties, makes possible the separation of  organic and inorganic particles of the same [[aerodynamic size]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Helmbrecht, C. Kykal, C. Haisch. Photophoretic Particle Separation in `Institute of Hydrochemistry, Annual report, 2006. p11&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, photophoresis has been suggested as a chiral sorting mechanism for single walled carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;D. Smith. (2014). Photophoretic separation of single-walled carbon nanotubes: a novel approach to selective chiral sorting, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2014,16, 5221-5228.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed method would utilise differences in the absorption spectra of semiconducting carbon nanotubes arising from optically excited transitions in electronic structure. If developed the technique would be orders of magnitudes faster than currently established ultracentrifugation techniques.

==Theory of photophoresis==

Direct photophoresis is caused by the transfer of photon momentum to a particle by refraction and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Ashkin, A. 2000 [[IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics]], 6,841-856.&lt;/ref&gt; Movement of particles in the forward direction occurs when the particle is transparent and has an [[index of refraction]] larger compared to its surrounding medium.&lt;ref&gt;C. Helmbrecht, C. Kykal, C. Haisch. Photophoretic Particle Separation in `Institute of Hydrochemistry, Annual report, 2006. p11.&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect photophoresis occurs as a result of an increase in the kinetic energy of molecules when particles absorb incident light only on the irradiated side, thus creating a temperature gradient within the particle. In this situation the surrounding gas layer reaches temperature equilibrium with the surface of the particle. Molecules with higher kinetic energy in the region of higher gas temperature impinge on the particle with greater momenta than molecules in the cold region; this causes a migration of particles in a direction opposite to the surface temperature gradient. The component of the photophoretic force responsible for this phenomenon is called the radiometric force.&lt;ref&gt;YU. I. Yalamov, V. B. Kutukov, and E. R. Shchukin, "Theory of the Photophoretic Motion of the Large-Size Volatile Aerosol Particle," Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, vol. 57, pp. 564-571, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; This comes as a result of uneven distribution of radiant energy (source function within a particle).
Indirect photophoretic force depends on the physical properties of the particle and the surrounding medium.

For pressures &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, where the free mean path of the gas is much larger than the characteristic size &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; of the suspended particle (direct photophoresis), the longitudinal force is &lt;ref&gt;Loesche, C. and Husmann, T. (2016). Photophoresis on particles hotter/colder than the ambient gas for the entire range of pressures, Journal of Aerosol Science, 102:55, 10.1016/j.jaerosci.2016.08.013&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\text{phot} = -\frac{\pi}{3} \, \alpha \, \alpha_\text{m} \frac{p}{\sqrt{\overline{T_{\text{gas}}^\text{out}}\,T_{\text{gas}}^\text{in}}} \, r_0^2 \, 	\frac{I\,J_1}{\frac{k}{r_0}+4\sigma_\text{SB}\varepsilon\,T_{\text{black body}}^3} \, \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;
where the mean temperature of the scattered gas is (thermal accommodation coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, momentum accommodation coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\text{m}&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{T_{\text{gas}}^{\text{out}}} = T_{\text{gas}}^\text{in}+\alpha\left(T_{\text{black body}}-T_{\text{gas}}^\text{in}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and the black body temperature of the particle (net light flux &lt;math&gt;I=\varepsilon\,I_0&lt;/math&gt;, Stefan Boltzmann constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\text{SB}}&lt;/math&gt;, temperature of the radiation field &lt;math&gt;T_{\text{opt}}&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\text{black body}} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{I_0}{4\sigma_{\text{SB}}}+T_{\text{opt}}^4}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal conductivity of the particle.
The asymmetry factor for spheres &lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt; is usually &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; (positive longitudinal photophoresis).
For non-spherical particles, the average force exerted on the particle is given by the same equation where the radius &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; is now the radius of the respective volume-equivalent sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Loesche, C., Wurm, G., Teiser, J., Friedrich, J. M., and Bischoff,
A. (2013). Photophoretic Strength on Chondrules. 1. Modeling. Astrophysical Journal, 778(2):101, 10.1088/0004-637X/778/2/101&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4297">'''Poetic naturalism''' is a philosophical approach to [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]] which encourages a variety of ways to talk about the world, using language dependent upon the aspect of reality being discussed. The term was coined by [[Sean M. Carroll]] in his book ''The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself'' to offer richer insight into naturalism, with strategies for agreeing on useful ways of talking about the [[Physical law|natural]] world. It acknowledges that the methods and terms used within one domain may not be coherent with those of another domain, yet both can be considered valid representations of reality.&lt;ref name="TheBigPicture"&gt;

==Overview==
Poetic naturalism resolves many of the conflicts caused by the fundamental differences between the various branches of science and philosophy. For example, the universe can be described mechanically in terms of atoms obeying certain [[Laws of science|laws]]. This results in a [[Determinism|deterministic]] universe incompatible with the concepts of [[choice]] or [[free will]]. Determinism is not a useful perspective for navigating the [[human condition]], which includes [[value judgment]]s and the concept of [[Causality|cause and effect]], as it essentially posits an endless chain of unavoidable "effects" stemming from a single primordial "cause". In spite of determinism, humans can be said to make decisions and control aspects of their environment. This apparent conflict does not negate either viewpoint; they can both be said to be legitimate depending on the frame of reference in which we are currently operating.

The tenets of poetic naturalism can be summarized in three points:
{{Quote|text=&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are many ways of talking about the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All good ways of talking must be consistent with one another and with the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our purposes in the moment determine the best way of talking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;|multiline=y|author=Sean Carroll|title=''The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself'' &lt;ref name="TheBigPicture"/&gt;{{rp|20}}}}

==Distinction from naturalism==
Sean Carroll cites a quote which speaks to the essence of poetic naturalism's distinction from naturalism:&lt;ref name="TheBigPicture" /&gt;{{rp|19}}{{Quote|text="The Universe is made of stories, not atoms"|author=[[Muriel Rukeyser]]|title=''The Speed of Darkness'' (1968)}}

While naturalism is the "idea or belief that only natural (as opposed to [[supernatural]] or [[spiritualism|spiritual]]) laws and forces operate in the world",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED| Naturalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; poetic naturalism understands that the way we find personally relevant meaning to life does not naturally emerge from a purely scientific approach. [[Science]] is a rigorous method of finding what is true or false, while poetic naturalism encourages extending the conversation to include contemplation into what is right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/godless-universe-a-physicist-searches-for-meaning-in-nature/|title=Godless Universe: A Physicist Searches for Meaning in Nature; Scientific American |publisher=Scientific American |author=Clara Moskowitz|date=2016-05-10|accessdate=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It integrates scientific reasoning methods into our personal purpose-seeking and meaning-making, with an emphasis on [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] techniques.&lt;ref name="TheBigPicture" /&gt;{{rp|75}}

{{Paranormal}}
The '''''preternatural''''' or '''''praeternatural''''' is that which appears outside or beside (Latin ''[[:Wikt:preter-|præter]]'') the [[nature|natural]]. It is "suspended between the mundane and the miraculous".&lt;ref&gt;Allchin, Douglas, "Monsters &amp; Marvels: How Do We Interpret the "Preternatural"?", ''The American Biology Teacher'', November 2007. p.565.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theology, the term is often used to distinguish marvels or deceptive trickery, often attributed to [[witchcraft]] or [[demon]]s, from the purely [[divinity|divine]] power of the genuinely supernatural to violate the laws of nature. In the [[early modern period]] the term was used by scientists to refer to abnormalities and strange phenomena of various kinds that seemed to depart from the norms of nature.

==Theology==
Medieval theologians made a clear distinction between the natural, the preternatural and the supernatural. [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that the supernatural consists in "God’s unmediated actions"; the natural is "what happens always or most of the time"; and the preternatural is "what happens rarely, but nonetheless by the agency of created beings...Marvels belong, properly speaking, to the realm of the preternatural."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Burshatin, "Elena Alias Elewno: Genders, sexualities, and 'race' in the mirror of natural history in sixteenth-century Spain" in Sabrina Petra Ramet, ''Gender Reversals and Gender Cultures: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', Routledge, New York, 1996, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians, following Aquinas, argued that only God had the power to disregard the laws of nature that he has created, but that demons could manipulate the laws of nature by a form of trickery, to deceive the unwary into believing they had experienced real miracles. According to historian Lorraine Daston,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although demons, astral intelligences, and other spirits might manipulate natural causes with superhuman dexterity and thereby work marvels, as mere creatures they could never transcend from the preternatural to the supernatural and work genuine miracles.&lt;ref name = "Lor"&gt;Lorraine Daston, "Marvelous Facts and Miraculous Evidence in Early Modern Europe", Peter G. Platt, ''Wonders, Marvels, and Monsters in Early Modern Culture'', University of Delaware Press, Newark, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;76–105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the 16th century, the term "preternatural" was increasingly used to refer to demonic activity comparable to the use of magic by human adepts: The Devil, "being a natural Magician … may perform many acts in ways above our knowledge, though not transcending our natural power."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; According to the philosophy of the time, preternatural phenomena were not contrary to divine law, but used hidden, or [[occult]] powers that violated the ''normal'' pattern of natural phenomena.&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt;

==Science==
With the emergence of early modern science, the concept of the preternatural increasingly came to be used to refer to strange or abnormal phenomena that seemed to violate the normal working of nature, but which were not associated with magic and witchcraft. This was a development of the idea that preternatural phenomena were fake miracles. As Daston puts it, "To simplify the historical sequence somewhat: first, preternatural phenomena were demonized and thereby incidentally naturalized; then the demons were deleted, leaving only the natural causes."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; The use of the term was especially common in medicine, for example in John Brown's ''A Compleat Treatise of Preternatural Tumours'' (1678), or [[William Smellie (obstetrician)|William Smellie]]'s ''A Collection of Preternatural Cases and Observations in Midwifery'' (1754).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel J. Rogal, ''Medicine in Great Britain from the Restoration to the Nineteenth Century, 1660–1800: An Annotated Bibliography'', Greenwood Press, New York, 1992, p.203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the term was appropriated in anthropology to refer to folk beliefs about fairies, trolls and other such creatures which were not thought of as demonic, but which were perceived to affect the natural world in unpredictable ways. According to [[Thorstein Veblen]], such preternatural agents were often thought of as forces somewhere between supernatural beings and material processes. "The preternatural agency is not necessarily conceived to be a personal agent in the full sense, but it is an agency which partakes of the attributes of personality to the extent of somewhat arbitrarily influencing the outcome of any enterprise, and especially of any contest."&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, T., ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions'', Macmillan, New York, 1915, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic association between individual agents and unexplained or unfortunate circumstances remains. Many people attribute occurrences that are known to be material processes, such as "gremlins in the engine", a "ghost in the machine", or [[pathetic fallacy|attributing motives to objects]]: "the clouds are threatening". The anthropomorphism in our daily life is a combination of the above cultural stems, as well as the manifestation of our pattern-projecting minds.{{or|date=June 2015}}

==Scholarship==
In 2011, Penn State Press began publishing a learned journal entitled ''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural''. Edited by Kirsten Uszkalo and Richard Raiswell, the journal is dedicated to publishing articles, reviews and short editions of original texts that deal with conceptions and perceptions of the preternatural in any culture and in any historical period. The journal covers "magics, witchcraft, spiritualism, occultism, prophecy, monstrophy, demonology, and folklore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psupress.org/journals/jnls_Preternature.html |title=''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural'' |publisher=Penn State University Press |access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rubble''' is broken [[rock (geology)|stone]], of irregular size, shape&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Rubble |volume=23 |page=804}}&lt;/ref&gt; and texture; undressed especially as a filling-in. Rubble naturally found in the soil is known also as ''''brash'''' (compare [[cornbrash]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Rubble" def. 2., "Brash n. 2. def. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Where present, it becomes more noticeable when the land is ploughed or worked.

==Building==
[[Image:Wyggestons Chantry House, rubblework.jpg|thumb|Rubble-work on [[Newarke Houses Museum|Wyggeston's Chantry House]] in [[Leicester]], built c. 1511]]

"[[Rubble-work]]" is a name applied to several types of [[masonry]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; One kind, where the stones are loosely thrown together in a wall between boards and [[grout]]ed with [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] almost like [[concrete]], is called in [[Italian language|Italian]] "muraglia di getto" and in [[French language|French]] "bocage".&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; In Pakistan, walls made of rubble and concrete, cast in a formwork, are called 'situ', which probably derives from Sanskrit (similar to the Latin 'in situ' meaning 'made on the spot').

Work executed with more or less large stones put together without any attempt at [[Course (architecture)|courses]] is called rubble&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; walling. Where similar work is laid in courses, it is known as coursed rubble. [[Dry-stone wall]]ing is somewhat similar work done without the use of mortar. It is bound together by the fit of the stones and the regular placement of stones which extend through the thickness of the wall. A rubble wall built with mortar will be stronger if assembled in this way.

===Rubble walls in Malta===
[[File:Ta' Dmejrek-IMG 1500.jpg|thumb|Rubble wall near [[Dingli]], [[Malta]]]]

Rubble walls ({{lang-mt|ħitan tas-sejjieħ}}) are found all over the island of [[Malta]]. Similar walls are also frequently found in Sicily and the Arab countries. The various shapes and sizes of the stones used to build these walls look like stones that were found in the area lying on the ground or in the soil.  It is most probable that the practice of building these walls around the field was inspired by the Arabs during their rule in Malta, as in Sicily who were also ruled by the Arabs around the same period. The Maltese farmer found that the technique of these walls was very useful especially during an era where resources were limited. Rubble walls are used to serve as borders between the property of one farm from the other. A great advantage that  rubble walls offered is that when heavy rain falls, their structure would allow excessive water to pass through and therefore, excess water will not ruin the products. Soil erosion is minimised as the wall structure allows the water to pass through but it traps the soil and prevents it from being carried away from the field. One can see many rubble walls on the side of the hills and in valleys where the land slopes down and consequently the soil is in greater danger of being carried away.

[[Image:Schist detail.jpg|thumb|Schist specimen showing the characteristic "scaly" schistose texture, caused by platy micas]]

'''Schist''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɪ|s|t}} {{respell|SHIST|'}}) is a medium-[[Metamorphism#Metamorphic_grades|grade]] [[metamorphic rock]].&lt;ref name="GeologyDictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/geology/glossarys.html#schist |title=Schist definition |work=Dictionary of Geology |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schist has medium to large, flat, sheet-like grains in a preferred orientation (nearby grains are roughly parallel). It is defined by having more than 50% [[Crystal habit#List of crystal habits|platy]] and elongated minerals (such as micas or talc),&lt;ref name="Glossary"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfnSesBc-RgC&amp;pg=PA577&amp;dq=schist+definition+50%25+platy+-study&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xD75UrviN4O0hAfg8YCgBw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=schist%20definition%2050%25%20platy%20-study&amp;f=false | title=Glossary of Geology | publisher=Springer | author=Jackson J.A., Mehl J.P. &amp; Neuendorf K.K.E. | year=2005 | page=577 | isbn=9780922152766}}&lt;/ref&gt; often finely interleaved with quartz and [[feldspar]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge Guide"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnianWtB5WgC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=schist+quartz+feldspar+interleaved&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LUT5UuqcJc-ThQeUxYGgCQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=schist%20quartz%20feldspar%20interleaved&amp;f=false | title=Cambridge Guide to Minerals, Rocks and Fossils | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | author=Bishop A.C., Woolley A.R. &amp; Hamilton W.R. | year=1999 | page=153 | isbn=9780521778817}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lamellar (flat, planar) [[mineral]]s include [[mica]]s, [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[talc]], [[hornblende]], [[graphite]], and others. [[Quartz]] often occurs in drawn-out grains to such an extent that a particular form called quartz schist is produced. Schist is often [[garnet]]iferous. Schist forms at a higher temperature and has larger grains than [[phyllite]].&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; Geological [[Foliation (geology)|foliation]] (metamorphic arrangement in layers) with medium to large grained flakes in a preferred sheetlike orientation is called ''schistosity''.&lt;ref name=EG&gt;Essentials of Geology, 3rd Ed, Stephen Marshak&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of various schists are derived from their mineral constituents. For example, schists primarily composed of [[biotite]] and [[muscovite]] are called mica schists.&lt;ref name="GeologyDictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/693684089|title=Earth science|last=J.|first=Tarbuck, Edward|date=2012|publisher=Prentice Hall/Pearson|others=Lutgens, Frederick K.|isbn=0321688503|edition=13th|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|oclc=693684089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most schists are mica schists, but graphite and chlorite schists are also common. Schists are also named for their prominent or perhaps unusual mineral constituents, as in the case of [[garnet]] schist, [[tourmaline]] schist, and [[glaucophane]] schist.

The individual [[mineral]] grains in schist, drawn out into flaky scales by heat and pressure, can be seen with the naked eye. Schist is characteristically ''foliated'', meaning that the individual mineral grains split off easily into flakes or slabs. The word schist is derived ultimately from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''σχίζειν'' (''schízein'') meaning "to split",&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/schist | title=Schist | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | work=English Dictionary | accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a reference to the ease with which schists can be split along the plane in which the platy minerals lie.

Most schists are derived from [[clay]]s and [[mud]]s that have passed through a series of metamorphic processes involving the production of [[shale]]s, [[slate]]s and [[phyllite]]s as intermediate steps. Certain schists are derived from fine-grained [[igneous rock]]s such as [[basalt]]s and [[tuff]]s.

==Historical mining terminology==
Before the mid-18th century, the terms slate, shale and schist  were not sharply differentiated by those involved with mining.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Raymond, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FpqFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA78 A Glossary of Mining and Metallurigical Terms], American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1881, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of underground [[coal mining]], shale was frequently referred to as [[slate]] well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Albert H. Fay, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y6hCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA622 A Glossary of the Mining and Mineral Industry], United States Bureau of Mines, 1920, p. 622.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
During metamorphism, rocks which were originally sedimentary, igneous or metamorphic are converted into schists and [[gneiss]]es. If the composition of the rocks was originally similar, they may be very difficult to distinguish from one another if the metamorphism has been great. A [[quartz-porphyry]], for example, and a fine grained feldspathic sandstone, may both be converted into a grey or pink mica-schist.  Usually, however, it is possible to distinguish between sedimentary and igneous schists and gneisses. If, for example, the whole district occupied by these rocks has traces of bedding, [[clastic]] structure, or [[Unconformity|unconformability]], then it may be a sign that the original rock was sedimentary. In other cases [[Intrusive rock|intrusive]] junctions, chilled edges, contact alteration or porphyritic structure may prove that in its original condition a metamorphic gneiss was an igneous rock. The last appeal is often to the chemistry, for there are certain rock types which occur only as sediments, while others are found only among igneous masses, and however advanced the metamorphism may be, it rarely modifies the chemical composition of the mass very greatly. Such rocks as [[limestone]]s, [[Dolostone|dolomite]]s, [[quartzite]]s and aluminous shales have very definite chemical characteristics which distinguish them even when completely recrystallized.

The schists are classified principally according to the minerals they consist of and on their chemical composition. For example, many metamorphic limestones, marbles, and calc-schists, with crystalline dolomites, contain silicate minerals such as mica, [[tremolite]], [[diopside]], [[scapolite]], quartz and [[feldspar]]. They are derived from calcareous sediments of different degrees of purity. Another group is rich in quartz (quartzites, quartz schists and quartzose gneisses), with variable amounts of white and black mica, [[garnet]], feldspar, [[zoisite]] and [[hornblende]]. These were once sandstones and arenaceous rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th Edition, [http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/s/schists.html], retrieved December 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The graphitic schists may readily be believed to represent sediments once containing coal or plant remains; there are also schistose [[ironstone]]s ([[hematite]]-schists), but metamorphic beds of salt or [[gypsum]] are exceedingly uncommon. Among schists of igneous origin there are the silky calc-schists, the foliated [[Serpentine group|serpentine]]s (once [[ultramafic]] masses rich in [[olivine]]), and the white mica-schists, porphyroids and banded [[halleflinta]]s, which have been derived from [[rhyolite]]s, quartz-porphyries and felsic [[tuff]]s. The majority of mica-schists, however, are altered [[claystone]]s and shales, and pass into the normal sedimentary rocks through various types of [[phyllite]] and mica-slates.  They are among the most common metamorphic rocks; some of them are [[Graphite|graphitic]] and others calcareous. The diversity in appearance and composition is very great, but they form a well-defined group not difficult to recognize, from the abundance of black and white micas and their thin, foliated, schistose character. A subgroup is the [[andalusite]]-, [[staurolite]]-, [[kyanite]]- and [[sillimanite]]-schists which usually make their appearance in the vicinity of gneissose granites, and have presumably been affected by contact metamorphism.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering considerations==
In [[geotechnical engineering]] a schistosity plane often forms a [[Discontinuity (Geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]] that may have a large influence on the mechanical behavior (strength, deformation, etc.) of rock masses in, for example, [[tunnel]], [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]], or [[Slope stability analysis|slope]] construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6608">The '''shower-curtain effect''' in [[physics]] describes the phenomenon of how a [[shower curtain]] gets blown inward with a running shower. The problem of identifying the cause of this effect has been featured in [[Scientific American]] magazine, with several theories given to explain the phenomenon but no definite conclusion.

The shower-curtain effect may also be used to describe the observation how nearby phase front distortions of an optical wave are more severe than remote distortions of the same amplitude.

==Hypotheses ==

===Buoyancy hypothesis ===
Also called Chimney effect or [[Stack effect]], observes that warm air (from the hot shower) rises out over the shower curtain as cooler air (near the floor) pushes in under the curtain to replace the rising air.  By pushing the curtain in towards the shower, the (short range) vortex and [[Coandă effect]]s become more significant. However, the shower-curtain effect persists when cold water is used, implying that this cannot be the only mechanism at work.&lt;ref name=straight&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1369/why-does-the-shower-curtain-blow-in-despite-the-water-pushing-it-out-revisited|title=The Straight Dope: Why does the shower curtain blow in despite the water pushing it out (revisited)?|website=www.straightdope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See also [[Cooling tower]].

===Bernoulli effect hypothesis ===
The most popular explanation given for the shower-curtain effect is [[Bernoulli's principle]].&lt;ref name=straight/&gt;  Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in velocity results in a decrease in pressure.  This theory presumes that the water flowing out of a [[shower head]] causes the air through which the water moves to start flowing in the same direction as the water.  This movement would be parallel to the plane of the shower curtain.  If air is moving across the inside surface of the shower curtain, Bernoulli's principle says the air pressure there will drop.  This would result in a pressure differential between the inside and outside, causing the curtain to move inward.  It would be strongest when the gap between the bather and the curtain is smallest - resulting in the curtain attaching to the bather.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Horizontal vortex hypothesis ===
A computer simulation of a typical bathroom found that none of the above theories pan out in their analysis, but instead found that the spray from the shower-head drives a horizontal [[vortex]]. This vortex has a low-pressure zone in the centre, which sucks the curtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://zidbits.com/2010/11/the-shower-curtain-effect/|title=What Is The Shower Curtain Effect?| date=2010-11-17| accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=straight/&gt;

David Schmidt of University of Massachusetts was awarded the 2001 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in Physics for his partial solution to the question of why shower curtains billow inwards. He used a [[computational fluid dynamics]] code to achieve the results.  Professor Schmidt is adamant that this was done "for fun" in his own free time without the use of grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2001/10/47334|title=Shower Curtain Rises on Ig Nobels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Coandă effect===
The [[Coandă effect]], also known as "boundary layer attachment", is the tendency of a moving fluid to adhere to an adjacent wall.&lt;ref name=straight/&gt;

===Condensation===
A hot shower will produce steam that condenses on the shower side of the curtain; lowering the pressure there.  In a steady state the steam will be replaced by new steam delivered by the shower but in reality the water temperature will fluctuate and lead to times when the net steam production is negative.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Air pressure===
Colder dense air outside and hot less dense air inside causes higher air pressure on the outside to force the shower curtain inwards to equalise the air pressure, this can be observed simply when the bathroom door is open allowing cold air into the bathroom.

==Solutions==
Many shower curtains come with features to reduce the shower-curtain effect. They may have adhesive suction cups on the bottom edges of the curtain, which are then pushed onto the sides of the shower when in use. Others may have magnets at the bottom, though these are not effective on acrylic or fiberglass tubs.

It's possible to use a telescopic shower curtain rod to block the curtain on it's lower part and to prevent it from sucking inside.

Hanging the curtain rod higher or lower, or especially further away from the shower head, can reduce the effect. A (convex) curved shower rod can also be used to hold the curtain against the inside wall of a tub.

A weight can be attached to a long string and the string attached to the curtain rod in the middle of the curtain (on the inside). Hanging the weight low against the curtain just above the rim of the shower pan or tub makes it an effective billowing deterrent without allowing the weight to hit the pan or tub and damage it.

There are a few alternative solutions that either attach to the shower curtain directly, attach to the shower rod or attach to the wall.

'''Singing sand''', also called '''whistling sand''' or '''barking sand''', is [[sand]] that produces sound. The sound emission may be caused by wind passing over [[dune]]s or by walking on the sand.

Certain conditions have to come together to create singing sand:
# The sand grains have to be round and between 0.1 and 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm in [[diameter]].
# The sand has to contain [[silica]].
# The sand needs to be at a certain [[humidity]].

The most common frequency emitted seems to be close to 450 [[hertz|Hz]].

There are various theories about the singing sand mechanism. It has been proposed that the sound frequency is controlled by the shear rate. Others have suggested that the frequency of vibration is related to the thickness of the dry surface layer of sand. The sound waves bounce back and forth between the surface of the dune and the surface of the moist layer, creating a resonance that increases the sound's volume.  The noise may be generated by friction between the grains or by the compression of air between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hTPOi8urYKwC&amp;pg=PA534 |title=Shifting theories of singing sand |journal=New Scientist |date=31 May 1973|last1=Information |first1=Reed Business }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sounds that can be emitted by sand have been described as "roaring" or "booming".

==In dunes==
Singing sand dunes, an example of the phenomenon of singing sand, produce a sound described as roaring, booming, squeaking, or the "Song of Dunes". This is a natural sound phenomenon of up to 105 [[decibel]]s, lasting as long as several minutes, that occurs in about 35 [[desert]] locations around the world. The sound is similar to a loud low-pitch rumble.  It emanates from crescent-shaped dunes, or [[barchan]]s. The sound emission accompanies a slumping or avalanching movement of sand, usually triggered by wind passing over the [[dune]] or by someone walking near the crest.

Examples of singing sand dunes include California's [[Kelso Dunes]] and [[Eureka Valley Sand Dunes|Eureka Dunes]]; AuTrain Beach in Northern Michigan; [[sugar sand]] beaches and [[Warren Dunes]] in southwestern [[Michigan]]; [[Sand Mountain (Nevada)|Sand Mountain]] in [[Nevada]]; the Booming Dunes in the [[Namib Desert]], [[Africa]]; Porth Oer (also known as Whistling Sands) near [[Aberdaron]] in [[Wales]]; [[Indiana Dunes]] in [[Indiana]]; [[Barking Sands]] in [[Hawaiʻi]]; Mingsha Shan in [[Dunhuang]], China; Kotogahama Beach in [[Ōda, Shimane|Odashi]], Japan; Singing Beach in [[Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts]]; near [[Mesaieed]] in [[Qatar]]; and Gebel Naqous, near [[el-Tor]], South Sinai, Egypt.

The phenomena also inspired a song called "The Singing Sands of Alamosa" in [[Bing Crosby]]'s album [[Drifting_and_Dreaming_(album)|Drifting and Dreaming]](1947).&lt;ref name="NPS20180625"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Singing Sands of Great Sand Dunes |url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/grsa-singing-sands.htm |website=National Park Service |publisher=Great Sand Dunes National Park &amp; Preserve |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Singing Sands of Alamosa by Bing Crosby |url=https://archive.org/details/78_the-singing-sands-of-alamosa_bing-crosby-dick-mcintire-and-his-harmony-hawaiians-be_gbia0048648a |website=Archive.org |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On some beaches around the world, dry sand will make a singing, squeaking, whistling, or screaming sound if a person scuffs or shuffles their feet with sufficient force.&lt;ref name="about.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Knox Beckius|first=Kim|title=Squeak Your Feet on the Singing Beach|url=http://gonewengland.about.com/od/nbostonsights/ss/aamanorthshore_6.htm|website=The 10 Most Memorable Things To Do on the Massachusetts North Shore|publisher=about.com: New England Travel|accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H2RNCB"&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Read a North Carolina Beach: Bubble Holes, Barking Sands, and Rippled Runnels|author1=Pilkey|first=Orrin H.|author2=Rice|first2=Tracy Monegan|author3=Neal|first3=William J.|date=29 March 2004|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0807855102|location=|pages=101|language=English|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is not completely understood scientifically, but it has been found that quartz sand will do this if the grains are very well-rounded and highly spherical.&lt;ref name="CanadaCool"&gt;{{cite web|last=Izon|first=Lucy|title=The Sands 'Sing' on Prince Edward Island|url=http://www.canadacool.com/COOLFACTS/PEI/SingingSands.html|publisher=CANADA COOL|accessdate=18 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006142637/http://canadacool.com/COOLFACTS/PEI/SingingSands.html|archivedate=6 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by some that the sand grains must be of similar size, so the sand must be well sorted by the actions of wind and waves, and that the grains should be close to spherical and have dust-, pollution-, and organic-matter-free surfaces. The "singing" sound is then believed to be produced by [[Shear stress|shear]], as each layer of sand grains slides over the layer beneath it. The similarity in size, the uniformity, and the cleanness means that grains move up and down in unison over the layer of grains below them. Even small amounts of pollution on the sand grains reduce the friction enough to silence the sand.&lt;ref name="H2RNCB"/&gt;

Others believe that the sound is produced by the friction of grain against grain that have been coated with dried salt, in a way that is analogous to the way that the rosin on the [[Bow (music)|bow]] produces sounds from a violin string.  It has also been speculated that thin layers of gas trapped and released between the grains act as "percussive cushions" capable of vibration, and so produce the tones heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lencek|first=Lena|title=No Man and the Sea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/l/lencek-beach.html|website=The Beach: The History of Paradise on Earth|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=18 September 2010|author2=Gideon Bosker |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all sands sing, whistle or bark alike. The sounds heard have a wide frequency range that can be different for each patch of sand. Fine sands, where individual grains are barely visible to the naked eye, produce only a poor, weak sounding bark. Medium-sized grains can emit a range of sounds, from a faint squeak or a high-pitched sound, to the best and loudest barks when scuffed enthusiastically.&lt;ref name="H2RNCB"/&gt;

Water also influences the effect. Wet sands are usually silent because the grains stick together instead of sliding past each other, but small amounts of water can actually raise the pitch of the sounds produced. The most common part of the beach on which to hear singing sand is the dry upper beach above the normal high tide line, but singing has been reported on the lower beach near the low tide line as well.&lt;ref name="H2RNCB"/&gt;

Singing sand has been reported on 33 beaches in the British Isles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Whistling sand beaches in the British Isles |author=Ridgway, K. |author2=Scotton, J.

[[File:Slate Macro 1.JPG|thumb|A piece of slate (~&amp;nbsp;6 cm long and ~&amp;nbsp;4 cm high)]]
'''Slate''' is a fine-grained, [[foliation (geology)|foliated]],  homogeneous [[metamorphic rock]] derived from an original [[shale]]-type [[sedimentary rock]] composed of [[clay]] or [[volcano|volcanic]] [[ash (volcanic)|ash]] through low-grade regional [[metamorphism]]. It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock.&lt;ref name=EG&gt;Essentials of Geology, 3rd Ed, Stephen Marshak&lt;/ref&gt; Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering, but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression.&lt;ref name=EG/&gt;

The foliation in slate is called "[[slaty cleavage]]".&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression.&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; When expertly "cut" by striking parallel to the foliation, with a specialized tool in the quarry, many slates will display a property called [[fissility (geology)|fissility]], forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for [[roof]]ing, floor tiles, and other purposes.&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; Slate is frequently grey in color, especially when seen, en masse, covering roofs. However, slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality; for example, slate from [[North Wales]] can be found in many shades of grey, from pale to dark, and may also be purple, green or [[cyan]]. Slate is not to be confused with [[shale]], from which it may be formed, or [[schist]].

The word "slate" is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock. It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate, or a [[Slate (writing)|writing slate]]. These were  traditionally a small, smooth piece of the rock, often framed in wood, used with chalk as a notepad or noticeboard, and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns. The phrases "clean slate" and "[[tabula rasa|blank slate]]" come from this usage.

==Historical mining terminology==
Before the mid-19th century, the terms ''slate'', ''shale'' and ''schist'' were not sharply distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Raymond, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FpqFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA78 A Glossary of Mining and Metallurgical Terms], American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1881; page 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of underground [[coal mining]] in the United States, the term slate was commonly used to refer to shale well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Albert H. Fay, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y6hCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA622 A Glossary of the Mining and Mineral Industry], United States Bureau of Mines, 1920; page 622.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, ''roof slate'' referred to shale above a coal seam, and ''draw slate'' referred to shale that fell from the mine roof as the coal was removed.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marvin Weller, ed.,[https://books.google.com/books?id=6UIrAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;pg=RA1-PA18 Supplement to the Glossary of Geology and Related Sciences], American Geological Institute, 1960; page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mineral composition==
Slate is mainly composed of the minerals [[quartz]] and [[muscovite]] or [[illite]], often along with [[biotite]], [[chlorite group|chlorite]], [[hematite]], and [[pyrite]] and, less frequently [[apatite]], [[graphite]], [[kaolinite]], [[magnetite]], [[tourmaline]], or [[zircon]] as well as [[feldspar]]. Occasionally, as in the purple slates of [[Slate industry in Wales|North Wales]], ferrous reduction spheres form around iron nuclei, leaving a light green spotted texture. These spheres are sometimes deformed by a subsequent applied stress field to ovoids, which appear as ellipses when viewed on a [[Cleavage (geology)|cleavage plane]] of the specimen.

Slate  can be made into roofing slates, a type of [[roof shingle]], or more specifically a type of [[roof tile]], which are installed by a [[slater]]. Slate has two lines of breakability – cleavage and grain – which make it possible to split the stone into thin sheets. When broken, slate retains a natural appearance while remaining relatively flat and easy to stack. A "slate boom" occurred in Europe from the 1870s until the first world war, allowed by the use of the steam engine in manufacturing slate tiles and improvements in road and waterway transportation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Schunck, Eberhard, and Hans Jochen Oster. ''Roof Construction Manual Pitched Roofs''.. Basel: De Gruyter, 2003. 12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slate is particularly suitable as a roofing material as it has an extremely low water absorption index of less than 0.4%, making the material waterproof. In fact, this natural slate, which requires only minimal processing, has the lowest [[embodied energy]] of all roofing materials.
Natural slate is used by building professionals as a result of its beauty and durability. Slate is incredibly durable and can last several hundred years, often with little or no maintenance. Its low water absorption makes it very resistant to frost damage and breakage due to freezing. Natural slate is also fire resistant and energy efficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insightmag.co.uk/newsarticle.asp?NewsID=286 Natural Slate, the natural option] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310123813/http://www.insightmag.co.uk/newsarticle.asp?NewsID=286 |date=10 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SlateTremedda.jpg|thumb|left|Slates with holes for fixing, viewed from below. Photographed in [[Tremedda]], [[Cornwall]], a farm in England]]

Slate roof tiles are usually fixed (fastened) either with nails, or with hooks as is common with Spanish slate. In the UK, fixing is typically with double nails onto timber battens (England and Wales) or nailed directly onto timber sarking boards (Scotland and Northern Ireland). Nails were traditionally of copper, although there are modern alloy and stainless steel alternatives. Both these methods, if used properly, provide a long-lasting weathertight roof with a lifespan of around 80–100 years. Slate roofs are still used today.

Some mainland European slate suppliers suggest that using hook fixing means that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spanishslateuk.com/hook_fixing.asp Galician and Spanish Slate website "Hook Fixing"]. Retrieved on 26 January 2010 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716113747/http://www.spanishslateuk.com/hook_fixing.asp archived]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Areas of weakness on the tile are fewer since no holes have to be drilled
* Roofing features such as valleys and domes are easier to create since narrow tiles can be used
* Hook fixing is particularly suitable in regions subject to severe weather conditions, since there is greater resistance to wind uplift, as the lower edge of the slate is secured.

The metal hooks are, however, visible and may be unsuitable for historic properties.

Slate tiles are often used for interior and exterior flooring, stairs, walkways and wall cladding. Tiles are installed and set on mortar and grouted along the edges. Chemical sealants are often used on tiles to improve durability and appearance, increase stain resistance, reduce [[efflorescence]], and increase or reduce surface smoothness. Tiles are often sold gauged, meaning that the back surface is ground for ease of installation. Slate flooring can be slippery when used in external locations subject to rain. Slate tiles were used in 19th century UK building construction (apart from roofs) and in slate quarrying areas such as [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]] and [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]], [[Wales]] there are still many buildings wholly constructed of slate. Slates can also be set into walls to provide a rudimentary [[damp-proof membrane]]. Small offcuts are used as [[shim (engineering)|shims]] to level floor joists. In areas where slate is plentiful it is also used in pieces of various sizes for building walls and hedges, sometimes combined with other kinds of stone. In modern homes slate is often used as table coasters.

Because it is a good [[electrical insulator]] and [[fireproof]], it was used to construct early-20th-century [[electric switchboard]]s and [[relay]] controls for large [[electric motor]]s. Fine slate can also be used as a [[whetstone (tool)|whetstone]] to hone knives.

Due to its thermal stability and chemical inertness, slate has been used for laboratory bench tops and for [[billiard table]] tops. In 18th- and 19th-century schools, slate was extensively used for [[Chalkboard|blackboards]] and individual [[Slate (writing)|writing slates]], for which slate or chalk pencils were used.

In areas where it is available, high-quality slate is used for [[tombstones]] and commemorative tablets. In some cases slate was used by the ancient [[Maya civilization]] to fashion [[Maya stelae|stelae]].

Slate was traditional material of choice for black [[Go (game)|Go]] stones in Japan. It is now considered to be a luxury.

{{Main|Slate industry}}

===Europe===
Most slate in Europe today [[Slate Industry in Spain|comes from Spain]], the world's largest producer and exporter of natural slate, and 90 percent of Europe's natural slate used for roofing originates from the slate industry there.

Lesser slate-producing regions in Europe include [[Slate industry in Wales|Wales]] (with a [[National Slate Museum|museum at Llanberis]]), [[Cornwall]] (famously the village of [[Delabole]]), [[Cumbria]] (see [[Burlington Slate Quarries]], [[Honister Slate Mine]] and [[Skiddaw Slate]]) and, formerly in the West Highlands of Scotland, around [[Ballachulish]] and the [[Slate Islands]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Parts of [[France]] ([[Anjou]], [[Loire Valley]], [[Ardennes]], [[Brittany]], [[Savoie]]) and [[Belgium]] (Ardennes), [[Liguria]] in northern [[Italy]], especially between the town of [[Lavagna]] (which means ''chalkboard'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) and Fontanabuona valley; [[Portugal]] especially around [[Valongo]] in the north of the country.

[[Germany]]'s [[Moselle River]] region, [[Hunsrück]], [[Eifel]],  [[Westerwald]], [[Thuringia]] and north [[Bavaria]] (with a former mine open as a museum at [[Fell Exhibition Slate Mine|Fell]]); and [[Alta, Norway]] (actually [[schist]], not a true slate). Some of the slate from Wales and Cumbria is colored slate (non-blue): purple and formerly green in Wales and green in Cumbria.

===Americas===
Slate is abundant in [[Brazil]], the world's second-biggest producer of slate, around [[Papagaios]] in [[Minas Gerais]], which extracts 95 percent of Brazil's slate. However, not all "slate" products from Brazil are entitled to bear the [[CE mark]].&lt;ref&gt;Fundación Centro Tecnológico de la Pizarra. Report into the "Technical properties of Bambui Slate from the State of Minas Gerais (Brazil) to ascertain its compliance with the Standard EN12326". [http://www.spanishslateuk.com/pdf/Brazilian_slate_summary.pdf Brazilian Slate Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214213924/http://www.spanishslateuk.com/pdf/Brazilian_slate_summary.pdf |date=14 February 2010 }}, retrieved on 27 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Slate is produced on the east coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], in Eastern [[Pennsylvania]],  [[Buckingham Slate|Buckingham County, Virginia]], and the [[Slate Valley]] of [[Vermont]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], where colored slate is mined in the [[Granville (town), New York|Granville, New York]] area.  Pennsylvania slate is widely used in the manufacture of turkey calls used for hunting turkeys in the U.S.  The tones produced from the slate (when scratched with various species of wood strikers) imitates almost exactly the calls of all four species of [[wild turkey]] in North America: eastern, Rio Grande, Osceola and Merriam's.

A major slating operation existed in [[Monson, Maine]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where the slate is usually dark purple to blackish, and many local structures are still roofed with slate tiles. The roof of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]] was made of Monson slate, as is the headstone of [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granville-ny.com/facts.htm Granville: Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108054330/http://www.granville-ny.com/facts.htm |date=8 January 2011 }} accessed 23 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Slate is found in the [[Arctic]], and was used by [[Inuit]] to make the blades for [[ulu]]s.

=== Asia ===
China has vast slate deposits; in recent years its export of finished and unfinished slate has increased. It has slate in various colors.

=== Australia ===
[[File:Mintaro Slate Quarry 1880.jpeg|thumb|right|Workers mining slate at Mintaro quarry, c. 1880]]

Deposits of slate exist throughout the Australian continent, with large reserves quarried in the [[Adelaide Hills]] ([[Willunga, South Australia|Willunga]] and [[Kanmantoo, South Australia|Kanmantoo]]) and the [[Mid North]] ([[Mintaro, South Australia#Slate and Flagstone|Mintaro]] and [[Spalding, South Australia|Spalding]]).

==Fossils==
Because slate was formed in low heat and pressure, compared to a number of other [[metamorphic rock]]s, some [[fossils]] can be found in slate; sometimes even [[microscopic]] remains of delicate organisms can be found in slate.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Video: ''[[David Attenborough]]: Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives''&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a spherical Earth displaced earlier beliefs in a [[flat Earth]]: In early [[Mesopotamian mythology]], the world was portrayed as a flat disk floating in the ocean with a hemispherical sky-dome above,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy|author=Otto E.

Neugebauer|publisher=Birkhäuser|date=1975|isbn=3-540-06995-X|page=577|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this forms the premise for [[early world maps]] like those of [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]. Other speculations on the shape of Earth include a seven-layered [[ziggurat]] or [[cosmic mountain]], alluded to in the [[Avesta]] and ancient [[Persian Empire|Persian]] writings (see [[seven climes]]).

The realization that the [[figure of the Earth]] is more accurately described as an [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] dates to the 17th century, as described by [[Isaac Newton]] in ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''. In the early 19th century, the flattening of the earth ellipsoid was determined to be of the order of 1/300 ([[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]], [[George Everest|Everest]]). The modern value as determined by the [[United States Department of Defense|US DoD]] [[World Geodetic System]] since the 1960s is close to 1/298.25.&lt;ref&gt;See [[figure of the Earth]] and [[Earth radius#Mean radii|Earth radius]] for details. Recent measurements from [[satellite]]s suggest that the Earth is, in fact, slightly [[pear]]-shaped.

==Cause==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}

The Earth is massive enough that [[gravity]] maintains it as a roughly spherical shape. Its formation into a sphere was made easy by its primordial hot, liquid phase.

===Formation===

The [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|Solar System formed]] from a dust cloud that was at least partially the remnant of one or more [[supernova]]s that created heavy elements by [[nucleosynthesis]]. Grains of matter accreted through electrostatic interaction. As they grew in mass, gravity took over in gathering yet more mass, releasing the [[potential energy]] of their collisions and in-falling as [[heat]]. The [[protoplanetary disk]] also had a greater proportion of radioactive elements than the Earth today because, over time, those elements decayed. Their decay heated the early Earth even further, and continue to contribute to [[Earth's internal heat budget]]. The early Earth was thus mostly liquid.

A sphere is the only stable shape for a non-rotating, gravitationally self-attracting liquid. The outward acceleration caused by the Earth's rotation is greater at the equator than at the poles (where is it zero), so the sphere gets deformed into an [[ellipsoid]], which represents the shape having the lowest potential energy for a rotating, fluid body. This ellipsoid is slightly fatter around the equator than a perfect sphere would be. Earth's shape is also slightly lumpy because it is composed of different materials of different densities that exert slightly different amounts of gravitational force per volume.

The liquidity of a hot, newly formed planet allows heavier elements to sink down to the middle and forces lighter elements closer to the surface, a process known as [[planetary differentiation]]. This event is known as the [[iron catastrophe]]; the most abundant heavier elements were [[iron]] and [[nickel]], which now form the [[Earth's core]].

{{further|History of Earth}}

===Later shape changes and effects===

Though the surface rocks of the Earth have cooled enough to solidify, the [[outer core]] of the planet is still hot enough to remain liquid. Energy is still being released; [[volcano|volcanic]] and [[tectonic]] activity has pushed rocks into hills and mountains and blown them out of [[caldera]]s. [[Meteor]]s also create [[impact crater]]s and surrounding ridges. However, if the energy release ceases from these processes, then they tend to [[Erosion|erode]] away over time and return toward the lowest potential-energy curve of the ellipsoid. [[Weather]] powered by [[solar energy]] can also move water, rock, and soil to make the Earth slightly out of round.

Earth undulates as the shape of its lowest potential energy changes daily due to the gravity of the Sun and Moon as they move around with respect to the Earth. This is what causes [[tides]] in the [[ocean]]s' water, which can flow freely along the changing potential.

===Shapes of other bodies===
[[File:Eros, Vesta and Ceres size comparison.jpg|thumb|Composite image showing the round dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]; the slightly smaller, mostly round [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]; and the much smaller, much lumpier [[433 Eros|Eros]]]]
[[File:Comet 67P on 19 September 2014 NavCam mosaic.jpg|thumb|The amorphous nucleus of the comet [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]]]]

The [[IAU definition of planet|IAU definitions of planet]] and [[dwarf planet]] require that a Sun-orbiting body has undergone the rounding process to reach a roughly spherical shape, an achievement known as [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. The same spheroidal shape can be seen from smaller rocky planets like [[Mars]] to [[gas giant]]s like [[Jupiter]].

Any natural Sun-orbiting body that has not reached hydrostatic equilibrium is classified by the IAU as a [[small Solar System body]] (SSB). These come in many non-spherical shapes which are lumpy masses accreted haphazardly by in-falling dust and rock; not enough mass falls in to generate the heat needed to complete the rounding. Some SSSBs are just collections of relatively small rocks that are weakly held next to each other by gravity but are not actually fused into a single big [[bedrock]]. Some larger SSSBs are nearly round but have not reached hydrostatic equilibrium. The small Solar System body [[4 Vesta]] is large enough to have undergone at least partial planetary differentiation.

Stars like the Sun are also spheroidal due to gravity's effects on their [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], which is a free-flowing [[fluid]]. Ongoing [[stellar fusion]] is a much greater source of heat for stars compared to the initial heat released during formation.

==Effects and empirical confirmation==

The roughly spherical shape of the Earth can be confirmed by many different types of observation from ground level, aircraft, and spacecraft.  The shape causes a number of phenomena that a flat Earth would not.  Some of these phenomena and observations would be possible on other shapes, such as a curved [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] or [[torus]], but no other shape would explain all of them.

===Spacecraft===

Many pictures have been taken of the entire Earth by satellites launched by a variety of governments and private organizations. From high orbits, where half the planet can be seen at once, it is plainly spherical.  The only way to piece together all the pictures taken of the ground from lower orbits so that all the surface features line up seamlessly and without distortion is to put them on an approximately spherical surface.

Astronauts in [[low Earth orbit]] can personally see the curvature of the planet, and travel all the way around several times a day.

The astronauts who travelled to the Moon have seen the entire Moon-facing half at once, and can watch the sphere rotate once a day (approximately; the Moon is also moving with respect to the Earth).

===Aircraft===

People in high-flying aircraft or skydiving from high-altitude balloons can plainly see the curvature of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OnJCqtTxsA James May Witnesses Curvature of Earth] (at {{convert|70000|ft}})&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial aircraft do not necessarily fly high enough to make this obvious.  Trying to measure the curvature of the horizon by taking a picture is complicated by the fact that camera lenses can produce distorted images depending on the angle used.  An extreme version of this effect can be seen in the [[fisheye lens]].  Scientific measurements would require a carefully calibrated lens.

The fastest way for an airplane to travel between two distant cities is a [[great circle]] route, which deviates significantly from what would be the fastest straight-line travel path on a flat Earth.

Photos of the ground taken from airplanes over a large enough area also do not fit seamlessly together on a flat surface, but do fit on a roughly spherical surface. Aerial photographs of large areas must be corrected to account for curvature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asprs.org/wp-content/uploads/pers/1958journal/dec/1958_dec_751-756.pdf The Effects of Earth's Curvature and Refraction on the Mensuration of Vertical Photographs]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visibility of distant objects===

{{main|Horizon#Distance to the horizon}}

On a completely flat Earth with no visual interference (such as trees, hills, or atmospheric haze) the ground itself would never obscure distant objects; one would be able to see all the way to the edge of the surface.  A spherical surface has a [[horizon]] which is closer when viewed from a lower altitude.&lt;ref name="smarter"&gt;[https://www.popsci.com/10-ways-you-can-prove-earth-is-round 10 easy ways you can tell for yourself that the Earth is not flat]&lt;/ref&gt;  In theory, a person standing on the surface with eyes {{convert|1.8|m}} above the ground can see the ground up to about {{convert|4.79|km}} away, but a person at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] at {{convert|273|m}} can see the ground up to about {{convert|58.98|km}} away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/june32012/index.html Consequences of a living on a sphere]&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon would seem to present a method to verify that the Earth's surface is locally [[wikt:convex|convex]].  If the degree of curvature was determined to be the same everywhere on the Earth's surface, and that surface was determined to be large enough, it would show that the Earth is spherical.

In practice, this turns out to be an unreliable method of measurement, due to variations in atmospheric [[refraction]].  This additional effect can give the impression that the earth's surface is flat, curved more convexly than it is, or even that it is [[wikt:concave|concave]], by bending light travelling near the surface of the earth (as happened in various trials of the famous [[Bedford Level experiment]]).

The phenomenon of variable atmospheric bending can be empirically confirmed by noting that sometimes the refractive layers of air can cause the image of a distant object to be broken into pieces or even turned upside down.  This is commonly seen at sunset, when the sun's shape is distorted, but has also been photographed happening for ships, and has caused the city of Chicago to appear normally, upside down, and broken into pieces from across Lake Michigan (from where it is normally below the horizon).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/earth/the-perfectly-scientific-explanation-for-why-chicago-appeared-upside-down-in-michigan/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc57.com/story/28925566/mirage-of-chicago-skyline-seen-from-michigan-shoreline&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their longer wavelengths, radio waves are even more susceptible to atmospheric refraction and reflection, which can cause radio and television signals to be received from towers thousands of miles away which cannot be seen with visible light.

When the atmosphere is relatively well-mixed, the visual effects generally expected of a spherical Earth can be observed.  For example, ships travelling on large bodies of water (such as the ocean) disappear over the horizon progressively, such that the highest part of the ship can still be seen even when lower parts cannot, proportional to distance from the observer.  The same is true of the coastline or mountain when viewed from a ship or from across a large lake or flat terrain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bco_p4V7-QU A video showing the curvature of the Earth] (using island coastline)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="headsup" /&gt;

===Lunar eclipses ===

The shadow of the Earth on the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]] is always a dark circle that moves from one side of the moon to the other (partially grazing it during a partial eclipse).  This could be produced by a flat disc that always faces the Moon head-on during the eclipse, but this is inconsistent with the fact that the Moon is only rarely directly overhead during an eclipse. For each eclipse, the local surface of the Earth is pointed in a somewhat different direction.  The shadow of a circular disc held at an angle is an oval, not a circle as is seen during the eclipse.  The idea of the Earth being a flat disc is also inconsistent with the fact that a given lunar eclipse is only visible from half of the Earth at a time.

The only shape that casts a round shadow no matter which direction it is pointed is a sphere, and the ancient Greeks deduced that this must mean the Earth is spherical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollack|first1=Rebecca|title=Ancient Myths Revised with Lunar Eclipse|url=https://www.astro.umd.edu/openhouse/3about-the-obs/news/2003-11-10.html|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observation of the stars at altitude===

On a perfectly spherical Earth, flat terrain or ocean, when viewed from the surface, blocks exactly half the sky - a hemisphere of 180°. Moving away from the surface of the Earth means that the ground blocks less and less of the sky.  For example, when viewed from the Moon, the Earth blocks only a small portion of the sky, because it is so distant.  This phenomenon of geometry means that when viewed from a high mountain, flat ground or ocean blocks less than 180° of the sky. The rate of change in the angle blocked by the sky as altitude increases is different for a disc than a sphere, and values observed show that the Earth is locally convex.  (The angles blocked would also be different for a mountain close to the edge of a flat Earth compared to a mountain in the middle of a flat Earth, and this is not observed.)  In theory, measurements of this type from all around the Earth would confirm that it is a complete sphere (as opposed to some other shape with convex areas) though actually taking all those measurements would be very expensive.

Using other evidence to hypothesize a spherical shape, the medieval Iranian scholar [[Al-Biruni]] used this phenomenon to calculate the Earth's circumference to within {{convert|16.8|km}} of the correct value.&lt;ref name="headsup" /&gt;

===Observation of the fixed stars from different locations===

The [[fixed stars]] can be demonstrated to be very far away, by [[diurnal parallax]] measurements (a technique known at least as early as Ancient Greece).  Unlike the Sun, Moon, and planets, they do not change position with respect to one another (at least not perceptibly over the span of a human lifetime); the shapes of the [[constellation]]s are always the same.  This makes them a convenient reference background for determining the shape of the Earth.  Adding distance measurements on the ground allows calculation of the Earth's size.

The fact that different stars are visible from different locations on the Earth was noticed in ancient times. [[Aristotle]] wrote that some stars are visible from Egypt which are not visible from Europe.&lt;ref name="headsup"&gt;[http://headsup.boyslife.org/ten-reasons-we-know-earth-is-round/ How We Know the Earth Is Actually Round]&lt;/ref&gt; This would not be possible if the Earth was flat.&lt;ref name="smarter" /&gt;

At the [[North Pole]] it is continuously nighttime for six months of the year and the same hemisphere of stars (a 180° view) are always visible making one counterclockwise rotation every 24 hours. The star [[Polaris]] (the "North Star") is almost at the center of this rotation (which is directly overhead). Some of the [[88 modern constellations]] visible are [[Ursa Major]] (including the [[Big Dipper]]), [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], and [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]. The other six months of the year, it is continuously daytime and the light from the Sun mostly blots out the stars.  (The location of the poles can be defined by these phenomena, which only occur there; more than 24 hours of continuous daylight can occur north of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]].)

At the [[South Pole]], a completely non-overlapping set of constellations are visible during the six months of continuous nighttime, including [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Crux]], and [[Centaurus]].  This 180° hemisphere of stars rotate clockwise once every 24 hours, around a point directly overhead (where there do not happen to be any particularly bright stars).

The fact that the stars visible from the north and south poles do not overlap must mean that the two observation spots are on opposite sides of the Earth, which is not possible if the Earth is a single-sided disc, but is possible for other shapes (like a sphere, but also any other convex shape like a donut or dumbbell).

From any point on the [[equator]], 360° of stars are visible over the course of the night, as the sky rotates around a line drawn from due north to due south (which could be defined as "the directions to walk to get to the poles in the shortest amount of time").  When facing east, the stars visible from the north pole are on the left, and the stars visible from the south pole are on the right.  This means the equator must be facing at a 90° angle from the poles.

The direction any intermediate spot on the Earth is facing can also be calculated by measuring the angles of the fixed stars and determining how much of the sky is visible.  For example, [[New York City]] is about 40° north of the equator.  The apparent motion of the Sun blots out slightly different parts of the sky from day to day, but over the course of the entire year it sees a dome of 280° (360° - 80°).  So for example, both [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] and the [[Big Dipper]] are visible during at least part of the year.

Making stellar observations from a representative set of points across the Earth, combined with knowing the shortest on-the-ground distance between any two given points makes an approximate sphere the only possible shape for the Earth.

Knowing the difference in angle between two points on the Earth's surface and the surface distance between them allows a calculation of the Earth's size.  Using observations at [[Rhodes]] (in Greece) and [[Alexandria]] (in Egypt) and the distance between them, the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Posidonius#Geography, ethnology, and geology|Posidonius]] actually did use this technique to calculate the circumference of the planet to within perhaps 4% of the correct value (though modern equivalents of his units of measure are not precisely known).

===Surface circumnavigation===

Since the 1500s, many people have sailed or flown completely around the world in all directions, and none have discovered an edge or impenetrable barrier.  (See [[Circumnavigation]], [[Arctic exploration]], and [[History of Antarctica]].)

Some flat Earth theories that propose the world is a north-pole-centered disc, conceive of Antarctica as an impenetrable ice wall that encircles the planet and hides any edges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.testingtheglobe.com/quest2.html&lt;/ref&gt; This disc model explains east-west circumnavigation as simply moving around the disc in a circle.  (East-west paths form a circle in both disc and spherical geometry.)  It is possible in this model to traverse the North Pole, but it is not possible to perform a circumnavigation that includes the South Pole (which it posits does not exist).

Explorers, government researchers, commercial pilots, and tourists have been to [[Antarctica]] and found that it is not a large ring that encircles the entire world, but actually a roughly disc-shaped continent smaller than South America but larger than Australia, with an interior that can in fact be traversed in order to take a shorter path from e.g. the tip of South America to Australia than would be possible on a disc.

The first land crossing of the entirety of Antarctica was the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] in 1955-58, and many exploratory airplanes have since passed over the continent in various directions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/2300322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/2372669/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observing the Sun===

On a flat Earth, an omnidirectional Sun (emitting light in all directions, as it does) would illuminate the entire surface at the same time, and all places would experience sunrise and sunset at the horizon at the same time (with some small variations due to mountains and valleys). With a spherical Earth, half the planet is in daylight at any given time (the hemisphere facing the Sun) and the other half is experiencing nighttime. When a given location on the spherical Earth is in sunlight, its [[antipodes|antipode]] - the location exactly on the opposite side of the Earth - is always experiencing nighttime. The spherical shape of the Earth causes the Sun to rise and set at different times in different places, and different locations get different amounts of sunlight each day. 

In order to explain day and night, time zones, and the seasons, some flat Earth theorists propose that the Sun does not emit light in all directions, but acts more like a spotlight, only illuminating part of the flat Earth at a time.&lt;ref&gt;claimed by http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=58309.0#.VuJqbULlyPZ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="takes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2017/10/28/what-does-take-believe-world-flat/0gdgl2JMPhBpgJK5mGXPkI/story.html |title=What does it take to believe the world is flat? |date=28 October 2017 |author=Courtney Humphries}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is not consistent with observation; at sunrise and sunset, a spotlight Sun would be up in the sky at least a little bit, rather than at the horizon where it is always actually observed. A spotlight Sun would also appear at different angles in the sky with respect to a flat ground than it does with respect to a curved ground. Assuming light travels in straight lines, actual measurements of the Sun's angle in the sky from locations very distant from each other are only consistent with a geometry where the Sun is very far away and is being seen from a hemispherical surface (the daylight half of the Earth).  These two phenomena are related: a low-altitude spotlight Sun would spent most of the day near the horizon for most locations on Earth (which is not observed), but rise and set fairly close to the horizon.  A high-altitude Sun would spend more of the day away from the horizon, but rise and set fairly far from the horizon (which is not observed).

====Local solar time and time zones====

{{main|Time zone}}

Ancient timekeeping reckoned "noon" as the time of day when the sun is highest in the sky, with the rest of the hours in the day measured against that.  During the day, the [[apparent solar time]] can be measured directly with a [[sundial]].  In ancient Egypt, the first known sundials divided the day into 12 hours, though because the length of the day changed with the season, the length of the hours also changed.  Sundials that defined hours as always being the same duration appeared in the [[Renaissance]].  In Western Europe, [[clock tower]]s and [[striking clock]]s were used in the Middle Ages to keep people nearby appraised of the local time, though compared to modern times this was less important in a largely agrarian society.

Because the Sun reaches its highest point at different times for different [[longitude]]s (about four minutes of time for every degree of longitude difference east or west), the local solar noon in each city is different except for those directly north or south of each other.  This means that the clocks in different cities could be offset from each other by minutes or hours.  As clocks became more precise and industrialization made timekeeping more important, cities switched to [[mean solar time]], which ignores minor variations in the timing of local solar noon over the year, due to the elliptical nature of the Earth's orbit, and its tilt.

The differences in clock time between cities was not generally a problem until the advent of [[railroad]] travel in the 1800s, which both made travel between distant cities much faster than by walking or horse, and also required passengers to show up at specific times to meet their desired trains.  In the [[United Kingdom]], railroads gradually switched to [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (set from local time at the Greenwich observatory in London), followed by public clocks across the country generally, forming a single time zone.  In the United States, railroads published schedules based on local time, then later based on standard time for that railroad (typically the local time at the railroad's headquarters), and then finally based on four standard time zones shared across all railroads, where neighboring zones differed by exactly one hour.  At first railroad time was synchronized by portable [[Railroad chronometer|chronometer]]s, and then later by [[telegraph]] and [[radio]] signals.

[[San Francisco]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/richmond-virginia.html&lt;/ref&gt; is at 122.41°W longitude and [[Richmond, Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/san-francisco-california.html&lt;/ref&gt; is at 77.46°W longitude.  They are both at about 37.6°N latitude (±.2°).  The approximately 45° of longitude difference translates into about 180 minutes, or 3 hours, of time between sunsets in the two cities, for example.  San Francisco is in the [[Pacific Time]] zone, and Richmond is in the [[Eastern Time]] zone, which are three hours apart, so the local clocks in each city show that the sun sets at about the same time when using the local time zone.  But a phone call from Richmond to San Francisco at sunset will reveal that there are still three hours of daylight left in California.

====Length of the day====

On a flat Earth with an omnidirectional Sun, all places would experience the same amount of daylight every day, and all places would get daylight at the same time.  Actual day length varies considerably, with places closer to the poles getting very long days in the summer and very short days in the winter, with northerly summer happening at the same time as southerly winter.  Places north of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]] get no sunlight for at least one day a year, and get 24-hour sunlight for at least one day a year.  Both the poles experience sunlight for 6 months and darkness for 6 months, at opposite times.

The movement of daylight between the northern and southern hemispheres happens because of the [[axial tilt]] of the Earth.  The imaginary line around which the Earth spins, which goes between the North Pole and South Pole, is tilted about 23° from the oval that describes its orbit around the Sun.  The Earth always points in the same direction as it moves around the Sun, so for half the year ([[summer]] in the Northern Hemisphere), the North Pole is pointed slightly toward the Sun, keeping it in daylight all the time because the Sun lights up the half of the Earth that is facing it (and the North Pole is always in that half due to the tilt).  For the other half of the orbit, the South Pole is tilted slightly toward the Sun, and it is [[winter]] in the Northern Hemisphere.  This means that at the equator, the Sun is not directly overhead at noon, except around the [[autumnal equinox]] and [[vernal equinox]], when one spot on the equator is pointed directly at the Sun.

The length of the day varies because as the Earth rotates some places (near the poles) pass through only a short curve near the top or bottom of the sunlight half; other places (near the equator) travel along much longer curves through the middle.

The length of [[twilight]] would be very different on a flat Earth. On a round Earth, the atmosphere above the ground is lit for a while before sunrise and after sunset are observed at ground level, because the Sun is still visible from higher altitudes.  Longer twilights are observed at higher latitudes (near the poles) due to a shallower angle of the Sun's apparent movement compared to the horizon.  On a flat Earth, the Sun's shadow would reach the upper atmosphere very quickly, except near the closest edge of the Earth, and would always set at the same angle to the ground (which is not what is observed).  The "spotlight Sun" theory is also not consistent with this observation, since the air cannot be lit without the ground below it also being lit (except for shadows of mountains and other surface obstacles).

====Determining the shape of the Earth====

On a given day, if many different cities measure the angle of the Sun at local noon, the resulting data, when combined with the known distances between cities, shows that the Earth has 180 degrees of north-south curvature.  (A full range of angles will be observed if the north and south poles are included, and the day chosen is either the autumnal or spring equinox.)  This is consistent with many rounded shapes, including a sphere, and is inconsistent with a flat shape.

Some claim that this experiment assumes a very distant Sun, such that the incoming rays are essentially parallel, and if a flat Earth is assumed, that the measured angles can allow one to calculate the distance to the Sun, which must be small enough that its incoming rays are not very parallel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=58309.0#.VuJqbULlyPZ&lt;/ref&gt; However, if more than two relatively well-separated cities are included in the experiment, the calculation will make clear whether the Sun is distant or nearby.  For example, on the equinox, the 0 degree angle from the North Pole and the 90 degree angle from the equator predict a Sun which would have to be located essentially next to the surface of a flat Earth, but the difference in angle between the equator and New York City would predict a Sun much further away if the Earth is flat.  Because these results are contradictory, the surface of the Earth cannot be flat; the data ''is'' consistent with a nearly spherical Earth and a Sun which is very far away compared with the diameter of the Earth.

====Determining the size of the Earth====

Using the knowledge that the Sun is very far away, the ancient Greek geographer Eratosthenes [[Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_the_Earth.27s_circumference|performed an experiment]] using the differences in the observed angle of the Sun from two different locations to calculate the circumference of the Earth. Though modern telecommunications and timekeeping were not available, he was able to make sure the measurements happened at the same time by having them taken when the Sun was highest in the sky (local noon) at both locations. Using slightly inaccurate assumptions about the locations of two cities, he came to a result within 15% of the correct value.

====Watching the sun set twice====

On level ground, the difference in the distance to the horizon between lying down and standing up is large enough to watch the Sun set twice by quickly standing up immediately after seeing it set for the first time while lying down.  This also can be done with a [[cherry picker]]&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.xkcd.com/2009/04/06/a-date-idea-analyzed/&lt;/ref&gt; or a tall building with a fast elevator.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5917230/did-you-know-that-the-burj-khalifa-is-so-tall-that-you-can-watch-two-sunsets-on-the-same-day Did You Know That the Burj Khalifa Is So Tall That you Can Watch Two Sunsets On the Same Day?]&lt;/ref&gt; On a flat Earth, one would not be able to see the Sun again (unless standing near the edge closest to the Sun) due to a much faster-moving Sun shadow.&lt;ref name="headsup" /&gt; 

When the supersonic [[Concorde]] took off not long after sunset from London and flew westward to New York faster than the sunset was advancing westward on the ground, passengers observed a sunrise in the west. After landing in New York, passengers saw a second sunset in the west.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/concorde-and-supersonic-travel-the-days-when-the-sun-rose-in-the-west-8888836.html Concorde and supersonic travel: The days when the sun rose in the west]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the speed of the Sun's shadow is slower in polar regions (due to the steeper angle), even a subsonic aircraft can overtake the sunset when flying at high latitudes. One photographer used a roughly circular route around the North Pole to take pictures of 24 sunsets in the same 24-hour period, pausing westward progress in each time zone to let the shadow of the Sun catch up.&lt;ref name="twenty_four"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2788267/here-comes-suns-photographer-travels-time-zone-capture-24-sunsets-one-day.html Here comes the suns! Photographer travels through every time zone to capture 24 sunsets in ONE DAY]&lt;/ref&gt; The surface of the Earth rotates at {{convert|180.17|mph}} at 80° north or south, and {{convert|1040.4|mph}} at the equator.&lt;ref name="twenty_four" /&gt;

===Spherical vs. flat triangles===
[[Image:Triangles (spherical geometry).jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram showing how the interior angles of triangles add up to about 180° when plotted on a small, nearly flat area of the Earth, but add up to more than 180° (in this case 230°) when plotted on a large area with significant curvature]]
Because the Earth is spherical, long-distance travel sometimes requires heading in different directions than one would head on a flat Earth.

For example, consider an airplane that travels {{convert|10000|km}} in a straight line, takes a 90-degree right turn, travels another {{convert|10000|km}}, takes another 90-degree right turn, and travels {{convert|10000|km}} a third time.  On a flat Earth, the aircraft would have travelled along three sides of a square, and arrive at a spot about {{convert|10000|km}} from where it started. But because the Earth is spherical, in reality it will have travelled along three sides of a triangle, and arrive back very close to its starting point.  If the starting point is the North Pole, it would have travelled due south from the North Pole to the equator, then west for a quarter of the way around the Earth, and then due north back to the North Pole.

In [[spherical geometry]], the sum of angles inside a triangle is greater than 180° (in this example 270°, having arrived back at the north pole a 90° angle to the departure path) unlike on a flat surface, where it is always exactly 180°.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/tripleright.jpg Triple-right triangle on a sphere (image)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grids are distorted by spherical ground===

A [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of [[longitude]] is a line where local solar noon occurs at the same time each day.  These lines define "north" and "south".  These are perpendicular to lines of [[latitude]] that define "east" and "west", where the Sun is at the same angle at local noon on the same day.  If the Sun were travelling from east to west over a flat Earth, meridian lines would always be the same distance apart - they would form a square grid when combined with lines of latitude. In reality, meridian lines get farther apart as one travels toward the equator, which is only possible on a round Earth.  In places where land is plotted on a grid system, this causes discontinuities in the grid.  For example, in areas of the [[Midwestern United States]] that use the [[Public Land Survey System]], the northernmost and westernmost sections of a [[township]] deviate from what would otherwise be an exact square mile.  The resulting discontinuities are sometimes reflected directly in local roads, which have kinks where the grid cannot follow completely straight lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/gerco-de-ruijter-grid-corrections-highways-driving-wichita Mysterious Detour While Driving? It Could Be Due to the Curvature of the Earth]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weather systems===

Low-pressure weather systems with inward winds (such as a [[hurricane]]) spin counterclockwise north of the equator, but clockwise south of the equator.  This is due to the [[Coriolis force]], and requires that (assuming they are attached to each other and rotating in the same direction) the north and southern halves of the Earth are angled in opposite directions (e.g. the north is facing toward Polaris and the south is facing away from it).

===Gravity===

The laws of [[gravity]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]] that explain the formation and rounding of the Earth are well-tested through experiment, and applied successfully to many engineering tasks.

From these laws, we know the amount of mass the Earth contains, and that a non-spherical planet the size of the Earth would not be able to support itself against its own gravity.  A flat disc the size of the Earth, for example, would likely crack, heat up, liquefy, and re-form into a roughly spherical shape.  On a disc strong enough to maintain its shape, gravity would not pull downward with respect to the surface, but would pull toward the center of the disc,&lt;ref name="smarter" /&gt; contrary to what is observed on level terrain (and which would create major problems with oceans flowing toward the center of the disk).

Ignoring the other concerns, some flat Earth theorists explain the observed surface "gravity" by proposing that the flat Earth is constantly accelerating upwards.&lt;ref name="takes" /&gt; Such a theory would also leave open for explanation the [[tide]]s seen in Earth's oceans, which are conventionally explained by the gravity exerted by the Sun and Moon.

===Technology===

Observation of [[Foucault pendulum]]s, popular in science museums around the world, demonstrate both that the world is spherical and that it rotates (not that the stars are rotating around it).

The mathematics of navigation by [[GPS]] assume that satellites are moving in known orbits around an approximately spherical surface.  The accuracy of GPS navigation in determining latitude and longitude and the way these numbers map onto locations on the ground show that these assumptions are correct.  The same is true for the operational [[GLONASS]] system run by Russia, and the in-development European [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], Chinese [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BeiDou]], and Indian [[Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System|IRNSS]].

Satellites, including communications satellites used for television, telephone, and Internet connections, would not stay in orbit unless the modern theory of gravitation were correct.  The details of which satellites are visible from which places on the ground at which times prove an approximately spherical shape of the Earth.  (Undersea cables are also used for intercontinental communications.)

Radio transmitters are mounted on tall towers because they generally rely on [[line-of-sight propagation]]. The distance to the [[horizon]] is further at higher altitude, so mounting them higher significantly increases the area they can serve.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popsci.com/bob-released-neil-degrasse-tyson-diss-track&lt;/ref&gt; Some signals can be transmitted at much longer distances, but only if they are at frequencies where they can use [[groundwave propagation]], [[tropospheric propagation]], [[tropospheric scatter]], or [[ionospheric propagation]] to reflect or refract signals around the curve of the Earth.

===Architecture===

The design of some large structures needs to take the shape of the Earth into account.  For example, the towers of the [[Humber Bridge]], although both vertical with respect to gravity, are {{convert|36|mm|in|1|abbr=in}} farther apart at the top than the bottom due to the local curvature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitgrimsby.co.uk/humber.htm|publisher=Visit Grimsby|title=The Humber Bridge|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hellenistic world====

Though the earliest written mention of a spherical Earth comes from ancient Greek sources, there is no account of how the sphericity of the Earth was discovered.&lt;ref name="evans47"&gt;James Evans, (1998), ''The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy'', page 47, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; A plausible explanation is that it was "the experience of travellers that suggested such an explanation for the variation in the observable [[altitude]] of the pole and the change in the area of circumpolar stars, a change that was quite drastic between [[Greek colonies|Greek settlements]]"&lt;ref name="Neugebauer.575–6"/&gt; around the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]], particularly those between the [[Nile Delta]] and [[Crimea]].&lt;ref name="Neugebauer.575–6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy|author=Otto E.

In ''The Histories'', written 431–425&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Herodotus]] cast doubt on a report of the Sun observed shining from the north. He stated that the phenomenon was observed during a [[circumnavigation]] of [[Africa]] undertaken by [[Phoenicia]]n explorers employed by [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[pharaoh]] [[Necho II]] c.&amp;nbsp;610–595&amp;nbsp;BC ([[s:History of Herodotus/Book 4|''The Histories'']], 4.42) who claimed to have had the Sun on their right when circumnavigating in a clockwise direction. To modern historians, these details confirm the truth of the Phoenicians' report and even open the possibility that the Phoenicians knew about the spherical model. However, nothing certain about their knowledge of geography and navigation has survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friis|first=Herman Ralph|title=The Pacific Basin: A History of Its Geographical Exploration|date=1967|publisher=[[American Geographical Society]]|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veuwAAAAIAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After the 5th century&amp;nbsp;BC, no Greek writer of repute thought the world was anything but round.&lt;ref name="dicks1" /&gt;

=====Plato=====
[[Plato]] (427–347&amp;nbsp;BC) travelled to southern [[Italy]] to study [[Pythagorean mathematics]]. When he returned to [[Athens]] and established his school, Plato also taught his students that Earth was a sphere, though he offered no justifications. "My conviction is that the Earth is a round body in the centre of the heavens, and therefore has no need of air or of any similar force to be a support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Phaedo]]|author=Plato|page=108|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; If man could soar high above the clouds, Earth would resemble "one of those balls which have leather coverings in twelve pieces, and is decked with various colours, of which the colours used by painters on Earth are in a manner samples."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=Phaedo|author=Plato|page=110b|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], his one work that was available throughout the Middle Ages in Latin, we read that the Creator "made the world in the form of a globe, round as from a lathe, having its extremes in every direction equidistant from the centre, the most perfect and the most like itself of all figures",&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=Timaeus|author=Plato|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the word "world" here refers to the heavens.

=====Aristotle=====
[[File:20080816eclipsed2.jpg|thumb|150px|Round Earth umbra during the [[August 2008 lunar eclipse]]]]
[[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC) was Plato's prize student and "the mind of the school".&lt;ref&gt;David Johnson and Thomas Mowry, ''Mathematics: A Practical Odyssey'', [[Cengage Learning]], 2011, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle observed "there are [[star]]s seen in [[Egypt]] and [...] [[Cyprus]] which are not seen in the northerly regions." Since this could only happen on a curved surface, he too believed Earth was a sphere "of no great size, for otherwise the effect of so slight a change of place would not be quickly apparent." (''De caelo'', 298a2–10)

Aristotle provided physical and observational arguments supporting the idea of a spherical Earth:

* Every portion of the Earth tends toward the centre until by compression and convergence they form a sphere. (''De caelo'', 297a9–21)
* Travelers going south see southern constellations rise higher above the horizon; and
* The shadow of Earth on the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]] is round. (''De caelo'', 297b31–298a10).

The concepts of symmetry, equilibrium and cyclic repetition permeated Aristotle's work. In his [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|''Meteorology'']] he divided the world into five climatic zones: two temperate areas separated by a torrid zone near the [[equator]], and two cold inhospitable regions, "one near our upper or northern pole and the other near the [[...]] southern pole," both impenetrable and girdled with ice (''Meteorologica'', 362a31–35). Although no humans could survive in the frigid zones, inhabitants in the southern temperate regions could exist.

[[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|Aristotle's theory of natural place]] relied on a spherical Earth to explain why [[Earth (classical element)|heavy things]] go down (toward what Aristotle believed was the center of the Universe), and things like [[Air (classical element)|air]] and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] go up. In this [[geocentric model]], the structure of the universe was believed to be a series of perfect spheres. The Sun, Moon, planets and fixed stars were believed to move on [[celestial spheres]] around a stationary Earth.

Though Aristotle's theory of physics survived in the Christian world for many centuries, the [[heliocentric model]] was eventually shown to be a more correct explanation of the [[Solar System]] than the geocentric model, and [[atomic theory]] was shown to be a more correct explanation of the nature of matter than [[classical element]]s like earth, water, air, fire, and aether.

=====Archimedes=====

=====Eratosthenes=====
[[Eratosthenes]], a Greek [[Hellenistic astronomy|astronomer]] from [[Hellenistic]] [[Cyrenaica]] (276–194&amp;nbsp;BC), estimated [[Earth]]'s circumference around 240&amp;nbsp;BC. He had heard that in [[Syene]] the [[Sun]] was directly overhead at the summer [[solstice]] whereas in [[Alexandria]] it still cast a shadow. Using the differing angles the shadows made as the basis of his trigonometric calculations he estimated a circumference of around 250,000 ''[[Ancient Greek units of measurement|stades]]''. The length of a 'stade' is not precisely known, but Eratosthenes's figure only has an error of around five to fifteen percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Albert | last = Van Helden | title = Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 1985 | pages = 4–5 | isbn = 0-226-84882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/F_JSC_NES_School_Measures_Up.html|title=JSC NES School Measures Up|publisher=NASA|date=11 April 2006|accessdate=7 Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Scolumb.htm|title=The Round Earth|publisher=NASA|date=12 December 2004|accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eratosthenes used rough estimates and round numbers, but depending on the length of the [[stadia (length)|stadion]], his result is within a margin of between 2% and 20% of the actual [[meridional]] [[circumference]], {{convert|40008|km}}.

Seventeen hundred years after Eratosthenes, Christopher Columbus studied Eratosthenes's findings before sailing west for the Indies. However, ultimately he rejected Eratosthenes in favour of other maps and arguments that interpreted Earth's circumference to be a third smaller than reality. If, instead, Columbus had accepted Eratosthenes findings, then he may have never gone west, since he didn't have the supplies or funding needed for the much longer voyage.&lt;ref&gt;

=====Seleucus of Seleucia=====
[[Seleucus of Seleucia]] (c.&amp;nbsp;190&amp;nbsp;BC), who lived in the city of [[Seleucia]] in [[Mesopotamia]], wrote that the Earth is spherical (and actually orbits the [[Sun]], influenced by the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]] of [[Aristarchus of Samos]]).

=====Posidonius=====
[[Posidonius]] (c. 135 – 51 BC) put faith in Eratosthenes's method, though by observing the star [[Canopus]], rather than the sun in establishing the Earth's circumference. In Ptolemy's ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'', his result was favoured over that of Eratosthenes. Posidonius furthermore expressed the distance of the sun in earth radii.

====Roman Empire====
From its Greek origins, the idea of a spherical earth, along with much of [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomical thought]], slowly spread across the globe and ultimately became the adopted view in all major astronomical traditions.&lt;ref name="Krüger: Roman and medieval continuation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ragep: Islamic adoption"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pingree: Indian adoption"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martzloff, Cullen: Chinese adoption"/&gt;

In the West, the idea came to the Romans through the lengthy process of cross-fertilization with [[Hellenistic civilization]]. Many Roman authors such as [[Cicero]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] refer in their works to the rotundity of the earth as a matter of course.&lt;ref name="Reinhard Krüger"&gt;Krüger, Reinhard: [https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/bitstream/11682/5268/1/ReinhardKrueger.pdf "Ein Versuch über die Archäologie der Globalisierung.

=====Strabo=====
[[File:Shiphorp.jpg|thumb|When a ship is at the horizon, its [[Hull-down|lower part is obscured]] by the Earth's curvature. This was one of the first arguments favouring a round-Earth model.]]
It has been suggested that seafarers probably provided the first observational evidence that the Earth was not flat, based on observations of the [[horizon]]. This argument was put forward by the geographer [[Strabo]] (c.&amp;nbsp;64&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– 24&amp;nbsp;AD), who suggested that the spherical shape of the Earth was probably known to seafarers around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] since at least the time of [[Homer]],&lt;ref name=strabo&gt;Hugh Thurston, ''Early Astronomy'', (New York: Springer-Verlag), p. 118. {{ISBN|0-387-94107-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; citing a line from the ''[[Odyssey]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'', Bk. 5 393: "As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near." [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler's]] translation is [http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/odyssey.5.v.html#284 available online].&lt;/ref&gt; as indicating that the poet [[Homer]] knew of this as early as the 7th or 8th century BC. [[Strabo]] cited various phenomena observed at sea as suggesting that the Earth was spherical. He observed that elevated lights or areas of land were visible to sailors at greater distances than those less elevated, and stated that the curvature of the sea was obviously responsible for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title= The Geography of Strabo, in Eight Volumes | author= Strabo | others= Loeb Classical Library edition, translated by Horace Leonard Jones, A.M., Ph.D. | date= 1960 | origyear= 1917 | location= London | publisher= William Heinemann }}, Vol.I Bk.

=====Claudius Ptolemy=====
[[Claudius Ptolemy]] (90–168&amp;nbsp;AD) lived in [[Alexandria]], the centre of scholarship in the 2nd century. In the ''[[Almagest]],'' which remained the standard work of astronomy for 1,400 years, he advanced many arguments for the spherical nature of the Earth. Among them was the observation that when a ship is sailing towards [[mountain]]s, observers note these seem to rise from the sea, indicating that they were hidden by the curved surface of the sea. He also gives separate arguments that the Earth is curved north-south and that it is curved east-west.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ptolemy | title = Almagest | pages = I.4}} as quoted in {{Cite book| first = Edward | last = Grant | title = A Source Book in Medieval Science | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = 1974 | pages = 63–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He compiled an eight-volume ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' covering what was known about the earth. The first part of the ''Geographia'' is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. As with the model of the Solar System in the ''Almagest'', Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme. He assigned [[coordinate]]s to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] that spanned the globe (although most of this has been lost). [[Latitude]] was measured from the [[equator]], as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as the length of the longest day rather than [[degree (angle)|degrees of arc]] (the length of the [[midsummer]] day increases from 12h to 24h as you go from the equator to the [[polar circle]]). He put the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of 0 [[longitude]] at the most western land he knew, the [[Canary Islands]].

''Geographia'' indicated the countries of "[[Seres|Serica]]" and "Sinae" ([[China]]) at the extreme right, beyond the island of "Taprobane" ([[Sri Lanka]], oversized) and the "Aurea Chersonesus" ([[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian peninsula]]).

Ptolemy also devised and provided instructions on how to create maps both of the whole inhabited world (''oikoumenè'') and of the Roman provinces. In the second part of the ''Geographia,'' he provided the necessary [[topographic]] lists, and captions for the maps. His ''oikoumenè'' spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Canary Islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[China]], and about 81 degrees of latitude from the Arctic to the [[East Indies]] and deep into [[Africa]]. Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe.

=====Late Antiquity=====
Knowledge of the spherical shape of the Earth was received in scholarship of [[Late Antiquity]] as a matter of course, in both [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Early Christianity]]. [[Calcidius]]'s fourth-century [[Latin language|Latin]] commentary on and translation of Plato's ''Timaeus'', which was one of the few examples of Greek scientific thought that was known in the Early Middle Ages in Western Europe, discussed [[Hipparchus]]'s use of the geometrical circumstances of eclipses to compute the [[On Sizes and Distances|relative diameters]] of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McCluskey | first = Stephen C. | title = Astronomies and Cultures in Early Medieval Europe | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1998 | pages = 119–120 | isbn = 978-0-521-77852-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Calcidius | author-link = Calcidius | editor-last = Klibansky| editor-first = Raymond| editor-link = Raymond Klibansky| date = 1962 | title = Timaeus a Calcidio translatus commentarioque instructus | series = Corpus Platonicum Medii Aevi, Plato Latinus | volume = 4 | publisher = Brill / Warburg Institute| publication-place = Leiden / London | pages = 141–144 | isbn = 9780854810529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theological doubt informed by the [[flat Earth]] model implied in the [[Hebrew Bible]] inspired some early Christian scholars such as [[Lactantius]], [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], but this remained an eccentric current. Learned Christian authors such as [[Basil of Caesarea]], [[Ambrose]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] were clearly aware of the sphericity of the Earth. "Flat Earthism" lingered longest in [[Syriac Christianity]], which tradition laid greater importance on a literalist interpretation of the Old Testament. Authors from that tradition, such as [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], presented the Earth as flat as late as in the 6th century. This last remnant of the ancient model of the cosmos disappeared during the 7th century. From the 8th century and the beginning [[Early Middle Ages|medieval period]], "no cosmographer worthy of note has called into question the sphericity of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Anselm Vogel, "Sphaera terrae – das mittelalterliche Bild der Erde und die kosmographische Revolution," PhD dissertation Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, 1995, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
Greek ethnographer [[Megasthenes]], c.&amp;nbsp;300&amp;nbsp;BC, has been interpreted as stating that the contemporary Brahmans believed in a spherical earth as the center of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the spread of [[Hellenistic period|Greek culture]] in the east, [[Hellenistic astronomy]] filtered eastwards to [[ancient India]] where its profound influence became apparent in the early centuries AD.&lt;ref name="Pingree (1978), 533, 554f."/&gt; The Greek concept of an Earth surrounded by the spheres of the planets and that of the fixed stars, vehemently supported by astronomers like [[Varahamihir]] and [[Brahmagupta]], strengthened the astronomical principles. Some ideas were found possible to preserve, although in altered form.&lt;ref name="Pingree (1978), 533, 554f."&gt;D.

The works of the classical [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomer]] and [[Indian mathematics|mathematician]], [[Aryabhatta]] (476–550 AD), deal with the sphericity of the Earth and the motion of the planets. The final two parts of his [[Sanskrit]] magnum opus, the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'', which were named the ''Kalakriya'' ("reckoning of time") and the ''Gol'' ("sphere"), state that the Earth is spherical and that its circumference is 4,967 [[yojana]]s.

===Middle Ages===
Knowledge of the sphericity of the Earth survived into the medieval corpus of knowledge by direct transmission of the texts of Greek antiquity ([[Aristotle]]), and via authors such as [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Beda Venerabilis]].
It became increasingly traceable with the rise of [[scholasticism]] and [[Medieval university|medieval learning]].&lt;ref name="Reinhard Krüger"/&gt;
Spread of this knowledge beyond the immediate sphere of Greco-Roman scholarship was necessarily gradual, associated with the pace of [[Christianisation]] of Europe. For example, the first evidence of knowledge of the spherical shape of the Earth in [[Scandinavia]] is a 12th-century [[Old Icelandic]] translation of ''[[Elucidarius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Simek, ''Altnordische Kosmographie'', Berlin, 1990, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-exhaustive list of more than a hundred [[Latin]] and vernacular writers from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]] who were aware that the earth was spherical has been compiled by Reinhard Krüger, professor for Romance literature at the [[University of Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name="Reinhard Krüger"/&gt;{{seemore|message=Krüger's list of the 79 authors known by name can be studied by clicking on}}

;Isidore of Seville
Bishop [[Isidore of Seville]] (560–636) taught in his widely read encyclopedia, ''The [[Etymologiae|Etymologies]],'' that the Earth was "round".&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologiae,'' XIV.ii.1 [3].&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop's confusing exposition and choice of imprecise Latin terms have divided scholarly opinion on whether he meant a sphere or a disk or even whether he meant anything specific.&lt;ref&gt;Referring to Isidore's five circles in ''De Natura Rerum'' X 5, ERnest Brehaut wrote: "The explanation of the passage and of the figure which illustrates it seems to be that Isidore accepted the terminology of the spherical earth from Hyginus without taking the time to understand it—if indeed he had the ability to do so—and applied it without compunction to the flat earth." {{cite book|title=Encyclopedist of the Flat Earth|author=Ernest Brehaut|page=30|date=1912}} Similarly, J. Fontaine refers to this passage as a "scientific absurdity".{{cite book|title=Traité de la Nature|author=Isidore of Seville|editor=J. Fontaine|date=1960|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable recent scholars claim that he taught a spherical earth.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley M. Stevens, "The Figure of the Earth in Isidore's 'De natura rerum," ''Isis'', 71(1980): 268–277.&lt;/ref&gt; Isidore did not admit the possibility of people dwelling at the antipodes, considering them as legendary&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologiae,'' XIV.v.17 [4].&lt;/ref&gt; and noting that there was no evidence for their existence.&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologiae,'' IX.ii.133 [5].&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bede the Venerable

The monk [[Bede]] (c.&amp;nbsp;672–735) wrote in his influential treatise on computus, ''The Reckoning of Time'', that the Earth was round. He explained the unequal length of daylight from "the roundness of the Earth, for not without reason is it called 'the orb of the world' on the pages of Holy Scripture and of ordinary literature. It is, in fact, set like a sphere in the middle of the whole universe." (De temporum ratione, 32). The large number of surviving manuscripts of ''The Reckoning of Time,'' copied to meet the Carolingian requirement that all priests should study the computus, indicates that many, if not most, priests were exposed to the idea of the sphericity of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Faith Wallis, trans., ''Bede: The Reckoning of Time,'' (Liverpool: Liverpool Univ. Pr., 2004), pp. lxxxv–lxxxix.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] paraphrased Bede into Old English, saying, "Now the Earth's roundness and the Sun's orbit constitute the obstacle to the day's being equally long in every land."&lt;ref&gt;Ælfric of Eynsham, ''On the Seasons of the Year,'' Peter Baker, trans&lt;/ref&gt;

Bede was lucid about earth's sphericity, writing "We call the earth a globe, not as if the shape of a sphere were expressed in the diversity of plains and mountains, but because, if all things are included in the outline, the earth's circumference will represent the figure of a perfect globe... For truly it is an orb placed in the centre of the universe; in its width it is like a circle, and not circular like a shield but rather like a ball, and it extends from its centre with perfect roundness on all sides."&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;Russell, Jeffrey B. 1991. ''Inventing the Flat Earth''. New York: Praeger Publishers. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Anania Shirakatsi
The 7th-century [[Armenia]]n scholar [[Anania Shirakatsi]] described the world as "being like an egg with a spherical yolk (the globe) surrounded by a layer of white (the atmosphere) and covered with a hard shell (the sky)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hewsen |first1=Robert H. |authorlink1=Robert H.

====Islamic astronomy====
[[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Islamic astronomy]] was developed on the basis of a spherical earth inherited from [[Hellenistic astronomy]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia of Islam: Astronomy"&gt;Ragep, F. Jamil: "Astronomy", in: Krämer, Gudrun (ed.) et al.: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', THREE, Brill 2010, without page numbers&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic theoretical framework largely relied on the fundamental contributions of [[Aristotle]] (''[[De caelo]]'') and [[Ptolemy]] (''[[Almagest]]''), both of whom worked from the premise that the earth was spherical and at the centre of the universe ([[geocentric model]]).&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia of Islam: Astronomy"/&gt;

Early Islamic scholars recognized Earth's sphericity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad Hamidullah]]. ''L'Islam et son impulsion scientifique originelle'', Tiers-Monde, 1982, vol. 23, n° 92, p. 789.&lt;/ref&gt; leading [[Islamic mathematics|Muslim mathematicians]] to develop [[spherical trigonometry]]&lt;ref&gt;David A. King, ''Astronomy in the Service of Islam'', (Aldershot (U.K.): Variorum), 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to further mensuration and to calculate the distance and direction from any given point on the Earth to [[Mecca]]. This determined the ''[[Qibla]],'' or Muslim direction of prayer.

;Al-Ma'mun
Around 830&amp;nbsp;AD, Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] commissioned a group of [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]] and [[Islamic geography|geographers]] to measure the distance from Tadmur ([[Palmyra]]) to [[Raqqa]] in modern Syria. They found the cities to be separated by one degree of [[latitude]] and the [[meridian arc]] distance between them to be 66{{frac|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;miles and thus calculated the Earth's circumference to be 24,000&amp;nbsp;miles.&lt;ref&gt;''Gharā'ib al-funūn wa-mulah al-`uyūn'' (The Book of Curiosities of the Sciences and Marvels for the Eyes), 2.1 "On the mensuration of the Earth and its division into seven climes, as related by Ptolemy and others," (ff. 22b–23a)[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/bookofcuriosities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another estimate given by his astronomers was 56{{frac|2|3}} Arabic miles (111.8&amp;nbsp;km) per degree, which corresponds to a circumference of 40,248&amp;nbsp;km, very close to the currently modern values of 111.3&amp;nbsp;km per degree and 40,068&amp;nbsp;km circumference, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Kennedy, ''Mathematical Geography'', pp=187–8, in {{Harv|Rashed|Morelon|1996|pp=185–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ibn Hazm
[[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[polymath]] [[Ibn Hazm]] stated that the proof of the Earth's sphericity "is that the Sun is always vertical to a particular spot on Earth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/how-islamic-inventors-changed-the-world-6106905.html "How Islamic inventors changed the world"]. ''[[The Independent]]''. March 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Al-Farghānī
[[Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī|Al-Farghānī]] (Latinized as Alfraganus) was a Persian astronomer of the 9th century involved in measuring the diameter of the Earth, and commissioned by Al-Ma'mun. His estimate given above for a degree (56{{frac|2|3}} Arabic miles) was much more accurate than the 60{{frac|2|3}} Roman miles (89.7&amp;nbsp;km) given by Ptolemy. [[Christopher Columbus]] uncritically used Alfraganus's figure as if it were in Roman miles instead of in Arabic miles, in order to prove a smaller size of the Earth than that propounded by Ptolemy.&lt;ref&gt;Felipe Fernández-Armesto, ''Columbus and the Conquest of the Impossible'', pp. 20–1, Phoenix Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Biruni
[[File:Abu Reyhan Biruni-Earth Circumference.svg|thumb|Biruni's method for calculation of Earth's radius]]
[[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] (973–1048) used a new method to accurately compute the Earth's [[circumference]], by which he arrived at a value that was close to modern values for the Earth's circumference.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Aber (2003). Alberuni calculated the Earth's circumference at a small town of Pind Dadan Khan, District Jhelum, Punjab, Pakistan.[http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/histgeol/biruni/biruni.htm Abu Rayhan al-Biruni], [[Emporia State University]].&lt;/ref&gt; His estimate of 6,339.6&amp;nbsp;km for the [[Earth radius]] was only 31.4&amp;nbsp;km less than the modern mean value of 6,371.0&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Moritz2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moritz |first=H. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=March 2000 |title=Geodetic Reference System 1980 |journal=Journal of Geodesy |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=128–133 |doi=10.1007/s001900050278 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0bgccvjj5bedgdfu/about/ |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 2000JGeod..74..128. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to his predecessors, who measured the Earth's circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations, Biruni developed a new method of using [[Trigonometry|trigonometric]] calculations based on the angle between a [[plain]] and [[mountain]] top. This yielded more accurate measurements of the Earth's circumference and made it possible for a single person to measure it from a single location.&lt;ref&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (1992), ''Avicenna'', p. 31, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-01929-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Savizi&gt;

Biruni's method was intended to avoid "walking across hot, dusty deserts," and the idea came to him when he was on top of a tall mountain in India. From the top of the mountain, he sighted the angle to the horizon which, along with the mountain's height (which he calculated beforehand), allowed him to calculate the curvature of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Chicago Press| isbn = 978-0-226-31635-2| pages = 182–184| editor = J.

According to John J. O'Connor and Edmund F. Robertson,
{{quote|Important contributions to [[geodesy]] and [[Islamic geography|geography]] were also made by Biruni. He introduced techniques to measure the earth and distances on it using [[triangulation]]. He found the [[Earth radius|radius of the earth]] to be 6339.6 km, a value not obtained in the West until the 16th century. His ''Masudic canon'' contains a table giving the coordinates of six hundred places, almost all of which he had direct knowledge.&lt;ref name=MacTutor&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Biruni|title=Al-Biruni}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
;Applications
Muslim scholars who held to the round Earth theory used it for a quintessentially Islamic purpose: to calculate the distance and direction from any given point on the Earth to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 11th century, [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|al-Biruni]] used spherical trigonometry to find the direction of Mecca from many cities and published it in ''The Determination of the Co-ordinates of Cities''. See Lyons, 2009, p85&lt;/ref&gt; This determined the [[Qibla]], or Muslim direction of prayer.

A terrestrial globe (Kura-i-ard) was among the presents sent by the Persian Muslim astronomer [[Jamal ad-Din (astronomer)|Jamal-al-Din]] to [[Kublai Khan]]'s [[China|Chinese]] court in 1267. It was made of wood on which "seven parts of water are represented in green, three parts of land in white, with rivers, lakes etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1959|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho Peng Yoke remarks that "it did not seem to have any general appeal to the Chinese in those days".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Ho Peng Yoke|title=Li, Qi and Shu, An introduction to Science and Civilisation in China|date=1985|publisher=New York, Dover Publications|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====High and late medieval Europe====

[[File:John Gower world Vox Clamantis.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Gower]] prepares to shoot the world, a sphere with compartments representing earth, air, and water (''[[Vox Clamantis]]'', around 1400)]]
During the [[High Middle Ages]], the astronomical knowledge in Christian Europe was extended beyond what was transmitted directly from ancient authors by transmission of learning from [[Medieval Islamic astronomy]]. An early student of such learning was Gerbert d'Aurillac, the later [[Pope Sylvester II]].

Saint Hildegard ([[Hildegard von Bingen]], 1098–1179), depicted the spherical earth several times in her work ''Liber Divinorum Operum''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/galileopalazzostrozzi/object/HildegardOfBingenLiberDivinorumOperum.html Hildegard of Bingen, Liber divinorum operum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes de Sacrobosco]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1195 – c.&amp;nbsp;1256&amp;nbsp;AD) wrote a famous work on Astronomy called ''[[Tractatus de Sphaera]],'' based on Ptolemy, which primarily considers the sphere of the sky. However, it contains clear proofs of the earth's sphericity in the first chapter.&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Pedersen, "In Quest of Sacrobosco", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 16(1985): 175–221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=The Sphere of Sacrobosco|others=trans. Lynn Thorndike|date=1949|url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] commentators on Aristotle's ''[[On the Heavens]]'' and Sacrobosco's ''Treatise on the Sphere'' unanimously agreed that the earth is spherical or round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Grant | first = Edward | author-link = Edward Grant | title = Planets, Stars, &amp; Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos, 1200–1687 | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1996 | pages = 620–622, 737–738 | isbn = 0-521-56509-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant observes that no author who had studied at a [[medieval university]] thought that the earth was flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Grant | first = Edward | author-link = Edward Grant | title = God and Reason in the Middle Ages | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 2001 | page = 339 | isbn = 0-521-00337-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Elucidarium'' of [[Honorius Augustodunensis]] (c. 1120), an important manual for the instruction of lesser clergy, which was translated into [[Middle English]], [[Old French]], [[Middle High German]], [[Old Russian]], [[Middle Dutch]], [[Old Norse]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and several Italian dialects, explicitly refers to a spherical Earth. Likewise, the fact that [[Bertold von Regensburg]] (mid-13th century) used the spherical Earth as an illustration in a [[sermon]] shows that he could assume this knowledge among his congregation. The sermon was preached in the vernacular German, and thus was not intended for a learned audience.

Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]],'' written in Italian in the early 14th century, portrays Earth as a sphere, discussing implications such as the different stars visible in the [[southern hemisphere]], the altered position of the [[sun]], and the various [[timezone]]s of the Earth.

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] exploration of [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s voyage to the [[Americas]] (1492) and, finally, [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s circumnavigation of the earth (1519–21) provided practical evidence of the global shape of the earth.

===Early Modern period===

====Circumnavigation of the globe====
{{further|Age of Discovery}}
[[File:Behaims Erdapfel.jpg|thumb|150px|The ''[[Erdapfel]]'', the oldest surviving terrestrial globe (1492/93)]]

The first direct demonstration of Earth's sphericity came in the form of the first circumnavigation in history, an expedition captained by Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]].&lt;ref&gt;Nowell, Charles E. ed. (1962). Magellan's Voyage around the World: Three Contemporary Accounts. Evanston: NU Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was financed by the Spanish Crown. On August 10, 1519, the five ships under Magellan's command departed from [[Seville]]. They crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]], passed through what is now called the [[Strait of Magellan]], crossed the Pacific, and arrived in [[Cebu]], where Magellan was killed by Philippine natives in a battle. His second in command, the Spaniard [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], continued the expedition and, on September 6, 1522, arrived at Seville, completing the circumnavigation. [[Charles I of Spain]], in recognition of his feat, gave Elcano a [[coat of arms]] with the motto ''Primus circumdedisti me'' (in Latin, "You went around me first").&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs(2006), "The story of geographical discovery" p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

A circumnavigation alone does not prove that the earth is spherical. It could be cylindric or irregularly globular or one of many other shapes. Still, combined with trigonometric evidence of the form used by Eratosthenes 1,700 years prior, the Magellan expedition removed any reasonable doubt in educated circles in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = ICSE Geography IX|author = RK Jain|publisher = Ratna Sagar|page = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Transglobe Expedition]] (1979–1982) was the first expedition to make a circumpolar circumnavigation, traveling the world "vertically" traversing both of the poles of rotation using only surface transport.

====Ming China====
In the 17th century, the idea of a spherical Earth, now considerably advanced by [[Scientific revolution|Western astronomy]], ultimately spread to [[Ming China]], when [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]], who held high positions as astronomers at the imperial court, successfully challenged the Chinese belief that the Earth was flat and square.&lt;ref name="Jean-Claude Martzloff 69"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/ans/eastm/back/cs11/cs11-4-martzloff.pdf|title=Jean-Claude Martzloff, "Space and Time in Chinese Texts of Astronomy and of Mathematical Astronomy in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries", ''Chinese Science'' 11 (1993–94): 66–92 (69)|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305205943/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/ans/eastm/back/cs11/cs11-4-martzloff.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Cullen (1980)"&gt;Christopher Cullen, “Joseph Needham on Chinese Astronomy”, ''Past and Present'', No. 87. (May, 1980), pp. 39–53 (42 &amp; 49)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Cullen (1976)"&gt;Christopher Cullen, "A Chinese Eratosthenes of the Flat Earth: A Study of a Fragment of Cosmology in Huai Nan Tzu 淮 南 子", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', Vol. 39, No. 1 (1976), pp. 106–127 (107–109)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ge zhi cao'' (格致草) treatise of Xiong Mingyu (熊明遇) published in 1648 showed a printed picture of the Earth as a spherical globe, with the text stating that "the round Earth certainly has no square corners".&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 499"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. pp. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; The text also pointed out that sailing ships could return to their port of origin after circumnavigating the waters of the Earth.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 499"/&gt;

The influence of the map is distinctly Western, as traditional maps of Chinese cartography held the graduation of the sphere at 365.25 degrees, while the Western graduation was of 360 degrees. Also of interest to note is on one side of the world, there is seen towering [[Chinese pagoda]]s, while on the opposite side (upside-down) there were European [[cathedral]]s.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 499"/&gt; The adoption of European astronomy, facilitated by the failure of indigenous astronomy to make progress, was accompanied by a [[sinocentric]] reinterpretation that declared the imported ideas Chinese in origin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;European astronomy was so much judged worth consideration that numerous Chinese authors developed the idea that the Chinese of antiquity had anticipated most of the novelties presented by the missionaries as European discoveries, for example, the rotundity of the Earth and the "heavenly spherical star carrier model." Making skillful use of philology, these authors cleverly reinterpreted the greatest technical and literary works of Chinese antiquity. From this sprang a new science wholly dedicated to the demonstration of the Chinese origin of astronomy and more generally of all European science and technology.&lt;ref name="Jean-Claude Martzloff 69"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although mainstream Chinese science until the 17th century held the view that the earth was flat, square, and enveloped by the [[celestial sphere]], this idea was criticized by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin-dynasty]] scholar [[Yu Xi]] (fl. 307–345), who suggested that the Earth could be either square or round, in accordance with the shape of the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling. (1995) [1959]. ''Science and Civilization in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth'', vol. 3, reprint edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-05801-5}}, pp. 220, 498–499.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan-dynasty]] mathematician [[Li Ye (mathematician)|Li Ye]] (c. 1192–1279) firmly argued that the Earth was spherical, just like the shape of the heavens only smaller, since a square Earth would hinder the movement of the heavens and celestial bodies in his estimation.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling. (1995) [1959]. ''Science and Civilization in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth'', vol. 3, reprint edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-05801-5}}, pp. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th-century ''Ge zhi cao'' treatise also used the same terminology to describe the shape of the Earth that the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern-Han]] scholar [[Zhang Heng]] (78–139 AD) had used to describe the shape of the sun and moon (i.e. that the former was as round as a [[crossbow]] bullet, and the latter was the shape of a ball).&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling. (1995) [1959]. ''Science and Civilization in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth'', vol. 3, reprint edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-05801-5}}, pp. 227, 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement and representation==
{{Main|Geodesy}}
[[Geodesy]], also called geodetics, is the scientific discipline that deals with the measurement and representation of the Earth, its [[gravitation]]al field and geodynamic phenomena ([[polar motion]], Earth [[tide]]s, and crustal motion) in three-dimensional time-varying space.

Geodesy is primarily concerned with positioning and the gravity field and geometrical aspects of their temporal variations, although it can also include the study of Earth's [[magnetic field]]. Especially in the [[German language|German]] speaking world, geodesy is divided into [[geomensuration]] ("Erdmessung" or "höhere Geodäsie"), which is concerned with measuring the Earth on a global scale, and [[Geophysical survey|surveying]] ("Ingenieurgeodäsie"), which is concerned with measuring parts of the surface.

The Earth's shape can be thought of in at least two ways;
* as the shape of the [[geoid]], the mean sea level of the world ocean; or
* as the shape of Earth's land surface as it rises above and falls below the sea.

As the science of [[geodesy]] measured Earth more accurately, the shape of the geoid was first found not to be a perfect sphere but to approximate an [[spheroid|oblate spheroid]], a specific type of [[ellipsoid]]. More recent measurements have measured the geoid to unprecedented accuracy, revealing [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]]s beneath Earth's surface.

'''Stone walls''' are a kind of [[masonry]] construction that has been used for thousands of years.  The first stone walls were constructed by farmers and primitive people by piling loose field stones into a [[dry stone wall]]. Later, [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[plaster]] were used, especially in the construction of [[city wall]]s, [[castle]]s, and other [[fortification]]s before and during the [[Middle Ages]]. These stone walls are spread throughout the world in different forms. One of the best example is the Cyclopean Wall in Rajgir, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travelnewsindia.com/cyclopean-wall-rajgir/|title=The Cyclopean Wall Rajgir|date=2017-03-07|work=Travel News India|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Stone walls are usually made of local materials varying from [[limestone]] and [[flint]] to [[granite]] and [[sandstone]]. However, the quality of building stone varies greatly, both in its endurance to [[weathering]], resistance to [[water]] penetration and in its ability to be worked into regular shapes before construction. Worked stone is usually known as [[ashlar]], and is often used for corners in stone buildings. [[Granite]] is very resistant to weathering, while some limestones are very weak. Other limestones, such as [[Portland stone]], are more weather-resistant.

==Dimensions==
Large structures are usually made of very thick walls, so that castles and cathedrals possess walls which may be up to 12 feet thick. They normally consist of a layered stone exterior and [[rubble]] infill.

[[File:EarthTransit2084.jpg|thumb|Earth and Moon transiting the Sun in 2084, as seen from Mars. Image created using JPL Solar System Simulator&lt;!--In case we reach 2084 and can't get an image :) --&gt;]]
[[File:Earth and Moon from Mars PIA04531.jpg|thumb|Earth and Moon from Mars, as photographed by the [[Mars Global Surveyor]]]]

A '''[[astronomical transit|transit]] of Earth across the Sun as seen from Mars''' takes place when the planet [[Earth]] passes directly between the [[Sun]] and [[Mars]], obscuring a small part of the Sun's disc for an observer on Mars. During a transit, Earth would be visible from Mars as a small black disc moving across the face of the Sun. They occur every 26, 79 and 100 years, and every 1,000 years or so there is an extra 53rd-year transit.

==Conjunctions==
Transits of Earth from Mars usually occur in pairs, with one following the other after 79 years; rarely, there are three in the series. The transits also follow a 284-year cycle, occurring at intervals of 100.5, 79, 25.5, and 79 years; a transit falling on a particular date is usually followed by another transit 284 years later. Transits occurring when Mars is at its [[ascending node]] are in May, those at [[descending node]] happen in November. This cycle corresponds fairly closely to 151 Mars orbits, 284 Earth orbits, and 133 [[synodic period]]s, and is analogous to the cycle of [[transit of Venus|transits of Venus from Earth]], which follow a cycle of 243 years (121.5, 8, 105.5, 8). There are currently four such active series, containing from 8 to 25 transits. A new one is set to begin in 2394. The last series ending was in 1211.

==View from Mars==
No one has ever seen a transit of Earth from Mars, but the next transit will take place on November 10, 2084.&lt;ref name="Mars2084"/&gt; The last such transit took place on May 11, 1984.&lt;ref name="Earth1984"/&gt;

During the event, the [[Moon]] could almost always  also be seen in transit, although due to the distance between Earth and Moon, sometimes one body completes the transit before the other begins (this last occurred in the 1800 transit, and will happen again in 2394).

==View from Earth==
A transit of Earth from Mars corresponds to Mars being perfectly uniformly illuminated at [[astronomical opposition|opposition]] from Earth, its phase being 180.0° without any [[defect of illumination]]. During the 1879 event, this permitted [[Charles Augustus Young]] to attempt a careful measurement of the [[oblateness]] (polar compression) of Mars. He obtained the value 1/219, or 0.0046. This is close to the modern value of 1/154 (many sources will cite somewhat different values, such as 1/193, because even a difference of only a couple of kilometers in the values of Mars' polar and equatorial radii gives a considerably different result).

Much more recently, better measurements of the oblateness of Mars have been made by using [[radar]] from the Earth. Also, better measurements have been made by using artificial satellites that have been put into orbit around Mars, including ''[[Mariner 9]]'', ''[[Viking 1]]'', ''[[Viking 2]]'', and Soviet orbiters, and the more recent orbiters that have been sent from the Earth to Mars.

==In science fiction==
A [[science fiction]] short story published in 1971 by [[Arthur C. Clarke]],  called "Transit of Earth", depicts a doomed astronaut on Mars observing the transit in 1984. This short story was first published in the January 1971 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.

==Grazing and simultaneous transits==
Sometimes Earth only grazes the Sun during a transit. In this case it is possible that in some areas of Mars a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 30 April 1211, and the next such transit will occur on 27 November [[5th millennium|4356]]. It is also possible that a transit of Earth can be seen in some parts of Mars as a partial transit, while in others Earth misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 26 October 664, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December [[6th millennium|5934]].

The simultaneous occurrence of a [[Transit of Venus from Mars|transit of Venus]] and a transit of Earth is extremely rare, and will next occur in the year [[Timeline of the far future#Astronomical events|571,471]].

[[File:Aluminizing tank.jpg|thumb|Aluminising vacuum chamber at [[Mont Mégantic Observatory]] used for re-coating telescope mirrors.]]

'''Vacuum deposition''' is a family of processes used to deposit layers of material atom-by-atom or molecule-by-molecule on a solid surface. These processes operate at pressures well below [[atmospheric pressure]] (i.e., [[vacuum]]). The deposited layers can range from a thickness of one atom up to millimeters, forming freestanding structures. Multiple layers of different materials can be used, for example to form [[optical coating]]s. The process can be qualified based on the vapor source; [[physical vapor deposition]] uses a liquid or solid source and [[chemical vapor deposition]] uses a chemical vapor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1533/9780857094698.1|chapter=Overview of coating technologies|title=Surface Modification by Solid State Processing|pages=1–24|year=2014|last1=Quintino|first1=Luisa|isbn=9780857094681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The vacuum environment may serve one or more purposes:
* reducing the particle density so that the [[mean free path]] for collision is long
* reducing the particle density of undesirable atoms and molecules (contaminants)
* providing a low pressure plasma environment
* providing a means for controlling gas and vapor composition
* providing a means for mass flow control into the processing chamber.

Condensing particles can be generated in various ways:
* thermal evaporation, [[Evaporation (deposition)]]
* [[sputtering]]
* [[cathodic arc deposition|cathodic arc vaporization]]
* [[laser ablation]]
* decomposition of a chemical vapor precursor, [[chemical vapor deposition]]

In reactive deposition, the depositing material reacts either with a component of the gaseous environment (Ti + N → TiN) or with a co-depositing species (Ti + C → TiC). A plasma environment aids in activating gaseous species (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2N) and in decomposition of chemical vapor precursors (SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + 4H). The plasma may also be used to provide ions for vaporization by sputtering or for bombardment of the substrate for sputter cleaning and for bombardment of the depositing material to densify the structure and tailor properties ([[ion plating]]).

== Types ==
When the vapor source is a liquid or solid the process is called [[physical vapor deposition]] (PVD). When the source is a chemical vapor precursor, the process is called [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD). The latter has several variants: ''low-pressure chemical vapor deposition'' (LPCVD), [[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]] (PECVD), and ''plasma-assisted CVD'' (PACVD). Often a combination of PVD and CVD processes are used in the same or connected processing chambers.

== Applications ==
* [[electric current|Electrical conduction]]: [[metallic film]]s, [[Transparent_conducting_film#Transparent_conducting_oxides|transparent conductive oxides]] (TCOs), [[superconducting film]]s &amp; coatings
* [[Semiconductor]] devices: semiconductor films, electrically insulating films
* [[Solar cell]]s.
* Optical films: [[anti-reflective coating]]s, [[filter (optics)|optical filters]]
* Reflective coatings: [[mirror]]s, [[hot mirror]]s
* [[tribology|Tribological]] coating: hard coatings, erosion resistant coatings, solid film lubricants
* [[Energy conservation]] &amp; generation: [[low emissivity]] glass coatings, solar absorbing coatings, mirrors, solar [[thin film]] [[solar cell|photovoltaic cells]], ''smart'' films
* [[Magnetic film]]s: [[magnetic storage|magnetic recording]]
* [[Diffusion barrier]]: [[gas permeation barrier]]s, [[vapor permeation barrier]]s, [[Solid-state physics|solid state]] [[diffusion barrier]]s
* [[Corrosion]] protection:
* [[automotive industry|Automotive]] applications:  lamp reflectors and trim applications
* Vinyl record pressing, manufacture of gold and [[Music recording sales certification|platinum records]]

A thickness of less than one [[micrometre]] is generally called a [[thin film]] while a thickness greater than one micrometre is called a coating.

Compared to the preindustrial era, wildland land fire in the [[conterminous U.S.]] has been reduced 90 percent with proportional reductions in wildland fire emissions. Land use changes ([[agricultur]]e and [[urbanization]]) are responsible for roughly 50 percent of this decrease, and land management decisions (land [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]], [[Wildfire suppression|suppression]] actions, etc.) are responsible for the remainder. [[human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] activities (e.g., [[industrial production]], [[transportation]], [[agriculture]], etc.) today have more than replaced the lost preindustrial wildland fire atmospheric emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Leenhouts, B. 1998.Assessment of biomass burning in the conterminous United States.

The '''World Pantheist Movement''' ('''WPM''') is the world's largest organization of people associated with [[pantheism]], a [[philosophy]] which asserts that [[spirituality]] should be centered on [[nature]]. The WPM promotes [[naturalistic pantheism]]&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Bron|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature|date=2008|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=1441122788|pages=1341–1342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i4mvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1342&amp;lpg=PA134|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WPM grew out of a mailing list started by [[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]] in 1997, arising around his Scientific Pantheism website. An initial group of 15 volunteers worked on a joint statement of agreed beliefs (the Pantheist Credo).&lt;ref name=Credo&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pantheist Credo|url=http://www.pantheism.net/manifest.htm|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WPM officially opened for membership in December 1999.

== Beliefs and practices ==
The official views of the World Pantheist Movement are listed in the nine points of the Belief Statement (see external links).
These are summarized as follows:&lt;ref name=Credo /&gt;
    
* Reverence, awe, wonder and a feeling of unity with Nature and the wider Universe.
* Respect and active care for the rights of all humans and other living beings.
* Celebration of our lives in our bodies on this beautiful earth as a joy and a privilege.
* Realism - acceptance that the external world exists independently of human consciousness or perception.
* Strong naturalism - without belief in supernatural realms, afterlives, beings or forces.
* Respect for reason, evidence and the scientific method as our best ways of understanding nature and the Universe.
* Promotion of religious tolerance, freedom of religion and complete separation of state and religion.

The specific Statement is as follows:&lt;ref name=Credo /&gt;

* 1. We revere and celebrate the Universe as the totality of being, past, present and future. It is self-organizing, ever-evolving and inexhaustibly diverse. Its overwhelming power, beauty and fundamental mystery compel the deepest human reverence and wonder.
* 2. All matter, energy, and life are an interconnected unity of which we are an inseparable part. We rejoice in our existence and seek to participate ever more deeply in this unity through knowledge, celebration, meditation, empathy, love, ethical action and art.
* 3. We are an integral part of Nature, which we should cherish, revere and preserve in all its magnificent beauty and diversity. We should strive to live in harmony with Nature locally and globally. We acknowledge the inherent value of all life, human and non-human, and strive to treat all living beings with compassion and respect.
* 4. All humans are equal centers of awareness of the Universe and nature, and all deserve a life of equal dignity and mutual respect. To this end we support and work towards freedom, democracy, justice, and non-discrimination, and a world community based on peace, sustainable ways of life, full respect for human rights and an end to poverty.
* 5. There is a single kind of substance, energy/matter, which is vibrant and infinitely creative in all its forms. Body and mind are indivisibly united.
* 6. We see death as the return to nature of our elements, and the end of our existence as individuals. The forms of "afterlife" available to humans are natural ones, in the natural world. Our actions, our ideas and memories of us live on, according to what we do in our lives. Our genes live on in our families, and our elements are endlessly recycled in nature.
* 7. We honor reality, and keep our minds open to the evidence of the senses and of science's unending quest for deeper understanding. These are our best means of coming to know the Universe, and on them we base our aesthetic and religious feelings about reality.
* 8. Every individual has direct access through perception, emotion and meditation to ultimate reality, which is the Universe and Nature. There is no need for mediation by priests, gurus or revealed scriptures.
* 9. We uphold the separation of religion and state, and the universal human right of freedom of religion. We recognize the freedom of all pantheists to express and celebrate their beliefs, as individuals or in groups, in any non-harmful ritual, symbol or vocabulary that is meaningful to them.

The WPM encourages wonder and awe at the beauty and mystery of the Universe and fosters the full range of positive emotional responses to life. It promotes ethical principles such as respect for the rights of humans and other living creatures, non-discrimination, justice and peace.

It respects the scientific method as humanity's most accurate approach for deepening its understanding of nature, while accepting that science is a never-ending quest and that some technologies have created massive social and environmental problems. It accepts that there are some questions that science may never answer - such as why anything exists, rather than nothing at all. It does not give any credence to ideas such as a separate soul distinct from the body, or of the consciousness' survival after death, but believes that people achieve a form of immortality through the ongoing effects of their actions, the things they create, others' memories, the legacy of their genes, and the recycling of their elements in nature.

It does not prescribe any particular set of religious practices, instead leaving the matter up to individuals. Pantheistic activity is viewed not as a ritual that must be upheld in order to placate gods and spirits, or to follow rules prescribed in scripture, but rather as an individual expression of one's deep feelings towards Nature and the wider Universe. Among members and friends of the WPM, the most common practices are meditation and close, daily observation of nature. Both of these are sometimes accompanied by the use of natural objects such as pebbles, shells, bark etc. About a quarter of WPM members report using some form of [[pagan]] celebration, but this is done for self-expression and fun, rather than out of literal belief in pagan theologies.

Members and friends may meet in small groups, the format of which varies. Groups may discuss general ideas; watch and discuss relevant (often nature-related) books, or films; share personal experiences; go on nature outings; or participate in nature conservation projects or other forms of community service.

Viewing the recycling of human elements in soil, water, and the atmosphere as a major element of human "immortality," the WPM supports the "natural death" approach. In this context, it seeks to return the elements to the natural cycle in the fastest and most responsible way possible, such as burial in a biodegradable container in nature-reserve type grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naturalizing Death|url=http://www.pantheism.net/pan/free/pan15s.pdf|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization and activities ==
The WPM is governed by a board of 13 directors. Its main forms of activity consist of:
* A Facebook Page with over 162,000 members&lt;ref name=Facebook&gt;{{cite web|title=Pantheism Facebook group|url=http://www.facebook.com/Pantheism?v=wall|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A richly featured social network with over 3,000 members with wide-ranging discussions and interest groups, as well as 34 local forum groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pantheism Forum at Ning|url=http://pantheists.ning.com/|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Its periodical, ''Pan''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public PAN Magazine Issues|url=https://www.scribd.com/pan8009/shelf|publisher=[[Scribd]]|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  explores the possibilities of naturalistic spirituality across a wide range of fields.
* Saving land to be managed in the interests of native wildlife, through direct sponsorship of conservation organizations, member click groups, and a pantheist wildlife reserves scheme. {{convert|300|acre|km2}} have been saved to date.
* A small [[Folding@home]] group that has contributed 204 work units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Team 13161's contributions to Folding@home|url=http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=teampage&amp;teamnum=13161|publisher=Folding@Home|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An associated [[SETI@home]] group that has amassed 2,138,435 credits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Pantheist|url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/team_display.php?teamid=31590|publisher=SETI@Home|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Pantheist Movement symbol is the spiral as seen in the curves of the nautilus shell, or in the spiral arms of a galaxy, showing the link between the cosmic physical (thousands of light years) and the biological. Sometimes the Nautilus spiral alone is used; it embodies the [[Fibonacci series]] and the [[golden ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=Pantheist Art|url=http://www.pantheism.net/pan/free/pan9.pdf|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diversity of beliefs ==
The WPM has a policy of accepting a diversity of language and methods of celebration among its members, although - following large surveys of its website visitors' preferences - it generally avoids overtly theistic or religious language in its official literature. Some members view themselves as [[atheism|atheists]], while others hold [[agnosticism|agnostic]] stances. Some members use [[theism|theistic]] vocabulary, however they do not believe in a thinking [[Creator deity|creator god]], and simply use the word "[[God]]" to describe their feelings of reverence towards Nature and the wider Universe. Some members, while accepting the basic naturalistic beliefs of the WPM, like to combine these with symbols and ceremonies from other traditions, most commonly paganism, philosophical [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]].

The WPM does not interfere with or promote any specific personal choices regarding sexuality or the use of recreational or psychotropic drugs. Similarly, members have a diversity of views on [[vegetarianism]], hunting, non-violence, and many other political, social, and technological issues. All these issues are left to members' understanding of Naturalistic Pantheistic morality and the Belief Statement.

== Relationship to other pantheist organizations ==
[[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]], the World Pantheist Movement founder, was vice president of the [[Universal Pantheist Society]] (UPS) in the mid-1990s, but resigned after becoming skeptical of the possibility of promoting "generic" pantheism given the very wide variety of beliefs held by different types of pantheist (specifically, by those with naturalistic beliefs and those with dualist or idealist beliefs). The WPM has since gained a membership considerably larger than the UPS, along with a wider circle of non-members who participate in its online forum and Facebook pages.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
