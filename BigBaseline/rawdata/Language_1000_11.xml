      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13203">The following is a list of common non-native [[pronounce|pronunciations]] that [[English language|English]] speakers make when trying to speak foreign languages. Many of these are due to transfer of [[phonology|phonological]] rules from English to the new language as well as differences in [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] that they encounter.

This article uses [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] pronunciation. See [[Help:IPA pronunciation key]] and [[IPA chart for English]] for an introduction.

== Esperanto ==
{{See also|Esperanto phonology}}
*While English speakers tend to assimilate {{IPA|/m/}} to {{IPA|[ɱ]}} before {{IPA|/f/}} or {{IPA|/v/}}, as well {{IPA|/n/}} to {{IPA|[ŋ]}} before {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, neither of which occurs in "strictly regular" Esperanto.{{sfnp|Blanke|2001|pp=41, 330–331}} However, since Zamenhof himself recognized [[Esperanto phonology#Assimilation|this type of assimilation]], there is debate over whether this is actually an error.
*Speakers tend to pronounce Esperanto {{IPA|/ɛ/}} as {{IPA|[eɪ]}}, the vowel of ''pay''.{{sfnp|Blanke|2001|p=37}}
*Speakers tend to reduce unstressed vowels.{{sfnp|Blanke|2001|p=38}}
*Speakers tend to pronounce {{IPA|/x/}} as {{IPA|[k]}} or otherwise have a hard time pronouncing it.  This sort of difficulty is behind the gradual shift from {{angbr|ĥ}} to {{angbr|k}} (see [[Esperanto phonology#Loss of phonemic ĥ]]).{{sfnp|Blanke|2001|p=39}}
*Speakers tend to pronounce the [[rhotic consonant]] as {{IPA|[ɹ]}}, rather than an [[alveolar trill]].  Speakers of [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] accents tend to mute the r when at end of a word or before consonant.{{sfnp|Blanke|2001|p=40}}
*Other pronunciation difficulties are related to spelling pronunciations of digraphs. The digraph {{angbr|sc}} represents {{IPA|/st͡s/}}, though speakers may substitute {{IPA|[s]}} or {{IPA|[sk]}}. The digraph {{angbr|kn}} represents {{IPA|/kn/}}, though speakers may mute the {{IPA|/k/}}. The {{angbr|g}} in the digraph {{angbr|ng}} is always pronounced.{{sfnp|Blanke|2001|p=41}}

== German ==
{{See also|Standard German phonology}}
* There are several German vowels that create problems for English speakers:
** One of the most difficult is German {{IPA|/eː/}} as it is further forward in the mouth than in varieties of Standard English so that speakers may pronounce German ''Geht'' as if it were English ''gate''.{{sfnp|Hall|2003|p=81}}
** Similarly, speakers may pronounce German {{IPA|/oː/}} with the vowel of ''goat'' so that ''ohne'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈəʊnə]}}.{{sfnp|Hall|2003|p=91}}
** English speakers tend to have difficulty with the front rounded vowels, {{IPA|/øː/}}, {{IPA|/œ/}}, {{IPA|/yː/}}, and {{IPA|/ʏ/}}{{sfnp|Hall|2003|pp=92-97}} (written {{angbr|ö}} and {{angbr|ü}}).
** Speakers have some difficulty with German {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}}, which may be pronounced as {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[ɑː]}}, respectively.{{sfnp|Hall|2003|pp=85-87}} 
* English speakers also have difficulty with the two sounds represented by ''ch'' ({{IPA|[x]}} and {{IPA|[ç]}}) in German, particularly the latter.{{sfnp|Hall|2003|p=46}} Often both are replaced with {{IPA|[k]}}; replacement of {{IPA|[ç]}} with {{IPA|[ʃ]}} is also common. They also have difficulty with the [[guttural r]] of most German dialects.&lt;ref&gt;http://joycep.myweb.port.ac.uk/pronounce/consonch.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2012}}

== Mandarin Chinese ==
{{see also|Standard Chinese phonology}}
*English speakers have difficulty with the 4 lexical [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] of [[Mandarin Chinese]].{{sfnp|Gottfried|Suiter|1997}}

== Russian ==
{{See also|Russian phonology}}
* Some speakers have difficulty with the trilled {{IPA|[r]}} in Russian, especially the palatalized {{IPA|[rʲ]}} since neither are sounds of English.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=185}}
** Non-rhotic speakers, even after learning the rolled-r, are prone to omit {{IPA|/r/}} in such Russian words as удар {{IPA|[ʊˈdar]}} ('blow') and горка {{IPA|[ˈɡorkə]}} ('hillock').
* Depending on the speaker's dialect, they may have difficulty with "dark l" {{IPA|[ɫ]}} (that is, velarized {{IPA|[l]}}, which in Russian contrasts with a palatalized {{IPA|[lʲ]}}) in positions other than in the syllable coda.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=168}}
* Difficulty with Russian vowels:
** Most English speakers have no {{IPA|[ɨ]}} (although it is an allophone in some dialects, see [[weak vowel merger]]) and speakers generally have difficulty producing the sound.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=33}} They may instead produce {{IPA|[ɪ]}}.
** Speakers may replace {{IPA|/e/}} with the diphthong in ''day''.  e.g. {{IPA|[ˈdeɪlə]}} instead of {{IPA|[ˈdʲelə]}} дело ('affair').{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=41}}
** Speakers are likely to diphthongize {{IPA|/u/}}, making сижу {{IPA|[sʲɪˈʐu]}}  ('I sit') sound more like {{IPA|[sɪˈʒʊu]}}.  Some speakers may also universally front it to {{IPA|[ʉ]}}.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=64}}
** Speakers may also diphthongize {{IPA|/i/}} in a similar fashion, especially in open syllables.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=30}}
** Speakers may have difficulty with Russian {{IPA|/o/}}, pronouncing it as either {{IPA|[ɔ]}} or {{IPA|[oʊ]}}.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=56}}
** It is likely that speakers will make the second element of Russian diphthongs insufficiently close, making them resemble English diphthongs (e.g., {{IPA|[druzʲeɪ]}} instead of {{IPA|[druzʲej]}}) or pronounce it too long.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=75}}
** Speakers may pronounce {{IPA|/a/}} as {{IPA|[æ]}} in closed syllables так ('so') and {{IPA|[ɑ]}} in open syllables два ('two').{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=47}}
* Speakers may also have difficulty with the [[Russian vowel reduction]] system as well as other allophonic vowels.
** Tendency to reverse the distribution of {{IPA|[ɐ]}} and {{IPA|[ə]}}. English speakers tend to pronounce {{IPA|[ə]}} in the pretonic position, right where {{IPA|[ɐ]}} is required in Russian, while they pronounce {{IPA|[ɐ]}} in pre-pretonic positions, where {{IPA|[ə]}} occurs. Thus, speakers may say  голова ('head') as {{IPA|[ɡɐləˈva]}} instead of {{IPA|[ɡəlɐˈva]}} and сторона ('side') as {{IPA|[stɐrəˈna]}} instead of {{IPA|[stərɐˈna]}}.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=55}}
* There are no cues to indicate correct stress in Russian. Speakers must memorize where primary and secondary stress resides in each word and are likely to make mistakes.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=212}}
* Speakers tend to fail to geminate double consonants.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=214}}

== Serbo-Croatian ==
{{See also|Serbo-Croatian phonology}}
* Speakers may have a difficulty with Serbo-Croatian pitch accent and vowel length. This rarely leads to loss of intelligibility as long as the word stress is correct.{{sfnp|Kordić|1997|p=8}}{{sfnp|Alexander|2006|p=4}}
** Speakers may transfer vowel length from English, producing longer vowels before voiced consonants (such as {{IPA|/b/}} or {{IPA|/z/}}) and shorter vowels before the voiceless ones (such as {{IPA|/p/}} or {{IPA|/s/}}) - see [[pre-fortis clipping]]. In Serbo-Croatian, vowels can be long or short in any environment; in fact, there are minimal pairs based only on length: compare ''grad'' {{nowrap|{{IPA|/ɡrâd/}}}} ('city') with ''grad'' {{IPA|/ɡrâːd/}} ('hall').{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=10}}
** If speakers learn to produce correct vowel length, they may diphthongize long {{IPA|/iː, uː, eː, oː/}} to {{IPA|[ɪi, ʊu, eɪ, oʊ]}} instead of the correct {{IPA|[{{IPA link|iː}}, {{IPA link|uː}}, {{IPA link|e̞|eː}}, {{IPA link|o̞|oː}}]}}.{{sfnp|Alexander|2006|p=3}}{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|pp=12, 20}}
* Speakers may incorrectly reduce unstressed vowels to {{IPAblink|ə}}, yielding pronunciations such as {{IPA|[ləpǒtə]}} instead of {{IPA|[lepǒta]}} for ''lepota'' ('beauty'). In Serbo-Croatian, vowels do not change their quality in unstressed positions.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=10}}{{sfnp|Kordić|1997|p=4}}
* Voiced consonants ({{IPA|/b, d, ɡ, dʒ, dʑ, z, ʒ/}}) can be only partially {{IPA|[b̥, d̥, ɡ̊, d̥ʒ̊, d̥ʑ̊, z̥, ʒ̊]}} rather than fully voiced {{IPA|[{{IPA link|b}}, {{IPA link|d̪|d}}, {{IPA link|ɡ}}, {{IPA link|dʐ|dʒ}}, {{IPA link|dʑ}}, {{IPA link|z}}, {{IPA link|ʐ|ʒ}}]}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|pp=30−31}}
** Similarly, {{IPA|/ʋ/}} (which phonologically is an approximant and therefore not the voiced counterpart of {{IPA|/f/}}) can also be realized as a partially voiced fricative {{IPA|[v̥]}} instead of a fully voiced weak fricative {{IPAblink|v|ʋ̝}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=30}}{{sfnp|Morén|2005|pp=5–6}}
* Speakers may incorrectly realize the voiceless stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} as aspirated {{IPA|[pʰ, tʰ, kʰ]}}.{{sfnp|Alexander|2006|p=3}}{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|pp=30−31, 33}}
* Speakers may realize {{IPA|/n, t, d/}} as alveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n}}, {{IPA link|t}}, {{IPA link|d}}]}} rather than dental {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n̪}}, {{IPA link|t̪}}, {{IPA link|d̪}}]}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|pp=31, 34}}
** Speakers may incorrectly transfer allophones of English {{IPA|/t/}} to Serbo-Croatian, yielding pronunciations such as {{IPA|[tʃûɾi]}} instead of {{IPA|[tʃûti]}} for ''čuti'' ('to hear') or {{IPA|[ɲûʔn̩]}} instead of {{IPA|[ɲûtn̩]}} for ''njutn'' ('newton'), all of which sound strange to native ears and might not even be understood as belonging to the {{IPA|/t/}} phoneme, potentially leading to a serious loss of intelligibility.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=31}}
* Speakers may have a difficulty distinguishing {{IPA|/tʃ, dʒ/}} from {{IPA|/tɕ, dʑ/}}. This does not lead to loss of intelligibility as many natives merge them as well.{{sfnp|Kordić|1997|p=5}}{{sfnp|Alexander|2006|pp=3−4}}
** Speakers who try to distinguish {{IPA|/tʃ, dʒ/}} from {{IPA|/tɕ, dʑ/}} may realize the former with inappropriate palatalization, i.e. as palato-alveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|tʃ}}, {{IPA link|dʒ}}]}} instead of flat postalveolar (laminal retroflex) {{IPA|[{{IPA link|tʂ|t̻ʂ̻}}, {{IPA link|dʐ|d̻ʐ̻}}]}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=32}}
** The same applies to {{IPA|/ʃ, ʒ/}}, which can be realized as {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʃ}}, {{IPA link|ʒ}}]}} instead of {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʂ|ʂ̻}}, {{IPA link|ʐ|ʐ̻}}]}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=32}}
* Speakers may realize {{IPA|/x/}} as glottal {{IPAblink|h}}, rather than a weak velar fricative {{IPAblink|x|x̞}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=33}}
* The palatal sounds {{IPA|/ɲ, ʎ/}} may be realized as sequences {{IPA|[nj, lj]}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=34}}
* Instead of a trill {{IPAblink|r}}, {{IPA|/r/}} can be realized as a postalveolar approximant {{IPAblink|ɹ̠}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|pp=32–33}}
* {{IPA|/j/}} preceded within the same word by a vowel (as in ''gaj'' {{IPA|/ɡâːj/}} ('grove')) can be articulated with an insufficiently raised tongue ({{IPA|[ɪ̯]}} instead of {{IPA|[i̯]}} or {{IPAblink|j}}).{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=29}}

Snow|Catherine Snow]] to serve as a central repository for first [[language acquisition]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Database|url=http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/01intro.pdf|accessdate=2015-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922055720/http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/01intro.pdf#|archive-date=2015-09-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its earliest transcripts date from the 1960s, and it now has contents (transcripts, audio, and video) in 26 languages from 130 different corpora, all of which are publicly available worldwide.  Recently, CHILDES has been made into a component of the larger corpus [[TalkBank]], which also includes language data from [[aphasia|aphasics]], [[second language acquisition]], [[conversation analysis]], and classroom language learning.  CHILDES is mainly used for analyzing the language of young children and the child directed speech of adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Corpus linguistics: Investigating language structure and use |first=Douglas |last=Biber |authorlink=Douglas Biber |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=9780521499576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1990s, as computational resources capable of easily manipulating the data volumes found in CHILDES became commonly available, there was a significant increase in the number of studies of child language acquisition that made use of it.  CHILDES is currently directed and maintained by [[Brian MacWhinney]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].

==Database Format==
There are a variety of languages and ages represented in the CHILDES transcripts.  The majority of the transcripts are from spontaneous interactions and conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Database|url=http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/01intro.pdf|accessdate=2015-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922055720/http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/01intro.pdf#|archive-date=2015-09-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The transcriptions are coded in the CHAT (Codes for the Human Analysis of Transcripts) transcription format, which provides a standardized format for producing conversational transcripts. This system can be used to transcribe conversations with any type of language learner: children, second-language learners, and recovering aphasics.  In addition to discourse level transcription, the CHAT system also has options for [[phonological]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] analysis.  The [[CLAN program]] was developed by Leonid Spektor and aids in transcription and analysis of the child language data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CHILDES Project: Tools for Analyzing Talk|url=http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/chat.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220000723/http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/manuals/chat.pdf|archivedate=2009-02-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:漢字文化圈／汉字文化圈 · 한자 문화권 · Vòng văn hóa chữ Hán · 漢字文化圏.svg|thumb|CJKV characters derived from Ancient Chinese characters. Left to right: Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese.]]

In [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]], '''CJK''' is a collective term for the [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]] languages, all of which include [[Chinese characters]] and derivatives (collectively, '''CJK characters''') in their writing systems. Occasionally, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] is included, making the abbreviation '''CJKV''', since Vietnamese historically used Chinese characters as well. Collectively, the CJKV characters often include ''[[hànzì]]'' in [[Written Chinese|Chinese]], ''[[kanji]]'', ''[[kana]]'' in [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]], ''[[hanja]]'', ''[[hangul]]'' in [[Korean language#Writing system|Korean]], and ''[[hán tự]]'' or ''[[chữ nôm]]'' in [[Vietnamese language#Writing system|Vietnamese]].

== Character repertoire ==
Chinese is written almost exclusively in Chinese characters. It requires over 3,000 characters for general [[literacy]], but up to 40,000 characters for reasonably complete coverage. Japanese uses fewer characters — general literacy in Japanese can be expected with 1,945 characters. The use of Chinese characters in Korea is becoming increasingly rare, although idiosyncratic use of Chinese characters in proper names requires knowledge (and therefore availability) of many more characters.  However, even today, students in South Korea are taught 1,800 characters.

Other scripts used for these languages, such as [[bopomofo]] and the [[Latin script|Latin]]-based [[pinyin]] for Chinese, [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] for Japanese, and [[hangul]] for Korean, are not strictly "CJK characters", although CJK character sets almost invariably include them as necessary for full coverage of the target languages.

Until the early 20th century, [[Literary Chinese]] was the written language of government and scholarship in Vietnam. Popular literature in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] was written in the ''[[chữ Nôm]]'' script, consisting of borrowed Chinese characters together with many characters created locally. By the end of the 1920s, both scripts had been replaced by writing in Vietnamese using the Latin-based [[Vietnamese alphabet]].{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=113–115}}{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1997}}

The [[Sinology|sinologist]] Carl Leban (1971) produced an early survey of CJK encoding systems.

== Encoding ==
The number of characters required for complete coverage of all these languages' needs cannot fit in the 256-character code space of 8-bit [[character encoding]]s, requiring at least a 16-bit fixed width encoding or multi-byte variable-length encodings. The 16-bit fixed width encodings, such as those from [[Unicode]] up to and including version 2.0, are now deprecated due to the requirement to encode more characters than a 16-bit encoding can accommodate—Unicode 5.0 has some 70,000 Han characters—and the requirement by the Chinese government that software in China support the [[GB 18030]] character set.

Although CJK encodings have common character sets, the encodings often used to represent them have been developed separately by different East Asian governments and software companies, and are mutually incompatible. [[Unicode]] has attempted, with some controversy, to unify the character sets in a process known as [[Han unification]].

CJK character encodings should consist minimally of Han characters plus language-specific phonetic scripts such as [[pinyin]], [[bopomofo]], hiragana, katakana and hangul.

CJK character encodings include:
*[[Big5]] (the most prevalent encoding before Unicode was implemented)
*[[Chinese Character Code for Information Interchange|CCCII]]
*[[CNS 11643]] (official standard of [[Republic of China (Taiwan)|Republic of China]])
*[[EUC-JP]]
*[[EUC-KR]]
*[[GB2312]] (subset and predecessor of GB18030)
*[[GB18030]] (mandated standard in the [[People's Republic of China]])
*Giga Character Set (GCS)
*[[ISO 2022|ISO 2022-JP]]
*KS C 5861
*[[Shift-JIS]]
*[[TRON (encoding)|TRON]]
*[[Unicode]]

The CJK character sets take up the bulk of the assigned [[Unicode]] code space. There is much controversy among Japanese experts of Chinese characters about the desirability and technical merit of the [[Han unification]] process used to map multiple Chinese and Japanese character sets into a single set of unified characters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

All three languages can be written both [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|left-to-right and top-to-bottom]] (right-to-left and top-to-bottom in ancient documents), but are usually considered left-to-right scripts when discussing encoding issues.

==Legal status==
Libraries cooperated on encoding standards for [[JACKPHY]] characters in the early 1980s.  According to [[Ken Lunde]], the abbreviation "CJK" was a registered [[trademark]] of [[Research Libraries Group]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cjk.inf Ken Lunde, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; (which merged with [[OCLC]] in 2006).   The trademark owned by OCLC between 1987 and 2009 has now expired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trademarks.justia.com/736/38/cjk-73638777.html Justia listing]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognitive science]] and [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistic theory]] have played an important role in providing empirical research into the [[writing process]] and serving the teaching of composition. As composition theories, there is some dispute concerning the appropriateness of tying these two schools of thought together into one theory of [[Composition studies|composition]]. However, their empirical basis for research and ties to the process theory of composition and cognitive science can be thought to warrant  some connection.

==Theoretical construct==
The cognitive theory of composition (hereafter referred to as “cognitive theory”) can trace its roots to psychology and cognitive science. [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s and [[Jean Piaget]]'s contributions to the theories of cognitive development and developmental psychology could be found in early work linking these sciences with composition theory (see [[Ann E. Berthoff]]).  [[Linda Flower]] and [[John Hayes (cognitive scientist)|John Hayes]] published “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing” in 1981, providing the groundwork for further research into how thought processes influence the writing process.

[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] theories of composition found their roots in the debate surrounding [[grammar]]'s importance in composition pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Hartwell, Patrick. "Grammar, Grammars, and the Teaching of Grammar." [[College English]] 47.2 (1985): 105-127. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars, such as [[Janet Emig]], [[Patrick Hartwell]], [[Martha J. Kolln]], Robert Funk, [[Stephen Witte]], and [[Lester Faigley]] continued this line of thought around the same time that a cognitive theory of composition was being developed by Flower and Hayes. These scholars, like scholars researching cognitive-oriented composition theory, focused on research providing insight into the writing process, but were also committed to providing pedagogical advancements addressing deficiencies, trends, and insights gained from their linguistic research.

==Research==

===Cognitive Theory===
A cognitive theory is focused on gaining insight into the writing process through the writer’s thought processes. Composition theorists have attacked the problem of accessing writers’ thoughts in various ways. Flower and Hayes’  essay, “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing” sought to outline the writer’s choice-making throughout the writing process, and how those choices constrained or influenced other choices down the line.&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Linda, and John R. Hayes. "A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing." College Composition and Communication 32.4 (1981): 365-387. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has focused on capturing the cognitive processes of writers during the writing process through note-taking or speaking aloud,&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, Anne M., and Barbara M. Sitko. Hearing Ourselves Think: Cognitive Research in the College Writing Classroom. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; while some early research by Birdwell, Nancrow, and Ross was done with computers to record writers’ keystrokes during the writing process.

===Applied Linguistics===
Linguistic composition theory has traditionally focused on sentence and paragraph-level composition, with the goal of providing instructors insights into the way students write at various proficiency levels. Stephen Witte and Lester Faigley&lt;ref&gt;Faigley, Lester, and Stephen P. Witte. "Coherence, Cohesion, and Writing Quality." College Composition and Communication 32.2 (1981): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; utilized detailed [[syntactic]] analysis to redefine the importance of [[cohesion (linguistics)|cohesion]] and [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]] in judging writing quality. Paul Rodgers&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, Paul Jr. C. "A Discourse-centered Rhetoric of the Paragraph." College Composition and Communication 17.1 (1966): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Braddock&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, Richard. "The Frequency and Placement of Topic Sentences in Expository Prose." Research in the Teaching of English 8.3 (1974): 2-11. Rpt. in Cross-talk in Comp Theory: A Reader. Victor Villanueva. Urbana, IL: National Council of Teachers of English, 1997. 153-166.&lt;/ref&gt; focused on paragraph structure, in separate studies, in order to dispel common misjudgments about the importance of traditional paragraph structure.

Applied linguistics, specifically [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL/ESL]] studies, has played a large role in development linguistic theories of composition. Liz Hamp-Lyons’ research in ESL/EFL [[writing assessment]] is valuable in informing ESL composition pedagogy. [[Paul Kei Matsuda]],&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul Kei. "Composition Studies and ESL Writing: A Disciplinary Division of Labor." College Composition and Communication 50.4 (1999): 699-721.&lt;/ref&gt;  has illustrated the deficiency in ESL composition research, and recent compilations by Matsuda and others&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul Kei, Michelle Cox, and Jay Jordan. Second-language Writing in the Composition Classroom: A Critical Sourcebook. New York: Bedford / St. Martin's, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; have attempted to bridge the gap between ESL instruction and composition theory by presenting pedagogical, theoretical, and assessment frameworks in the ESL composition classroom.

==Pedagogy==
Cognitive and linguistic theories of composition are heavily tied to [[process theory]]. Cognitive and linguistic theories have been instrumental in providing respected empirical research to the field of [[Composition studies|composition theory]], but tend to stay away from making pedagogical suggestions. Instead, research in these fields is typically intended to inform process theory by providing data analysis regarding the writing process, and by bringing scientific research to the field.

'''Complete Feedback''' is one of [[Charles Hockett]]'s 16 [[Design features of language]] which states that speakers are able to hear what they are saying. Through their auditory channels they are able to receive feedback on what they are vocalizing.&lt;ref&gt;Saxton, Matthew. "Child Language: acquisition and development". Sage Publications, 2010, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Concatenation theory''', also called '''string theory''', '''character-string theory''', or '''theoretical [[syntax]]''', studies [[String (computer science)|character strings]] over finite alphabets of characters, signs, symbols, or marks. String theory is foundational for formal linguistics, computer science, logic, and metamathematics especially proof theory.&lt;ref&gt;John Corcoran and Matt Lavine, "Discovering string theory". ''Bulletin of Symbolic Logic''. 19 (2013) 253–4.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[generative grammar]] can be seen as a recursive definition in string theory.

The most basic operation on strings is [[concatenation]]; connect two strings to form a longer string whose length is the sum of the lengths of those two strings. ABCDE is the concatenation of AB with CDE, in symbols ABCDE = AB ^ CDE. Strings, and concatenation of strings can be treated as an algebraic system with some properties resembling those of the addition of integers; in modern mathematics, this system is called a [[free monoid]].

In 1956 [[Alonzo Church]] wrote: "Like any branch of mathematics, theoretical syntax may, and ultimately must, be studied by the axiomatic method".&lt;ref&gt;Alonzo Church, ''Introduction to Mathematical Logic'', Princeton UP, Princeton, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Church was evidently unaware that string theory already had two axiomatizations from the 1930s: one by [[:de:Hans Hermes|Hans Hermes]] and one by [[Alfred Tarski]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]], William Frank and Michael Maloney, "String theory", ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'', vol. 39 (1974) pp. 625&amp;ndash; 637&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, the first English presentation of Tarski’s 1933 axiomatic foundations of string theory appeared in 1956 – the same year that Church called for such axiomatizations.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 173&amp;ndash;4 of Alfred Tarski, ''The concept of truth in formalized languages'', reprinted in ''Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics'', Hackett, Indianapolis, 1983, pp. 152–278&lt;/ref&gt; As Tarski himself noted using other terminology, serious difficulties arise if strings are construed as tokens rather than types in the sense of [[Pierce's type-token distinction]], not to be confused with similar distinctions underlying other [[type-token distinction]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7353">The '''Consorzio ICoN''' is an interuniversity consortium for [[Italian Studies]] established in 1999. It consists of 21 Italian universities and focuses on [[philology]] and [[cultural studies]]. The consortium is based and administrated at the [[University of Pisa]] and is supported by the Italian [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|Ministry of University and Research]] (''Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca''). It aims at diffusing Italian language, culture and literature.

== Participants ==

* [[University of Trento]] (Università degli Studi di Trento)
* [[University of Turin]] (Università degli Studi di Torino)
* [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]] (Università "Cà Foscari" di Venezia)

== Bachelor's degree ==

The [[University of Pisa]], in collaboration with the consortium, offers a [[bachelor's degree]] program in Italian [[philology]] and [[cultural studies]] (Corso di laurea triennale in ''Lingua e cultura italiana per stranieri'') for foreigners and expatriates, based on [[distance education]] and [[e-learning]]. The program refers to the bachelor's degree class L-10 (literary studies) and offers four majors in

* [[linguistics]] and [[didactics]],
* [[literature]],
* [[arts]] and
* [[history]] and [[culture]].

Exams are carried out at institutions in the country of residence (partner universities, Italian embassies). The title will be issued by the administrative university, actually Pisa, mentioning all participating universities. As Italy is part of [[European Higher Education Area]], the program has a value of 180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] points and permits to participate in a [[Master's degree]] program.

== Master's degrees ==

The ICoN consortium organizes three [[executive master's degree]]s (60 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]) in the field of Italian studies. They consist of phases of attendance, distance education and e-learning. The offer includes

* [[Translation|Specialized translation]] (English–Italian), issued by the Universities of [[University of Pisa|Pisa]], [[University of Bari|Bari]] and [[University of Genoa|Genoa]]
* [[Didactics]] of Italian language and literature, issued by the Foreigner Universities of [[University for Foreigners Perugia|Perugia]] and [[Foreigners University of Siena|Siena]]
* [[Cultural heritage management]], issued by the [[University of Parma]]

== Language courses ==

The consortium ICoN also offers language courses and programs in written Italian at distinct levels. For native English speakers special packages have been designed in collaboration with the [[National Italian American Foundation]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California]]'s department of Italian. The courses have been awarded with the [[European Commission]]'s ''European Language Label''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14023">In [[formal language theory]], a  '''context-free language''' ('''CFL''') is a [[formal language|language]] generated by a [[context-free grammar]] (CFG).

Context-free languages have many applications in [[programming languages]], in particular, most arithmetic expressions are generated by context-free grammars.

==Background==

===Context-free grammar===

Different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language. Intrinsic properties of the language can be distinguished from extrinsic properties of a particular grammar by comparing multiple grammars that describe the language.

===Automata===

The set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by [[pushdown automata]], which makes these languages amenable to parsing. Further, for a given CFG, there is a direct way to produce a pushdown automaton for the grammar (and thereby the corresponding language), though going the other way (producing a grammar given an automaton) is not as direct.

==Examples==

A model context-free language is &lt;math&gt;L = \{a^nb^n:n\geq1\}&lt;/math&gt;, the language of all non-empty even-length strings, the entire first halves of which are {{mvar|a}}'s, and the entire second halves of which are {{mvar|b}}'s. {{mvar|L}} is generated by the grammar &lt;math&gt;S\to aSb ~|~ ab&lt;/math&gt;.
This language is not [[regular language|regular]].
It is accepted by the [[pushdown automaton#Formal definition|pushdown automaton]] &lt;math&gt;M=(\{q_0,q_1,q_f\}, \{a,b\}, \{a,z\}, \delta, q_0, z, \{q_f\})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:&lt;ref group=note&gt;meaning of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;'s arguments and results: &lt;math&gt;\delta(\mathrm{state}_1, \mathrm{read}, \mathrm{pop}) = (\mathrm{state}_2, \mathrm{push})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\delta(q_0, a, z) &amp;= (q_0, az) \\
\delta(q_0, a, a) &amp;= (q_0, aa) \\
\delta(q_0, b, a) &amp;= (q_1, \varepsilon) \\
\delta(q_1, b, a) &amp;= (q_1, \varepsilon) \\
\delta(q_1, \varepsilon, z) &amp;= (q_f, \varepsilon)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Unambiguous CFLs are a proper subset of all CFLs: there are [[Inherently ambiguous language|inherently ambiguous]] CFLs. An example of an inherently ambiguous CFL is the union of &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^m c^m d^n | n, m &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^m d^m | n, m &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt;. This set is context-free, since the union of two context-free languages is always context-free. But there is no way to unambiguously parse strings in the (non-context-free) subset &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^n d^n | n &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; which is the intersection of these two languages.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=100|loc=Theorem 4.7}}

===Dyck language===

The [[Dyck language|language of all properly matched parentheses]] is generated by the grammar &lt;math&gt;S\to SS ~|~ (S) ~|~ \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==

===Context-free parsing===
{{main|Parsing}}

The context-free nature of the language makes it simple to parse with a pushdown automaton.

Determining an instance of the [[membership problem]]; i.e. given a string &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, determine whether &lt;math&gt;w \in L(G)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the language generated by a given grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;; is also known as ''recognition''. Context-free recognition for [[Chomsky normal form]] grammars was shown by Leslie G. Valiant to be reducible to boolean [[matrix multiplication]], thus inheriting its complexity upper bound of [[Big O notation|''O'']](''n''&lt;sup&gt;2.3728639&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport| author=Leslie Valiant| title=General context-free recognition in less than cubic time|date=Jan 1974| pages=11| institution=Carnegie Mellon University| url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2751&amp;context=compsci}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Leslie G. Valiant| title=General context-free recognition in less than cubic time| journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences| year=1975| volume=10| number=2| pages=308–315| doi=10.1016/s0022-0000(75)80046-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In Valiant's papers, ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2.81&lt;/sup&gt;) given, the then best known upper bound. See [[Matrix multiplication#Algorithms for efficient matrix multiplication]] and [[Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm]] for bound improvements since then.&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, Lillian Lee has shown ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3−ε&lt;/sup&gt;) boolean matrix multiplication to be reducible to ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3−3ε&lt;/sup&gt;) CFG parsing, thus establishing some kind of lower bound for the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Lillian Lee| title=Fast Context-Free Grammar Parsing Requires Fast Boolean Matrix Multiplication| journal=J ACM| year=2002| volume=49| number=1| pages=1–15| url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/papers/bmmcfl-jacm.pdf| doi=10.1145/505241.505242| arxiv=cs/0112018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical uses of context-free languages require also to produce a derivation tree that exhibits the  structure that the grammar associates with the given string. The process of producing this tree is called ''[[parsing]]''. Known parsers have a time complexity that is cubic in the size of the string that is parsed.

Formally, the set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown automata (PDA). Parser algorithms for context-free languages include the [[CYK algorithm]] and [[Earley parser|Earley's Algorithm]].

A special subclass of context-free languages are the [[deterministic context-free language]]s which are defined as the set of languages accepted by a [[deterministic pushdown automaton]] and can be parsed by a [[LR parser|LR(k) parser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Knuth | first1 = D.

===Closure===
Context-free languages are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the following operations. That is, if ''L'' and ''P'' are context-free languages, the following languages are context-free as well:
*the [[union (set theory)|union]] &lt;math&gt;L \cup P&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' and ''P''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.1}}
*the reversal of ''L''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142|loc=Exercise 6.4d}}
*the [[concatenation]] &lt;math&gt;L \cdot P&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' and ''P''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.1}}
*the [[Kleene star]] &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt; of ''L''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.1}}
*the image &lt;math&gt;\varphi(L)&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' under a [[String operations#String homomorphism|homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131-132|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.2}}
*the image &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}(L)&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' under an [[String operations#String homomorphism|inverse homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=132|loc=Theorem 6.3}}
*the [[circular shift#Applications|circular shift]] of ''L'' (the language &lt;math&gt;\{vu : uv \in L \}&lt;/math&gt;){{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142-144|loc=Exercise 6.4c}}
*the prefix closure of ''L'' (the set of all [[Prefix (computer science)|prefix]]es of strings from ''L''){{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142|loc=Exercise 6.4b}}
*the [[Quotient of a formal language|quotient]] ''L''/''R'' of ''L'' by a regular language ''R''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142|loc=Exercise 6.4a}}

====Nonclosure under intersection, complement, and difference====
The context-free languages are not closed under intersection.  This can be seen by taking the languages &lt;math&gt;A = \{a^n b^n c^m \mid m, n \geq 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = \{a^m b^n c^n \mid m,n \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, which are both context-free.&lt;ref group=note&gt;A context-free grammar for the language ''A'' is given by the following production rules, taking ''S'' as the start symbol: ''S'' → ''Sc'' | ''aTb'' | ''ε''; ''T'' → ''aTb'' | ''ε''. The grammar for ''B'' is analogous.&lt;/ref&gt; Their intersection is &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \{ a^n b^n c^n \mid n \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, which can be shown to be non-context-free by the [[pumping lemma for context-free languages]]. As a consequence, context-free languages cannot be closed under complementation, as for any languages ''A'' and ''B'', their intersection can be expressed by union and complement:  &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \overline{\overline{A} \cup \overline{B}} &lt;/math&gt;. In particular, context-free language cannot be closed under difference, since complement can be expressed by difference: &lt;math&gt;\overline{L} = \Sigma^* \setminus L&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Scheinberg.1960"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82210847.pdf | author=Stephen Scheinberg | title=Note on the Boolean Properties of Context Free Languages | journal=Information and Control | volume=3 | number= | pages=372&amp;ndash;375 | month= | year=1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, if ''L'' is a context-free language and ''D'' is a regular language then both their intersection &lt;math&gt;L\cap D&lt;/math&gt; and their difference &lt;math&gt;L\setminus D&lt;/math&gt; are context-free languages.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Decidability===
In formal language theory, questions about regular languages are usually decidable, but ones about context-free languages are often not. It is decidable whether such a language is finite, but not whether it contains every possible string, is regular, is unambiguous, or is equivalent to a language with a different grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1138|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following problems are [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] for arbitrarily given [[context-free grammar]]s A and B:
*Equivalence: is &lt;math&gt;L(A)=L(B)&lt;/math&gt;?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.12(1)}}
*Disjointness: is &lt;math&gt;L(A) \cap L(B) = \emptyset &lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=202|loc=Theorem 8.10}} However, the intersection of a context-free language and a ''regular'' language is context-free,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Salomaa|1973}}, p. 59, Theorem 6.7&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=135|loc=Theorem 6.5}} hence the variant of the problem where ''B'' is a regular grammar is decidable (see "Emptiness" below).
*Containment: is &lt;math&gt;L(A) \subseteq L(B)&lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.12(2)}} Again, the variant of the problem where ''B'' is a regular grammar is decidable,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} while that where ''A'' is regular is generally not.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.12(4)}}
*Universality: is &lt;math&gt;L(A)=\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.11}}

The following problems are ''decidable'' for arbitrary context-free languages:
*Emptiness: Given a context-free grammar ''A'', is &lt;math&gt;L(A) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=137|loc=Theorem 6.6(a)}}
*Finiteness: Given a context-free grammar ''A'', is &lt;math&gt;L(A)&lt;/math&gt; finite?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=137|loc=Theorem 6.6(b)}}
*Membership: Given a context-free grammar ''G'', and  a word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, does &lt;math&gt;w \in L(G)&lt;/math&gt; ? Efficient polynomial-time algorithms for the membership problem are the [[CYK algorithm]] and [[Earley parser|Earley's Algorithm]].

According to Hopcroft, Motwani, Ullman (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John E. Hopcroft |author2=Rajeev Motwani |author3=Jeffrey D. Ullman | title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation| year=2003| publisher=Addison Wesley}} Here: Sect.7.6, p.304, and Sect.9.7, p.411&lt;/ref&gt; 
many of the fundamental closure and (un)decidability properties of context-free languages were shown in the 1961 paper of Bar-Hillel, Perles, and Shamir&lt;ref name="Bar-Hillel.Perles.Shamir.1961"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yehoshua Bar-Hillel |author2=Micha Asher Perles |author3=Eli Shamir | title=On Formal Properties of Simple Phrase-Structure Grammars| journal=Zeitschrift für Phonetik, Sprachwissenschaft und Kommunikationsforschung| year=1961| volume=14| number=2| pages=143–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages that are not context-free===

The set &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^n d^n | n &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[context-sensitive language]], but there does not exist a context-free grammar generating this language.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}} So there exist context-sensitive languages which are not context-free. To prove that a given language is not context-free, one may employ the [[pumping lemma for context-free languages]]&lt;ref name="Bar-Hillel.Perles.Shamir.1961"/&gt; or a number of other methods, such as [[Ogden's lemma]] or [[Parikh's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/265/how-to-prove-that-a-language-is-not-context-free How to prove that a language is not context-free?]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44469">'''Developmental language disorder''' ('''DLD''') is identified when a child has problems with language development that continue into school age and beyond. The language problems have a significant impact on everyday social interactions or educational progress, and occur in the absence of [[autism spectrum]] disorder, [[intellectual disability]] or a known biomedical condition. The most obvious problems are difficulties in using words and sentences to express meanings, but for many children, understanding of language (receptive language) is also a challenge, although this may not be evident unless the child is given a formal assessment.

==Classification==
===Terminology===
The term '''developmental language disorder''' ('''DLD''') was endorsed in a consensus study involving a panel of experts (CATALISE Consortium) in 2017...&lt;ref name=Bishop2017&gt;Bishop, D. V. M., Snowling, M. J., Thompson, P. A., Greenhalgh, T., &amp; The CATALISE Consortium. (2017). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.12721/abstract Phase 2 of CATALISE: a multinational and multidisciplinary Delphi consensus study of problems with language development: Terminology]. Journal of Child Psychology &amp; Psychiatry. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0158753
&lt;/ref&gt; The study was conducted in response to concerns that a wide range of terminology was used in this area, with the consequence that there was poor communication, lack of public recognition, and in some cases children were denied access to services. Developmental language disorder is a subset of language disorder, which is itself a subset of the broader category of speech, language and communication needs (SLCN).

The terminology for children’s language disorders has been extremely wide-ranging and confusing, with many labels that have overlapping but not necessarily identical meanings.&lt;ref name=Bishop2014&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (2014). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1460-6984.12101/abstract Ten questions about terminology for children with unexplained language problems]. International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders, 49(4), 381-415. doi:10.1111/1460-6984.12101
&lt;/ref&gt; In part this confusion reflected uncertainty about the boundaries of DLD, and the existence of different subtypes. Historically, the terms ‘’developmental dysphasia’’ or ‘’developmental aphasia’’ were used to describe children with the clinical picture of DLD.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, T. T. S., &amp; Reid, J. F. (1956). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2011959/ Developmental aphasia observed in a department of child psychiatry]. Archives of Disease in Childhood, 31, 161-172. 
&lt;/ref&gt; These terms have, however, largely been abandoned, as they suggest parallels with adult acquired [[aphasia]]. This is misleading, as DLD is not caused by brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;Rapin, I. (1996). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1996.tb01456.x/abstract Developmental language disorders: a clinical update]. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 37, 643-655. doi:10.1111/j.1469-7610.1996.tb01456.x
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term DLD has been used for many years, it has been less common than the term [[Specific language impairment]] (SLI),&lt;ref name=Bishop2014 /&gt; which has been widely adopted, especially in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, L. B. (1991). [http://lshss.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1777973 Specific language impairment as a clinical category]. Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools, 22, 66-68. doi:10.1044/0161-1461.2202.66&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of SLI overlaps with DLD, but was rejected by the CATALISE panel because it was seen as overly restrictive in implying that the child had relatively pure problems with language in the absence of any other impairments. Children with such selective problems are relatively rare, and there is no evidence that they respond differently to intervention, or have different causal factors, from other children with language problems.&lt;ref name=Bishop2016&gt;Bishop, D. V. M., Snowling, M. J., Thompson, P. A., Greenhalgh, T., &amp; The CATALISE Consortium. (2016). [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158753 CATALISE: a multinational and multidisciplinary Delphi consensus study]. Identifying language impairments in children. PLOS One, 11(7), e0158753. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0158753
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK education system the term '''Speech, Language and Communication Needs (SLCN)''' is widely used, but this is far broader than DLD, and includes children with speech, language and social communication difficulties arising from a wide range of causes.&lt;ref&gt;Bercow, J. (2008). [http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/bercowreview The Bercow Report: A Review of Services for Children and Young People (0-19) with Speech, Language and Communication Needs]. Nottingham: DCSF Publications. However, the UK special educational needs system uses SLCN in a manner which is more similar to DLD.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of whether to refer to children's language problems as ‘disorder’ was a topic of debate among the CATALISE consortium, but the conclusion was that ‘disorder’ conveyed the serious nature and potential consequences of persistent language deficits. It is also parallel with other neurodevelopmental conditions and consistent with diagnostic frameworks such as [[DSM5]] and [[ICD-11]].&lt;ref name=Bishop2017 /&gt; Where there are milder or more transient difficulties, language difficulties may be a more appropriate term.

===Types of language difficulty===
DLD can affect a range of areas of language and the degree of impairment in different areas of language can vary from child to child.&lt;ref&gt;van Weerdenburg, M., Verhoeven, L., &amp; van Balkom, H. (2006). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01454.x/abstract Towards a typology of specific language impairment]. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 47(2), 176-189. 
&lt;/ref&gt; However, although there have been attempts to define different subtypes, these have not generally resulted in robust categories.&lt;ref&gt;Conti-Ramsden, G., &amp; Botting, N. (1999). [http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781170 Classification of children with specific language impairment: Longitudinal considerations]. Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research, 42(5), 1195-1204. 
&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendation of the CATALISE panel was that the specific areas of impairment should be assessed and documented for individual children, while recognizing that different children might have different combinations of problems. The areas which can be affected are:
* [[Grammar]] – This involves the ability to combine words into grammatically correct sentences (syntax) and to combine parts of words together (morphology) such as adding grammatical endings to verbs like –ing or –ed or to add prefixes and suffixes like dis- or –ation. For instance, a child may say 'me jump here', instead of 'I jumped here'.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, L. B. (2014). Children with specific language impairment, 2nd edition. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; Comprehension of sentences can also be affected. For instance, there may be difficulty understanding meaning expressed by word order, and so confusion about what is blue in a sentence like 'the pencil on the shoe is blue',&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (1982). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1982.tb00045.x/abstract Comprehension of spoken, written and signed sentences in childhood language disorders]. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 23, 1-20. 
&lt;/ref&gt; and a tendency to use general knowledge rather than linguistic cues to meaning,&lt;ref&gt;Paul, R. (1990). [http://journals.lww.com/topicsinlanguagedisorders/citation/1990/06000/comprehension_strategies__interactions_between.7.aspx Comprehension strategies: interactions between world knowledge and the development of sentence comprehension]. Topics in Language Disorders, 10(3), 63-75. 
&lt;/ref&gt; or problems in interpreting grammatical markers of number or tense.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, L. B., &amp; Deevy, P. (2010). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3640588/|Tense and aspect in sentence interpretation by children with specific language impairment]. Journal of Child Language, 37(2), 395-418. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Semantics]] – This refers to children’s ability to understand the meaning of words and how meanings are expressed by combining words together. Children with DLD often have limited vocabulary and may make heavy use of a small set of words with rather general meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, M. L., &amp; Bode, J. V. (1993). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/014272379301303707 GAPS in the verb lexicons of children with specific language impairment]. First Language, 13(37), 113-131. doi:10.1177/014272379301303707
&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Word finding – Children with word finding difficulties may know a word, but have difficulty accessing it for production&lt;ref&gt;German, D. J. (1992 ). [http://journals.lww.com/topicsinlanguagedisorders/citation/1992/11000/word_finding_intervention_for_children_and.6.aspx Word finding intervention for children and adolescents]. Topics in Language Disorders, 13, 33-50. 
&lt;/ref&gt; - similar to the [[Tip of the tongue]] phenomenon.
* [[Pragmatics]] - Pragmatics refers to the ability to select the appropriate message, or interpret what others say, in relation to context. Pragmatic difficulties can give an impression of oddity, with the content of language not fitting the environmental or social context; comprehension may be over-literal; the child may chatter incessantly, be poor at turn-taking in conversation and maintaining a topic &lt;ref&gt;Adams, C. (2001). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/lcd.36.3.289.305/abstract Clinical diagnostic and intervention studies of children with semantic-pragmatic language disorder]. International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders, 36, 289-305. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse]] – Discourse refers to a level of organisation of language beyond the sentence. Child with limitations in this domain may have limited ability to tell a story or describe a set of events in a logical sequence &lt;ref&gt;Van der Lely, H. K. J. (1997). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9154015 Narrative discourse in Grammatical specific language impairment: a modular language deficit?] Journal of Child Language, 24, 221-256. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Verbal memory]] and learning – Problems with remembering words or sentences can affect both the learning of new vocabulary,&lt;ref&gt;Gathercole, S. (1993). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/026565909300900302 Word learning in language impaired children]. Child Language Teaching and Therapy, 9, 187-199. doi:10.1177/026565909300900302
&lt;/ref&gt; and the understanding of long or complex sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, J. (2002). [http://journals.lww.com/topicsinlanguagedisorders/Abstract/2002/05000/Information_Processing_and_Language_Comprehension.7.aspx Information processing and language comprehension in children with specific language impairment]. Topics in Language Disorders, 22, 62-84. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phonology]] – Phonology is the branch of linguistics concerned with the way sounds are combined together in words. Children with difficulties with phonology may fail to distinguish between certain speech sounds, such as 't' and 'k', so that 'cake' is produced as 'tate'. Such difficulties are not unusual as part of typical development in toddlers, but they would usually resolve by the time children are 4–5 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Rvachew, S., &amp; Brosseau-Lapre, F. (2012). Developmental Phonological Disorders: Foundations of clinical Practice: Plural Publishing Inc.
&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties with producing some speech sounds accurately may reduce intelligibility of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, E. S., &amp; Flint, C. B. (2006). [http://lshss.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1762909 Measurement of intelligibility in disordered speech]. Language Speech and Hearing Services in Schools, 37(3), 191-199. doi:10.1044/0161-1461(2006/021)
&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, more subtle difficulties in recognising specific sounds in words ([[phonological awareness]]) can lead to literacy difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Kamhi, A. G., Catts, H. W., Mauer, D., Apel, K., &amp; Gentry, B. F. (1988). [https://jshd.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1775118 Phonological and spatial processing abilities in language- and reading-impaired children]. Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders, 53, 316-327.

[[Speech]] is the act of articulating sounds, and this can be impaired for all kinds of reasons – a structural problem such as [[cleft lip and cleft palate]], a neurological problem affecting motor control of the speech apparatus [[Dysarthria]], or inability to perceive distinctions between sounds because of [[Hearing loss]]. Some distortions of speech sounds, such as a [[Lisp]], are commonly seen in young children. These misarticulations should not be confused with language problems, which involve the ability to select and combine linguistic elements to express meanings, and the ability to comprehend meanings. 
Although speech disorders can be distinguished from language disorders, they can also co-occur.&lt;ref&gt;Shriberg, L. D., Tomblin, J. B., &amp; McSweeny, J. L. (1999). [http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781216 Prevalence of speech delay in 6-year-old children and comorbidity with language impairment]. Journal of Speech, Language and Hearing Research, 42(6), 1461-1481. 
&lt;/ref&gt; When a child fails to produce distinctions between speech sounds for no obvious reason, this is typically regarded as a language problem affecting the learning of phonological contrasts. The classification of and terminology for disorders of speech sound production is a subject of considerable debate.&lt;ref&gt;Waring, R., &amp; Knight, R. (2013). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-6984.2012.00195.x/abstract How should children with speech sound disorders be classified? A review and critical evaluation of current classification systems]. International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders, 48(1), 25-40. doi:10.1111/j.1460-6984.2012.00195.x
&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, even for those with specialist skills, it is not always easy to distinguish between phonological disorders and other types of speech production problem.
[[Speech sound disorder]] (SSD) is any problem with speech production arising from any cause.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, C. (2015). Children's Speech Sound Disorders (2nd ed.). Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell.
&lt;/ref&gt;  
Speech Sound Disorders of unknown cause that are not accompanied by other language problems are a relatively common reason for young children to be referred to speech-language therapy (speech-language pathology).&lt;ref&gt;Broomfield, J., &amp; Dodd, B. (2004). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/13682820310001625589/abstract Children with speech and language disability: caseload characteristics]. International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders, 39, 303-324. 
&lt;/ref&gt; These often resolve by around 4–5 years of age with specialist intervention,&lt;ref&gt;Law, J., Garrett, Z., &amp; Nye, C. (2003). [http://www.cochrane.org/CD004110/BEHAV_speech-and-language-therapy-interventions-for-children-with-primary-speech-and-language-delay-or-disorder Speech and language therapy interventions for children with primary speech and language delay or disorder (Cochrane Review)]. The Cochrane Library, 3. 
&lt;/ref&gt; and so would not meet criteria for DLD. Where such problems continue beyond 5 years of age, they are usually accompanied by problems in broader language domains and have a poorer prognosis,&lt;ref name=Bishop1987&gt;Bishop, D. V. M., &amp; Edmundson, A. (1987). [https://jshd.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1774916 Language-impaired four-year-olds: distinguishing transient from persistent impairment]. Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders, 52, 156-173. 
&lt;/ref&gt; so a diagnosis of DLD with SSD is then appropriate.

===Relationship with other neurodevelopmental disorders===
DLD often co-occurs with milder neurodevelopmental disorders of unknown origin, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental dyslexia or developmental co-ordination disorder.&lt;ref name=Bishop2016 /&gt; These do not preclude a diagnosis of DLD, but should be noted as co-occurring conditions.

==Risk factors==
It is generally accepted that DLD is strongly influenced by genetic factors.&lt;ref name=Bishop2006&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (2006). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2582396/ What causes specific language impairment in children?] Current Directions in Psychological Science, 15, 217-221. 
&lt;/ref&gt; The best evidence comes from the [[Twin study]] method. Two twins growing up together are exposed to the same home environment, yet may differ radically in their language skills. Such different outcomes are, however, much more common in fraternal (non-identical) twins, who are genetically different. Identical twins share the same genes and tend to be much more similar in language ability. There can be some variation in the severity and persistence of DLD in identical twins, indicating that non-genetic factors affect the course of disorder, but it is unusual to find a child with DLD who has an identical twin with typical language.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M., North, T., &amp; Donlan, C. (1995). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8749.1995.tb11932.x/abstract Genetic basis of specific language impairment: evidence from a twin study]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 37, 56-71. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

There was considerable excitement when a large, multigenerational family with a high rate of DLD were found to have a mutation of the [[FOXP2]] gene just in the affected family members.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, S. E., Vargha Khadem, F., Watkins, K. E., Monaco, A. P., &amp; Pembrey, M. E. (1998). [https://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v18/n2/abs/ng0298-168.html Localisation of a gene implicated in a severe speech and language disorder]. Nature Genetics, 18, 168-170. 
&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent studies have found that, though DLD runs in families, it is not usually caused by a mutation in FOXP2 or another specific gene.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, S. E. (2006). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027706000746?via%3Dihub Tangled webs: Tracing the connections between genes and cognition]. Cognition, 101(2), 270-297. doi:10.1016/j.cognition.2006.04.004
&lt;/ref&gt; Current evidence suggests that there are many different genes that can influence language learning, and DLD results when a child inherits a particularly detrimental combination of risk factors, each of which may have only a small effect.&lt;ref name=Bishop2006/&gt; Nevertheless, study of the mode of action of the FOXP2 gene has helped identify other common genetic variants involved in the same neural pathways that may play a part in causing DLD.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, S. E., &amp; Scharff, C. (2009). [http://www.cell.com/genetics/abstract/S0168-9525(09)00043-2 FOXP2 as a molecular window into speech and language]. Trends in genetics, 25(4), 166-177. doi:10.1016/j.tig.2009.03.002&lt;/ref&gt;

Language disorders are associated with aspects of home environment, and it is often assumed that this is a causal link, with poor language stimulation leading to weak language skills. Twin studies, however, show that two children in the same home environment can have very different language outcomes, suggesting we should consider other explanations for the link. Children with DLD often grow up into adults who have relatively low educational attainments,&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse, A. J. O., Watt, H. J., Line, E. A., &amp; Bishop, D. V. M. (2009). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2835860/ Adult psychosocial outcomes of children with specific language impairment, pragmatic language impairment and autism]. International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders, 44, 511-528. 
&lt;/ref&gt; and their children may share a genetic risk for language disorder.&lt;ref name=Bishop2014 /&gt;

One non-genetic factor that is known to have a specific impact on language development is being a younger sibling in a large family.&lt;ref&gt;Fundudis, T., Kolvin, I., &amp; Garside, R. (1979). Speech Retarded and Deaf Children: Their Psychological Development. London: Academic Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associated factors===
It has long been noted that males are more affected by DLD than females, with a sex ratio of affected males: females around 3 or 4:1 &lt;ref&gt;Robinson, R. J. (1991). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8749.1991.tb14811.x/abstract Causes and associations of severe and persistent specific speech and language disorders in children]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 33, 943–962.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sex difference is much less striking in epidemiological samples, suggesting that similar problems may exist in females but are less likely to be detected.&lt;ref name=Norbury2016 /&gt; The reason for the sex difference is not well understood.

Poor motor skills are commonly found in children with DLD.&lt;ref&gt;Hill EL (2001). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/13682820010019874/abstract Non-specific nature of specific language impairment: a review of the literature with regard to concomitant motor impairments.] International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders, 36 (2): 149–71. doi:10.1080/13682820010019874. {{PMID|11344592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brain scans do not usually reveal any obvious abnormalities in children with DLD, although quantitative comparisons have found differences in brain size or relative proportions of white or grey matter in specific regions.&lt;ref&gt;Jernigan TL, Hesselink JR, Sowell E, Tallal PA (May 1991). [http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/590865 Cerebral structure on magnetic resonance imaging in language- and learning-impaired children.] Archives of Neurology, 48 (5): 539–45. doi:10.1001/archneur.1991.00530170103028. {{PMID|2021369}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, unusual brain gyri are found.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson T, Plante E (1996). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01875369?LI=true Gyral morphology in the posterior Sylvian region in families affected by developmental language disorder]. Neuropsychology Review 6 (2): 81–94. doi:10.1007/bf01875369. {{PMID|8976499}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; To date, no consistent 'neural signature' for DLD has been found, although some studies have noted evidence for involvement of subcortical systems.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnan, S., Watkins, K., &amp; Bishop, D. V. M. (2016). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661316300833 Neurobiological basis of language learning difficulties]. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 20(9), 701-714. doi:10.1016/j.tics.2016.06.012
&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in the brains of children with DLD vs typically developing children are subtle and may overlap with atypical patterns seen in other neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert MR, Kenet T (2007). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031395507000363 Brain abnormalities in language disorders and in autism.] Pediatric Clinics of North America, 54 (3): 563–83, vii. doi:10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.007. {{PMID|17543910}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
DLD is defined purely in behavioural terms: there is no biological test. There are three points that need to be met for a diagnosis of DLD:&lt;ref name=Bishop2017 /&gt;
# The child has language difficulties that create obstacles to communication or learning in everyday life,
# The child's language problems are unlikely to resolve by five years of age, and 
# The problems are not associated with a known biomedical condition such as brain injury, neurodegenerative conditions, genetic conditions or chromosome disorders such as [[Down Syndrome]], sensorineural [[hearing loss]], or [[Autism Spectrum]] Disorder or [[Intellectual Disability]].
 
For research and epidemiological purposes, specific cutoffs on language assessments have been used to document the first criterion. Tomblin et al.&lt;ref&gt;Tomblin, J. B., Records, N. L., &amp; Zhang, X. (1996). [http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781254 A system for the diagnosis of Specific Language Impairment in kindergarten children]. Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research, 39(6), 1284. doi:10.1044/jshr.3906.1284
&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the EpiSLI criterion, based on five composite scores representing performance in three domains of language (vocabulary, grammar, and narration) and two modalities (comprehension and production). Children scoring in the lowest 10% on two or more composite scores are identified as having language disorder.

The second criterion, persistence of language problems, can be difficult to judge in a young child, but longitudinal studies have shown that difficulties are less likely to resolve for children who have poor language comprehension, rather than difficulties confined to expressive language.&lt;ref name=Bishop2017 /&gt; In addition, children with isolated difficulties in just one of the areas noted under 'subtypes' tend to make better progress than those whose language is impaired in several areas.&lt;ref name=Bishop1987 /&gt;

The third criterion specifies that DLD is used for children whose language disorder is not part of another biomedical condition, such as a genetic syndrome, a sensorineural hearing loss, neurological disease, Autism Spectrum Disorder or Intellectual Disability – these were termed 'differentiating conditions' by the CATALISE panel.&lt;ref name=Bishop2017 /&gt; Language disorders occurring with these conditions need to be assessed and children offered appropriate intervention, but a terminological distinction is made so that these cases would be diagnosed as Language Disorder associated with &lt;mark&gt;___&lt;/mark&gt;, with the main diagnosis being specified: e.g. "Language Disorder associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder." The reasoning behind these diagnostic distinctions is discussed further by Bishop (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=|first1=|date=|year=2017|title=Why is it so hard to reach agreement on terminology? The case of developmental language disorder (DLD)|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1460-6984.12335/full|journal=International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders|volume=52|pages=|doi=10.1111/1460-6984.12335|via=|author-last=Bishop|author-first=D. V. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
Assessment will usually include an interview with the child’s caregiver, observation of the child in an unstructured setting, a hearing test, and standardized tests of language.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, R. (2006). Language Disorders from Infancy through Adolescence: Assessment and Intervention, 3rd Edition. St. Louis: Mosby-Year Book.
&lt;/ref&gt; There is a wide range of language assessments in English. Some are restricted for use by experts in [[speech-language pathology]]: speech and language therapists (SaLTs/SLTs) in the UK, speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in the US and Australia. A commonly used test battery for diagnosis of DLD is the [http://www.pearsonclinical.co.uk/Psychology/ChildCognitionNeuropsychologyandLanguage/ChildLanguage/ClinicalEvaluationofLanguageFundamentals-FourthEditionUK(CELF-4UK)/ClinicalEvaluationofLanguageFundamentals-FourthEditionUK(CELF-4UK).aspx Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF)]. 
Assessments that can be completed by a parent or teacher can be useful to identify children who may require more in-depth evaluation. The [http://www.pearsonclinical.co.uk/Psychology/ChildCognitionNeuropsychologyandLanguage/ChildLanguage/ChildrensCommunicationChecklist(CCC-2)/ChildrensCommunicationChecklist(CCC-2).aspx Children’s Communication Checklist (CCC–2)] is a parent questionnaire suitable for assessing everyday use of language in children aged 4 years and above who can speak in sentences. 
Informal assessments, such as language samples, are often used by speech-language therapists/pathologists to complement formal testing and give an indication of the child's language in a more naturalistic context. A language sample may be of a conversation or narrative retell. In a narrative language sample, an adult may tell the child a story using a wordless picture book (e.g. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Frog_Where_Are_You.html?id=Asi5KQAACAAJ&amp;hl=en Frog Where Are You?, Mayer, 1969]), then ask the child to use the pictures and tell the story back. Language samples can be transcribed using computer software such as the [http://www.saltsoftware.com/ Systematic Analysis of Language Software], and then analyzed for a range of features: e.g., the grammatical complexity of the child's utterances,  whether the child introduces characters to their story or jumps right in, whether the events follow a logical order, and whether the narrative includes a main idea or theme and supporting details.

==Treatment==
Treatment is usually carried out by speech and language therapists/pathologists, who use a wide range of techniques to stimulate language learning.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, F. P., &amp; Worthington, C. K. (2010). Treatment resource manual for speech-language pathology, 4th edition. San Diego: Singular Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, there was a vogue for drilling children in grammatical exercises, using imitation and elicitation, but such methods fell into disuse when it became apparent that there was little generalisation to everyday situations. Contemporary approaches to enhancing development of language structure, for younger children at least, are more likely to adopt 'milieu' methods, in which the intervention is interwoven into natural episodes of communication, and the therapist builds on the child's utterances, rather than dictating what will be talked about. Interventions for older children, may be more explicit, telling the children what areas are being targeted and giving explanations regarding the rules and structures they are learning, often with visual supports,.&lt;ref&gt;Ebbels, S.H., [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1191/0265659007072143?journalCode=clta Teaching grammar to school-aged children with Specific Language Impairment using Shape Coding]. Child Language Teaching and Therapy, 2007. 23(1): p. 67-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, A., Colourful Semantics., in Language disorders in children and adults: psycholinguistic approaches to therapy., S. Chiat, J. Law, and J. Marshall, Editors. 1997, Whurr: London&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there has been a move away from a focus solely on grammar and phonology toward interventions that develop children's social use of language, often working in small groups that may include typically developing as well as language-impaired peers.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Gallagher, T. (1996). Social-interactional approaches to child language intervention. In J. Beitchman, N. J. Cohen, M. M. Konstantareas &amp; R. Tannock (Eds.), Language, Learning and Behavior Disorders: Developmental, Biological and Clinical Perspectives (pp. 493–514). New York: Cambridge University Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way in contemporary remediation differ from the past is that parents are more likely to be directly involved, but this approach is largely used with preschool children, rather than those whose problems persist into school age.,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, M.Y. and A.P. Kaiser (2011) [http://ajslp.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1757532 The effectiveness of parent-implemented language interventions: A meta-analysis]. American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, 20(3), 180-199&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tosh, R., W. Arnott, and N. Scarinci, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1460-6984.12280/abstract Parent-implemented home therapy programs for speech and language: A systematic review]. International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

For school-aged children, teachers are increasingly involved in intervention, either in collaboration with speech and language therapists/pathologists, or as the main agents of delivery of the intervention. Evidence for the benefits of a collaborative approach is emerging,&lt;ref&gt;Archibald, L.(2017). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2396941516680369 SLP-Educator classroom collaboration: A review to inform reason-based practice.] Autism and Developmental Language Impairments, 2. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/2396941516680369&lt;/ref&gt; but the benefits of asking education staff to be the main deliverers of SLT intervention (the “consultative” approach) are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;McCartney, E., et al., [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3109/13682820903560302/abstract Indirect language therapy for children with persistent language impairment in mainstream primary schools: outcomes from a cohort intervention]. International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders, 2011. 46(1), 74-82.&lt;/ref&gt; When SLT intervention is delivered indirectly by trained SLT assistants, however, there are indications that this can be effective.&lt;ref&gt;Mecrow, C., J. Beckwith, and T. Klee, An exploratory trial of the effectiveness of an enhanced consultative approach to delivering speech and language intervention in schools. International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders, 2010. 45(3): p. 354-367. DOI: 10.3109/13682820903560302&lt;/ref&gt;

A radically different approach has been developed by Tallal and colleagues, who devised a computer-based intervention, FastForWord, that involves prolonged and intensive training on specific components of language and auditory processing.&lt;ref&gt;Tallal, P. (2000). Experimental studies of language learning impairments: From research to remediation. In D. V. M. Bishop &amp; L. B. Leonard (Eds.), Speech and Language Impairments in Children: Causes, Characteristics, Intervention and Outcome (pp. 131–155). Hove, UK: Psychology Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; The theory underlying FastForword maintains that language difficulties are caused by a failure to make fine-grained auditory discriminations in the temporal dimension, and the computerised training materials are designed to sharpen perceptual acuity. However, a systematic review of clinical trials assessing FastForWord reported no significant gains relative to a control group.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, G. K., Torgerson, C. J., Torgerson, D., &amp; Hulme, C. (2010). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02329.x/full A systematic meta-analytic review of evidence for the effectiveness of the ‘Fast ForWord’ language intervention program]. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 52(3), 224-235. doi:10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02329.x
&lt;/ref&gt;

In this field, [[Randomized controlled trial]] methodology has not been widely used, and this makes it difficult to assess clinical efficacy with confidence. Children's language will tend to improve over time, and without controlled studies, it can be hard to know how much of observed change is down to a specific treatment. There is, however, increasing evidence that direct 1:1 intervention with an SLT/P can be effective for improving vocabulary and expressive language.&lt;ref&gt;Law, J., Garrett, Z., &amp; Nye, C.

 doi:10.1044/1092-4388(2004/069) {{PMID|15324296}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; There have been few studies of interventions that target receptive language,&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, J., McCartney, E., O'Hare, A., &amp; Law, J. (2010).

==Outcome==
[[Longitudinal studies]] indicate that problems are largely resolved by 5 years of age in around 40% of 4-year-olds with early language delays who have no other presenting risk factors.&lt;ref name=Bishop1987 /&gt; However, for children who still have significant language difficulties at school entry, reading problems are common, even for children who receive specialist help,&lt;ref&gt;Catts, H. W., Fey, M. E., Tomblin, J. B., &amp; Zhang, X. (2002). [http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781088 A longitudinal investigation of reading outcomes in children with language impairments]. Journal of Speech, Language and Hearing Research, 45, 1142-1157. 
&lt;/ref&gt; and educational attainments are typically poor.&lt;ref&gt;Snowling, M. J., Adams, J. W., Bishop, D. V. M., &amp; Stothard, S. E. (2001).

International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders, 36, 173-183. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Poor outcomes are most common in cases where comprehension as well as expressive language is affected.&lt;ref&gt;Simkin, Z., &amp; Conti-Ramsden, G. (2006).

Child Language Teaching and Therapy, 22, 315-331. 
&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that scores on tests of nonverbal ability of children with DLD decrease over the course of development.&lt;ref&gt;Botting, N. (2005). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00355.x/abstract Non-verbal cognitive development and language impairment].

DLD is associated with an elevated risk of social, emotional and mental health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Nancy (2001). Language impairment and psychopathology in infants, children, and adolescents. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications. {{ISBN|0-7619-2025-0}}. OCLC&amp;nbsp;45749780.
&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in a UK survey, 64% of a sample of 11-year-olds with DLD scored above a clinical threshold on a questionnaire for psychiatric difficulties, and 36% were regularly bullied, compared with 12% of comparison children.&lt;ref&gt;Conti-Ramsden, G., &amp; Botting, N.

&lt;/ref&gt; In the longer-term, studies of adult outcomes of children with DLD have found elevated rates of unemployment, social isolation and psychiatric disorder among those with early comprehension difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, J., Hollis, C., Mawhood, L., &amp; Rutter, M.

&lt;/ref&gt; However, better outcomes are found for children who have milder difficulties and do not require special educational provision.&lt;ref&gt;Snowling, M. J., Bishop, D. V. M., Stothard, S.

==Research==
Much research has focused on trying to identify what makes language learning so hard for some children.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (1997). Uncommon Understanding: Development and Disorders of Language Comprehension in Children. Hove: Psychology Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; A major divide is between theories that attribute the difficulties to a low-level problem with auditory temporal processing,&lt;ref&gt;Tallal, P., &amp; Piercy, M. (1973). [https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v241/n5390/abs/241468a0.html Defects of non-verbal auditory perception in children with developmental dysphasia]. Nature, 241, 468-469. 
&lt;/ref&gt; and those that propose there is a deficit in a specialised language-learning system.,.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, M. L., Wexler, K., &amp; Cleave, P. L. (1995). [http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1780857 Specific language impairment as a period of extended optional infinitive]. Journal of Speech and Hearing Research, 38, 850-863.

Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 9, 53-59. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts emphasise deficits in specific aspects of learning and memory.,.&lt;ref&gt;Gathercole, S. E., &amp; Baddeley, A. D. (1990).

&lt;/ref&gt; It can be difficult to choose between theories because they do not always make distinctive predictions, and there is considerable heterogeneity among children with DLD. It has also been suggested that DLD may only arise when more than one underlying deficit is present.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, D. V. M. (2006).

'''Dhikr''' (also ''Zikr, Zekr, Zikir, Jikir'', and variants; {{lang-ar|ذِكْر|ḏikr}} {{IPA-ar|ðɪkr|}}; plural {{lang|ar|أذكار}} ''aḏkār'' {{IPA-ar|ʔaðˈkɑːr|}}, meaning "[[:wikt:ذكر#Noun|mentioning]]")&lt;ref name="Modarresi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|authorlink=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|title=The Laws of Islam|date=26 March 2016|publisher=Enlight Press|isbn=978-0994240989|url=http://almodarresi.com/en/books/pdf/TheLawsofIslam.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2017|ref=Modarresi|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|470}}
are devotional acts in [[Islam]] in which short phrases or prayers are repeatedly recited silently within the mind or aloud. It can be counted on a set of [[prayer beads]] (''[[Misbaha]]'' {{lang|ar|مِسْبَحَة}}) or in ones head. A person who recites the Dhikr is called a ''ḏākir'' ({{IPA-ar|ˈðaːkɪr|}} {{lang|ar|ذاكر}}).
''[[Tasbih]]'' ({{lang|ar|تسبيح}}) is a form of dhikr that involves the repetitive utterances of short sentences glorifying God.
The content of the prayers includes  the [[names of God in Islam|names of God]], or a ''[[dua|duʿāʾ]]'' (prayer of supplication) taken from the [[hadith]] or the [[Quran]].

[[File:Isma allah zat-new.png|thumb|right|Allah as having been written on the disciple's heart according to Sarwari Qadri Order]]

== Importance ==
There are several verses in the Quran that emphasize the importance of remembering the will of God by saying phrases such as "God willing," "God knows best," and "If it is your will.' This is the basis for dhikr. [[Sura]] 18 ([[Al-Kahf]]), [[ayah]] 24 states a person who forgets to say, "God Willing," should immediately remember God by saying, "May my Lord guide me to do better next time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|18|24|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other verses include [[sura]] 33 ([[Al-Ahzab]]), ayah 41, "O ye who believe! Celebrate the praises of Allah, and do this often,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|33|41|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sura 13 ([[Ar-Ra'd]]), ayah 28, "They are the ones whose hearts rejoice in remembering God. Absolutely, by remembering God, the hearts rejoice."&lt;ref name="quran1328"&gt;{{Cite quran|13|28|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad said, 'The best [dhikr] is ''La ilaha illa’llah'' ("there is no God but God"), and the best supplicatory prayer is ''Al-hamdu li’llah'' ("praise be to God").&lt;ref&gt;Razi, Najm al-Din. The Path of God’s Bondsman: From Origin to Return. Trans. Hamid Algar. North Haledon, New Jersey: Islamic Publications International, 1980. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muslim|Muslims]] believe dhikr is one of the best ways to enter the higher level of [[Jannah|Heaven]] and to glorify the [[Tawhid|Oneness]] of [[Allah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dhikr, remembrance of God|url = http://sunnah.org/ibadaat/dhikr.htm|website = sunnah.org|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To Sufis, dhikr is seen as a way to gain spiritual enlightenment and achieve union (''visal'') or annihilation (''fana'') in God. All Muslim sects endorse individual rosaries as a method of meditation, the goal of which is to obtain a feeling of peace, separation from worldly values ([[dunya]]), and, in general, strengthen [[Iman (concept)|Iman]] (faith).{{cn|date=January 2015}}

== Common phrases ==
{{unreferenced-section|date=January 2015}}
There are several phrases that are usually read when remembering Allah. Here are a few:

* [[Allāh]]- الله is the Arabic word for God  and mentioned in Quran most of the verses.
* [[Takbir|Allāhu ʾakbar]] (Takbir) - الله أَكْبَر means "[[God in Islam|God]] is greater" or "God is the greatest"
* [[Subhan Allah]] (Tasbih) - سبحان الله means "Glory be to God" or "How pure is God" or "Exalted be God"
* [[Alhamdulillah]] (Tahmid) - الحمد لله means "All praise is due to God", an expression of [[gratitude]]
* [[Tahlil|Lā ʾilāha ʾillā llah]] (Tahlil) - لا إله إلا الله means "There is no god but Allah"
* [[Hawqala|Lā ḥawla wa-lā quwwata ʾillā bi-llāh]] (Hawqala) - لا حول ولاقوة إلا بالله means "There is no power or strength except with God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://islam.ru/en/content/story/dhikr-and-tasbih-sunnah|title=Dhikr and tasbih from the Sunnah {{!}} islam.ru|website=islam.ru|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Basmala|Bi-smi llāhi r-raḥmāni r-raḥīm]] (Basmala) - means "In the name of God, the gracious, the merciful", said before anything of spiritual significance ; e.g. eating, [[wudhu]], [[salaat]], rising from and going to sleep, before work, etc.
* ʾastaġfiru llāh (Istighfar) - means "I seek forgiveness from Allah".
* Audhubillah (Ta'uidh) - means "I seek refuge in Allah".
* Laa ilaaha illal laahu wahdahoo laa sharikalahoo lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa 'alaa kulli shai'in qadeer - means "There is no god but Allah, alone, without partner. His is the sovereignty, and His the praise, and He has power over everything".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sunnahaday.wordpress.com/2010/07/12/sunnah-83-la-ilaha-ila-allah-wahdahu-la-sharika-lah-lahu-al-mulk-wa-lahu-al-hamd-wa-huwa-ala-kulli-shay%E2%80%99in-qadir/|title=Sunnah 83: la ilaha ila Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu al-mulk wa lahu al-hamd, wa huwa `ala kulli shay’in qadir|date=2010-07-12|work=A Sunnah A Day|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* SubhanAllah wa biHamdihi - means "Glory be to Allah and Praise Him".
* SubhanAllahi wa biHamdihi, Subhan-Allahi 'l-`adheem (Glory be to Allah, and Praise Him, Glory be to Allah, the Supreme) 

Some of these can be said together.e.g- 
* Subhan'Allahi wal hamdulillaahi wa laa ilaaha ilallaahu wAllahu Akbar - means "Glory be to Allah, All Praise is for Allah, There is No God but Allah, Allah is the Greatest".
* Subhan'Allahi wal hamdulillaahi wa laa ilaaha ilallaahu wAllahu Akbar wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illaa billaahil 'aleeul azeem.
* Laa ilaaha illal laahu wahdahoo laa sharikalahoo lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa 'alaa kulli shai'in qadeer - means "There is No God But Allah Alone, who has no partner. His is the dominion and His is the raise, and He is Able to do all things".
* Subhan'Allahi wal hamdulillaahi wa laa ilaaha ilallaahu wAllahu Akbar wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illaa billaahil 'aleeul azeem.
* Laa ilaaha illa Anta, subhaanaka inni kuntu min al-zaalimeen (There is no God but Allah, Glory to You, verily I was one of the wrongdoers).

== Quran as Dhikr ==

Reciting the Quran sincerely is also considered a kind of Dhikr. &lt;br /&gt;
e.g.- 
* Reciting Sura Ikhlas / Tawheed (Sura 112) is equal to one-third of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=al-Bukhaari|pages=4628}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reciting Sura Ikhlas 10 times gives a palace in Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saheeh al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=6472|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reciting Sura Kaafiroon (Sura 109) is equal to one-fourth of the Quran. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mu’jam Al-Kabeer|pages=13319}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reciting Sura Nasr (Sura 110) is equal to one-fourth of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reciting Sura Zalzalah is equal to half of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is mentioned in hadith that where people are oblivious to dhikir, remembrance of Allah is like being steadfast in jihad when others are running away (Targhib, p. 193, vol. 3 ref. Bazar and Tibrani).

== Sufi view ==
{{Sufism}}
{{See also|Sema}}
Followers of Sufism often engage in ritualized dhikr ceremonies, the details of which sometimes vary between Sufi orders or ''[[tariqah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Each order, or lineage within an order, has one or more forms for group dhikr, the [[liturgy]] of which may include [[Quran reading|recitation]], [[singing]], [[Islamic music|music]], [[dance]], [[Islam and clothing|costume]]s, [[Religious use of incense|incense]], ''[[muraqaba]]'' (meditation), [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]], and [[altered state of consciousness|trance]].&lt;ref&gt;Touma, p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the extent, usage and acceptability of many of these elements vary from order to order - with many condemning the usage of instruments (considered unlawful by most scholars)&lt;ref&gt;In his "The Whirling Dervishes and Orthodox Islam" the Nuh Ha Mim Keller (an indisputed shaykh of the Hashimi-Shadhili order) criticizes the common usage of music by the contemporary Turkish branch of the Mevlavi order in particular - arguing that the Sufis are not exempt from following Islamic law. See [http://shadhilitariqa.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=23 The Whirling Dervishes and Orthodox Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402144655/http://shadhilitariqa.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=23 |date=2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and intentional loss of control. In addition, costumes are quite uncommon and is almost exclusively unique to the [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlavi]] order in Turkey - which is an official cultural "heritage" of the secular Turkish state. In Sufism, group dhikr does not necessarily entail all of these forms.

The most common forms of Sufi group dhikr consist in the recital of particular litanies (e.g. [http://www.dar-sirr.com/Tijanism/Hizb-Al-Bahr.htm Hizb al-Bahr] of the Shadhilis), a composition of Quranic phrases and Prophetic supplications (e.g. [https://www.amazon.com/Prophetic-Invocations-Imam-Al-Haddad/dp/1929694105 Wird al-Latif] of the [[Ba 'Alawi tariqa|Ba `Alawis]]), or a liturgical repetition of various formula and prayers (e.g. al-Wadhifa of the [[Tijani]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Litany of Tijani Prayers|url=http://www.dar-sirr.com/Tijanism/litanies.html|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). All of these forms are referred to as a "hizb" (''pl.'' "ahzab") or a "wird" (''pl.'' "awrad"). This terminological usage is important as some critics often mistakenly believe that the word hizb only refers to a [[Juz'|portion]] of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Ahmad al-Tijani is often unfairly criticized for saying that the ''Salat al-Fatih'' which he instructed his students to recite is "more valuable than a ''hizb''". This "''hizb''" that he was referring to was not a ''hizb'' of the Quran, but a ''hizb'' of the ''[[Dala'il al-Khayrat]]'' which was so commonly recited in Tijani's time that many people recited the entire composition several times a day.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many recite extended prayers upon Muhammad (known as [[durood]]) of which the [[Dala'il al-Khayrat]] is perhaps the most popular. Though common to almost all Sufi orders, some (such as the [[Naqsbandi]]s) prefer to perform their dhikr silently - even in group settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmad|first=Zulfaqir|title=Wisdom for the Seeker|location=Concerning the Dhikr of the Naqsbandi-Mujaddid Tariqa|url=http://www.tasawwuf.org/writings/wisdom_seeker/wisdom_letter2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most gatherings are held on Thursday or Sunday nights as part of the institutional practices of the tariqah (since Thursday is the night marks the entrance of the Muslim "holy" day of Friday and Sundays are a convenient congregational time in most contemporary societies) - though people who don't live near their official [[Khanqah|zawiya]] gather whenever is convenient for the most people.

Another type of group dhikr ceremony that is most commonly performed in [[Arab World|Arabic countries]] is called the [[haḍra]] (''lit''. presence).&lt;ref&gt;In earlier orders, the "presence" referred to was that of God, but since the 18th century it has been considered to be the spiritual presence of Muhammad (John L. Esposito, "Hadrah." The Oxford Dictionary of Islam. Oxford Islamic Studies Online. Web. 3 Apr. 2010.) The shifting focus, however, is not shared by all and is a result of the Sufi reforms which sought to mitigate the heretical belief of [[theopanism]] committed by some Sufi claimants through a greater focus on the spirit and active life of Muhammad instead of a metaphorical union with God.(Ira Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, p. 210)&lt;/ref&gt; The haḍra is a communal gathering for dhikr and its associated liturgical rituals, prayers, and song recitals, performing both in private or public. Though the haḍra is popular (in part because of the controversy surrounding it), it is mostly practiced in North Africa, the Middle-East and Turkey. In [[Turkey]] this ceremony is called "Zikr-i Kiyam" (Standing dhikr) and "imara" in Algeria and Morocco. In places like Syria where Sufis are a visible part of the fabric and psyche of society, each order typically has their private gathering on one day and will participate in a public haḍra at a central location to which both the affiliated and unaffiliated alike are invited as an expression of unity. Similar public ceremonies occur in Turkey, Egypt, Algeria and Morocco.

[[File:Dhikr hadrah articulation.PNG|thumb|Dhikr hadrah articulation, upward beams indicating inhalation and downward beams indicating exhalation &lt;ref name="Touma, p.165"/&gt;]]

For those who perform it, the haḍra marks the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of the Sufi's gathering regardless of any teaching or [[musical form|formal]] structure - it often follows a formal teaching session as a way of internalizing the lessons. Musically, the structure of the haḍra includes several secular [[Arabic music|Arab genres]] (each of which expresses a different emotion) and can last for hours.&lt;ref name="Touma, p.165"&gt;Touma, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt; It is directed by the [[sheikh]] of the tariqa or one of his representatives; monitoring the intensity, depth and duration of the phases of the haḍra, the sheikh aims to draw the circle into deep awareness of God and away from the participants own individuatedness. The dhikr ceremonies may have a ritually determined length or may last as long as the Sheikh deems his [[murid]]s require. The haḍra section consists of the [[ostinato]]-like repetition of the name of God over which the soloist performs a richly ornamented song. In many haḍras, this repetition proceeds from the chest and has the effect of a percussion instrument, with the participants bending forward while exhaling and stand straight while inhaling so that both the movement and sound contribute to the overall rhythm. The climax is usually reached through cries of "Allah! Allah!" or "hu hu" (which is either the pronoun "he" or the last vowel on the word "Allah" depending on the method) while the participants are moving up and down. Universally, the haḍra is almost always followed by Quranic recital in the [[tarteel]] style - which according to [[Junayd Baghdadi|al-Junayd al-Baghdadi]], was a prophetic instruction received through a dream.

More common than the haḍra is the [[Sema|sama]]` (''lit''. audition), a type of group ceremony that consist mostly of the audition of spiritual poetry and Quranic recitation in an emotionally charged manner; and thus is not dhikr is the technical sense the word implies. However, the same debate over certain matters of decorum apply as exists with the haḍra. Even though group dhikr is popular and makes up the spiritual life of most Sufi adherents, other more private forms of dhikr are performed more routinely - usually consisting of the order's ''wird'' (daily litany) - which adherents usually recite privately, even if gathered together. So although group dhikr is seen as a hallmark of Sufism, the Sufis themselves practice the same private forms of worship that other Muslims practice, though usually more frequently and methodically; group dhikr is a less frequent occurrence and is not the end-all-and-be-all of Sufism, as some Sufi orders do not even perform it.

Dhikr takes on a wide range and various layers of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Jawadi Amuli, ''[http://basirat.ca/basirat/dhikr_and_the_wisdom_behind_it/ Dhikr and the Wisdom Behind It]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders it is instituted as a ceremonial activity. In ''[[tasawwuf]]'' (Islamic mysticism or [[Sufism]]) dhikr is most likely the most frequent form of prayer. Among the orders of Muslims that practice dhikr, there are some who advocate silent, individual prayer, while others join together in an outward, group expression of their love for God.&lt;ref&gt;Gardet, L.  Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Brill, 2010. Web. 4 Apr. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of hadiths that give emphasis to remembrance of God.&lt;ref&gt;Naqshbandi Sufi Way. Naqshbandi-Haqqani Sufi Order of America, 2010. Web. April 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dhikr in Sufism ===
Dhikr is given great importance by some Sufi writers, among them is [[Najm-al-Din Razi]] who wrote about dhikr in the context of what it combats. In contrast to the virtues of remembrance, Razi uses the perils of forgetfulness to show the importance of dhikr. The soul and the world are veils that make people forget God.&lt;ref&gt;Naqshbandi Sufi Way. Naqshbandi-Haqqani Sufi Order of America, 2010. Web. 3 Apr. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order]] of America says this about dhikr: {{quotation|Dhikr is the means by which Stations yield their fruit, until the seeker reaches the Divine Presence. On the journey to the [[Divine presence|Divine Presence]] the seed of remembrance is planted in the heart and nourished with the water of praise and the food of glorification, until the tree of dhikr becomes deeply rooted and bears its fruit. It is the power of all journeying and the foundation of all success. It is the reviver from the sleep of heedlessness, the bridge to the One remembered.}}&lt;ref&gt;Geels, Antoon. "A Note on the Psychology of dhikr: The Halveti-Jerrahi Order of Dervishes in Istanbul." the ''[[International Journal for the Psychology of Religion]]'', 6.4, 229-251 (1996). ATLA. Web. 3 Apr. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufi methods===
There are some Sufi orders, such as the [[Shadhili]], that perform a ritualized form of dhikr in groups termed "[[haḍra]]" (''lit''. presence) - the details of which are discussed below. Another method of dhikr, but which is most commonly associated with Sufism, is the repetition of the Arabic name "Allah Hu". Sufi orders have similar practices - some with similar visualizations and others choosing to focus only on the attachment of their heart to the One they are invoking. Though this is associated almost exclusively with Sufism in modern times, many of the Quranic exegesis of the past approved of the practice (e.e. [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] in his ''[[Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi)|Mafatih al-Ghayb]]''), which confirms that it has a basis in orthodoxy.

== Prayer beads ==
Known also as ''[[Tasbih]]'', these are usually ''[[Misbaha]]'' ([[prayer beads]]) upon a string, 99 or 100 in number, which correspond to the names of God in Islam and other recitations. The beads are used to keep track of the number of recitations that make up the dhikr.

When the dhikr involves the repetition of particular phrases a specific number of times, the beads are used to keep track so that the person performing dhikr can turn all of their focus on what is actually being said - as it can become difficult to concentrate simultaneously on the number and phrasing when one is doing so a substantial number of times.

In the United States, Muslim inmates are allowed to utilize [[prayer beads]] for therapeutic effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.buffalo.edu/Academics/courses/704/prisonlaw/readings/9alameen.html United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311210028/http://www.law.buffalo.edu/Academics/courses/704/prisonlaw/readings/9alameen.html |date=2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Alameen v. Coughlin, 892 F. Supp. 440 (E.D.N.Y 1995), Imam Hamzah S. Alameen, a/k/a Gilbert Henry, and Robert Golden brought suit against Thomas A. Coughlin III, etc., et alia (Head of the Department of Corrections) in the [[New York (state)|State of New York]] pursuant to 28 [[United States Code|USC]] @ 1983.  The plaintiffs argued that prisoners have a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] [[Constitutional right]] to pursue Islamic healing therapy called KASM (قاسَمَهُ | qaasama | taking an oath ) which uses [[prayer beads]].  The rosary of oaths, which Alameen developed, was used to successfully rehabilitate inmates suffering from co-occurring mental health challenges and substance abuse issues during the 1990s.  All people, including Muslims and Catholics, were allowed to use [[prayer beads]] inside prisons, lest their freedom of religion be violated when the prison administration forbade their possession as contraband in the penal system. The practice of carrying [[prayer beads]] became controversial when gang-members began carrying specific colors of [[prayer beads]] to identify themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2400">In [[linguistics]] and in particular in [[natural language understanding]], a '''dialog act''' is an utterance, in the context of a conversational dialog, that serves a function in the dialog. Types of dialog acts include a question, a statement, or a request for action.&lt;ref name="McTear2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McTear |first1=Michael |last2=Callejas |first2=Zoraida |last3=Griol |first3=David |title=The Conversational Interface: Talking to Smart Devices |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319329673 |pages=162-166 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_w0DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=%22Dialog+act%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8kqaEirHbAhVxFjQIHUPADJ0Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dialog%20act%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 May 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dialog acts are a type of  [[speech act]]. 

Dialog act recognition, also known as spoken utterance classification, is an important part of spoken language understanding. AI inference models or statistical models are used to recognize and classify dialog acts.&lt;ref name="McTear2016" /&gt;

A [[dialog system]] typically includes a taxonomy of dialog types or ''tags'' that classify the different functions dialog acts can play.  One study had 42 types of dialog act in their taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of types in this study include ''STATEMENT'', ''OPINION'', ''AGREEMENT/ACCEPT'', and ''YES-NO-QUESTION''. 

The research on dialog acts have increased since 1999, after [[spoken dialog systems]] became commercial reality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1681">'''"Dictated but not read"''' is a phrase used at the end of a text to warn that the written material has not been personally written or verified by the [[author]]. The material may have been [[Dictation (exercise)|dictated]] to a [[secretary]] when the author had no time to proofread or edit it. 

This practice is more common within the medical community, though its appropriateness is still debated.&lt;ref&gt;Shere S. ''Not reading and signing letters you have dictated is dangerous.'' BMJ. 2001 Apr 21;322(7292):992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/323/7310/448 BMJ (British Medical Journal)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The phrase is used to indicate a need for extra care in reading the document so annotated. It may be intended as a [[disclaimer]] to limit [[legal liability]].

It may be used at the end of an article to warn the reader that the written material has not been personally written by the author, who likely dictated it to a secretary, but they did not have the time to write it themselves. Very busy people may be expected to sign off their article with such notation. However, it may be regarded as disrespectful, especially when the writer is deemed not busy.

It is commonly used to sign off on correspondence where formality takes a backseat to speedy communications, or where such correspondence is routine. When this is not the case, it may be a discourtesy to the recipient of the letter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?z=y&amp;ean=9780671723651&amp;displayonly=EXC How to Win Friends and Influence People], ''Dale Carnegie''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ems Ukaz''', or ''Ems Ukase'' ({{lang-ru|Эмский указ}}, ''Emskiy ukaz''; {{lang-uk|Емський указ}}, ''Ems’kyy ukaz''), was a secret decree (''[[ukaz]]'') of [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia]] issued in 1876, banning the use of the [[Ukrainian language]] in print, with the exception of reprinting of old documents. The ukaz also forbade the import of Ukrainian publications and the staging of plays or lectures in Ukrainian. It was named after the city of [[Bad Ems]], [[Germany]], where it was promulgated.

== Background ==

In the 1860s, a decade and a half after the Imperial Russian government had broken up the [[Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius]] in [[Kiev]] (March 1847), and exiled or arrested its founder [[Nikolay Kostomarov]] and other prominent figures, Ukrainian intellectuals were gaining further awareness of their cultural background.  ''[[Hromada]]'' cultural associations (named after the traditional village assembly) started in a number of cities, and Sunday schools started in the cities and towns (the Russian Imperial administration had neglected education).  The new cultural movement was partly driven by publications in both Russian and Ukrainian, including journals (such as Kostomarov's ''Osnova'', 1861–62, and [[Leonid Hlibov|Hlibov]]'s ''Chernyhosvs’kyy Lystok'', 1861–63), historical and folkloristic monographs (Kostomarov's biography of the Cossack hetman [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], [[Panteleimon Kulish|Kulish]]'s two-volume folklore collection ''Zapiski o Yuzhnoy Rusi'', ''Notes on Southern Rus''', 1856–57), and elementary primers (Kulish's ''Hramatka'', 1857, 1861, [[Taras Shevchenko|Shevchenko]]'s ''Bukvar Yuzhnoruskiy'', 1861&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
| last1 = Shevchenko

| location = Kiev
| publication-date = 1976
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;).  In ''Osnova'', Kostomarov published his influential article "Dve russkiye narodnosti" ("Two Russian Nationalities").

Although Ukrainianism had been considered popular and somewhat chic in Russian cultural circles, a debate began at the time over its relation to the ideology of Russian [[Pan-Slavism]]—epitomized by a quotation of [[Pushkin]]: "will not all the Slavic streams merge into the Russian sea?"—and a rhetoric of criticism emerged. Conservative Russians called the Ukrainian movement a "Polish intrigue", while Polish commentators had been complaining that Ukrainianism had been used as a weapon against Polish culture in [[right-bank Ukraine]].

After the 1861 [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipation of the serfs]] in the [[Russian Empire]], many landowners were unhappy with the loss of their serfs, while peasants were generally displeased with the terms of the emancipation.  In this atmosphere of discontent, increasing reports reached the imperial government that Ukrainian leaders were plotting to separate from Russia. The 1863 [[January Uprising]] in Poland raised tensions around the issue of ethnic separatism in general even further.  Several Ukrainian activists were arrested, Sunday schools and hromadas were closed and their publication activities were suspended.

A new Ukrainian translation by [[Pylyp Morachevskyi]] of parts of the [[New Testament]] was vetted and passed by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences]], but rejected by the [[Most Holy Synod|Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox church]], because it was considered politically suspect.&lt;ref name=Zerk_morachev&gt;{{Ru icon}}/{{uk icon}} Volodymyr Kozyrsky, Vasyl Shenderovsky, "The spiritual valour of Pylyp Morachevsky (to the bicentenary anniversary of his birth)", ''[[Zerkalo Nedeli]] (the Mirror Weekly)'', 5–19 August 2006, [http://www.zerkalo-nedeli.com/ie/show/609/54147/ in Russian]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, [http://www.zn.kiev.ua/ie/show/609/54147/ in Ukrainian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311010339/http://www.zn.kiev.ua/ie/show/609/54147 |date=2007-03-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Interior Minister Count [[Pyotr Valuyev]] issued a decree through an internal document circulated to the censors on 18 July 1863, known as  [[Valuyev's Circular]]. The Circular implemented a policy based on his opinion that "the Ukrainian language never existed, does not exist, and shall never exist".  It banned the publication of secular and religious books (apart from ''[[belles-lettres]]''), on the premise that not only is the content of such publications potentially questionable, but their very existence implied the anti-imperial idea that a Ukrainian nation could exist.

== Ems Ukaz ==

In the 1870s, the Kiev [[Hromada]] and the South-Western Branch of the Imperial [[Russian Geographic Society]] began to publish important works in Kiev, in Russian, about Ukrainian ethnography.  Authors included [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]], [[Volodymyr Antonovych]], [[Ivan Rudchenko]], and [[Pavlo Chubynsky]].  They held an Archaeological Congress in 1874, and published in the Russian-language paper ''Kievskiy telegraf''.

A member of the Geographic Society, [[Mikhail Yuzefovich]], sent two letters to [[St Petersburg]] warning of separatist activity.  [[Tsar Alexander II]] appointed an Imperial Commission on Ukrainophile Propaganda in the Southern Provinces of Russia, which found evidence of a danger to the state, and recommended extending the scope of the Valuyev decree.  While enjoying a spa in [[Bad Ems]], Germany, in May 1876, the Tsar signed what would come to be called the "Ems Ukaz", extending the [[publication ban]] to apply to all books and song [[lyrics]] in the "Little Russian dialect", and to prohibit the [[import]]ation of such materials.  Public lectures, plays, and song performances in Ukrainian were forbidden, suspect teachers removed from teaching, and presumably dangerous organizations and newspapers shut down.

The ukaz coincided with other actions against [[Culture of Ukraine|Ukrainian culture]]. Drahomanov and fellow activist [[Mykola Ziber]] were sacked from their posts at Kiev's [[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv|University of St Vladimir]], and emigrated along with other cultural leaders such as [[Fedir Vovk]] and [[Serhiy Podolynsky]].  The situation was exposed by professor Mykhailo Drahomanov at the 1878 Paris International Literary Congress.

In 1881, the new [[Tsar Alexander III]] amended the ukaz.  Ukrainian lyrics and dictionaries would be allowed, but the ''Kulishivka'' [[Ukrainian alphabet]] was still prohibited, and such publications would have to employ Russian orthography (disparagingly called the ''Yaryzhka'' by some Ukrainians, after the Russian letter [[yery]], ы).  Performance of Ukrainian plays and humorous songs could be approved by local authorities, but Ukrainian-only [[theatre]]s and troupes could not be established.

Many illegal performances and publications were delivered through ingenuity and [[bribery]], but Ukrainian cultural development practically ceased.

== Aftermath ==

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences]] recommended that the ukaz's restrictions be lifted. Ukrainian-language [[newspaper]]s began publication, ''[[Prosvita]]'' (‘Enlightenment’) educational societies were formed, some university professors lectured in Ukrainian, and the Orthodox bishop of the [[Podolia]] vicariate, Parfeniy Levytsky, allowed the language to be used in services and church schools there.

In 1910, concerned about potential revolutionary activity, Interior Minister [[Pyotr Stolypin]] restored the ukaz's restrictions and shut down the Prosvita societies and Ukrainian-language publications.  Russian-language press and intellectuals launched a campaign against the idea of Ukrainian autonomy or separatism.

Thus, self-aware Ukrainians remained a small intelligentsia in [[Dnieper Ukraine]], out of touch with a much larger rural population who lacked the opportunity for a cultural education.  Russian imperial ideology dominated the schools and the army, and the [[Russian language]] was the only one used for official business in the urban workplace, government offices, and public services.  In the meantime, Ukrainian self-identity would grow in Austro-Hungarian [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], out of reach of Russian imperial authorities.

The ukaz was never cancelled, but became void along with all other imperial Russian laws in the [[February Revolution]] of 1917–18. [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|After the Revolution]], Ukrainian language, education and culture was allowed to flower in the [[Ukrainian National Republic]], the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]], and under the [[Ukrainization#1923-1931: Early years of Soviet Ukraine|Ukrainization]] policies of [[Soviet Ukraine]] before 1931.

== Text of the ukaz ==
Excerpts from the Ukaz:

{{quote|The importation into the Russian Empire, without special permission of the Central Censorship over Printing, of all books and pamphlets in the [[Little Russia]]n dialect, published abroad, is forbidden,

The printing and publishing in the Empire of original works and translations in this dialect is forbidden with the exception of (a) historical documents and monuments; (b) works of [[belles-lettres]] but with the provision that in the documents the orthography of the originals be retained; in works of belles-lettres no deviations from the accepted [[Russian orthography]] are permitted and permission for their printing may be given only by the Central Censorship over Printing.

All theatrical performances and lectures in the Little Russian dialect, as well as printing of text to musical notes, are forbidden.|&lt;ref&gt;''Radians’kyi knyhar'' 1930, quoted in Luckyj 1990, pp 24–25. A full version, with five points addressed "for the Ministry of the Interior", five "for the Ministry of Education", and one "for the Third Section [secret police] of His Majesty's Supreme Chancellory" is published in Magocsi 1996, pp 372–3, translated from Savchenko 1970, p 381.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3281">Some family names contain clues as to their origin, like '''English surnames of Norman Origin'''.&lt;ref name=From/&gt;  William, [[Duke of Normandy]], successfully invaded England in 1066, and this invasion left a lasting legacy in the English language, in general, and in surnames, in particular.  

According to Christopher Daniell, in ''From Norman Conquest to Magna Carta'', 1140 marked what might be the first recorded use of a modern surname, inherited by multiple generations.  The sons of a Norman named Robert used a modern inheritable surname, ''[[FitzGerald (surname)|FitzGerald]]'', in honour of an earlier relative, named ''Gerald''.&lt;ref name=From/&gt;

According to Joslin Fiennes's ''Origins of English surnames'' modern surnames were not used until the fourteenth century:&lt;ref name=OriginsOfEnglishSurnames/&gt;
:{| class="wikitable"

:''"Surnames exploded into the records in the late fourteenth century, and document a unique history of ordinay medieval society during a short period of extraordinary social change.  The roots of the names tell you the language people spoke then. It is a well-stirred mix of Old English, Middle English and Norman French, with some Norse and Celt, in which it is English that dominates.  To see it in context, Norman French was the language of power and rank until Henry IV made English the tongue of kings at the end of the fourteenth century when most surnames already existed."''&lt;ref name=OriginsOfEnglishSurnames/&gt;
|}
Beginning in the late 1500s and peaking in the wake of the  Edict of Fontainebleau (1685), French [[Protestant]] refugees from [[France]], the [[Huguenots]], brought surnames like [[Dubarry (disambiguation)|Dubarry]], [[Duhamel (disambiguation)|Duhamel]] and [[Dupuy (surname)|Dupuy]], from [[Normandy]], into the English namespace, when the historical record shows these names had not been present prior to the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name=OriginsOfEnglishSurnames/&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Etymologicum Magnum''''' ({{lang-el|Ἐτυμολογικὸν Μέγα}}, ''Ἐtymologikὸn Mέga'') (standard abbreviation '''''EM''''', or '''''Etym. M.''''' in older literature) is the traditional title of a Greek lexical [[encyclopedia]] compiled at [[Constantinople]] by an unknown [[lexicographer]] around 1150 AD. It is the largest Byzantine lexicon and draws on many earlier grammatical, lexical and rhetorical works. Its main sources were two previous ''etymologica'', the so-called ''[[Etymologicum Genuinum]]'' and the ''[[Etymologicum Gudianum]]''. Other sources include [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], the ''Epitome'' of [[Diogenianus]], the so-called ''Lexicon'' Αἱμωδεῖν (''Haimōdeῖn''), Eulogius’ Ἀπορίαι καὶ λύσεις (''Ἀporίai kaὶ lύseis''), [[Georgius Choeroboscus|George Choeroboscus]]’ ''Epimerismi ad Psalmos'', the ''Etymologicon'' of [[Orion of Thebes]], and collections of [[Scholion|''scholia'']].&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897), 248–253, 351–352; Sturz (1820)&lt;/ref&gt; The compiler of the ''Etymologicum Magnum'' was not a mere copyist; rather he amalgamated, reorganised, augmented and freely modified his source material to create a new and individual work.

The ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the ''Etymologicum Magnum'' was published by [[Zacharias Calliergi|Zacharias Kallierges]] and [[Nikolaos Vlastos]] under the patronage of [[Anna Notaras]] at [[Venice]] in 1499. The typeface was designed and cut by Kallierges, modeled on his own handwriting. The decorative initial letters and headpieces are patterned on the decorations of the Byzantine manuscript tradition, and the woodcut borders incorporate elaborate arabesque designs, usually colored white on red, but also white on gold. The decorations of the Kallierges edition had a great influence in printing, especially on Greek liturgical books.&lt;ref&gt;Ecro Layton, ''Five Centuries of Books and Manuscripts in Modern Greek: A Catalogue of an Exhibition at the Houghton Library December 4, 1987, through February 17, 1988'' (Cambridge: Harvard College Library, 1990), pp. 39-41&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17979">{{other uses}}
A '''fact''' is something that is consistent with objective [[reality]] or that can be proven with [[evidence]]. The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability — that is whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to [[experience]]. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. [[Science|Scientific]] facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by [[experiments]] or other means.

== Etymology and usage ==
The word "fact" derives from the Latin ''factum'', and was first used in English with the same meaning: ''a thing done or performed'' a meaning now obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact". OED_2d_Ed_1989, (but note the conventional uses: ''after the fact'' and ''before the fact'').&lt;/ref&gt;  The common usage of "something that has really occurred or is the case" dates from the middle of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (1a). OED_2d_Ed_1989 Joye ''Exp. Dan.'' xi. Z vij b, ''Let emprours and kinges know this godly kynges fact. 1545''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact is sometimes used synonymously with ''[[truth]]'', as distinct from opinions, falsehoods, or matters of taste.  This use is found in such phrases as, "''It is a fact that the cup is blue"'' or "''Matter of fact"'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (4a) OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; and "...&amp;nbsp;not history, nor fact, but imagination." Filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]] distinguishes between the two, claiming that "Fact creates norms, and truth illumination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wernerherzog.com/52.html |title=Werner Herzog Film: Statements / Texts |publisher=Wernerherzog.com |date=1999-04-30 |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715011254/http://www.wernerherzog.com/52.html |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact also indicates a ''matter under discussion'' deemed to be true or correct, such as to emphasize a point or prove a disputed issue; (e.g., "...&amp;nbsp;the ''fact'' of the matter is ...").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6c). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(See also "Matter" (2,6). Compact_OED)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, ''fact'' may also indicate an ''allegation or stipulation'' of something that may or may not be a ''true fact'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (5). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., "the author's facts are not trustworthy"). This alternate usage, although contested by some, has a long history in standard English.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', "Fact has a long history of usage in the sense 'allegation'" AHD_4th_Ed. The OED dates this use to 1729.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact may also indicate findings derived through a ''process of evaluation'', including review of testimony, direct observation, or otherwise; as distinguishable from matters of inference or speculation.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6a). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; This use is reflected in the terms "fact-find" and "fact-finder" (e.g., "set up a [[fact-finding]] commission").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (8). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be checked by reason, experiment, personal experience, or may be argued from authority.  [[Roger Bacon]] wrote "If in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error, it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Bacon, translated by Robert Burke ''Opus Majus'', Book I, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==

In [[philosophy]], the concept ''fact'' is considered in [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]. Questions of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and truth are closely associated with questions of fact. A "fact" can be defined as something that is the case—that is, a [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;"A fact, it might be said, is a state of affairs that is the case or obtains." – [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/states-of-affairs/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. ''States of Affairs'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Wittgenstein, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]],'' Proposition 2: What is the case -- a fact -- is the existence of states of affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be understood as information that makes a true sentence true.&lt;ref&gt;"A fact is, traditionally, the worldly correlate of a true proposition, a state of affairs whose obtaining makes that proposition true." – ''Fact'' in The Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Facts may also be understood as those things to which a true sentence refers. The statement "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system" is ''about'' the fact Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Oliver, ''Fact'', in {{cite book
| title     = Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy

| publisher = Routledge, Oxford
| year      = 2005
| isbn        = 0-415-32495-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correspondence and the slingshot argument===

[[Pascal Engel|Pascal Engel's]] version of the [[correspondence theory of truth]] explains that what makes a sentence true is that it ''corresponds'' to a fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Truth
| first     = Pascal
| last      = Engel
| publisher = McGill-Queen's Press- MQUP
| year      = 2002
| isbn        = 0-7735-2462-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory presupposes the existence of an objective world.

The [[Slingshot argument]] claims to show that all true statements stand for the same thing - the [[truth value]] ''true''. If this argument holds, and facts are taken to be what true statements stand for, then we reach the counter-intuitive conclusion that there is only one fact - ''the truth''.&lt;ref&gt;The argument is presented in many places, but see for example [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]], ''Truth and Meaning'', in {{cite book
| title     = Truth and Interpretation
| first     = Donald
| last      = Davidson
| publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford
| year      = 1984
| isbn        = 0-19-824617-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compound facts===

Any non-trivial true statement about [[reality]] is necessarily an abstraction composed of a complex of [[object (philosophy)|objects]] and [[property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[logic of relatives|relations]].&lt;ref&gt;"Facts possess internal structure, being complexes of objects and properties or relations" Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the fact described by the true statement "[[Paris]] is the capital city of [[France]]" implies that there is such a place as Paris, there is such a place as France, there are such things as capital cities, as well as that France has a government, that the government of France has the power to define its capital city, and that the French government has chosen Paris to be the capital, that there is such a thing as a ''place'' or a ''government'', and so on.  The verifiable accuracy of all of these assertions, if facts themselves, may coincide to create the fact that Paris is the capital of France.

Difficulties arise, however, in attempting to identify the constituent parts of negative, modal, disjunctive, or moral facts.&lt;ref&gt;''Fact'', in ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', Ted Honderich, editor. (Oxford, 1995) {{ISBN|0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fact–value distinction===
{{main|Fact–value distinction}}
Moral philosophers since [[David Hume#Ethics|David Hume]] have debated whether values are objective, and thus factual. In ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' Hume pointed out there is no obvious way for a series of statements about what ''ought'' to be the case to be derived from a series of statements of what ''is'' the case. Those who insist there is a logical gulf between [[Fact-value distinction|facts and values]], such that it is fallacious to attempt to derive values from facts, include [[G. E. Moore]], who called attempting to do so the [[naturalistic fallacy]].

===Factual–counterfactual distinction===
{{main|Counterfactual conditional}}

Factuality—what has occurred—can also be contrasted with counterfactuality:
what ''might have'' occurred, but did not. A counterfactual conditional or subjunctive conditional is a conditional (or "if-then") statement indicating what ''would be'' the case if events had been other than they were. For example, "If Alexander had lived, his empire would have been greater than Rome." This contrasts with an indicative conditional, which indicates what ''is'' (in fact) the case if its antecedent ''is'' (in fact) true—for example, "If you drink this, it will make you well."

Such sentences are important to [[modal logic]], especially since the development of [[possible world]] semantics.

==In science==
{{further|scientific method|philosophy of science}}

In science, a ''fact'' is a repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experimentation or other means), also called [[empirical evidence]].  Facts are central to building [[scientific theories]].  Various forms of observation and measurement lead to fundamental questions about the [[scientific method]], and the scope and validity of [[Philosophy of science|scientific reasoning]].

In the most basic sense, a scientific ''fact'' is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a ''[[hypothesis]]'' or ''[[theory]]'', which is intended to explain or interpret facts.&lt;ref name="Gower000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Method: A Historical and Philosophical Introduction
| first     = Barry
| last      = Gower
| publisher = Routledge
| year      = 1997
| isbn        = 0-415-12282-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[scholars]] have offered significant refinements to this basic formulation.  Scientists are careful to distinguish between: 1) ''states of affairs'' in the external world and 2) ''assertions'' of fact that may be considered relevant in scientific analysis. The term is used in both senses in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Ravetz000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems
| first     = Jerome Raymond
| last      = Ravetz
| publisher = Transaction Publishers
| year      = 1996
| isbn        = 1-56000-851-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and clinical researchers in both the social and natural sciences have written about numerous questions and theories that arise in the attempt to clarify the fundamental nature of scientific fact.&lt;ref&gt;(Gower 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Pertinent issues raised by this inquiry include:
* the process by which "established fact" becomes recognized and accepted as such;&lt;ref&gt;(see e.g., Ravetz, p. 182 fn. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* whether and to what extent "fact" and "theoretic explanation" can be considered truly independent and separable from one another;&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gower, p. 138"&gt;Gower, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;
* to what extent "facts" are influenced by the mere act of observation;&lt;ref name="Gower, p. 138"/&gt; and
* to what extent factual conclusions are influenced by history and consensus, rather than a strictly systematic methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with the idea of [[confirmation holism]], some scholars assert "fact" to be necessarily "theory-laden" to some degree. [[Thomas Kuhn]] points out that knowing what facts to measure, and how to measure them, requires the use of other theories. For example, the age of [[fossils]] is based on [[radiometric dating]], which is justified by reasoning that radioactive decay follows a [[Poisson process]] rather than a [[Bernoulli process]]. Similarly, [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] is credited with the methodological position known as operationalism, which asserts that all observations are not only influenced, but necessarily defined by the means and assumptions used to measure them.

=== The scientific method ===
Apart from the fundamental inquiry into the nature of scientific fact, there remain the practical and social considerations of how fact is investigated, established, and substantiated through the proper application of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz p. 181 et. seq. (Chapter Six: "Facts and their evolution")&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific facts are generally believed independent of the observer: no matter who performs a scientific experiment, all observers agree on the outcome.&lt;ref name="The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine"&gt;Cassell, Eric J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=K1kjFYrliTMC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;ots=3V6-UmUFmP&amp;dq=%22scientific+fact&amp;sig=YtQTgNbisFSQ1QfV-JNkmW7D0n4#PPA181,M1 The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine] ''[[Oxford University Press]]''. Retrieved 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to these considerations, there are the social and institutional measures, such as peer review and accreditation, that are intended to promote ''factual accuracy'' (among other interests) in scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;(Ravetz 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In history ==
{{further|Historiography}}

A common rhetorical cliché states, "[[History is written by the winners]]." This phrase suggests but does not examine the use of facts in the writing of history.

[[E. H. Carr]] in his 1961 volume ''[[What is History?]]'' argues that the inherent biases from the gathering of facts makes the objective truth of any historical [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] [[idealistic]] and impossible. Facts are, "like fish in the Ocean," of which we may only happen to catch a few, only an indication of what is below the surface. Even a dragnet cannot tell us for certain what it would be like to live below the Ocean's surface. Even if we do not discard any facts (or fish) presented, we will always miss the majority; the site of our fishing, the methods undertaken, the weather and even luck play a vital role in what we will catch. Additionally, the composition of history is inevitably made up by the compilation of many different biases of fact finding - all compounded over time. He concludes that for a historian to attempt a more objective method, one must accept that history can only aspire to a conversation of the present with the past - and that one's methods of fact gathering should be openly examined.  Historical truth and facts therefore change over time, and reflect only the present consensus (if that).

Nevertheless, the principles described herein have analogous treatment in other legal systems (such as [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems) as well.&lt;/ref&gt; the general concept and analysis of fact reflects fundamental principles of [[jurisprudence]], and is supported by several well-established standards.&lt;ref name="Estrich000"&gt;{{cite book

=== Legal pleadings ===
{{main|Pleading}}
A party to a civil suit generally must clearly state all relevant allegations of fact that form the basis of a [[Claim (legal)|claim]]. The requisite level of precision and particularity of these allegations varies, depending on the rules of civil procedure and jurisdiction. Parties who face uncertainties regarding facts and circumstances attendant to their side in a dispute may sometimes invoke alternative pleading.&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. McDonald, ''Alternative Pleading in the United States: I'' Columbia Law Review, Vol. 52, No. 4 (Apr., 1952), pp. 443-478&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, a party may plead separate sets of facts that (when considered together) may be contradictory or mutually exclusive. This (seemingly) logically-inconsistent presentation of facts may be necessary as a safeguard against contingencies (such as ''[[res judicata]]'') that would otherwise preclude presenting a claim or defense that depends on a particular interpretation of the underlying facts.&lt;ref&gt;(McDonald 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feminist language reform''' or '''feminist language planning''' refers to the effort, often of political and [[grassroots]] movements, to change how [[language]] is used to [[gender]] people, activities and ideas on an [[individual]] and societal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liddicoat|first1=A.

== History ==
[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] activism and feminist authorship stemming from [[second-wave feminism|second wave feminism]] in the 1960s and 70s began to draw attention to [[gender bias]] in [[language]], including "the uncovering of the gendered nature of many linguistic rules and norms".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Linguistic Sexism and Feminist Linguistic Activism|last = Pauwels|first = Anne|date = 2003|journal = The Handbook and Language of Gender|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarship such as [[Dennis Baron|Dennis Baron's]] "Grammar and Gender" and Anne Bodine's "Androcentrism in Prescriptive Grammar" uncovered historical [[male]] regulation to promote [[Patriarchy|male-centric]] language such as the use of "[[he]]" as a generic pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Grammar and Gender|last = Baron|first = Dennis|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = New Haven, CT|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Androcentrism in prescriptive [[grammar]]: singular ‘they’, sex-indefinite ‘he’, and ‘he or she’|last = Bodine|first = Anne|date = 1975|journal = Language in Society|doi = 10.1017/s0047404500004607|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposition and analysis of [[sexism]] in language through a [[grassroots]] feminist linguistics movement continued throughout the 80's and 90's, including study across languages and [[Speech community|speech communities]] such as Germany and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender and Language in Germany|last = Leue|first = Elisabeth|date = 2000|journal = Journal of Contemporary Central and Eastern Europe|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The [[battle]] of [[feminism]] and bon usage: instituting nonsexist usage in French|last = Fleischman|first = S.|date = 1997|journal = French Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Study and documentation of gendered language has since spread to cover over 30 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender across languages The linguistic representation of women and men|last = Hellinger|first = M.|publisher = John Benjamin's Publishing Company|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Amsterdam, The Netherlands|pages = Preface|last2 = Bußmann|first2 = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist language planning has more recently been instituted centrally in countries such as [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Australia]], with mixed results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Sweden have made strides towards shifting their language to fit a less misogynistic society. In the Swedish language, there has never been a word for the female genitalia or even a translation of the word “vagina”, even though the word ''snopp'' translates to “penis” and has been used as such since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through history, there have been many slang terms used for the woman’s genitalia, including words such as ''fitta'' translated to “cunt”, ''där nere'' translated to “down-there”, and even ''mus'' translated to “mouse”. In the 1990s, Swedish media started to bring the absence of such a word to light. It wasn’t until the early 2000s did the feminists and activists start using the word ''snippa'' to be identified with the female genitalia. ''Snippa''’s origins can be traced back to many different Swedish dialects. It’s popular definition “refers to something small and/or narrow, for example a small pike or a narrow boat”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In regards to genitalia, “it might have been used to refer to female genitalia of cows and pigs in the early twentieth century”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the popularization of using the word ''Snippa,'' the Swedish Academy added the word to the 2006 Swedish Language Dictionary.

Some language reformers directly work with identifying and changing sexist undertones and patriarchal vocabulary through a method called “linguistic disruption”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; An example: In the United States, the word “herstory” became popularized “to refer to history which is not only about men”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Sweden has also showed efforts in language planning regarding changing misogynistic undertones in their vocabulary. The Swedish Association for Sexuality Education has promoted the word ''slidkrans'' to replace the word for “hymen”, ''mödomshinna.'' “The new word, ''slidkrans'', is made up of the two parts ''slid'', translating to “vaginal” and ''krans'', translating to “garland”. It lacks the connotations of the ideology of virginity and honour attached to mödomshinna.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Additionally, Sweden has also shown efforts in accepting more of a non-gender binary identity by creating the gender-neutral pronoun ''hen,'' which has been used by feminists and the LGBT community. Feminist language reform regarding gender is not of recent efforts. Early feminist language reformists have been fighting the male-dominant approach to language and raising awareness to the public about the gendered structure of the society’s language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An interdisciplinary bibliography on language, gender, and sexuality|last=Motschenbacher|first=Heiko|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=2012|isbn=9789027273154|location=|pages=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has been identified as a nation that officially promotes the feminist influence to its public bureaucracy by implementing feminist language reform across many institutions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winter|first=Jo|date=December 23, 2010|title='Trajectories of Agency' and Discursive Identities in Education: A Critical Site in Feminist Language Planning|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.2167/cilp093.0#tabModule|journal=Current Issues in Language Planning|volume=|pages=171–198|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this planned social shift, Australia has seen changes in political and government leadership that aim to interfere with this reform, such as a shift towards a conservative-leaning government.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are shifts that come from such movements that support them as well, such as the gender-neutral pronoun “they” being more widely accepted.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

The ongoing feminist movement acknowledges language as a “powerful instrument of patriarchy”.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pauwels|first=Anne|date=1999-11-14|title=Feminist Language Planning: Has it been worthwhile?|url=https://bop.unibe.ch/linguistik-online/article/view/1043|journal=Linguistik Online|language=de-DE|volume=2|issue=1|issn=1615-3014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals set for linguistic reform aim to achieve linguistic equality of the sexes. A study of Australian newspapers from 1992 and 1996 found that the word “chairman” was used to describe all people holding the position, including women.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; This is an example of a linguistic issue that feminist’s seek to reform. Occupational nomenclature reflects gender bias when “professional nomenclature used in employment-related contexts displays bias in favour of men leading to women’s invisibility in this area.”&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; The invisibility of women is a linguistic feminist issue because when encountering sentences predominantly using male pronouns, listeners are more likely to think of men before women and therefore women get overlooked.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Positions are gendered to be male and the “continuing, frequent use reflects the fact that far more men than women continue to occupy this position.”&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; This study further investigated and found instances of female professionals being specified as women while men would just be titled with the profession itself, for example “female judge,” “woman engineer,” and “woman politician.”&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
Switzerland has attempted to implement feminist language reform both formally and informally. However, changes in Switzerland have proven to be complicated due to the fact that Switzerland is a multilingual country (with the major languages being German, French, and Italian). The Bulletin Suisse de Linguistique Appliquée (Swiss Bulletin of Applied Linguistics) addressed this issue in 2000 when it created a special issue dedicated to the feminization of language in Switzerland. The bulletin attempted to critique language in Switzerland by creating a composite image of all the languages in Switzerland and how they interact with gender.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mucchi-Faina|first=Angelica|date=March 1, 2005|title=Visible or influential? Language reforms and gender (in)equality|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0539018405050466|journal=Social Science Information|volume=44|pages=10|via=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly spoken language in Switzerland is German. German is a gendered language. This has concerned some language activists due to the fact that many important societal position such as judge and professor possess the gender of male and are often referred to as he/him. Activists worry that the gendering of those words discourage women from entering those fields. This facet of the German language is particularly important in Switzerland because it was historically used as a justification to restrict women’s right to vote and pass the bar.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=zzW5dqN8NiUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=switzerland+feminist+language+reform&amp;ots=fyNietMHbk&amp;sig=JVv4_W11OgUfYCSM5trQ16-Ky5g#v=onepage&amp;q=switzerland&amp;f=false|title=Social Communication|last=Fiedler|first=Klaus|date=2011-03-15|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781136872426|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various attempts to implement feminist language reform have been undertaken in German speaking Switzerland. The government and other organizations have attempted to implement language feminization in the realms of policy making, teaching, advertising, etc.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Language feminization refers to when in writing or talking traditional male words are feminized by either using the feminine variant of the word or adding a feminine suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=mINlCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2635&amp;lpg=PA2635&amp;dq=feminization+%22abstract+nouns%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p4RDWcmlbX&amp;sig=Q4QgBWuZOuhR6JYYfRCgYWhJKRw&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig_t6AiPPPAhXCLMAKHYZrCoUQ6AEILzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=feminization%20%22abstract%20nouns%22&amp;f=false|title=Word-Formation: An International Handbook of the Languages of Europe|date=2016-01-15|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=9783110379082|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these attempts have had only limited success. For example, private Swiss radio and television broadcasts still generally use the generic-masculine form of words.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The second most commonly spoken language in Switzerland is French which is also a gendered language. The French language raises similar concerns to that of the German language. This is because many nouns (especially those of professions) are gendered. To address these concerns, the Swiss government has created a guide on the non-sexist use of the French language. However, these attempts at change have been met with little success. This is due to the fact that Switzerland has limited influence over the French language. Meanwhile, France and specifically the government backed Académie Française (French Academy) (the French council for matters relating to the French language) has resisted feminist language reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleischman|first=Suzanne|date=1997|title=The Battle of Feminism and Bon Usage: Instituting Nonsexist Usage in French|jstor=398544|journal=The French Review|volume=70|issue=6|pages=834–844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
The main focus of Feminist Language Reform is to acknowledge the often unconscious ways that language both silences and emphasizes gender in negative ways. In some languages it is clear with gendered nouns how some words are gendered to associate those words with maleness of femaleness. [[Feminist philosophy|Feminist Philosophers]] argue that English, a non gendered language, still has the need for Language Reform.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/feminism-language/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Saul|first=Jennifer|last2=Diaz-Leon|first2=Esa|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous [[language reform]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; attempts to avoid [[Sexism|sexist]] words or phrases were addressed in a [[Symptomatic treatment|symptomatic]] manner. Often in the workplace, employees were given pamphlets with lists of words to avoid or preferred words to use. Many [[Fourth-wave feminism|modern day feminists]] argue that this is ineffective because it does not address the root of the problem or make the large scale changes to the language that they feel are necessary.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=553f6fea-4b9e-4fff-af20-4d1bbc51bb3c@sessionmgr102&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=edsgcl.16476233&amp;db=edsglr|title=Nonsexist language reform and 'political correctness.': Discovery Service for Loyola Marymount Univ|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major part of the theory focuses on when words or phrases make one gender, typically women, subjugated or invisible compared to the other. The most popular examples are the pronoun “he” or the word “man”. Feminist Language Philosophers argue that these words participate in making women invisible by having them being used to refer to men and also women. The fact that the pronouns or words for the male [[gender]] can be also used to refer to the female [[gender]] shows how maleness is dominant and femaleness is subjugated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Feminist Language Theory also focuses on when words or phrases emphasize a break in [[Gender role|gender norms]]. Clear examples of this are words like Lady Doctor or Manageress. These are positions of power that are typically held by men. Therefore, when a woman holds them, they need a new title to emphasize their break of social norm.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It also goes both ways, with terms like male nurse referring to a man in a typically feminine role. Feminist Language Reform seeks to remove words like this because they help to sustain unhealthy gender norms.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Some modern [[Feminism|feminists]], like Sergio Bolaños Cuellar, argue that feminist language reforms needs to reverse the generic masculine forms and create a generic feminine form with words like he or man being replaced with she or woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolaños Cuéllar|first=Sergio|date=2006-06-01|title=Women's language: a struggle to overcome inequality|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238766777_Women's_language_a_struggle_to_overcome_inequality|journal=Forma y Función}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
Cases of feminist language [[plan]]ning have taken a largely [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] approach in which the goal is to enact [[social change]] through the reform of language and language use.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This approach to [[language planning]] is divided into four stages:

# '''Fact-finding''' in which language [[:wikt:issue|issues]] are identified and [[report]]ed.
# '''Planning''' in which [[solution]]s to the issue are proposed.
# '''Implementation''' in which agreed upon methods are [[test (assessment)|tested]] and the final solution implemented.
# '''Evaluation and Feedback''' in which the results of the [[plan]] are assessed for effectiveness and the overall affects of the plan are evaluated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Living with Patriarchy : Discursive Constructions of Gendered Subjects across Cultures|last = Majstorovic|first = Danijela|publisher = John Benjamins Publishing Company|year = 2011|isbn = 9789027206367|location = |pages = 74|last2 = Lassen|first2 = Inger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fix-up''' (or '''fixup''') is a [[novel]] created from several [[short fiction]] stories that may or may not have been initially related or previously published. The stories may be edited for consistency, and sometimes new connecting material, such as a [[frame story]] or other interstitial narration, is written for the new work. The term was coined by the [[science fiction]] writer [[A. E. van Vogt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinberg|first1=Robert|title=A. E. van Vogt: The Weinberg Interview (1980)|url=http://www.icshi.net/sevagram/interviews/weinberg.php|website=Icshi.net|publisher=Isaac Walwyn|accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who published several fix-ups of his own, including ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'',&lt;ref name="liptak20130805"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Liptak |first=Andrew |date=2013-08-05 |title=A.E. van Vogt and the Fix-Up Novel |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/e-van-vogt-and-fix-novel/ |magazine=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the practice (if not the term) exists outside of science fiction. The use of the term in science fiction criticism was popularised by the first (1979) edition of the ''[[Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', edited by [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]], which credited Van Vogt with the creation of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nicholls | first = Peter |author2=John Clute| title = New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction | publisher = Orbit | location = London | year = 1999 | isbn = 1-85723-897-4 | page = 432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/fixup|title=Fixup page at Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (Third Edition)|website=Encyclopedia of Science Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name comes from the modifications that the author needs to make in the original texts to make them fit together as though they were a novel. Foreshadowing of events from the later stories may be jammed into an early chapter of the fix-up, and character development may be interleaved throughout the book. Contradictions and inconsistencies between episodes are usually worked out.

Some fix-ups in their final form are more of a [[short story cycle]] or composite novel rather than a traditional novel with a single main plotline. Examples are [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' and [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[I, Robot]]'', both of which read as a series of short stories which may share plot threads and characters but which still act as self-contained stories.&lt;ref name="luscher"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WyidbsLaxQC&amp;lpg=PA370&amp;ots=mnc_goAXNW&amp;pg=PA370#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=A Companion to the American Novel |last=Luscher |first=Robert M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2012 |isbn=9781405101196 |editor-last=Bendixen |editor-first=Alfred |editor-link=Alfred Bendixen |series=Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture |volume=80 |page=370 |chapter=The American Short-Story Cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, van Vogt's ''[[The Weapon Shops of Isher]]'' is structured like a continuous novel although it incorporates material from three previous Van Vogt short stories.

Fix-ups became an accepted practice in the 1950s, when science fiction and [[fantasy]]—once published only in magazines—began appearing in book form. Large book publishers like [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] entered the market, greatly increasing demand for fiction. Authors created new manuscripts from old stories to sell to publishers. [[Algis Budrys]] in 1965 described fixups as a consequence of the lack of good supply during the "bad years for quality" of the mid-1950s, although citing ''The Martian Chronicles'' and [[Clifford D. Simak]]'s ''[[City (novel)|City]]'' as among exceptions.&lt;ref name="budrys196510"&gt;{{Cite magazine

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49638">The '''Hopi time controversy''' is the academic debate about how the [[Hopi language]] grammaticalizes the concept of time, and about whether the differences between the ways the English and Hopi languages describe time are an example of [[linguistic relativity]] or not. In popular discourse the debate is often framed as a question about whether the [[Hopi people|Hopi]] "had a concept of time", despite it now being well established that they do.

The debate originated in the 1940s when American linguist [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] argued that the Hopi conceptualized time differently from the [[Standard Average European]] speaker, and that this difference correlated with grammatical differences between the languages.{{sfn|Carroll|1956}} Whorf argued that Hopi has "no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call 'time'", and concluded that the Hopi had "no general notion or intuition of time as a smooth flowing continuum in which everything in the universe proceeds at equal rate, out of a future, through the present, into a past".{{sfn|Whorf|1956b|p=57}} Whorf used the Hopi concept of time as a primary example of his concept of linguistic relativity, which posits that the way in which individual languages encode information about the world, influences and correlates with the cultural [[world view]] of the speakers.  Whorf's relativist views fell out of favor in [[linguistics]] and [[anthropology]] in the 1960s, but Whorf's statement lived on in the popular literature often in the form of an [[urban myth]] that "the Hopi have no concept of time". In 1983 linguist [[Ekkehart Malotki]] published a 600-page study of the [[grammatical tense|grammar of time]] in the Hopi language, concluding that he had finally refuted Whorf's claims about the language.{{sfn|Malotki|1983}} Malotki's treatise gave hundreds of examples of Hopi words and grammatical forms referring to temporal relations. Malotki's central claim was that the Hopi do indeed conceptualize time as structured in terms of an ego-centered spatial progression from past, through present into the future. He also demonstrated that the Hopi language grammaticalizes tense using a distinction between future and non-future tenses, as opposed to the English tense system, which is usually analyzed as being based on a past/non-past distinction. Many took Malotki's work as a definitive refutation of the linguistic relativity hypothesis.{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006}} Linguist and specialist in the linguistic typology of tense [[Bernard Comrie]] concluded that "Malotki's presentation and argumentation are devastating".{{sfn|Comrie|1984|p=132}} Psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], a well-known critic of Whorf and the concept of linguistic relativity, accepted Malotki's claims as having demonstrated Whorf's complete ineptitude as a linguist.{{sfn|Pinker|1994|p=63}}

Subsequently the study of linguistic relativity was revived using new approaches in the 1990s,{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}}{{sfn|Reines|Prinze|2009}} and Malotki's study came under criticism from relativist linguists and anthropologists, who did not consider that the study invalidated Whorf's claims.{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006}}{{sfn|Lee|1996}}{{sfn|Lee|1991}}{{sfn|Leavitt|2011|p=180-88}} The main issue of contention is the interpretation of Whorf's original claims about Hopi, and what exactly it was that he was claiming made Hopi different from what Whorf called "[[Standard Average European]]" languages.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}} Some consider that the Hopi language may be best described as a [[tenseless language]], and that the distinction between non-future and future posited by Malotki may be better understood as a distinction between ''realis'' and ''irrealis'' [[grammatical mood|moods]].{{sfn|Comrie|1984}} Regardless of exactly how the Hopi concept of time is best analyzed, most specialists agree with Malotki that all humans conceptualize time by an analogy with space, although some recent studies have also questioned this.{{sfn|Evans|2004}}{{sfn|Sinha|Sinha|Zinken|Sampaio|2011}}

==The Hopi language==
The [[Hopi language]] is a [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American language]] of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language family]], which is spoken by some 5,000 [[Hopi people]] in the [[Hopi Reservation]] in Northeastern [[Arizona]], US.

In the large ''[[Hopi Dictionary: Hopìikwa Lavàytutuveni|Hopi dictionary]]'' there is no word exactly corresponding to the English noun "time". Hopi employs different words to refer to "a duration of time" (''pàasa''' "for that long"), to a point in time (''pàasat'' "at that time"), and time as measured by a clock (''pahàntawa''), as an occasion to do something (''hisat'' or ''qeni''), a turn or the appropriate time for doing something (''qeniptsi'' (noun)), and to have time for something (''aw nánaptsiwta'' (verb)).{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=854}}

Time reference can be marked on verbs using the suffix ''-ni''
:''Momoyam piktota'' "The women are/were making ''[[piki]]''"
: Women piki-make
:''Momoyam piktota-ni''''' "The women will be making ''piki''"{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=878}}
:Women piki-make-NI

The -ni suffix is also used in the word ''naato'''ni'''qa'' which means "that which will happen yet" in reference to the future. This word is formed from the adverb ''naato'' "yet", the ''-ni'' suffix and the clitic -qa that forms a [[relative clause]] with the meaning "that which...".{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=281}}

The -''ni'' suffix is also obligatory on the main verb in [[Conditional mood|conditional]] clauses:{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=155}}

:''Kur nu' pam tuwa nu' wuuvata-ni''''' "if I see him I'll run away"{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=155}}
:If I him see I run-NI

The suffix is also used in conditional{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=157}} clauses referring to a past context then often combined with the particle ''as'' that carries past tense or [[Counterfactual thinking|counterfactual]] meaning, or describes unachieved intent:{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=143}}
:''Pam nuy tuwáq nu' so'on as wayaa'''ni''''' "If he had seen me I wouldn't have run"{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=157}}
:he me see I Neg Past/Counterfact. run-NI

:''Nu' sayti'''ni''''' "I will smile"{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=143}}
:I smile-NI

:''Nu' as sayti'''ni''''' "I tried to smile/I should smile/I wanted to smile/I was going to smile"{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=143}}
:I Past/Counterfact. smile

The suffix ''-ngwu'' describes actions taking place habitually or as a general rule.
:''Tömö' taawa tatkyaqw yáma'''ngwu''''' "In the winter the sun rises in the southeast"{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=878}}

==Benjamin Lee Whorf==
Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897–1941), a fire prevention engineer by profession, studied Native American linguistics from an early age. He corresponded with many of the greatest scholars of his time, such as [[Alfred Tozzer]] at Harvard and Herbert Spinden of the American Museum of Natural History. They were impressed with his work on the linguistics of the [[Nahuatl language]] and encouraged him to participate professionally and to undertake field research in Mexico. In 1931 [[Edward Sapir]], the foremost expert on Native American languages, started teaching at [[Yale University|Yale]], close to where Whorf lived, and Whorf signed up for graduate-level classes with Sapir, becoming one of his most respected students.{{sfn|Carroll|1956|p=''passim''}} Whorf took a special interest in the [[Hopi language]] and started working with Ernest Naquayouma, a speaker of Hopi from Toreva village on the [[Second Mesa]] of the [[Hopi Reservation]] in [[Arizona]], who was living in the [[Manhattan]] borough of New York City. At this time it was common for linguists to base their descriptions of a language on data from a single speaker. Whorf credited Naquayouma as the source of most of his information on the Hopi language, although in 1938 he took a short field trip to the village of Mishongnovi on the [[Second Mesa]], collecting some additional data.&lt;ref name="Dinwoodie"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Dinwoodie|2006|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whorf published several articles on Hopi grammar, focusing particularly on the ways in which the grammatical categories of Hopi encoded information about events and processes, and how this correlated with aspects of Hopi culture and behavior. After his death his full sketch of Hopi grammar was published by his friend the linguist [[Harry Hoijer]], and some essays on Native American linguistics, many of which had been previously published in academic journals, were published in 1956 in the anthology ''Language, Thought, and Reality'' by his friend psychologist [[John Bissell Carroll]].{{sfn|Carroll|1956}}

===Whorf on Hopi time===
Whorf's most frequently cited statement regarding Hopi time is the strongly worded introduction of his 1936 paper "An American Indian model of the Universe", which was first published posthumously in Carroll's edited volume. Here he writes that

{{quote|I find it gratuitous to assume that a Hopi who knows only the Hopi language and the cultural ideas of his own society has the same notions, often supposed to be intuitions, of time and space as we have, and that are generally assumed to be universal. In particular he has no notion or intuition of {{Smallcaps|time}} as a smooth flowing continuum in which everything in the universe proceeds at an equal rate, out of a future into a present and into a past&amp;nbsp;.... After a long and careful analysis the Hopi language is seen to contain no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call 'time', or to past, present or future ...|{{harvcoltxt|Whorf|1956b|p=57}}}}

Whorf argues that in Hopi units of time are not represented by nouns, but by adverbs or verbs. Whorf argues that all Hopi nouns include the notion of a boundary or outline, and that consequently the Hopi language does not refer to abstract concepts with nouns. This, Whorf argues, is encoded in Hopi grammar, which does not allow durations of time to be counted in the same way objects are. So instead of saying, for example, "three days", Hopi would say the equivalent of "on the third day", using ordinal numbers. Whorf argues that the Hopi do not consider the process of time passing to produce another new day, but merely as bringing back the daylight aspect of the world.{{sfn|Whorf|1956e|pp=148-52}}

====Hopi as a tenseless language====
Whorf gives slightly different analyses of the grammatical encoding of time in Hopi in his different writings. His first published writing on Hopi grammar was the paper "The punctual and segmentative aspects of verbs in Hopi", published in 1936 in ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'', the journal of the [[Linguistic Society of America]].{{sfn|Whorf|1956a}} Here Whorf analyzed Hopi as having a tense system with a distinction between three tenses: one used for past or present events (which Whorf calls the ''Factual'' tense or ''present-past''); one for future events; and one for events that are generally or universally true (here called ''usitative''). This analysis was repeated in a 1937 letter to J. B. Carroll, who later published it as part of his selected writings under the title "Discussion of Hopi Linguistics".{{sfn|Whorf|1956c|p=103|quote="There are three tenses: past (i.e. past up to and including the present), future and generalized (that which is generally, universally or timelessly true), all of which are mutually exclusive"}}

In the 1938 paper "Some verbal categories of Hopi", also published in ''Language'', Whorf abandoned the word "tense" in the description of Hopi and described the distinction previously called "tense" with the label "assertions". Whorf described assertions as a system of categories that describe the speaker's claim of [[epistemic]] validity of his own statement. The three "assertions" of Hopi described by Whorf are the ''Reportive'', ''Expective'' and ''Nomic'' forms of the Hopi verb. Whorf acknowledges that these "translate more or less [as] the English tenses", but maintains that these forms do not refer to time or duration, but rather to the speaker's claim of the validity of the statement.{{sfn|Whorf|1938|p=276|quote="What we call present tense (not counting our present form which corresponds to the nomic) is from the Hopi standpoint simply a report to others concerning a situation shared with them, this report being either redundant information, or used to call attention to, or tell about some fragment of the situation not fully shared. Thus to the Hopi 'he is running'
need not be different from 'he was running', for if both the speaker and listener can see the runner then the 'is' of the former sentence means merely that the listener can see for himself what he is being told; he is being given redundant information, and this is the only difference from the latter sentence."}} The reportive form is unmarked, whereas the expective form is marked with the verbal suffix ''-ni'', and the nomic form with the suffix ''-ŋʷi''. In Whorf's analysis, by using the reportive form the speaker claims that the event has in fact occurred or is still occurring, whereas by using the expective form the speaker describes an expectation of a future event. Whorf says that the expective can be used to describe events in the past, giving the meaning of "was going to" or "would".{{sfn|Whorf|1938|pp=276-278}}

In the 1940 article "Science and Linguistics", Whorf gave the same three-way classification based on the speaker's assertion of the validity of his statement: "The timeless Hopi verb does not distinguish between the present, past and future of the event itself but must always indicate what type of validity the {{smallcaps|speaker}} intends the statement to have: a. report of an event .. b. expectation of an event ..; generalization or law about events."{{sfn|Whorf|1956f|p=217}}

In his full sketch of Hopi grammar published posthumously in 1946, Whorf also described how adverbial particles contributed to the linguistic description of time in Hopi.{{sfn|Whorf|1946}} He posited two subclasses of adverbs called ''temporals'' and ''tensors'', which were used in sentences to locate events in time. A central claim in Whorf's work on linguistic relativity was that for the Hopi units of time were not considered objects that can be counted like most of the comparable English words that are described by [[noun]]s (''a day'', ''an hour'' etc.). He argued that only the Hopi word for "year" was a noun, the words for days and nights were ambivalent between noun and verbs, but that all other cyclic events and periods were described by adverbial particles used as modifiers for the sentence {{sfn|Whorf|1946|p=165|quote="Names of cyclic events and time periods, like summer, morning, full moon are in the class of temporals, a kind of adverbs. They mean e.g. "when it is summer" and are used to qualify predicates. They are not used as subjects, objects or at all as nouns."}}
&lt;!--(temporals and tensors are a subclass of the analytic word class (adverbial particles))
aspect (Add to this that these aspects may compound together, and that all but the durative and continuative handle ideas that are utterly strange, to English or indeed Indo-European...{{sfn|Whorf|1946|p=175}}): ingressive punctual or punctualizing (moment of completion, passage from latency into manifestation), and tensive or tensivizing, durative, segmentative (repeating), --&gt;

===Whorf's inspiration from Einsteinian physics===
In his interpretation of Hopi time Whorf was influenced by [[Einstein]]'s theory of relativity, which was developed in the first decades of the century and impacted the general Zeitgeist.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Heynick 1983 "From Einstein to Whorf: space, time, matter and reference frames in physical and linguistic relativity." Semiotica, 45 (1-2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Whorf, an engineer by profession, in fact made occasional reference to physical relativity, and he adopted the term "linguistic relativity," reflecting the general concept of the different but equally valid interpretations of some aspects of physical reality by different observers due to differences in their (for Einstein) physical circumstances or (for Whorf) their psychological-linguistic circumstances.

The most salient points involve the concepts of ''simultaneity'' and ''spacetime''. In his [[Annus Mirabilis Papers#Special relativity|1905 Special Relativity]] paper, Einstein maintained that two given events can legitimately be called simultaneous if and only if they take place at the same point in time '''and''' in the same point in space. No two events which take place at a spatial distance from one another can legitimately be declared to be simultaneous in any absolute sense, for the judgement of simultaneity or non-simultaneity will depend on the physical circumstances (to be exact: the relative motion) of the observers. This difference is no artifact; each of the observers is correct (and is wrong only to the extent he or she insists that another observer is incorrect).

[[Hermann Minkowski]], in his seminal 1908 address to the Congress of German Physicists, translated Einstein's 1905 mathematical equations into geometric terms. Minkowski famously declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Spatial distance and temporal distance between any two events was now replaced by a single absolute distance in spacetime.

Heynick points to several passages in Whorf's writings on the Hopis which parallel Einsteinian concepts such as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"time varies with each observer and does not permit of simultaneity" (1940)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Hopi metaphysics does not raise the question whether the things at a distant village exist at the same moment as those in one's own village, for it ... says that any 'events' in the distant village can be compared to any events in one's own village only by an interval of magnitude that has both time and space forms in it." (c.1936) &lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.42. Heynick is careful to point out that he has selectively cited such passages and that in the broader context of Whorf's writing it would be inaccurate to assume that Whorf simply presents the Hopis as pre-Einstein Einsteins in their conception of time.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of a "simultaneous now" throughout the cosmos was formulated by [[Aristotle]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and most succinctly in [[John Locke]]'s ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1690):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"For this moment is common to all things that are now in being ... they all exist in the same moment of time."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whorf saw this notion as derived from the Standard Average European languages in which these thinkers thought: "Newtonian space, time, and matter are no intuitions. They are recepts from culture and language. That is where Newton got them."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heynick, who claimed no personal knowledge of the Hopi language, posits alternative weaker and stronger interpretations of the influence of Einsteinian relativity on Whorf's analysis of the Hopi language and the Hopi concept of time. In the weaker version, the (then) new questioning of the nature of time and space brought about by the Einsteinian revolution in physics enabled Whorf to approach the Hopis and their language unburdened by traditional Western concepts and presumptions. The stronger version is that Whorf under the influence of Einstein tended inadvertently to "read into" his linguistic and cultural data relativistic concepts where they perhaps were not.&lt;ref&gt;Heynick also analyzes Whorf's concepts of "eventing" and the nature of matter in the language of the Hopis (and the Nooktas), and their parallels in modern physics. These relate only peripherally to the Hopi time controversy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The myth of the timeless Hopi==
Whorf died in 1941, but his ideas took on their own life in academia and in the popular discourse on Native Americans. In 1958 [[Stuart Chase]]—an economist and engineer at MIT who had followed Whorf's ideas with great interest, but whom Whorf himself considered utterly incompetent and incapable of understanding the nuances of his ideas{{sfn|Lee|1996|p=16}}—published "Some things worth knowing: a generalist's guide to useful knowledge". Here he repeated Whorf's claim about Hopi time, but arguing that because of the Hopi view of time as a process, they were better able to understand the concept of time as a [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]].{{sfn|Deutscher|2010|p=141-43}} Similarly, even scientists were intrigued by the thought that the idea of spatio-temporal unity that had taken [[Albert Einstein]] seven years to ponder, was readily available to the Hopi, simply because of the grammar of their language.{{sfn|Livingston|1963|p=16}}

In 1964 [[John Greenway (folklorist)|John Greenway]] published a humorous portrait of American culture, ''The Inevitable Americans'', in which he wrote: "You have a watch, because Americans are obsessed with time. If you were a Hopi Indian, you would have none, the Hopi have no concept of time".{{sfn|Greenway|1964|p=9}} And even the 1971 ethnography of the Hopi by Euler and Dobyns claimed that "The English concept of time is nearly incomprehensible to the Hopi".{{sfn|Euler|Dobyns|1971|p=21}} The myth quickly became a staple element of [[New Age]] conceptualizations of the Hopi.{{sfn|Geertz|1994}}

==Max Black and Helmut Gipper==
In 1959 philosopher [[Max Black]] published a critique of Whorf's arguments in which he argued that the principle of linguistic relativity was obviously wrong because translation between languages is always possible, even when there are no exact correspondences between the single words or concepts in the two languages.{{sfn|Black|1959}}

German linguist and philosopher Helmut Gipper had studied with the neo-[[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldtian]] linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]] and had a basically Kantian understanding of the relation between language and thought. [[Immanuel Kant]] considered the categories of time and space to be universals underlying all human thinking.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011|pp=179-180, 186-87}} Whorf's argument that the Hopi do not conceive of time and space as speakers of [[Indo-European languages]] do clashed with this basic understanding of cognition. Gipper went to the Hopi reservation to collect data for a general critique of Whorf's principle of linguistic relativity published in 1972. His critique included a refutation of Whorf's Hopi arguments. Gipper showed that the Hopi could refer to time, by juxtaposing Hopi phrases with their German equivalents that used words referring to units of time and to distinctions between past and present. Gipper also argued that several time intervals were described by nouns, and that these nouns could take the role of syntactic subject or object, in contradiction of Whorf's explicit statement. He argues that Whorf's assertion that intervals of time are not counted in the same way as objects is "questionable".{{sfn|Gipper|1972}}

==Ekkehart Malotki==
[[Ekkehart Malotki]] studied with Gipper at the [[University of Münster|Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität]] at [[Münster]] and his work was a continuation of his mentor's, spurred on by the frequent claims in the popular literature that "the Hopi have no concept of time". Malotki conducted four years of research on the [[Third Mesa]], studying Hopi spatial and temporal reference. He published two large volumes, one in German, ''Hopi-Raum''{{sfn|Malotki|1979}} [Hopi space] and one in English, ''Hopi Time''.{{sfn|Malotki|1983}} For Malotki it was imperative to demonstrate two facts in contradiction of Whorf's claims: 1. that the Hopi language has an abundance of terms, words and constructions that refer to time. 2. that the Hopi do cognitively conceptualize time in analogy with physical space, using spatial metaphors to describe durations and units of time. He also wanted to demonstrate that Whorf misanalyzed several particularities regarding specific Hopi words and expressions. Malotki states that a main goal is to present "actual Hopi language data", since when he was writing very little textual data in Hopi had been published, and Whorf's publications were largely without text examples.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=629}}

===''Hopi Time'' (1983)===
Most of ''Hopi Time'' is dedicated to the detailed description of the Hopi usage of words and constructions related to time. Malotki describes in detail the usage of a large amount of linguistic material:  temporal adverbs, time units, time counting practices such as the Hopi calendar, the way that days are counted and time is measured.

The first part of the book describes "spatio-temporal metaphors"; in it he shows several deictic adverbs that are used both to reference distance in space and in time, such as the word ''ep'' that means both "there" and "then". In the second chapter he describes the way in which the Hopi talk about units of time. He argues that in some contexts, specifically those of the ceremonial cycle, the Hopi do count days, using compound words such as ''payistala'' "the third day (of a ceremony)" composed of the morphemes ''paayo'' "three", ''s'' "times" and ''taala''' "day/light", meaning literally "three-times-day".{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=246}} He also shows that the Hopi reckon time through the movement of the sun, having distinct words for the different degrees of light during the dawn and dusk periods. He also notes that the feeling of time passing can be described by saying "the sun moves slowly/quickly". Parts 3, 4, 5, and 6 describe Hopi time-keeping practices using the sun relative to the horizon, using the stars, the ceremonial calendar and the use of time-keeping devices such as knotted strings or notched sticks with a mark or knot for every day, sun-hole alignment and shadow observation. The eighth chapter describes the temporal particles that Whorf defined as temporals and tensors. He argues that Whorf's descriptions are vague and alienating.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=531}}

====Malotki on tense in Hopi====
The concept of Hopi tense is covered in the last part of chapter 9, titled "miscellaneous", and in the conclusion. Malotki follows Gipper in arguing that time is a natural category and that it is naturally experienced in terms of past, present and future, even though many languages do not necessarily grammaticalize all of these distinctions.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=625}} He analyzes the Hopi ''-ni'' suffix as marking the future tense. He argues that since there is no grammatical distinction between past and present, Hopi has a future-nonfuture tense system. Malotki distinguishes between primary and secondary functions of the -ni suffix, arguing that its primary function is temporal reference and that its many modal functions such as [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[hortative]] and [[desiderative]] are of secondary importance. {{quote|text=As it turns out from among the numerous suffixes that the Hopi verb can select to mark the grammatical categories of aspect, mode and tense, one is specifically reserved to refer to time, or rather the sequential ordering of events or states. This temporal marker is ''-ni'' whose referential force is futurity. Its temporal function is primary; however, in many contexts i-''ni'' also takes on a number of secondary, atemporal functions which essentially belong to the modal category (imperative, hortative, desiderative, etc.). Since no markers exist to point out present or past time, Hopi, like many other languages, can be said to be endowed with a future-nonfuture tense system.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=624}}}} Malotki does admit that the English and Hopi systems of tense are different since the English system distinguishes past from non-past, whereas Hopi distinguishes future from non-future.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=666}}

==Further debates==
Subsequent descriptions of Hopi grammar have maintained Malotki's distinction between an unmarked non-future tense and a future tense marked with the -''ni'' suffix, and a habitual aspect marked by the suffix -''ngwu''.{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=878}} The review by [[Bernard Comrie]], a well-known authority on the [[linguistic typology]] of [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], accepts that Malotki's work demonstrates that the Hopi do have a concept of time and that it is devastating for Whorf's strong claims. But Comrie also notes that Malotki's "Claim that Hopi has a tense system based on the opposition of future and non-future&amp;nbsp;... strikes me as questionable: given the wide range of modal uses of the so-called future, it is at least plausible that this is a modal rather than temporal distinction, with the result that Hopi would have no tense distinction."{{sfn|Comrie|1984|p=132}}

Linguists and psychologists who work in the universalist tradition such as [[Steven Pinker]] and [[John McWhorter]], have seen Malotki's study as being the final proof that Whorf was an inept linguist and had no significant knowledge or understanding of the Hopi language.{{sfn|Pinker|1994}}{{sfn|Pinker|2007}}{{sfn|McWhorter|2009}}{{sfn|McWhorter|2010}} This interpretation has been criticized by relativist scholars as unfounded and based on a lack of knowledge of Whorf's work.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}}{{sfn|Lee|1996}}

In spite of Malotki's refutation, the myth that "the Hopi have no concept of time" lived on in the popular literature. For example, in her 1989 novel ''[[Sexing the Cherry]]'', [[Jeanette Winterson]] wrote of the Hopi: "...their language has no grammar in the way we recognize it. And most bizarre of all, they have no tenses for past, present and future. They do not sense time in that way. For them time is one."{{sfn|Winterson|1989|p=140}} And the myth continues to be an integral part of [[New Age]] thinking that draws on stereotypical depictions of "timeless Hopi culture".{{sfn|Geertz|1994}}&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{harvcoltxt|Braden|2009}}; {{harvcoltxt|Griscom|1988}}; {{harvcoltxt|Pinchbeck|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some linguists working on Universals of [[semantics]], such as [[Anna Wierzbicka]] and [[Cliff Goddard]], argue that there is a [[Natural Semantic Metalanguage]] that has a basic vocabulary of semantic ''primes'' including concepts such as {{smallcaps|time, when, before, after}}. They have argued that Malotki's data show that the Hopi share these primes with English and all other languages, even though it is also clear that the precise way in which these concepts fit into the larger pattern of culture and language practices is different in each language, as illustrated by the differences between Hopi and English.{{sfn|Goddard|Wierzbicka|2002|pp=18-19}}

Malotki's work has been criticized by relativist scholars for failing to engage with Whorf's actual argument. [[John A. Lucy]] argues that Malotki's critique misses the fact that Whorf's point was exactly that the way in which the Hopi language grammatically structurates the representation of time leads to a different conception of time than the English one, not that they do not have one.{{sfn|Lucy|1996}} Lucy notes that when Whorf makes his strong claim about what it is that Hopi lacks, he consistently puts the word "time" in scare quotes, and uses the qualifier "what we call".{{sfn|Lucy1992b|p=286}} Lucy and others take this as evidence that Whorf was implying specifically that what the Hopi lacked was a concept that corresponds entirely to that denoted by the English word, i.e. he was making a point of showing that the concepts of time were different. Malotki himself acknowledges that the conceptualizations are different, but because he ignores Whorf's use of scare quotes, takes Whorf to be arguing that the Hopi have no concept of time at all.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011|p=180}}{{sfn|Levinson|2012|p=xii}}

In 1991 Penny Lee published a comparison of Malotki and Whorf's analyses of the adverbial word class that Whorf had called "tensors". She argues that Whorf's analysis captured aspects of Hopi grammar that were not captured by simply describing tensors as falling within the class of temporal adverbs.{{sfn|Lee|1991}}

In 2006 anthropologist [[David Dinwoodie]] published a severe critique of Malotki's work, questioning his methods and his presentation of data as well as his analysis. Dinwoodie argues that Malotki fails to adequately support his claim of having demonstrated that the Hopi have a concept of time "as we know it".{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006|p=341}} He provides ethnographic examples of how some Hopi speakers explain the way they experience the difference between a traditional Hopi way of experiencing time as tied closely to cycles of ritual and natural events, and the Anglo-American concept of clock-time or school-time.{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006}}

===Language, time and cognition===
Sparked by the Hopi debate about time a number of studies about how different languages grammaticalize tense and conceptualize time have been carried out. Some of these studies in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[cognitive linguistics]] have found some evidence that there may be significant differences in how speakers of different languages conceptualize time, although not necessarily in the way Whorf claimed for the Hopi. Specifically, it has been shown that some cultural groups conceptualize the flow of time in a direction opposite to what is usual for speakers of English and other [[Indo-European languages]], i.e. that the future is in front of the speaker and the past behind.{{sfn|Núñez|Sweetser|2006}}{{sfn|Dahl|1995}} It has also been found that not all languages have a grammatical category of tense: some instead use combinations of adverbs and grammatical aspect to locate events in time.{{sfn|Bittner|2005}}{{sfn|Smith|2008}}{{sfn|Tonhauser|2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26604">The '''innateness hypothesis''' is an expression coined by [[Hilary Putnam]] to refer to a linguistic theory of [[language acquisition]] which holds that at least some knowledge about language exists in humans at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/innateness+hypothesis |title=Innateness hypothesis &amp;#124; Define Innateness hypothesis at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1327223.files/Putnam%20item.pdf |date= |accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam used the expression "the innateness hypothesis" to target linguistic nativism and specifically the views of [[Noam Chomsky]].  Facts about the complexity of human language systems, the universality of language acquisition, the facility that children demonstrate in acquiring these systems, and the comparative performance of adults in attempting the same task are all commonly invoked in support. However, the validity of Chomsky's approach is still debated. Empiricists advocate that language is entirely learned. Some have criticized Chomsky's work, pinpointing problems with his theories while others have proposed new theories to account for language acquisition (with specific differences in terms of language acquisition per se compared to second language acquisition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lightbown |first1=Patsy |last2=Spada |first2=Nina |title=How Languages are Learned |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-442224-6 |page=35 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Linguistic nativism==
Linguistic nativism is the theory that humans are born with some knowledge of language. One acquires a language not entirely through learning.

Human language is complicated and is said to form one of the most complex areas of human cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Adele E|title=Universal Grammar? Or prerequisites for natural language?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2008|volume=31|issue=5|pages=522–523|doi=10.1017/s0140525x0800513x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its complexity, children are able to accurately acquire a language within a short period of time. Moreover, research has shown that language acquisition among children (including the blind and the deaf) occurs in ordered developmental stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laurence|first1=Stephen|last2=Margolis|first2=Eric|title=The Poverty of the Stimulus Argument|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|date=2001|volume=52|issue=2|pages=217–276|doi=10.1093/bjps/52.2.217}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This highlights the possibility of humans having an innate language acquisition ability. According to Noam Chomsky,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=N|title=Language and the problems of knowledge|date=1988|publisher=MIT Press|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The speed and precision of vocabulary acquisition leaves no real alternative to the conclusion that the child somehow has the concepts available before experience with language and is basically learning labels for concepts that are  already a part of his or her conceptual apparatus." Chomsky's view that the human faculty of language is innate is also affirmed by [[Steven Pinker]]. Moreover, in his work, The Language Instinct, Pinker argued that language in humans is a biological adaptation—language is hard-wired into our minds by evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=The language instinct : how the mind creates language|date=2007|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|location=New York|edition=1st Harper Perennial Modern Classics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in contrast to children's ease in language acquisition, having passed the critical age for language acquisition the complexity of a language often makes it challenging for adult learners to pick up a second language.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Alexander Simon|last2=Lappin|first2=Shalom|title=Linguistic nativism and the poverty of the stimulus|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|location=Hoboken}}&lt;/ref&gt; More often than not, unlike children, adults are unable to acquire native-like proficiency.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;
Hence, with this idea in mind, nativists advocate that the fundamentals of language and grammar are innate rather than acquired through learning. The innateness hypothesis supports language nativism and several reasons and concepts have been proposed to support and explain this hypothesis. In his work, Chomsky introduced the idea of a [[language acquisition device]] (LAD) to account for the competence of humans in acquiring a language. The [[universal grammar]] (UG) that is also often credited to Chomsky was later introduced.

=== Language acquisition device===
According to Chomsky, humans are born with a set of language learning tools referred to as the LAD. The LAD is an abstract part of the human mind which houses the ability for humans to acquire and produce language.&lt;ref name=Volkmar&gt;{{cite book|last1=Volkmar|first1=Fred R.|title=Encyclopedia of Autism Spectrum Disorders|date=2013|publisher=Springer New York|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky expressed that children are able to derive rules of a language through hypothesis testing because they are equipped with a LAD. The LAD then transforms these rules into basic grammar.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt; Hence, according to Chomsky, the LAD explains why children seem to have the innate ability to acquire a language and accounts for why no explicit teaching is required for a child to acquire a language.

=== Universal grammar ===
In his argument for the existence of a LAD, Chomsky proposed that for a child to acquire a language, sufficient innate language-specific knowledge is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Adele E|title=Universal Grammar? Or prerequisites for natural language?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2008|volume=31|issue=5|pages=522–523|doi=10.1017/s0140525x0800513x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These constraints were later termed as universal grammar (UG). In this theory, it is suggested that all humans have a set of limited rules for grammar that are universal to all natural human languages. These rules are genetically wired into our brains and they can be altered in correspondence to the language children are exposed to. In other words, under this theory, language acquisition is seen as a process of filtering through the set of possible grammatical structures in natural languages pre-programmed in one's mind and this is guided by the language input in one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=John D|last2=Elman|first2=Jeffrey L|title=Learnability and the Statistical Structure of Language: Poverty of Stimulus Arguments Revisited|journal=Proceedings of the Annual Boston University Conference on Language Development|date=2002|volume=26|issue=1|pages=359–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky later introduced [[generative grammar]]. He argued that "properties of a generative grammar arise from an "innate" universal grammar".&lt;ref name="Abushıbab"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abushıbab |first1=İbrahim |title=Can Transformational Generative Grammar Be Used For Pedagogical Purposes? |journal=Ekev Academic Review |date=2008 |volume=12 |issue=36 |pages=301–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of generative grammar describes a set of rules that are used to order words correctly in order to form grammatically-sound sentences.&lt;ref name="Abushıbab" /&gt; It also attempts to describe a speaker's innate grammatical knowledge.&lt;ref name="Abushıbab" /&gt;

=== Poverty of stimulus ===
One of the most significant arguments generative grammarians had for language nativism is the [[poverty of the stimulus]] argument. Since 1980, the poverty of stimulus became increasingly integrated into the theory of generative grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Margaret|title=Development of the Concept of 'the Poverty of the Stimulus'|journal=Linguistic Review|date=2002|volume=19|pages=51–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this argument, Noam Chomsky put forth that the amount of input a child receives during language acquisition is insufficient to account for the linguistic output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Behme|first1=Christina|last2=Deacon|first2=S Helene|title=Language Learning in Infancy: Does the Empirical Evidence Support a Domain Specific Language Acquisition Device?|journal=4015: psycholinguistics; child language acquisition|date=2008|volume=21|issue=5|pages=641–671|doi=10.1080/09515080802412321}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be exact, he said that, "the native speaker has acquired a grammar on the basis of very restricted and degenerate evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=Language and mind.|date=1972|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|edition=Enl.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in his paper, Pinker concludes that humans have a system that is more sophisticated than what they are being exposed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=Rules of Language|journal=Science|volume=253|issue=5019|doi=10.1126/science.1857983|pmid=1857983|pages=530–535|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their article, Pullum and Scholz summarised the properties of a child's environment.&lt;ref name="PullumScholz2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pullum |first1=Geoffrey K. |last2=Scholz |first2=Barbara C. |title=Empirical assessment of stimulus poverty arguments |journal=Linguistic Review |date=2002 |volume=19 |issue=1/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They identified properties of positivity, degeneracy, incompleteness and idiosyncrasy. Under positivity, they assert that children are only exposed to positive linguistic data. Moreover, there is lack in negative data that aids a child in identifying ungrammatical sentences that are unacceptable in the language.&lt;ref name="PullumScholz2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Longa|first1=Víctor M|title=What about a (really) minimalist theory of language acquisition?|journal=Linguistics|date=2008|volume=46|issue=3|pages=541–570|doi=10.1515/ling.2008.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also claimed that children are unable to acquire a language with positive evidence alone. In addition, under degeneracy, it is stated that children are often exposed to linguistic data that are erroneous. This is supported by Zohari that states that in adult speech, erroneous utterances that include speech slips, ungrammatical sentences, incomplete sentences etc. are often observed.&lt;ref name="Zohari"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zohari |first1=Parissa |title=Language acquisition and the argument from the poverty of the stimulus |journal=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the linguistic data each child is exposed to is different (i.e. idiosyncrasy) and there are many utterances that a child might not have heard (i.e. incompleteness). However, despite the properties mentioned above, children would eventually be able to deliver a linguistic output that is similar to the target language within a relatively short amount of time.&lt;ref name="Zohari" /&gt; In contrast, when placed in certain environments, other organisms are unable to attain the language mastery humans have reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=Poverty of Stimulus: Unfinished Business|journal=Studies in Chinese Linguistics|date=2012|volume=33|issue=1|pages=3–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the nativists' point of view, all of these highlight that babies are hard-wired with a UG and thus support the innateness hypothesis.

However, it is important to note that the argument that the poverty of stimulus supports the innateness hypothesis remains very controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laurence|first1=Stephen|title=The Poverty of the Stimulus Argument|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|date=2001|volume=52|issue=2|pages=217–276|doi=10.1093/bjps/52.2.217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in one of the latest work against the poverty of stimulus argument, Fiona Cowie wrote in her paper that the Poverty of Stimulus argument fails "on both empirical and conceptual grounds to support nativism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cowie|first1=Fiona|title=What's Within? Nativism Reconsidered|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical period hypothesis ===
The [[critical period hypothesis]] by Linguist [[Eric Lenneberg]] states that full native competence in acquiring a language can only be achieved during an optimal period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lenneberg|first1=E.H.|title=Biological foundations of language|date=1967|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis supports the innateness hypothesis about the biological innateness of linguistic competence. Lenneberg expressed that age plays a salient role in the ability to acquire language. According to him, a child before the age of two will not sufficiently acquire language, while development of full native competence in a language must occur before the onset of puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lenneberg|first1=E. H.|title=Biological Foundations of Language|date=1967|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that language is innate that occurs through development instead of feedback from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chomsky and language learning.|url=http://www2.vobs.at/ludescher/Ludescher/LAcquisition/Nativist/nativist%20theory.htm|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, should a child not hear any language during this period, the child would not be able to learn nor be able to speak. This hypothesis is also said to explain why adults do not acquire languages as well as children.

Evidence for the critical period hypothesis can be seen in the case of [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]]. When discovered, she was without language. Genie's subsequent language acquisition process was studied, whereby her linguistic performance, cognitive and emotional development was deemed abnormal. Genie was said to have right-hemisphere language, resembling other cases where language was acquired outside of the "critical period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curtiss|first1=Susan|title=Genie: A Psycholinguistic Study of a Modern-Day "Wild Child"|date=1977|publisher=Academic Press|location=Boston, MA|pages=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would lend support to Lenneberg's hypothesis. Moreover, some saw the case of Genie as a support to the innateness hypothesis. When the LAD is not triggered during the critical period, the natural process of language acquisition cannot be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=D.H.|title=Principles of language learning and teaching|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman, Inc.|location=New York|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Genie's case is complex and controversial. It has been  argued that it does not support linguistic innateness. Some have asserted that there is at least a possible degree of first language acquisition beyond the critical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snow E.|first1=Catherine|last2=Hoefnagel-Höhle|first2=Marian|title=The Critical Period for Language Acquisition: Evidence from Second Language Learning|journal=Society for Research in Child Development|date=1978|volume=49|issue=4|pages=1114–1128|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1978.tb04080.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MayberryEichen1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mayberry |first1=Rachel I. |last2=Eichen |first2=Ellen B. |title=The critical period for language acquisition and the deaf child's language comprehension: a psycholinguistic approach |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |date=1991 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=486–512 |doi=10.1016/0749-596x(91)90018-f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the emotional and cognitive deprivation may have also played a part in Genie's linguistic and cognitive difficulties.&lt;ref name="MayberryEichen1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sampson|first1=Geoffrey|title=Educating Eve: The 'Language Instinct' Debate|date=1997|publisher=Cassell|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the [[Nicaraguan sign language]] by students in a school for the deaf also lends evidence to the hypothesis. Initially a [[pidgin]] sign language with simple grammar, there were large grammatical differences and variations across signers. Eventually, the pidgin became a full-fledged language (like a [[Creole language|creole]])  as younger signers developed a significantly more grammatically structured and regular system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandler|first1=Wendy|title=Sign language: An overview|url=http://sandlersignlab.haifa.ac.il/html/html_eng/pdf/Sign_Language_Overview_ELL2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as specific grammatical structures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senghas|first1=Ann|title=The Development of Nicaraguan Sign Language via the Language Acquisition Process|journal=Proceedings of Boston University Child Language Development|date=1995|volume=19|pages=543–552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the differences in abilities between the younger and older students to use sign language are said to suggest evidence for a critical period. The spontaneity of the development of NSL also shows that there is an innate element to the process of language learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children create new sign language|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3662928.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, the critical period hypothesis in relation to language acquisition is also widely debated. Other research has also indicated that any age effects depend largely on the opportunities for learning, learning situations and how significant the initial exposure is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lightbown |first1=Patsy M. |title=Classroom SLA research and second language teaching |journal=Applied Linguistics |date=2000 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=431–462 |doi=10.1093/applin/21.4.431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic empiricism==
[[Empiricism]] is the theory that all knowledge is based on experience derived from the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Empiricism|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/empiricism|website=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empiricists only study observable behaviour instead of unobservable mental representations, states and processes. They claim that sense and experience is the ultimate source of all concepts and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markie|first1=Peter|title=Rationalism vs. Empiricism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/rationalism-empiricism/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 October 2014|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, linguistic empiricism is a perspective where language is entirely learned. These data-driven theorists also support that children do not have linguistically-specific knowledge at birth. Language and grammar are only learned through exposure and accumulated experience. This is also called the "nurture" perspective as opposed to the "nature" perspective (linguistic nativism).

Against Chomsky's Innateness Hypothesis, philosopher [[John Locke]] insisted that our knowledge, including language, cannot be innate.&lt;ref name=Locke&gt;{{cite book|last1=Book|first1=I|last2=II|first2=Book II|last3=Locke|first3=John|title=An essay concerning human understanding|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, all ideas are derived from experience.&lt;ref name=Locke/&gt; [[Geoffrey Sampson]] also showed the same stand by stating that "Our languages are not inborn but are learned wholly with experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sampson|first1=Geoffrey|title=Linguistic universals as evidence for empiricism|date=1978|publisher=Cambridge Univ Press|pages=183–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Empiricists have criticised concepts like generative grammar that support linguistic nativism. In fact, some would argue that "language structure" is created through language use.&lt;ref name=Tomasello&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomasello|first1=Michael|last2=Tomasello|first2=Michael|title=Constructing a language: A usage-based theory of language acquisition|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, they assert that theories like the [[Language Acquisition Device|LAD]] are unsupported by empirical evidence.

===Arguments===
Contrastive analyses about the innateness hypothesis have been done by [[Jacek Fisiak]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=Fisiak&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fisiak|first1=Jacek|title=Theoretical issues in contrastive linguistics|date=1981|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fisiak's analysis, [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]], Hiż and [[Nelson Goodman|Goodman]] criticized Chomsky's innate hypothesis by stating that:

#The fact that languages have similar properties is common and natural.&lt;ref name=Fisiak/&gt; There is no necessity to appeal to innate concepts for the explanation of this fact.  Goodman also expressed that claims about language universals are dubious. He argues that it is not surprising that languages in the world will coincidentally have features in common.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chapman|first1=Siobhan|title=Philosophy for linguists: an introduction|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the claim that common features, which have been identified as natural 'language universals', should not be supported.&lt;ref name=Chapman/&gt;
#The hypothesis cannot be supported by empirical evidence.&lt;ref name=Fisiak/&gt;
It is hard to explain what it is for someone to have an innate concept since empirical evidence to support this theory is hard to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markie|first1=Peter|title=Rationalism vs. Empiricism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/rationalism-empiricism/#4|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, there is no way to falsify the theory unless empirical evidence is found.

Over the years, many theories that are against language innateness have been developed to account for language acquisition. Many have championed that human beings learn language through experience with some leaning towards children being equipped with learning mechanisms while others suggesting that social situations or cognitive capacities can account for language learning.

Bates and Elman summarised a research conducted by Saffran, Aslin and Newport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saffran|first1=Jenny R|last2=Aslin|first2=Richard N|last3=Newport|first3=Elissa L|title=Statistical learning by 8-month-old infants|journal=Science|date=1996|volume=274|issue=5294|pages=1926–1928|doi=10.1126/science.274.5294.1926|pmid=8943209}}&lt;/ref&gt; that supports that learning is "a purely inductive, statistically driven process".&lt;ref name="pmid8984644"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bates |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Elman |first2=Jeffrey |title=Learning Rediscovered |journal= Science |date=1996 |volume=274 |issue=5294 |pages=1849–1850 |doi=10.1126/science.274.5294.1849 |pmid=8984644}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the research, it was found that 8 month old infants were able to use simple statistics to identify word boundaries in speech. The results of the research highlight that language acquisition is a process of learning through statistical means. Moreover, it raises the possibility that infants possess experience-dependent mechanisms that allow for word segmentation and acquisition of other aspects of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkin|first1=Lyle|title=Biolinguistics: Exploring the Biology of Language|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Bates and Elman found that this contradicts the extensive view that human beings are unable and cannot utilize generalized statistical procedures for language acquisition.&lt;ref name="pmid8984644" /&gt; This is empirical evidence for linguistic empiricism, thereby going against the innateness hypothesis.

[[Michael Tomasello]]'s findings highlight the significance of a usage-based theory of language acquisition and indicates that there is a relation between cognitive and social skills with linguistic competence.&lt;ref name=Tomasello/&gt; This shows the importance of the role of experience in language acquisition. By empirically studying the developmental stages of child language acquisition, he argues that children have specific cognitive capacities at birth that promote growth in linguistic competence and specific interpersonal abilities that aid language learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joseph T|first1=Kessler|title=Michael Tomasello on Language Development: The Puzzle of Human Linguistic Uniqueness|journal=Handbook of Child Psychology: Cognitive Development|date=2010|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he emphasised that this does not prove that language is innate. In addition, his experiments indicate that children's awareness and understanding of the intentional communicative cues displayed by others is a salient social cognitive skill that determines their ability to learn words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hurford|first1=James R|title=Review of Michael Tomasello and Elizabeth Bates (eds.), Language Development: the essential readings|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~jim/tomasello.bates.revu.html|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomasello also stated that young children's initial multi-word productions are very concrete as they are based on specific words and phrases instead of innate and abstract linguistic categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomasello|first1=Michael|last2=Bates|first2=Elizabeth|title=Language Development: The Essential Readings|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|pages=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, this would explain why grammar development is progressive and word-specific.

[[Geoffrey Sampson]] also supports that the "richness of the environment" plays a role in language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jabli|first1=Taieb|title=Chomskyan Rationalist Approach to Language Acquisition Versus The Empiricist Approach|url=https://www.academia.edu/3461596/Chomskyan_Rationalist_Approach_to_Language_Acquisition_Versus_The_Empiricist_Approach|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Sampson observed that not only human beings but all species are capable of recognizing speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geoffrey|first1=Sampson|title=The 'Language Instinct' Debate|date=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability indicates that a child is equipped with the capacity for normalisation which plays a fundamental role in acquiring the phonology of a language. Therefore, he contends that a child is born with the ability to learn and this is through testing and guessing instead of the innate ability that nativists support.

The '''Institute of the Peoples of the North''' ({{lang-ru|Институт Народов Севера}}) is a research and later educationary institute based in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Its objective is to examine topics related to the northern minorities in the [[Soviet Union]], and to prepare teachers for the northern boarding schools. One of the central figures involved in the research institute was [[Vladimir Bogoraz]].

The institute was founded in 1930, as four years previously it had become possible to study the languages of the northern peoples in their own right at the Institute for Eastern Studies at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]]. By the end of 1929, the institute's teachers had joined forces to create the Unified Northern Alphabet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Saving Languages: An Introduction to Language Revitalization |last= Grenoble |first= Lenore A. |authorlink= |author2=Lindsay J. Whaley |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge |isbn= 0-521-81621-1|pages=73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ru|Единый северный алфавит}}) for use by the linguistic minorities living in the north of the Soviet Union. The alphabet consisted of 32 Latin-based letters, some of which were equipped with [[diacritic]]s. For practical reasons, i.e., typographical reasons, a move to rid the alphabet of graphemes using diacritics was made and one year later a new version was ready. On December 13, 1930, the [[Presidium]] of the Scientific Investigation Association at the institute presented a version of the Unified Northern Alphabet to the Scientific Council of the USSR’s Central Committee on Alphabet Adaptation ({{lang-ru|Всесоюзного центрального комитета нового алфавита}}). The same body discussed the draft again on December 18 and it was approved on February 23, 1931. The scientific section of [[Narkompros]] approved the draft in May the same year. 

The alphabet consisted of 39 letters: 29 consonants and 10 vowels. In addition, some letters were marked with diacritics to show [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]], [[Length (phonetics)|length]] and [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]].

An intensive and systematic publishing campaign was launched immediately after the alphabet had been formally approved. From 1939 to 1949, approximately 300 experts were employed by the institute.

''The finalisation of principles for creation of a literary public institution for the peoples of the north'' came at the first pan-Russian conference. Delegates to the conference (which was held at the INS ni Leningrad) were representatives for Narkompros, Komitet Severa v/Presidium VCIK, CK Novogo Alfavita SSSR i RSFSR, and the publisher Učpedgiz. In the work conducted at the conference, there were participants from the national northern okrugs, for the local Northern Committees, for CK VLKSM, for the soviet Academy of Sciences, for the Historical-linguistic institute in Leningrad, and for the Northern department at the [[Herzen University|Leningrad Herzen Pedagogical Institute]]. The preparation work was done at INS.

The conference decided to create orthographies for a total of 16 languages and to have books available for the 15th anniversary of the revolution:

* the [[Uralic languages]]: ''[[Nenets languages|Nenets]], [[Selkup language|Selkup]], [[Khanty language|Khanty]], [[Mansi language|Mansi]] and [[Kildin Sami]]''
* the [[Tungusic languages]]: ''[[Evenki language|Evenki]], [[Even language|Even]], [[Nanai language|Nanai]] and [[Udege language|Udege]]''
* the [[Paleosiberian languages]]: ''[[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], [[Koryak language|Koryak]], [[Itelmen language|Itelmen]], [[Siberian Yupik]], [[Aleut language|Aleut]], [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]] and [[Ket language|Ket]]''

Various books, including primers and math textbooks, were published using this alphabet. The first work published using the new orthography was a book on terminology specific to these areas.

==After World War II==

The institute was run in its original form from 1930 until 1941. Between 1942 and 1945, the institute was located in [[Omsk]], after which it moved back to Leningrad as a part of the Faculty of Oriental Studies at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]]. Since 1948, the institute has been a part of the [[Herzen University]], to which it still belongs today.

{{Sociolinguistics}}

'''Language planning''' (also known as '''language engineering''') is a deliberate effort to influence the function, structure, or acquisition of [[languages]] or [[dialects|language variety]] within a [[speech community]].&lt;ref name= Kaplan&gt;Kaplan B., Robert, and Richard B. Baldauf Jr. ''Language Planning from Practice to Theory.''  Clevedon: Multilingual Matters ltd., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with [[government]] planning, but is also used by a variety of [[non-governmental organization]]s, such as grass-roots organizations, and individuals. Goals of such planning vary. Better communication through assimilation of a single dominant language can bring economic benefits to minorities but is also perceived to facilitate their political domination.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias&gt;Cobarrubias, Juan.  "Ethical Issues in Status Planning."  ''Progress in Language Planning: International Perspectives''.  Eds. Juan Cobarrubias and Joshua Fishman.  New York: Mouton Publishers, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the establishment of language regulators, such as formal or informal agencies, committees, societies or academies, to design or develop new structures to meet contemporary needs.&lt;ref&gt;''Language: An Introduction,'' Lehmann, W.P., 1983, Random House&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ideology ==

Four overarching [[language ideology|language ideologies]] motivate decision making in language planning.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias /&gt;  The first, linguistic assimilation, is the belief that every member of a society, irrespective of their [[First language|native language]], should learn and use the dominant language of the society in which they live.  An example is the [[English-only movement]] of some residents of the [[United States]].

In contrast is the second ideology, linguistic pluralism - the recognition and support of multiple languages within one society.  Examples include the coexistence of [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Romansh language|Romansh]] in [[Switzerland]]; and the shared official status of [[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] in [[Singapore]].  The coexistence of many languages may not necessarily arise from a conscious language ideology, but rather related to the relative efficiency in communication of a common language.

The third ideology, vernacularization, denotes the restoration and development of an indigenous language, along with its adoption by the state as an [[official language]].  Examples include [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in the state of [[Israel]] and [[Quechua language|Quechua]] in [[Peru]].

The final ideology, internationalization, is the adoption of a non-indigenous language as a means of wider communication, as an official language or in a particular domain, such as the use of English in [[India]], Singapore, the [[Philippines]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[South Africa]].

==Goals==

Eleven language planning goals have been recognized (Nahir 2003):&lt;ref name=Nahir&gt;Nahir, Moshe. "Language Planning Goals: A Classification." ''Sociolinguistics: The Essential Readings.'' Eds.  Paulston, Christina Bratt and G. Richard Tucker.  Oxford: Blackwell, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
# Language Purification – prescription of usage in order to preserve the "[[linguistic purism|linguistic purity]]" of language, protect language from foreign influences, and guard against language deviation from within
# [[Language revitalization|Language Revival]] – the attempt to restore to common use a language that has few or no surviving native speakers&lt;ref&gt;Linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann claims that any attempt to revive a no-longer spoken language is likely to end up with a hybrid - see Zuckermann, Ghil'ad, [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf "Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns"]. In ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2 (2009), 40-67.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Language reform|Language Reform]] – deliberate change in specific aspects of language, such as [[orthography]], [[spelling]], or [[grammar]], in order to facilitate use
# Language Standardization – the attempt to garner [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] for a regional language or dialect, developing it as the chosen major language, or [[standard language]], of a [[region]]
# Language Spread – the attempt to increase the number of speakers of a language
# Lexical Modernization – word creation or adaptation
# Terminology Unification – development of unified [[terminology|terminologies]], primarily in technical domains
# Stylistic Simplification – simplification of language usage in [[lexicon]], grammar, and style. That includes modifying the use of language in social and formal contexts.
# Interlingual Communication – facilitation of linguistic communication between members of distinct speech communities
# Language Maintenance – preservation of the use of a group's native language as a first or [[second language]] where pressures threaten or cause a decline in the status of the language
# Auxiliary-Code Standardization – standardization of marginal, auxiliary aspects of language, such as signs for the deaf, place names, or rules of [[transliteration]] and [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]

== Types ==
Language planning has been divided into three types:

=== Status planning ===
Status planning is the allocation or reallocation of a language or variety to functional domains within a society, thus affecting the status, or standing, of a language.

==== Language status ====
Language status is a concept distinct from, though intertwined with, language [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] and language function. Strictly speaking, language status is the position or standing of a language vis-à-vis other languages.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, John. "Language, Prestige, and Stigma," in ''Contact Linguistics''. Ed. Hans Goebel. New York: de Gruyter, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A language garners status according to the fulfillment of four attributes, described in 1968 by two different authors, [[Heinz Kloss]] and [[William Alexander Stewart|William Stewart]]. Both Kloss and Stewart stipulated four qualities of a language that determine its status. Their respective frameworks differ slightly, but they emphasize four common attributes:
# Language origin – whether a given language is indigenous or imported to the speech community
# Degree of standardization – the extent of development of a formal set of norms that define 'correct' usage
# Juridical status
##Sole official language (e.g. French in France and Turkish in Turkey)
##Joint official language (e.g. English and [[Afrikaans]] in [[South Africa]]; French, German, Italian and Romansh in Switzerland)
##Regional official language (e.g. [[Igbo language|Igbo]] in [[Nigeria]]; [[Marathi language|Marathi]] in [[Maharashtra]], India)
##Promoted language – lacks official status on a national or regional level but is promoted and sometimes used by public authorities for specific functions (e.g. [[Spanish people|Spanish]] in [[New Mexico]]; [[West African Pidgin English]] in [[Cameroon]])
##Tolerated language – neither promoted nor proscribed; acknowledged but ignored (e.g. [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] in the [[United States]] in present day)
##Proscribed language – discouraged by official sanction or restriction (e.g. Galician, Basque and Catalan during [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime in Spain; [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] in [[Greece]]);&lt;ref name=Wardhaugh&gt;Wardhaugh, Ronald. "Planning," in ''An Introduction to Sociolinguistics''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; indigenous American languages during the [[American Indian boarding schools|boarding school era]]&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;cite [http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/aibscurrguide.pdf Jennifer Jones, Dee Ann Bosworth, Amy Lonetree,  "American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic &amp; Cultural Cleansing"], Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture &amp; Lifeways, 2011, accessed 25 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
#Vitality – the ratio, or percent, of users of a language to another variable, like the total population.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias/&gt; Kloss and Stewart both distinguish six classes of statistical distribution. However, they draw the line between classes at different percentages. According to Kloss, the first class, the highest level of vitality, is demarcated by 90% or more speakers. The five remaining classes in decreasing order are 70–89%, 40–69%, 20–39%, 3–19%, and less than 3%. Stewart defines the six classes are determined by the following percentages of speakers: 75%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, and less than 5%.

Together, origin, degree of standardization, juridical status, and vitality express a language's status.

William Stewart outlines ten functional domains in language planning:&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;Stewart, William A.  "Sociolinguistic Typology of Multilingualism," in ''Readings in the Sociology of Language''.  Ed. Joshua Fishman.  The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Official – An official language "function[s] as a legally appropriate language for all politically and culturally representative purposes on a nationwide basis."&lt;ref name=Stewart /&gt;  Often, the official function of a language is specified in a [[constitution]].
#Provincial – A provincial language functions as an official language for a geographic area smaller than a nation, typically a [[province]] or [[region]] (e.g. French in [[Quebec]])&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;Cooper, Robert L.  ''Language Planning and Social Change''.  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Wider communication – A language of wider communication is a language that may be official or provincial, but more importantly, functions as a medium of communication across language boundaries within a nation (e.g. [[Hindi]] in India; [[Swahili language]] in [[East Africa]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#International – An international language functions as a medium of communication across national boundaries (e.g. English, formerly French as a diplomatic and international language)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Capital – A capital language functions as a prominent language in and around a national [[capital (political)|capital]] (e.g. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and French in [[Brussels]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Group – A group language functions as a conventional language among the members of a single cultural or ethnic group (e.g. Hebrew amongst the [[Jews]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Educational – An educational language functions as a medium of instruction in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools on a regional or national basis ([[Urdu]] in [[West Pakistan]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] in [[East Pakistan]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#School subject – A school subject language is a language that is taught as a subject in secondary school or [[higher education]] (e.g. [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] in English-language schools)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Literary – A literary language functions as a language for [[literature|literary]] or [[scholarly]] purposes (Ancient Greek)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Religious – A religious language functions as a language for the ritual purposes of a particular religion (e.g. Latin for the [[Latin Rite]] within the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; [[Arabic]] for the reading of the [[Qur'an]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;

Robert Cooper, in reviewing Stewart's list, makes several additions.  First, he creates three sub-types of official functions: statutory, working, and symbolic.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;  A statutory language is a language that a government has declared official by law. A working language is a language that a government uses as a medium for daily activities, and a symbolic language is a language that is a [[symbol]] of the state. Cooper also adds two functional domains to Stewart's list: mass media and work.

===Corpus planning===
Corpus planning refers to the [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] intervention in the forms of a language, whereby planning decisions are made to engineer changes in the structure of the language.&lt;ref name=FergusonG&gt;Ferguson, Gibson. (2006). ''Language Planning and Education.'' Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Corpus planning activities often arise as the result of beliefs about the adequacy of the form of a language to serve desired functions.&lt;ref name=Hornberger&gt;Hornberger, Nancy H. (2006). "Frameworks and Models in Language Policy and Planning", in Thomas Ricento, ''An Introduction to Language Policy'', Wiley-Blackwell, pp 24-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike status planning, which is primarily undertaken by administrators and politicians, corpus planning generally is performed by individuals with greater linguistic expertise.&lt;ref name=FergusonG /&gt; There are three traditionally recognized types of corpus planning: graphization, standardization, and modernization.

====Graphization====
Graphization refers to development, selection and modification of [[writing system|scripts]] and orthographic conventions for a language.&lt;ref name=Liddicoat&gt;Liddicoat, Anthony J. (2005). "Corpus Planning: Syllabus and Materials Development," in Eli Hinkel, ''Handbook of Research in Second Language Teaching and Learning'', Routledge, pp 993-1012.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of writing in a speech community can have lasting sociocultural effects, which include easier transmission of material through generations, communication with larger numbers of people, and a standard against which varieties of spoken language are often compared.&lt;ref name=FergusonC&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. (1968). "Language Development", in Charles A. Ferguson, Thom Huebner (1996), ''Sociolinguistic Perspectives: papers on language in society, 1959-1994'', Oxford University Press US, pp 40-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Charles A. Ferguson]] made two key observations about the results of adopting a writing system. First, the use of writing adds another variety of the language to the community's repertory. Although written language is often viewed as secondary to spoken language, the [[vocabulary]], [[grammar|grammatical structures]] and [[phonology|phonological structures]] of a language often adopt characteristics in the written form that are distinct from the spoken variety. Second, the use of writing often leads to a folk belief that the written language is the 'real' language, and speech is a corruption of it. Written language is viewed as more conservative, while the spoken variety is more susceptible to language change. Isolated relic areas of the spoken language may be less innovative than the written form, or the written language may have been based on a divergent variety of the spoken language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

In establishing a writing system for a language, corpus planners have the option of using an existing system or creating a new one. The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of [[Japan]] chose to adopt the [[Japanese language]]'s [[katakana]] [[syllabary]] as the writing system for the [[Ainu language]]. Katakana is designed for a language with a basic CV [[syllable structure]], but Ainu contains many CVC syllables that cannot easily be adapted to this syllabary. As a result, Ainu uses a modified katakana system, in which syllable-final [[syllable coda|codas]] are [[consonants]] by a [[subscript]] version of a katakana symbol that begins with the desired consonant.&lt;ref name=Liddicoat /&gt;

An example on a created script includes the development of the [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian script]] in 405 AD by [[Saint Mesrob|St. Mesrop Mashtots]]. Though the script was modeled after the [[Greek alphabet]], the original script distinguished Armenian from the Greek and [[Syriac alphabet]]s of the neighboring peoples.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt; Similarly, in the early 19th century, [[Sequoyah]] (Cherokee) created an orthography for written [[Cherokee]] in the Southeast of the present-day United States. It uses some Latin characters but also introduces new ones.

====Standardization====
The process of Standardization often involves one variety of a language taking precedence over other social and regional [[dialect]]s of a language.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;Christian, Donna (1988). "Language Planning: the view from linguistics", in Frederick J. Newmeyer, ''Language: the socio-cultural context'', Cambridge University Press, pp 193-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, where dialects are mutually intelligible, is to introduce a poly-phonemic written form that is intended to represent all dialects of a language adequately but with no standard spoken form. If one variety of a language is chosen, that variety comes to be understood as supra-dialectal and the 'best' form of the language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

The choice of which language takes precedence has important societal consequences, as it confers privilege upon speakers whose spoken and written dialect conforms closest to the chosen standard.&lt;ref name=Wiley&gt;Wiley, Terrance G. (2003). "Language Planning and Policy," in Sandra McKay, Nancy H. Horberger, ''Sociolinguistics and Language Teaching'', Cambridge University Press, pp 103-147.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard that is chosen as the norm is generally spoken by the most powerful social group within the society, and is imposed upon the less powerful groups as the form to emulate. This often reinforces the dominance of the powerful social group and makes the standard norm necessary for socioeconomic mobility.&lt;ref name=FergusonG /&gt; In practice, standardization generally entails increasing the uniformity of the norm, as well as the [[Codification (linguistics)|codification]] of the norm.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

The history of English provides an example of standardization occurring over an extended time period, without formally recognized language planning. The standardization process began when [[William Caxton]] introduced the [[printing press]] in [[England]] in 1476. This was accompanied by the adoption of the south-east [[English Midlands|Midlands]] variety of English, spoken in [[London]], as the print language. Because of the dialect's use for administrative, government, business, and literary purposes, this variety became entrenched as the prestigious variety of English. After the creation of [[grammar]]s and [[dictionaries]] in the 18th century, the rise of print [[Capitalism#As a mode of production|capitalism]], [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], and [[mass education]] led to the dissemination of this dialect as the standard norm for the English language.

====Modernization====
Modernization is a form of language planning that occurs when a language needs to expand its resources to meet functions. Modernization often occurs when a language undergoes a shift in status, such as when a [[country]] gains [[independence]] from a [[colonialism|colonial power]] or when there is a change in the language [[education policy]].&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt; The most significant force in modernization is the expansion of the [[lexicon]], which allows the language to discuss topics in modern [[semantic domain]]s. Language planners generally focus on creating new lists and [[glossary|glossaries]] to describe new technical terms, but it is also necessary to ensure that the new terms are consistently used by the appropriate sectors within society. While some languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], have experienced rapid lexical expansion to meet the demands of modernization, other languages, such as [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt; Rapid lexical expansion is aided by the use of new terms in textbooks and professional publications, as well as frequent use among specialists. Issues of [[linguistic purism]] often play a significant role in lexical expansion, but technical vocabulary can be effective within a language, regardless of whether it comes from the language's own process of [[word formation]] or from extensive [[loanword|borrowing]] from another language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC/&gt; While Hungarian has almost exclusively used language-internal processes to create new lexical items, Japanese has borrowed extensively from English to derive new words as part of its modernization.

=== Acquisition planning ===
Acquisition planning is a type of language planning in which a national, state or local government system aims to influence aspects of language, such as language status, distribution and literacy through education. Acquisition planning can also be used by non-governmental organizations, but it is more commonly associated with government planning.&lt;ref&gt;Liddicoat, Anthony J., and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr., "Language Planning in Local Contexts: Agents, Contexts and Interactions." ''Language Planning in Local Contexts''. Ed. Anthony J. Liddicoat and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently, acquisition planning is integrated into a larger language planning process in which the statuses of languages are evaluated, corpuses are revised and the changes are finally introduced to society on a national, state or local level through education systems, ranging from primary schools to universities.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. "Sociolinguistic Settings of Language Planning." ''Language Planning Processes''. Ed. Rubin, Joan, Björn H. Jernudd, Jyotirindra Das Gupta, Joshua A. Fishman and Charles A. Ferguson. The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; This process of change can entail a variety of modifications, such as an alteration in student textbook formatting, a change in methods of teaching an official language or the development of a [[multilingualism|bilingual]] language program, only to name a few. For example, if a government decides to raise the status level of a certain language or change its level of prestige, it can establish a law that requires teachers to teach only in this language or that textbooks are written using only this language's script. This, in turn, would support the elevation of the language's status or could increase its prestige. In this way, acquisition planning is often used to promote [[language revitalization]], which can change a language's status or reverse a [[language shift]], or to promote linguistic purism.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. "Language Planning Processes"''Language Planning Processes''. Ed. Rubin, Joan, Björn H. Jernudd, Jyotirindra Das Gupta, Joshua A. Fishman and Charles A. Ferguson. The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In a case where a government revises a corpus, new dictionaries and educational materials will need to be revised in schools in order to maintain effective language acquisition.

====The education sector====
The education [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] or education sector of government is typically in charge of making national [[language acquisition]] decisions based on state and local evaluation reports. The responsibilities of education sectors vary by country; [[Robert B. Kaplan]] and Richard B. Baldauf describe the sectors' six principal goals:&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt;

# To decide what languages should be taught within the [[curriculum]].
# To determine the amount and quality of [[teacher training]].
# To involve local [[communities]].
# To determine what materials will be used and how they will be incorporated into [[syllabi]].
# To establish a local and state [[Educational assessment|assessment]] system to monitor progress.
# To determine financial [[cost]]s.

====Problems====
Although acquisition planning can be useful to governments, there are several problems that must be considered.&lt;ref name= Thorburn&gt;Thorburn, Thomas. "Cost-Benefit Analysis in Language Planning." ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Even with a solid evaluation and assessment system, the effects of planning methods can never be certain; governments must consider the effects on other aspects of state planning, such as economic and political planning. Some proposed acquisition changes could also be too drastic or instituted too suddenly without proper planning and organization. Acquisition planning can also be financially draining, so adequate planning and awareness of financial resources is essential. It is important therefore that government goals, such as those described above, be organized and planned carefully.&lt;ref name= Thorburn /&gt;

====Multilingualism====
There is also a growing concern over the treatment of [[multilingualism]] in education, especially in many countries that were once colonized.&lt;ref&gt;Mansor, Sabiha. ''Language Planning in Higher Education''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding on which language of instruction would be most beneficial to effective communication on the local and state level is a task requiring thoughtful planning and is surrounded by debate. Some states prefer instruction only in the official language, but some aim to foster linguistic and thus social diversity by encouraging teaching in several [[first language|(native) languages]]. One reason some states prefer a single language of instruction is that it supports national unity and homogeneity.&lt;ref name= Fishman&gt;Fishman, Joshua A. "The Impact of Nationalism on Language Planning," ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Some states prefer incorporating different languages in order to help students learn better by giving them diverse perspectives.

====Non-governmental organizations====
In addition to the education sector, there are non-governmental sectors or organizations that have a significant effect on language acquisition, such as the [[Académie française]] of France or the [[Real Academia Española]] of Spain.&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt; These organizations often create their own dictionaries and grammar books, thus affecting the materials which students are exposed to in schools. Although these organizations do not hold official power, they influence government planning decisions, such as with educational materials, affecting acquisition.&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt;

====Ireland====
Before the partition of [[Ireland]], a movement began which aimed at the restoration of [[Irish language|Irish]], as the nation's primary language, based on a widespread sentiment for Irish nationalism and cultural identity.&lt;ref name= Macnamara&gt;Macnamara, John. "Successes and Failures in the Movement for the Restoration of Irish," ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; During and after colonisation, Irish had competed with English and [[Scots language|Scots]];  the movement to restore the language gained momentum after the [[Irish War of Independence]]. The [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] was created to promote the acquisition of Irish in schools, thus "de-Anglicizing" Ireland.&lt;ref name= Macnamara /&gt; Immediately after Ireland gained independence in 1922, the League declared that Irish must be the language of instruction for at least one hour in primary schools nationwide. Irish-speaking teachers were recruited, and preparatory colleges were established to train new ones.

The program implementation was mostly left to the individual schools, which did not consistently carry it out. Additionally, educating a generation is a long process, for which the League was not prepared. There was no consensus as to how the Irish language should be reinstituted; the League and schools did not develop a system assessment plan to monitor progress. As a result, the movement lost strength, and the number of native Irish speakers has been in steady decline.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Giolla Chriost, Diarmait. "Micro-level Language Planning in Ireland." ''Language Planning in Local Contexts''  Ed. Anthony J. Liddicoat and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case study: Quechua in Peru ==

=== Status planning ===
[[Peru]]'s history of language planning begins in the 16th century with Spanish [[colonization]].  When the Spanish first arrived in Peru, [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] served as a language of wider communication, a lingua franca, between Spaniards and Peruvian natives. As the years passed, Spaniards asserted the superiority of the Spanish language; as a result, Spanish gained prestige, taking over as a language of wider communication and the dominant language of Peru.&lt;ref name= CoronelM&gt;Coronel-Molina, Serafin M. "Functional Domains of the Quechua Language in Peru: Issues of Status Planning." University of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975, under the leadership of President [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], the revolutionary government of Peru declared Quechua an official language of the Peruvian state, "coequal with Spanish."&lt;ref name=Hornberger2&gt;Hornberger, Nancy and Kendell A. King. "Authenticity and Unification in Quechua Language Planning." University of Pennsylvania: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, the law was reversed.&lt;ref name=CoronelM /&gt; Peru's 1979 [[constitution]] declares Spanish the only official language of the state; Quechua and Aymara are relegated to "official use zones," equivalent to Stewart's provincial function described above. Quechua has officially remained a provincial language since 1979.  Today, Quechua also serves a limited international function throughout [[South America]] in [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], and [[Ecuador]]; communities of Quechua speakers outside Peru enable communication in Quechua across borders. Still, because of Quechua's low status, Spanish is almost always used as the lingua franca instead. Recently, Quechua has also gained ground in the academic world, both as a school subject and a topic of literary interest.

=== Corpus planning ===
The three main types of corpus planning are all evident in the development of Quechua languages in Peru since the colonial era. Graphization has been in process since the arrival of the Spanish in the region, when the Spanish imperialists attempted to describe the exotic sounds of the language to Europeans.&lt;ref name= Coronel&gt;Coronel-Molina, Serafin M. (1996). "Corpus Planning for the Southern Peruvian Quechua Language." ''Working Papers in Educational Linguistics,'' 12 (2), pp 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Quechua was made an official language in Peru in 1975, the introduction of the language into the education and government domains made it essential to have a standard written language.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;  The task of adopting a writing system proved to be a point of contention among Peruvian linguists. Although most agreed to use the [[Latin alphabet]], linguists disagreed about how to represent the phonological system of Quechua, particularly in regards to the vowel system. Representatives from the [[Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua|Peruvian Academy of the Quechua language]] and the [[SIL International|Summer Institute of Linguistics]] wanted to represent [[allophone]]s of the [[vowel]]s /i/ and /u/ with separate letters &lt;e&gt; and &lt;o&gt;, which creates an apparent five-vowel system. They argued that this makes the language easier to learn for people who are already familiar with written Spanish. However, other Peruvian linguists argued that a three-vowel system was more faithful to the [[phonology]] of Quechua. After several years of debate and disagreement, in 1985 Peruvian linguists proposed the Pan-Quechua alphabet as an accurate representation of the language, and this was adopted in [[intercultural bilingual education]] programs and textbooks. However, the Peruvian Academy and the SIL both refused to adopt it and continued to propose new alphabets, leaving the issue unsettled.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt; For more information, see [[Quechua languages#Writing system|Quechua writing system]] and [[Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift]]. Another of the primary issues disagreements was about how to reflect the phonological differences apparent in different dialects of Quechua. For example, some distinct dialects utilize [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] and [[glottalization|glottalized]] versions of the [[voiceless uvular plosive|voiceless uvular stop /q/]], while others do not and some language planners found it important to reflect these dialectal differences.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

The search for a unified alphabet reflects the process of standardization. Unlike other cases of standardization, in Quechua this has been applied only to the written language, not to the spoken language, and no attempt was made to change the spoken language of native speakers, which varied by regions. Rather, standardization was required in order to create a uniform writing system to provide education to Quechua speakers in their native language.

Language planners in Peru have proposed several varieties to serve as the supradialectal spoken norm. Some saw [[Qusqu-Qullaw]] as the natural choice for a standard norm, as it is recognized to be the variety closest to that spoken by the Incas. Others argued that [[Ayacucho Quechua]] is a better option, as the language is more conservative and similar to the proto-language, while Qusqu-Qullaw has been influenced by contact with the [[Aymara language]].

[[Rodolfo Cerrón-Palomino]] proposed a standard literary norm, [[Southern Quechua]] that combines features of both these dialects. This norm has been accepted by many institutions in Peru.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

Lexical modernization has also been critical to the development of Quechua. Language planners have attempted to create new Quechua words primarily through Quechua morphemes, which are combined in new ways to give new meanings. In general, loanwords from other languages are considered only when there are no possibilities to develop the word through existing Quechua structures. If loanwords are adopted into the language, linguists attempt to phonologically adapt the word to match typical Quechua pronunciation norms.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

=== Acquisition planning ===
Since Quechua is no longer an official language of Peru, Quechua literacy is not consistently encouraged in schools.&lt;ref name= Hornberger3&gt;Hornberger, Nancy "Quechua Literacy and Empowerment." ''Indigenous Literacies in the Americas'' Ed. Hornberger, Nancy. New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Peru's education system is instead primarily based on Spanish, the nation's official language. Despite its low prestige, Quechua is still spoken by millions of indigenous Peruvians, a large portion of whom are bilingual in Quechua and Spanish. There is a desire to preserve the uniqueness of Quechua as a language with its own attributes and representations of culture. Some argue that promoting a diverse literacy program gives students diverse perspectives on life, which could only enhance their educational experience.&lt;ref name= Hornberger3 /&gt; Before 1975, Peru had bilingual education programs, but Quechua was not taught as a subject in primary and secondary schools.  After the 1975 education reform, Quechua and Spanish both had standing in bilingual programs, but only in restricted speech communities. These experimental programs were then canceled due to a change in government planning, but again reinstated in 1996. Even with national [[intercultural bilingual education]] programs, teachers at local schools and members of the community often prefer using Spanish, destabilizing support for bilingual education.&lt;ref name= CoronelM /&gt; This underscores the importance of community support as a goal for the education sector as mentioned earlier. Some believe that due to Spanish's higher national prestige, it is more socially and economically beneficial to learn and speak Spanish. It is debatable whether these education programs will benefit education or raise the status of Quechua.&lt;ref name= CoronelM /&gt;

A '''lexicon''', '''word-hoard''', '''wordbook''', or '''word-stock''' is the [[vocabulary]] of a person, [[language]], or branch of [[knowledge]] (such as [[nautical]] or [[medical]]).  In [[linguistics]], a '''lexicon''' is a language's inventory of [[lexeme]]s. The word "lexicon" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|λεξικόν}} (''lexicon''), neuter of {{lang|grc|λεξικός}} (''lexikos'') meaning "of or for words."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlecikos λεξικός] in Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (Perseus Digital Library). Sc. βιβλίον "book").&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic theories generally regard human languages as consisting of two parts: a lexicon, essentially a catalogue of a language's words (its [[wikt:wordstock|wordstock]]); and a [[grammar]], a system of rules which allow for the combination of those words into meaningful sentences. The lexicon is also thought to include [[bound morpheme]]s, which cannot stand alone as words (such as most [[affix]]es).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=OKvziaqXzXwC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=morphemes+lexicon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CB_0QMidAO&amp;sig=1YiUJnAc0kj-Pbh0V6duJhHPktg&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl99OPt_TTAhWK0xoKHUolARo4ChDoAQgpMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=morphemes%20lexicon&amp;f=false|title=Morphological structure, lexical representation, and lexical access|last2=Taft|first2=Marcus|date=1994|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|last1=Dominiek|first1=Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some analyses, [[compound word]]s and certain classes of [[idiom]]atic expressions and other [[collocation]]s are also considered to be part of the lexicon. [[Dictionary|Dictionaries]] represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included.

== Size and organization ==

Items in the lexicon are called lexemes, or lexical items, or word forms. Lexemes are not atomic elements but contain both phonological and morphological components. When describing the lexicon, a reductionist approach is used, trying to remain general while using a minimal description. To describe the size of a lexicon, [[lexeme]]s are grouped into lemmas. A [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]] is a group of lexemes generated by [[Inflection#Inflectional morphology|inflectional morphology]]. Lemmas are represented in dictionaries by headwords which list the [[citation form]]s and any [[English irregular verbs|irregular forms]], since these must be learned to use the words correctly. Lexemes derived from a word by derivational morphology are considered new lemmas. The lexicon is also organized according to open and closed categories. [[Part of speech|Closed categories]], such as [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] or [[pronoun]]s, are rarely given new lexemes; their function is primarily [[Syntax|syntactic]]. Open categories, such as [[noun]]s and [[verb]]s, have highly active generation mechanisms and their lexemes are more [[Semantics|semantic]] in nature.

== Lexicalization and other mechanisms in the lexicon ==
{{anchor#Lexicalization}}

A central role of the lexicon is the documenting of established ''lexical norms and conventions''. [[Lexicalization]] is the process in which new words, having gained widespread usage, enter the lexicon. Since lexicalization&lt;ref name="Geert2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Geert |first=Booij |title=The grammar of words : an introduction to linguistic morphology |series=Oxford textbooks in linguistics |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-928042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; may modify lexemes phonologically and morphologically, it is possible that a single etymological source may be inserted into a single lexicon in two or more forms. These pairs, called a [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublet]], are often close semantically. Two examples are ''[[wikt:aptitude|aptitude]]'' versus ''[[wikt:attitude|attitude]]'' and ''[[wikt:employ|employ]]'' versus ''[[wikt:imply|imply]]''.&lt;ref name="Skeat 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Skeat |first=Walter |title=A Concise Etymological Dictionary of the English Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRGhnkZq3HQC |date=2010-04-17 |publisher=Forgotten Books |isbn=978-1-4400-5722-9 |page=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms, not mutually exclusive, are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ornan |first=Uzzi |authorlink=Uzzi Ornan |title=The Final Word — Mechanism For Hebrew Word Generation |year=2003 |publisher=Haifa University Press |location=Haifa |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Innovation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalf |first=Allan |title=Predicting New Words — The Secrets of Their Success |year=2002 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |location=Boston |isbn=0-618-13006-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the planned creation of new roots (often on a large-scale), such as ''slang'', ''branding''.
* Borrowing of foreign words.
* [[Compound (linguistics)|Compounding]] (composition), the combination of lexemes to make a single word.
* [[Abbreviation]] of compounds.
* [[Acronyms]], the reduction of compounds to their initial letters, such as [[wikt:NASA|NASA]] and [[wikt:laser|laser (from "LASER")]].
* [[Inflection]], a morphology change with a category, such as number or tense.
* [[Morphological derivation|Derivation]], a morphological change resulting in a change of category.
* [[Agglutination]], the compounding of morphemes into a single word.

===Neologisms (new words)===
[[Neologism]]s are new lexeme candidates which, if they gain wide usage over time, become part of a language's lexicon. Neologisms are often introduced by children who produce erroneous forms by mistake.&lt;ref name="Jaeger2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaeger |first=Jeri J. |title=Kid's slips: what young children's slips of the tongue reveal about language development |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1YGd1FkRgAC |accessdate=8 April 2012 |year=2005 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-8058-3579-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common source is slang and activities such as advertising and branding.

===Neologisms that maintain the sound of their external source===
There are two types of borrowings (neologisms based on external sources) that retain the sound of the [[Source language (translation)|source language]] material:
* Borrowing using the source language lexical item as the basic material for the neologization: guestwords, foreignisms and loanwords
* Borrowing using a target language lexical items as the basic material for the neologization: phono-semantic matching, semanticized phonetic matching and phonetic matching.

====Guestwords, foreignisms and loanwords====
The following are examples of external lexical expansion using the [[Source language (translation)|source language]] lexical item as the basic material for the neologization, listed in decreasing order of phonetic resemblance to the original lexical item (in the source language):&lt;ref&gt;Page 8 in [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]], by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Guestword (in German: ''Gastwort''): unassimilated borrowing.
* Foreignism (in German: ''Fremdwort''): foreign word, e.g. phonetic adaptation.
* Loanword (in German: ''Lehnwort''): totally assimilated borrowing, e.g. morphemic adaptation.

====Phono-semantic matches, semanticized phonetic matches and phonetic matches====
The following are examples of simultaneous external and internal lexical expansion using [[Target language (translation)|target language]] lexical items as the basic material for the neologization but still resembling the sound of the lexical item in the source language:&lt;ref&gt;Page 8 in ''Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew'', by Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phono-semantic matching]] (PSM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item both phonetically and semantically.
* Semanticized phonetic matching (SPM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item phonetically, and only in a loose way semantically.
* Phonetic matching (PM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item phonetically but not semantically.

===Role of morphology===
Another mechanism involves [[Generative grammar|generative]] devices that combine morphemes according to a language's rules. For example, the [[Suffix (linguistics)|suffix]] "-able" is usually only added to [[transitive verb]]s, as in "readable" but not "cryable".

===Compounding===
A compound word is a lexeme composed of several established lexemes, whose semantics is not the sum of that of their constituents. They can be interpreted through [[analogy]], [[Pragmatics|common sense and, most commonly, context]].&lt;ref name="Geert2005" /&gt; Compound words can have simple or complex morphological structures. Usually only the head requires inflection for agreement. Compounding may result in lexemes of unwieldy proportion. This is compensated by mechanisms that reduce the length of words. A similar phenomenon has been recently shown to feature in social media also where hashtags compound to form longer-sized hashtags that are at times more popular than the individual constituent hashtags forming the compound.&lt;ref name="Maity2016"&gt;Suman Kalyan Maity, Ritvik Saraf and Animesh Mukherjee (2016). #Bieber + #Blast = #BieberBlast: Early Prediction of Popular Hashtag Compounds. In ''ACM CSCW'', San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding is the most common of word formation strategies cross-linguistically. 

== Diachronic mechanisms ==

Comparative historical linguistics studies the evolutions languages and takes a [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] view of the lexicon. The evolution of lexicons in different languages occurs through parallel mechanism. Over time historical forces work to  shape the lexicon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutscher |first=Guy |authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist) |title=The Unfolding of Language: An Evolutionary Tour of Mankind's Greatest Invention  |date=May 19, 2005 |publisher=Metropolitan Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it simpler to acquire and often creating an illusion of great regularity in language.
* [[Assimilation (linguistics)|Phonological assimilation]], the modification of loanwords to fit a new language's sound structure more effectively. If, however, a loanword sounds too "foreign", inflection or derivation rules may not be able to transform it.
* [[Analogy]], where new words undergo inflection and derivation analogous to that of words with a similar sound structure.
* [[Stress (linguistics)|Emphasis]], the modification of words' stress or accenting.
* [[Metaphor]], a form of semantic extension.

== Second-language lexicon ==
{{main|Bilingual lexical access}}

The term "lexicon" is generally used in the context of single language. Therefore, multi-lingual speakers are generally thought to have multiple lexicons. Speakers of language variants ([[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[European Portuguese]], for example) may be considered to possess a single lexicon. Thus a ''[[wikt:cash dispenser|cash dispenser]]'' (British English) as well as an  [[wikt:automatic teller machine|automatic teller machine]] or [[wikt:ATM|ATM]] in American English would be understood by both American and British speakers, despite each group using different dialects.

When linguists study a lexicon, they consider such things as what constitutes a word; the word/[[concept]] relationship; [[lexical access]] and lexical access failure; how a word's [[phonology]], [[syntax]], and meaning intersect; the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]-word relationship; vocabulary structure within a given language; language use ([[pragmatics]]); [[language acquisition]]; the history and evolution of words ([[etymology]]); and the relationships between words, often studied within [[philosophy of language]].

Various models of how lexicons are organized and how words are retrieved have been proposed in [[psycholinguistics]], [[neurolinguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]].

In the [[Linguistics|study of language]], '''description''' or '''descriptive linguistics''' is the work of [[Objectivity (science)|objectively]] analyzing and describing how [[language]] is actually used (or how it was used in the past) by a group of people in a speech community.

All academic research in [[linguistics]] is descriptive; like all other scientific disciplines, its aim is to describe the reality as it is, without the bias of preconceived ideas about how it ought to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kordić|first=Snježana|authorlink=Snježana Kordić|year=2010|language=Serbo-Croatian|title=Jezik i nacionalizam|trans-title=Language and Nationalism|url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf|series=Rotulus Universitas|location=Zagreb|publisher=Durieux|page=60|isbn=978-953-188-311-5|lccn=2011520778|oclc=729837512|ol=15270636W|id={{COBISS|13436977}}|archivedate= 8 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/690BiBe4T?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2015|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Moch.

Linguistic description is often contrasted with [[linguistic prescription]], which is found especially in [[education]] and in [[publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Lawrence Trask|title=Key Concepts in Language and Linguistics|pages=47-48|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EE4dhRzavEgC|isbn=9780415157414|lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nils Langer|title=Linguistic Purism in Action: How auxiliary tun was stigmatized in Early New High German|year=2013|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110881103|pages=223|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IZUiAAAAQBAJ|lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescription seeks to define standard language forms and give advice on effective language use, and can be thought of as a presentation of the fruits of descriptive research in a learnable form, though it also draws on more subjective aspects of language aesthetics. Prescription and description are complementary, but have different priorities and sometimes are seen to be in conflict. Description is sometimes distinguished from "descriptivism", which is then defined as the belief that description is more significant or important to teach, study, and practice than prescription.

==Description==
As English-linguist Larry Andrews describes it, descriptive grammar is the linguistic approach that studies what a language is like, as opposed to prescriptive, which declares what a language should be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Larry|title=Language Exploration and Awareness: A Resource Book for Teachers|date=2006|publisher=Lawrence Earlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-4308-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, descriptive grammarians focus analysis on how all sorts of people in all sorts of environments, usually in more casual, everyday settings, communicate, while prescriptive grammarians focus on the grammatical rules and structures predetermined by linguistic registers and figures of power for those who are under the control of said authorities to use. An example Andrews uses in his book is ''fewer than'' vs ''less than''.&lt;ref name="Andrews-26"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Larry|title=Language Exploration and Awareness: A Resource Book for Teachers|date=2006|publisher=Lawrence Earlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-4308-6|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A descriptive grammarian would state that both statements are correct, as long as the receiver of the message can understand the meaning behind the statement. A prescriptive grammarian, on the other hand, would analyze the rules and conventions behind the statements made and determine which statement is correct according to those rules. Andrews also believes that although the majority of linguists would be descriptive grammarians, the majority of public school teachers tend to be prescriptive.&lt;ref name="Andrews-26" /&gt;

==Challenges==
Accurate description of real speech is a difficult problem, and linguists have often been reduced to approximations. Almost all linguistic theory has its origin in practical problems of descriptive linguistics. [[Phonology]] (and its theoretical developments, such as the [[phoneme]]) deals with the function and interpretation of sound in language. [[Syntax]] has developed to describe the rules concerning how words relate to each other in order to form sentences. [[Lexicology]] collects "words" and their derivations and transformations: it has not given rise to much generalized theory.

An extreme "mentalist" viewpoint denies that the linguistic description of a language can be done by anyone but a competent speaker. Such speakers have internalized something called "[[linguistic competence]]", which gives them the ability to extrapolate correctly from their experience new but correct expressions, and to reject expressions which do not convey meaning in the way the speaker intends. For example, an expression could be [[ambiguous]], possibly leading to several different interpretations by the listener. Depending on the speaker's intent, ambiguity can be desirable (as in [[joke]]s and other [[humor]]) or not. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A linguistic description is considered descriptively adequate if it achieves one or more of the following goals of descriptive linguistics:
# A description of the [[phonology]] of the language in question.
# A description of the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of words belonging to that language.
# A description of the [[syntax]] of well-formed sentences of that language.
# A description of [[Derivation (linguistics)|lexical derivation]].
# A documentation of the [[vocabulary]], including at least one thousand entries.
# A reproduction of a few genuine texts.

'''Láadan''' is a feminist&lt;ref name="foer-2012"&gt;Joshua Foer, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/12/24/121224fa_fact_foer "John Quijada and Ithkuil, the Language He Invented"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Dec. 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[constructed language]] created by [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] in 1982 to test the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780761169086|title=Atlas Obscura|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically to determine if development of a language aimed at expressing the views of women would shape a culture; a subsidiary hypothesis was that Western [[natural language]]s may be better suited for expressing the views of men than women. The language was included in her [[science fiction]] [[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|''Native Tongue'']] series. Láadan contains a number of words that are used to make unambiguous statements that include how one feels about what one is saying. According to Elgin, this is designed to counter [[Androcentrism|male-centered]] language's limitations on women, who are forced to respond "I know I said that, but I meant this".

== Phonology ==

=== Tones ===
Láadan is a [[tone (linguistics)|tonal language]]. It utilises two distinct tones:
* ''lo''{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|/lō/}} or {{IPA|/lò/}}, a short, medium or low tone, represented by a single unmarked vowel
* ''ló''{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|/ló/}}, a short, high tone, represented by a single marked vowel
The word "Láadan" has three syllables: "lá-" with the short vowel /a/ plus high tone; "-a" with the short vowel /a/ and no tone; and "-dan".

Láadan does not allow any double [i.e. long] phonemes. Whenever two identical short vowels would occur side by side in a single morpheme, one of them has to be marked for high tone. When adding an affix would result in two identical vowels side by side, an epenthetic /h/ is inserted to prevent the forbidden sequence. The language will allow either "máa" or "maá," but not "maa". These combinations can be described as:
* ''loó''{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|/lǒː/}}, a long, low-rising tone, represented by a double vowel, the second of which is marked
* ''lóo''{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|/lôː/}}, a long, high-falling tone, represented by a double vowel, the first of which is marked
(Some people analyze these tone sequences as tonemic as well, for a total of four tones.)

Elgin prefers an analysis of the language as having no long vowels and a single tone, the high tone (distinguished from "neutral, baseline pitch"), but she acknowledges that linguists using other formalisms would be justified in saying that there are two tones, high and low (or unmarked or mid).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ozarque.livejournal.com/253528.html?thread=4544600#t4544600 Elgin's blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowels ===
Láadan has five [[vowel]]s:
* ''a''{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|/ɑ/}}, an [[open back unrounded vowel]] (as [[English language|English]] ''calm''),
* ''e''{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|/ɛ/}}, an [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] (as English ''bell''),
* ''i''{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|/ɪ/}}, a [[near-close near-front unrounded vowel]] (as English ''bit''),
* ''o''{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|/o/}}, a [[close-mid back rounded vowel]] (as English ''home''),
* ''u''{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|/u/}}, a [[close back rounded vowel]] (as English ''boon'').

Láadan lacks the [[consonant]]s {{IPA|/p, t, k, ɡ, s, z, f, v/}}. However, it uses ''b'', ''d'', ''sh'' ({{IPA|/ʃ/}}), ''m'', ''n'', ''l'', ''r'', ''w'', ''y'' ({{IPA|/j/}}), ''h'' with the same phonetic value as English. In addition to these, three [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] require further explanation:
* ''th''{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|/θ/}}, a [[voiceless dental fricative]] (always as in English ''think'', never as ''then''),
* ''zh''{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|/ʒ/}}, a [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] (as English ''plea'''s'''ure''),
* ''lh''{{spaced ndash}}{{IPA|/ɬ/}}, a [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] (as [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''llan'').

== Grammar ==
Most Láadan sentences contain three [[grammatical particle|particles]]:
* The ''speech-act'' particle{{spaced ndash}}this occurs at the beginning of the sentence and marks it as either a statement (''bíi''), a question (''báa''), ''et cetera''; in connected speech or writing, this particle is often omitted. They are:
*; Bíi : Indicates a declarative sentence (usually optional)
*; Báa : Indicates a question
*; Bó : Indicates a command; very rare, except to small children
*; Bóo : Indicates a request; this is the usual imperative/"command" form
*; Bé : Indicates a promise
*; Bée : Indicates a warning
* The [[grammatical tense]] particle{{spaced ndash}}this occurs second in the sentence and marks it as either [[present tense]] (''ril''), [[past tense]] (''eril''), [[future tense]] (''aril'') or hypothetical (''wil''); without the tense particle, the sentence is assumed to have the same tense as the previous sentence.
* The [[evidentiality|evidence]] particle{{spaced ndash}}this occurs at the end of statements and indicates the trustworthiness of the statement. They are:
*; wa : Known to speaker because perceived by speaker, externally or internally
*; wi : Known to speaker because self-evident
*; we : Perceived by speaker in a dream
*; wáa : Assumed true by speaker because speaker trusts source

Láadan is a [[verb–subject–object]] (VSO) language. [[Verb]]s and [[adjective]]s are interchangeable. There are no [[article (grammar)|articles]], and the object is marked by the ''-th'' or ''-eth'' [[suffix]]. The [[plural]] number is shown only by the ''me-'' prefix to the verb. The particle ''ra'' following a verb makes it negative. Separate clauses are joined by the particle ''hé''.

=== Morphology ===
Láadan has an [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and uses a number of [[affix]]es to indicate various feelings and moods that many [[natural language]]s can only indicate by tone of voice, [[body language]] or circumlocution.

{|class="wikitable"
!Affix||meaning||example
|-
|(-)lh(-)||disgust or dislike||''hahodimi'': "pleasantly bewildered"; ''hahodimilh'': "unpleasantly bewildered"
|-
|du-||to try to||''bíi eril dusháad le wa'': "I tried to come"
|-
|dúu-||to try in vain to||''bíi eril dúusháad le wa'': "I tried in vain to come"
|-

|-
| -id||denotes male (otherwise female or gender neutral)||''thul'': "mother/parent"; ''thulid'': "father"
|}

The ''speech-act'' particle, at the beginning of a sentence, can also carry several suffixes, which expand on the overall state of the sentence. For example, ''bíi'' begins a statement, but ''bíide'' begins a statement that is part of a narrative; ''bóoth'' begins a request made in pain; ''báada'' begins a question that is meant in jest.

=== Pronouns ===
[[Pronoun]]s in Láadan are built up from a number of constituent parts. The consonant ''l'' marks the [[grammatical person|first person]], ''n'' the second person and ''b'' the third person. Usually, these are followed by the vowel ''e''. However, the vowel ''a'' is used to designate someone who is loved (''lhe-'' is prefixed to describe someone who is despised). The suffix ''-zh'' is used to mark a plural pronoun for numbers up to four, and ''-n'' for numbers beyond that. Therefore, ''lazh'' means "we, several beloved", and ''lheben'' means "they, many despised".

{{Semiotics}}

In [[semiotics]], the '''meaning''' of a sign is its place in a [[sign relation]], in other words, the set of roles that it occupies within a given sign relation.  

This statement holds whether ''sign'' is taken to mean a ''sign type'' or a ''sign token''.  Defined in these global terms, the meaning of a sign is not in general analyzable with full exactness into completely localized terms, but aspects of its meaning can be given approximate analyses, and special cases of sign relations frequently admit of more local analyses.

Two aspects of meaning that may be given approximate analyses are the ''connotative relation'' and the ''denotative relation''.  The connotative relation is the relation between signs and their interpretant signs.  The denotative relation is the relation between signs and objects. An arbitrary association exists between the ''signified'' and the ''signifier.''
For example, a US salesperson doing business in [[Etiquette in Japan|Japan]] might interpret [[silence]] following an offer as rejection, while to Japanese negotiators silence means the offer is being considered. This difference in interpretations represents a difference in: semiotics

==Triadic relation==
The triadic (three part) model of the sign separates the meaning of a sign into three distinct components:

1.The representamen, which is the medium, or ‘sign vehicle’,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Summer 2013|title = Peirce's Theory of Signs|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/peirce-semiotics/|date = 2013-01-01|first = Albert|last = Atkin|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; through which the sign is represented. For example, this could be written/spoken words, a photograph, or a painting.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Semiotics: The Basics|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|publisher = Routledge|year = 2002|isbn = 0-415-35111-1|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2.The interpretant, or what is meant by the sign &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

3. The object, or that to which the sign refers &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Together, these three components generate [[semiosis]]. For example, an exclamation mark can be broken down into these components. The representamen is the exclamation mark itself, the interpretant is the idea of excitement or an elevated volume of speech, and the object is the actual excitement or elevated volume of speech to which it refers.
While it might appear that the latter two are the same, the subtle difference lies in the fact that the interpretant refers to the idea of something, and the object is the thing itself.

The representamen component of the sign can be further broken down into three categories, which are icon, index, and symbol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These denote the degree of abstraction from the object to which they refer. A symbol, which is the most abstract, does not resemble or bear any physical relation to the thing that it represents in any way. For example, a peace sign has no relation to peace aside from its social construction as a symbol that represents it. An icon is slightly less abstract, and resembles to some degree the thing that it represents, and bears some physical likeness to it. A good example of this would be a painted portrait. An index is the least arbitrary category of representamen, and has a definite physical tie to that which it represents. This could be something like a weather vane blowing in the wind indicating that it is windy out, or smoke, which indicates a fire.

The triadic model of the sign was proposed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]]. In contradistinction to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s dyadic model, which assumed no material referent, Peirce's model assumes that in order for a sign to be meaningful, it must refer to something external and cannot be self-contained, as it is for Saussure. Thus, Peirce's model includes the addition of an 'object'. The ‘representamen’ and ‘interpretant’ components of the triadic model are comparable to Saussure’s dyadic model of the sign, which breaks down into signifier and signified.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13694">'''[[Metaphor]]''', the description of one thing as something else, has become of interest in recent decades to both [[analytic philosophy]] and [[continental philosophy]], but for different reasons.

== Metaphor in analytic philosophy ==
In the Anglo-American tradition of [[analytic philosophy]] (in particular, in the [[philosophy of language]]), [[metaphor]] has attracted interest because it does not conform to accepted [[truth-conditional semantics]], the conditions which determine whether or not a statement is true. Taken literally, the statement "Juliet is the sun" (from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'') is false, if not nonsensical, yet, taken metaphorically, it is meaningful and may be true, but in a sense which is far from clear. The comparison theory of metaphor asserts that one can express the [[truth value]] of a metaphor by listing all the respects in which the two terms are alike or similar; for example: Juliet is ''like'' the sun because she shares with it qualities such as radiance, brilliance, the fact that she makes the day and that she gets up every morning. However, this results in re-casting metaphor as [[simile]]. Because it can only explain the truth of metaphor by in effect losing metaphor, the comparison theory is rarely defended.

In contrast, two leading theorists emphasize the fact that [[truth conditions]] cannot be specified for a metaphor. [[Max Black]] maintains that metaphors are too open-ended to be able to function as [[referring expression]]s, and so cannot be expressions which have truth conditions {{Harv |Black|1962}}.  If metaphors are used in contexts where precise terminology is expected (for example, in a scientific theory), then their role, Black argues, is purely [[heuristic]], that is, they are means to an end or ways of assisting understanding, rather than being terms which can be tested for truth or falsity {{Harv |Black|1962| p= 37}}.  [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] also thinks it a mistake to look for the truth conditions of a metaphor, since, in his words, "much of what we are caused to notice [in a metaphor] is not propositional in character", that is to say, metaphor is a prompt to thought which cannot be reduced to or contained by a series of [[truth conditions]] {{Harv |Davidson|1984| p= 263}}.  What metaphor does, Davidson maintains, is make us see one thing as something else by "making [a] literal statement that inspires or prompts the insight" {{Harv |Davidson|1984| p= 263}}.  Seeing one thing as something else is not the recognition of some truth or fact, and so "the attempt to give literal expression to the content of the metaphor is simply misguided".{{Harv |Davidson|1984| p= 263}}

Max Black develops the idea that metaphor actually creates insight or new meaning {{Harv |Black|1979}}. His interactionist theory asserts that at the heart of a metaphor is the interaction between its two subject terms, where the interaction provides the condition for a meaning which neither of the subject terms possesses independently of the metaphorical context. The primary [[subject (grammar)|subject]] in a metaphor, he claims, is coloured by a set of "associated implications" normally predicated of the secondary [[subject (grammar)|subject]] {{Harv |Black|1979| p= 28}}.    From the number of possible meanings which could result, the primary subject sieves the qualities predicable of the secondary subject, letting through only those that fit. The interaction, as a process, brings into being what Black terms an "[[Logical implication|implication]]-complex", a system of associated implications shared by the linguistic community as well as an impulse of free meaning, free in that it is meaning which was unavailable prior to the metaphor's introduction.{{Harv |Black|1979| p= 28}}

In a different, naturalist, approach, some English-speaking philosophers close to [[cognitive science]], such as [[George Lakoff | Lakoff]], have made metaphor the central aspect of human rationality.

== Metaphor in continental philosophy ==
Whereas analytic philosophy examines metaphor within the philosophy of language, [[continental philosophy]] assigns much wider significance to metaphor. This is because the climate within continental thought has been more favourable to the propagation of new branches of enquiry from nineteenth century German philosophy. Although [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]] sit quite happily on both analytic and continental curricula, it is only the latter which has seriously addressed the need to rethink how the world appears to us and how it is made manifest to us in the light of their [[metaphysics]]. Metaphor has proven to be extremely important for this rethinking because it is the process of conceptual borrowing or reassignment which revises our perception of the world.

The major shift which occurs in [[Kantian]] continental philosophy, according to Cazeaux, is the departure 'from dualistic thought, i.e. thinking which remains within the boundaries created by oppositions, such as mind—body and subjective—objective' {{Harv |Cazeaux|2007| p=4}}.  The turn away from dualistic thought is made by Kant on account of his representing experience as the subjective determination of an objective world, thereby placing in a relationship terms which normally stand as opposites in a dualism. As a result of this shift, without conventional dualisms to fall back upon, the process of conceptual borrowing and cross-referral presented by metaphor becomes central as the means by which the textures and complexities of experience can be articulated. Theses to this effect, but with significant differences, can be found in [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], [[Merleau-Ponty]], [[Bachelard]], [[Paul Ricoeur]], and [[Derrida]].

To give two examples. According to [[Nietzsche]], we are in metaphor or we are metaphor: our being is not derived from a [[Platonism|Platonic]], eternal [[essence]] or from a [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] thinking substance but (in as much as there is a way of being we can call ours) is emergent from tensional interactions between competing drives or perspectives {{Harv |Nietzsche|2000}}. We customarily hold truth to be a relation of correspondence between knowledge and reality but, Nietzsche declares, it is in fact ‘a movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms’ due to the fundamentally metaphorical nature of concept-formation, a series of creative leaps from nerve [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] to retinal image (first metaphor) to sound as signifier (second metaphor) {{Harv |Nietzsche|2000| p=55}}.  Our categories, and the judgments we form with them, can never correspond to things in themselves because they are formed through a series of transformations which ensures that ‘there is no [[causality]], no correctness, and no expression’ connecting the first stage (the stimulus) with the last (the concept) {{Harv |Nietzsche|2000| p=58}}.

For [[Paul Ricoeur|Ricoeur]], metaphor is also ‘living’ – hence the title of his book, ''La Métaphore vive'' {{Harv |Ricoeur|1975}} (translated into English as ''The Rule of Metaphor'' {{Harv |Ricoeur|1977}}) – but in a different sense from Nietzsche .  Metaphor is living, Ricoeur claims, in that it is the principle which revives our [[perception]] of the world and through which we become aware of our creative capacity for seeing the world anew. This process, he thinks, is both paradoxical and Kantian in nature: paradoxical in that the creative combination of terms in a metaphor nevertheless produces meaning which has the character of a discovery (how can something be both a creation and a discovery?), and Kantian because the paradox mirrors Kant’s theory of experience in which the subjective application of concepts nevertheless yields perception of an objective world.  The tension between the subjective, creative and the objective, discovery aspects of a metaphor, Ricoeur argues, proceeds ‘from the very structures of the mind, which it is the task of [Kant’s] transcendental philosophy to articulate’ {{Harv |Ricoeur|1977| p=300}}.  Unfortunately, the part of Kant’s philosophy which Ricoeur appeals to is highly problematic: the [[Schema (Kant)|schema]] or schematism,  the operation which Kant dismisses as ‘an art concealed in the depths of the human soul' {{Harv |Kant|1929| p=183, A141, B180-81}}.  Ricoeur’s Kantianism is considered at length by Cazeaux {{Harv |Cazeaux|2007}} and Stellardi {{Harv |Stellardi|2000}}, with the former providing an account of how the schematism might afford a coherent explanation of metaphor.

Another reason for the attention paid by continental philosophy to metaphor is the questioning of boundaries – between subject areas and between the wider concepts of [[ethics]], [[epistemology]] and [[aesthetics]] – which has occurred within [[postmodernism]]. Principal concerns in these debates are the status of knowledge and the way in which the concepts of [[truth]] and objectivity are understood. Philosophy has been under attack on this score with its history of ‘universal truths’, e.g. [[Descartes]]’s cogito, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s table of categories, and [[Hegel]]’s Absolute Consciousness. The main arguments against this universalism invoke metaphor on two related accounts: (1) the fact that key epistemological concepts have metaphors at their root, for example, “mirroring”, “[[Communication|correspondence]]”, “[[sense data]]”, is taken as evidence of the contingent, communal, subjective basis of knowledge, and (2) because metaphor (as a form of dislocated or dislocating predication) works by testing the appropriate with the inappropriate, it is seen as a means of challenging the boundaries whereby one subject defines itself in relation to another.

In [[romance languages]], '''''nomen à clef''''' or '''''nomen à clé''''' ({{IPA-fr|nomen‿a kle|}}, French for "name with a key"), is a [[name]] describing a real person, behind a façade of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VxFomoeKT74C&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=film+%C3%A0+clef&amp;lr=&amp;ei=mFMTS4H2FpCuzQSZ3737DA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "The films in my life" By François Truffaut, Da Capo Press, 1994, ISBN 0-306-80599-5, ISBN 978-0-306-80599-8, pg 131]&lt;/ref&gt; "Key" in this context means a table one can use to swap out the names.  
It is the nomenclature complement of the [[roman à clef]].

{{Shintoism}}
{{Nihongo|'''Norito'''|祝詞}} are [[Liturgy|liturgical]] texts or ritual incantations in [[Shinto]], usually addressed to a given ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Philippi|first=Donald L.|title=Norito: A Translation of the Ancient Japanese Ritual Prayers|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691014892|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norito|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/norito|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaShinto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Motosawa|first1=Masafumi|title=Norito|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1246|website=Encyclopedia of Shinto|publisher=Kokugakuin University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

There is no single accepted universally accepted theory to explain the meaning of the term.&lt;ref name="Philippi2"&gt;Philippi (1990). p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; One theory derives ''norito'' from ''noru'' ([[wikt:宣#Kanji|宣る]], 'to declare'; cf. the verbs ''[[wikt:祈る|inoru]]'' 'to pray' and ''[[wikt:呪う|norou]]'' 'to curse'&lt;ref name="Philippi2" /&gt;) - combined with the suffix ''-to''.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaShinto" /&gt; A variant term, ''notto'', is derived from a combination of ''norito'' with ''koto'', 'word'.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaShinto" /&gt;

There are various known ways of writing the word in [[kanji]]: aside from 祝詞 (currently the standard), 詔戸言, 詔刀言, and 諄辞 are also attested.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaShinto" /&gt;

One recent writer summed up the original meaning of ''norito'' as "a general term meaning [[Kotodama|magic by means of words]]."&lt;ref&gt;Shiraishi, Mitsukuni, cited in Philippi (1990). p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first written documentation of ''norito'' dates to 712 CE in the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and 720 CE in the ''[[Nihongi]]''.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaShinto" /&gt;

The [[Engishiki]], a compilation of laws and minute regulation presented by the court compiled in 927 CE, preserves twenty-seven representative forms of ''norito''.&lt;ref&gt;Philippi (1990). p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitagawa|first1=Joseph Mitsuo|title=On Understanding Japanese Religion|date=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691102290|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1xcc4cGL5cC&amp;pg=PA67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading==

''Norito'' were (and still are) traditionally written in a variety of ''[[man'yōgana]]'' where [[Japanese particles|particles]] and suffixes are written in a smaller script than the main body of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sinor|editor1-first=Denis|title=American Oriental Society, Middle West Branch, Semi-Centennial Volume: A Collection of Original Essays|date=1969|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=242-243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGEDAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of writing, used in imperial edicts (宣命 ''senmyō'') preserved in the ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'' and other texts dating from the 8th century ([[Nara period]]), is known as ''senmyōgaki''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seeley|first1=Christopher|title=A History of Writing in Japan|date=1991|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004090811|pages=54-55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCZ2ya6cg88C&amp;pg=PA54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4246">An '''open-ended question''' cannot be answered with a "yes" or "no" response, or with a static response. Open-ended questions are phrased as a statement which requires a response. The response can be compared to information that is already known to the questioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ackley | first = Betty | title = Nursing diagnosis handbook : an evidence-based guide to planning care | publisher = Mosby | location = Maryland Heights, Mo | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780323071505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of open-ended questions:
*Tell me about your relationship with your supervisor.  
*How do you see your future?
*Tell me about the children in this photograph.
*What is the purpose of government?
*Why did you choose that answer?
*Tap?

== Education: open questioning ==
The received wisdom in education is that open questions are broadly speaking ‘good’ questions. They invite students to give longer responses that demonstrate their understanding. They are preferable to [[Closed-ended question|closed questions]] (i.e. one that demands a yes/no answer) because they are better for discussions or enquiries, whereas closed questions are only good for knowledge testing. 

Peter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley’s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are “grammatically closed, but conceptually open”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2016-12-03|title=Ariadne’s Clew Absence and presence in the facilitation of philosophical conversations|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1350/870|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v3i2.1350|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, in standard parlance, ‘is it ever right to lie?’ would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes/no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes/no answer to it can be ‘opened up’ by the questioner (‘why do you think that?,’ ‘Could there be an instance where that’s not the case?), inviting elaboration and enquiry. 

This grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, “gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/question-your-questioning|title=Question your questioning|date=2017-04-19|work=Tes|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Closed questions, simply require ‘opening up’ strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential. 

Worley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention 'Open Questioning Mindset', or OQM. OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of student’s contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genuine enquiry in the classroom. It provides teachers with the tools to move beyond what Worley calls ‘guess what’s in my head’ teaching, that relies on [[Closed-ended question|closed]] and leading questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2015-11-29|title=Open thinking, closed questioning: Two kinds of open and closed question|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1269|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v2i2.1269|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Paremiology''' ({{Etymology|gre|παροιμία (paroimía)|proverb, maxim, saw}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparoimi%2Fa παροιμία], [[Henry George Liddell]], Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;  is the collection and study of [[proverb]]s.

==History==
Paremiology can be dated back as far as [[Aristotle]]. [[Paremiography]], on the other hand, is the collection of proverbs. The proverb scholar [[Wolfgang Mieder]] defines the term ''proverb'' as follows:

{{Quote|A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation.|Mieder 1985:119; also in Mieder 1993:24}}

==Categorization==
As well as actual proverbs, the following may be considered proverbial phrases:
* proverbial comparison, such as "as busy as a bee."
* proverbial interrogative, such as "Does a chicken have lips?"
* [[wellerism]], named after [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]] from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1837), is a triad that consists of a statement (often a proverb), an identification of a speaker (person or animal), and a phrase that places the statement into an unexpected situation. An example: "Every evil is followed by some good," the man said when his wife died the day after he became bankrupt.
*[[anti-proverb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mieder|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Litovkina|first2=Anna|title=Twisted Wisdon: Modern Anti-Proverbs|date=2002|publisher=DeProverbio}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[perverb]]. This is a misuse or adaptation of a familiar proverb to twist or change its meaning. Examples include: "Nerds of a feather flock together," "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and likely to talk about it," and "Absence makes the heart grow wander." Anti-proverbs are common on T-shirts, such as "If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatoshop.com/product/If-At-First-You-Dont-Succeed-Skydiving-Isnt-For-You |title=T-shirt with anti-proverb |publisher=Neatoshop.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even classic Latin proverbs can be remolded as anti-proverbs, such as "[[Carpe diem|Carpe noctem]]." and "Carpe per diem." Anti-proverbs are not new; [[Aristophanes]] is credited with creating one over 2,300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, Alster, Bendt. 1979. "An Akkadian and a Greek proverb: A comparative study". ''Die Welt des Orients'' 10:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[proverbial expression]], such as "to bite the dust." This is not strictly a proverb, which should be a fixed unchangeable sentence; a proverbial expression permits alteration to fit the grammar of the context.&lt;ref name=folk&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 "Proverbial Phrases from California"], by Owen S. Adams, ''[[Western Folklore]]'', Vol. 8, No. 2 (1949), pp. 95-116 {{doi|10.2307/1497581}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[allusion]], which is a reference to a proverb rather than a statement of the proverb. An example: "The new boss will probably fire some of the old staff, you know what they say about a ''new broom''." This allusion refers to the proverb "A new broom sweeps clean."&lt;ref name=folk/&gt;

==Styles==
Typical stylistic features of proverbs (as Shirley Arora points out in her article, ''The Perception of Proverbiality'' (1984)) are:

* [[Alliteration]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Fionnuala Carson. 2011. Alliteration in English-Language Versions of Current Widespread European Idioms and Proverbs. Jonathan Roper,  (ed.) ''Alliteration in Culture'', pp. 34-44. England: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; (Forgive and forget)
* [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|Parallelism]] (Nothing ventured, nothing gained)
* [[Rhyme]] (When the cat is away, the mice will play)
* [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]] (Once bitten, twice shy)

==Poetic techniques==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
In some languages, [[assonance]], the repetition of a vowel, is also exploited in forming artistic proverbs, such as the following extreme example from [[Oromo language|Oromo]], of Ethiopia.
* kan mana baala, aɂlaa gaala ("A leaf at home, but a camel elsewhere"; somebody who has a big reputation among those who do not know him well.)
Similarly, from [[Tajik language|Tajik]]:
* Az yak palak ― chand handalak ("From one vine, many different melons.")
* Man taanna adraka ma tamanna ("No point in running, one should leave on time.") Arabic
Notice that in all of these cases of complete assonance, the vowel is &lt;a&gt;, the most common vowel in human languages.

Also in [[Amharic]], complete assonance is not infrequent when verbs are in the 3rd person masculine singular, past tense. The vowel &lt;ä&gt; is the most frequent vowel in the language.
*yälämmänä mänämmänä - (The one who begs becomes thin.)

Internal features that can be found quite frequently include:
* [[Hyperbole]] (All is fair in love and war)
* [[Paradox]] (For there to be peace there must first be war)
* [[Personification]] (Hunger is the best cook)

==Metaphorical links==
To make the respective statement more general most proverbs are based on a [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Mac Coinnigh, Marcas. ‘[https://www.academia.edu/2353903/_The_Heart_of_Irish-Language_Proverbs_An_Linguo-Stylistic_Analysis_of_Explicit_Metaphor The Heart of Irish-Language Proverbs? A Linguo-stylistic Analysis of Explicit Metaphor’]. Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship 30 (2013): 113-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Further typical features of the proverb are its shortness and the fact that its author is generally unknown.
[[File:Nimm dich selbst by der Nase.JPG|thumb|''Nimm dich selbst bei der Nase'' ("take yourself by your nose"). It's also called "Vogel Selbsterkenntnis" (Bird of self-knowledge)]]

==Interpretations from other languages==
In the article "Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding", Joseph Raymond comments on what common [[Russian proverbs]] from the 18th and 19th centuries portray: Potent antiauthoritarian proverbs reflected tensions between the Russian people and the [[Czar]]. The rollickingly malicious undertone of these folk verbalizations constitutes what might be labeled a "paremiological revolt". To avoid openly criticizing a given authority or cultural pattern, folk take recourse to proverbial expressions which voice personal tensions in a tone of generalized consent.{{huh|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;J. Raymond. 1956. Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding. ''Western Folklore'' 15.3, pg 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs that speak to the political disgruntlement include: "When the Czar spits into the soup dish, it fairly bursts with pride"; "If the Czar be a rhymester, woe be to the poets"; and "The hen of the [[Czarina]] herself does not lay swan's eggs". While none of these proverbs state directly, "I hate the Czar and detest my situation" (which would have been incredibly dangerous), they do get their points across.

Proverbs are found in many parts of the world, but some areas seem to have richer stores of proverbs than others (such as West Africa), while others have hardly any (North and South America) (Mieder 2004b:108,109).

==Users of proverbs==
Proverbs are used by speakers for a variety of purposes.  Sometimes they are used as a way of saying something gently, in a veiled way (Obeng 1996). Other times, they are used to carry more weight in a discussion, a weak person is able to enlist the tradition of the ancestors to support his position, or even to argue a legal case.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Messenger Jr. The Role of Proverbs in a Nigerian Judicial System. ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology''. 15:1 (Spring, 1959) pp. 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs can also be used to simply make a conversation/discussion more lively.  In many parts of the world, the use of proverbs is a mark of being a good orator.

==Uses of paremiology==
The study of proverbs has application in a number of fields. Clearly, those who study [[folklore]] and [[literature]] are interested in them, but scholars from a variety of fields have found ways to profitably incorporate the study proverbs. For example, they have been used to study abstract reasoning of children, acculturation of immigrants, intelligence, the differing mental processes in mental illness, cultural themes, etc.  Proverbs have also been incorporated into the strategies of social workers, teachers, preachers, and even politicians. (For the deliberate use of proverbs as a propaganda tool by [[Nazi]]s, see Mieder 1982.)

There are collections of sayings that offer instructions on how to play certain games, such as [[dominoes]] (Borajo ''et al.'' 1990) and the Oriental board game [[go (board game)|go]] (Mitchell 2001).  However, these are not prototypical proverbs in that their application is limited to one domain.

==Folklore==
One of the most important developments in the study of proverbs (as in folklore scholarship more generally) was the shift to more ethnographic approaches in the 1960s. This approach attempted to explain proverb use in relation to the context of a speech event, rather than only in terms of the content and meaning of the proverb.&lt;ref&gt;E. Ojo Arewa and [[Alan Dundes]].  Proverbs and the Ethnography of Speaking Folklore. American Anthropologist. 66: 6, Part 2: The Ethnography of Communication (Dec 1964), pp. 70-85. Richard Bauman and Neil McCabe. Proverbs in an LSD Cult. The Journal of American Folklore. Vol. 83, No. 329 (Jul. - Sep., 1970), pp. 318-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive science==
Another important development in scholarship on proverbs has been applying methods from cognitive science to understand the uses and effects of proverbs and proverbial metaphors in social relations.&lt;ref name="Richard P. Honeck 1997"&gt;Richard P. Honeck. A proverb in mind: the cognitive science of proverbial wit and wisdom. Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The directive is more in particular aimed at the [[municipalities with language facilities]] bordering the [[Brussels Capital-Region]].

==Legal background==
According to a 1986 ruling of the [[Constitutional Court of Belgium|Constitutional Court]], the division in language regions entails "a restriction on the ability of legislators to regulate the use of languages and so forms the constitutional guarantee of the priority of the language of the unilingual area".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.briobrussel.be/assets/rechtspraak/gwhof1986_017n.pdf |title=Ruling no. 17 of 26 March 1986: In zake : het beroep tot vernietiging van het decreet van de Franse Gemeenschap van 26 juni 1984 "assurant la protection de l'usage de la langue française pour les mandataires publics d'expression française" (tot verzekering van de bescherming van het Franse taalgebruik voor de franstalige overheidsmandatarissen), ingesteld door de Vlaamse Executieve op 12 oktober 1984 |page=11 |date=1984-03-26 |publisher=Constitutional Court of Belgium |accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;br&gt;"''Artikel 3bis van de Grondwet behelst tevens een beperking van de bevoegdheid van de wetgevers inzake taalgebruik en vormt aldus de grondwettelijke waarborg van de voorrang van de taal van het eentalige gebied of van het tweetalige karakter van het gebied.''"&lt;/ref&gt; The 1988 revision of the constitution (art. 129, §1) confirms that the parliaments of the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] and the [[Flemish Community]] determine through [[Decree (Belgium)|decrees]], each for their respective territory, the use of languages in administrative matters, the education system, for social contacts between the employer and his employees, and for official documents in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://www.senate.be/doc/const_fr.html#art129 |title=Article 129 of the Belgian Constitution |date=2009-03-04 |publisher=[[Senate of Belgium]] |accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;br&gt;"''Art. 129 (modification de la terminologie): § 1er.

===Underlying ideas===
The Peeters directive's recommendations for [[municipalities with language facilities]] bordering the [[Brussels Capital-Region]] and the [[language border]], where to some extent the French-speaking population has the right to relate with the local and federal administration in [[French language|French]], have triggered political commotion. It stipulates these facilities, being "an exception to the rule of unilingualism of the official language areas", should be interpreted "strictly",&lt;ref&gt;"''De faciliteiten vormen de uitzondering op de eentaligheid van een taalgebied; bijgevolg moeten zij strikt geïnterpreteerd worden.''"&lt;/ref&gt; considering their "exceptional" and "temporary" character.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

{{cquote|The language facilities constitute the exception on the unilingualism of a language area; consequently, they thus have to be interpreted strictly. This implies that this interpretation has to be in conformity with the Constitution at all times. Therefore, the facilities cannot be interpreted that broadly that they would detract the priority of the language of the region and lead to a generalised bilingualism of administration in the municipalities with language facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://binnenland.vlaanderen.be/regelgeving/omzendbrieven/omz16.12.1997.htm |title=Omzendbrief BA 97/22 van 16 december 1997 betreffende het taalgebruik in gemeentebesturen van het Nederlandse taalgebied |author= |work=Regelgeving — Omzendbrieven |page= |year=1997 |publisher=[[Flemish government]] |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;br&gt;Section I.1.: "''De faciliteiten vormen de uitzondering op de eentaligheid van een taalgebied; bijgevolg moeten zij strikt geïnterpreteerd worden. Dit impliceert dat deze interpretatie in ieder geval conform de Grondwet moet zijn. De faciliteiten mogen dan ook niet dermate ruim geïnterpreteerd worden dat zij afbreuk doen aan de voorrang van de taal van het gebied en dat zij tot een veralgemeende tweetaligheid van het bestuur in de faciliteitengemeenten zouden leiden."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The directive argues language facilities have an "integrative function", meaning that, "per definition", "for the concerned individual", they have an "extinguishing character".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://binnenland.vlaanderen.be/regelgeving/omzendbrieven/omz16.12.1997.htm |title=Omzendbrief BA 97/22 van 16 december 1997 betreffende het taalgebruik in gemeentebesturen van het Nederlandse taalgebied |author= |work=Regelgeving — Omzendbrieven |page= |year=1997 |publisher=[[Flemish government]] |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;br&gt;Section I.3.: "''De faciliteiten zijn bedoeld als integratiebevorderende maatregel; dit houdt in dat zij per definitie, voor de individuele betrokkenen, een uitdovend karakter hebben. (...)''"&lt;/ref&gt; It reads further: "The interpretation of language facilities has to take into account the possibility that a French-speaking inhabitant, who previously made use of these facilities, meanwhile knows the language of the region well enough and consequently no longer wishes to invoke the facilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://binnenland.vlaanderen.be/regelgeving/omzendbrieven/omz16.12.1997.htm |title=Omzendbrief BA 97/22 van 16 december 1997 betreffende het taalgebruik in gemeentebesturen van het Nederlandse taalgebied |author= |work=Regelgeving — Omzendbrieven |page= |year=1997 |publisher=[[Flemish government]] |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;br&gt;Section I.3.: "'' (...) Bij de interpretatie van de faciliteiten moet rekening gehouden worden met de mogelijkheid dat een Franstalige inwoner, die voorheen een beroep heeft gedaan op deze faciliteiten, inmiddels de taal van het gebied voldoende kent en bijgevolg zich niet meer op de faciliteiten wenst te beroepen.''"&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, facilities are temporary in character, and because they are temporary, they have to be applied "restrictively", implying that French-speakers have to make a new request each and every time they wish to use French in official affairs.&lt;ref name="restrictief"&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://binnenland.vlaanderen.be/regelgeving/omzendbrieven/omz16.12.1997.htm |title=Omzendbrief BA 97/22 van 16 december 1997 betreffende het taalgebruik in gemeentebesturen van het Nederlandse taalgebied |author= |work=Regelgeving — Omzendbrieven |page= |year=1997 |publisher=[[Flemish government]] |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;br&gt; "''De faciliteiten die de S.W.T. verleent, moeten echter restrictief worden toegepast, hetgeen impliceert dat de particulier telkens uitdrukkelijk moet verzoeken om het Frans te gebruiken. Uiteindelijk werden de faciliteiten ingesteld om de integratie van Franstaligen in het Nederlandse taalgebied te bevorderen.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt; The directive claims the "spirit in which the language laws of 1962-63 were established" is reflected in the end report of the Harmel Centre:&lt;ref&gt;"Harmel Centre" is the nickname for the ''Centre de recherche pour la solution nationale des problèmes sociaux, politiques et juridiques des diverses régions du pays'' (in French) or ''Centrum van onderzoek voor de nationale oplossing van de maatschappelijke, Politieke en Rechtskundige vraagstukken van de verschillende gewesten van het land'' (in Dutch) — both meaning "Centre for research on a national solution for the social, political and juridical problems of the diverse regions of the country" —; it was an advisory body for the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]] and is widely considered to have a had a considerable impact on post-war Belgian politics.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the directive, this quote clearly shows that the language facilities were intended to ease the transition of the minority language inhabitants to the Community to which their municipality would belong from that moment onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://binnenland.vlaanderen.be/regelgeving/omzendbrieven/omz16.12.1997.htm |title=Omzendbrief BA 97/22 van 16 december 1997 betreffende het taalgebruik in gemeentebesturen van het Nederlandse taalgebied |author= |work=Regelgeving — Omzendbrieven |page= |year=1997 |publisher=[[Flemish government]] |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;br&gt;Section I.3.: "''Dit citaat geeft duidelijk de geest weer waarin de taalwetten van '62 en '63 tot stand zijn gekomen. De parlementaire debatten die gevoerd werden bij de totstandkoming van de wetten van 8 november 1962 en 2 augustus 1963 tonen aan dat de faciliteiten bedoeld waren om voor anderstaligen de overgang te vergemakkelijken naar de Gemeenschap waartoe de gemeente waarin ze woonden voortaan zou behoren.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tangible changes of the existing practice===
The most important rule introduced by the Peeters directive is that all official documents have to be sent to the citizens in Dutch. Afterwards, French-speakers can request a French translation for each separate document, on their own initiative. As for the application of documents in the town hall, all these documents have to be issued in Dutch in the municipalities along the language border, after which a translation can be requested. For the "rim municipalities" (those bordering Brussels), a French translation can be requested beforehand.&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt; Such a restrictive meaning went against the existing practice, whereby citizens had to declare their preferred language only once.&lt;ref name="ECMI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perception"/&gt;

Another issue is that the Peeters directive stipulates that the language of administration and local public services should at all times be Dutch, the only official language of the concerned municipalities. It is obligatory to speak Dutch in meetings of the municipal council and the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt;

==Legal challenge and controversy==

===On the internal language of administration===
On the initiative of the municipality of [[Linkebeek]], the Constitutional Court of Belgium was asked for an opinion on the constitutionality of article 23 of the law of 18 July 1966 that stipulates that the internal language of administration in the rim municipalities has to be Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juridat.be/cgi_loi/loi_N.pl?cn=1966071831 Juridat.be] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212031012/http://www.juridat.be/cgi_loi/loi_N.pl?cn=1966071831 |date=12 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its ruling 98/26 of 10 March 1998, the Court ruled this was not in violation with articles 10 and 11 of the [[Constitution of Belgium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.arbitrage.be/public/n/1998/1998-026n.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031217105401/http://www.arbitrage.be/public/n/1998/1998-026n.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-12-17 |title=Ruling 98/26 of 10 March 1998 |author=Court of Arbitration (present-day Constitutional Court of Belgium) |date=1998-03-10 |publisher=Constitutional Court of Belgium |accessdate=2009-01-22 }}&lt;br&gt;Section B.4.6.: "''Artikel 23 van de bij koninklijk besluit van 18 juli 1966 gecoördineerde wetten op het gebruik van de talen in bestuurszaken schendt niet de artikelen 10 en 11 van de Grondwet, in de interpretatie dat het de burgemeester of een ander lid van het college van burgemeester en schepenen van een in die bepaling beoogde gemeente verbiedt een agendapunt van de gemeenteraadszitting in te leiden of toe te lichten in een andere taal dan het Nederlands of in een dergelijke taal te antwoorden op interventies van gemeenteraadsleden.''"&lt;/ref&gt; and that the mayor and [[schepen|aldermen]] do indeed not have the right to speak in another language than Dutch during council meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.arbitrage.be/public/n/1998/1998-026n.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031217105401/http://www.arbitrage.be/public/n/1998/1998-026n.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-12-17 |title=Ruling 98/26 of 10 March 1998 |author=Court of Arbitration (present-day Constitutional Court of Belgium) |date=1998-03-10 |publisher=Constitutional Court of Belgium |accessdate=2009-01-22 }}&lt;br&gt;Section B.3.2.: "''In de interpretatie van het verwijzende rechtscollege volgt uit artikel 23 van de gecoördineerde wetten op het gebruik van de talen in bestuurszaken dat de burgemeester en de andere leden van het college van burgemeester en schepenen van een gemeente bedoeld in die bepaling uitsluitend het Nederlands dienen te gebruiken bij het inleiden of het toelichten van een agendapunt van de gemeenteraadszitting en bij het beantwoorden van interventies van gemeenteraadsleden.

Zulks impliceert dat de taal die er in bestuurszaken moet worden gebruikt in beginsel het Nederlands is en dat bepalingen die het gebruik van een andere taal toestaan niet tot gevolg mogen hebben dat afbreuk wordt gedaan aan de door artikel 4 van de Grondwet gewaarborgde voorrang van het Nederlands.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the annulment of the circular===
On 27 February 1998, the [[French Community of Belgium]] and the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]], together with a French-speaking inhabitant of one of the concerned rim municipalities, challenged the legitimacy of the directive before the [[Council of State (Belgium)|Council of State]]. On 27 March 2001, the court argued that two first plaintiffs did not have any powers within the territory of the [[Flemish Region]], and dismissed the appeal on those grounds. The case of the French-speaking inhabitant was forwarded to a Dutch-speaking chamber (since the other two plaintiffs were removed from the case, the competetent chamber changed) and debates were reopened.&lt;ref name="eerstearrest"&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.raadvst-consetat.be/Arresten/94000/300/94345nfn.pdf |title=Ruling 94.345 of 27 March 2001 |author=Council of State — Department of Administration |date=2001-03-27 |publisher=Council of State |accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;br&gt;More in particular sections 3.2.3.3, 3.2.3.5 and 3.2.4 (conclusion).&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February 1998, the municipality of [[Kraainem]] (in the periphery of Brussels, with a French-speaking majority) had initiated another case, also requesting annulment of the directive. On 28 May, [[Wemmel]] and [[Wezembeek-Oppem]] filed for intervention,&lt;ref&gt;A procedure whereby the beneficiaries of the contested acts and any person who establishes an interest in the case have the possibility to intervene in these cases.&lt;/ref&gt; joined by [[Drogenbos]] on 28 July 2008.&lt;ref name="tweedearrest"&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.raadvst-consetat.be/Arresten/138000/800/138860.pdf |title=Ruling 138.860 of 23 December 2004 |author=Council of State — Department of Administration |date=2004-12-23 |publisher=Council of State |accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipalities (and a number of French-speaking inhabitants) claimed that the directive introduced new rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.raadvst-consetat.be/Arresten/138000/800/138860.pdf |title=Ruling 138.860 of 23 December 2004 |author=Council of State — Department of Administration |date=2004-12-23 |publisher=Council of State |accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;br&gt;Section 4.1.1.: "''Het kan moeilijk ontkend worden dat het de bedoeling is van de Vlaamse Minister van Binnenlandse Aangelegenheden, Stedelijk Beleid en Huisvesting om onder meer in de betrekkingen met de particulieren nieuwe regels op te leggen aan de plaatselijke diensten uit de rand- en faciliteitengemeenten, daar waar de bestreden omzendbrief bepaalt dat elke plaatselijke dienst uit zulke gemeente in zijn betrekkingen met inwoners uit bedoelde gemeenten het Nederlands moet gebruiken en enkel wanneer een inwoner uit een rand- of taalgrensgemeente daar telkens uitdrukkelijk om verzoekt het Frans wordt gebruikt. Het gaat hier ontegensprekelijk om een dwingende regel, uitgevaardigd met de bedoeling dat hij daadwerkelijk wordt nageleefd, een regel die rechtstreekse werking heeft omdat hij als dusdanig toepasbaar is.''"&lt;/ref&gt; and thus conflicted with art. 129, §2 of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.raadvst-consetat.be/Arresten/138000/800/138860.pdf |title=Ruling 138.860 of 23 December 2004 |author=Council of State — Department of Administration |date=2004-12-23 |publisher=Council of State |accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;br&gt;Section 4.4.: "''Overwegende dat in verband met die interpretaties, de verzoekende en de tussenkomende partijen er blijkbaar wel van uitgaan, dat de door hen voorgestane interpretatie en de daarop steunende bestuurspraktijk op een dergelijke wijze zijn vastgelegd door artikel 129, § 2, eerste streepje, van de Grondwet, dat deze in het geheel zelfs niet meer mogen worden gewijzigd, tenzij met een wet die met de in artikel 4, laatste lid, van de Grondwet bepaalde meerderheid wordt aangenomen; (...)''"&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December 2004, the Council of State decided not to nullify the directive.&lt;ref name="zakboekje"/&gt; It argued that although the directive may have changed existing practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.raadvst-consetat.be/Arresten/138000/800/138860.pdf |title=Ruling 138.860 of 23 December 2004 |author=Council of State — Department of Administration |date=2004-12-23 |publisher=Council of State |accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;br&gt;Section 4.2.:"''(...) dat er echter te dezen blijkbaar reeds geruime tijd ook een andere interpretatie van de bestuurstaalwet voorhanden was en een daarop steunende praktijk;

Op geen enkele wijze toont de verzoekende partij immers aan waarom een interpretatie die afwijkt van de adviezen van de Commissie -adviezen die geen bindende kracht hebben en  geen jurisdictionele beslissingen zijn- de bestuurlijke beslissingen die op die afwijkende interpretatie steunen onwettig zou maken. De verzoekende partij noemt de Commissie immers ten onrechte "het enige administratieve orgaan dat bevoegd is om de wetgeving betreffende het taalgebruik in administratieve zaken te interpreteren" : zij dicht aldus de Commissie een bevoegdheid tot authentieke interpretatie van de wetten toe en gaat daarmee voorbij aan artikel 84 van de Grondwet, luidens welke bepaling alleen de wet een authentieke uitlegging van de wetten mag geven.

On 16 December 1997 the directive was sent to the governors of the five Flemish provinces by the then Flemish minister of Internal Affairs, [[Leo Peeters]].&lt;ref name="rand"&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.docu.vlaamserand.be/ned/webpage.asp?WebpageId=277&amp;MenuId=45 |title=Omzendbrief Peeters |year=2009 |work=De Vlaamse Rand — documentatiecentrum |publisher=[[Flemish government]] |accessdate=2009-09-21 }}&lt;br&gt;[http://www.briobrussel.be/assets/omzendbrief_peeters-en.pdf English translation also available]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was amended by the Martens directive of 5 May 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/mopdf/1998/05/27_1.pdf |title=Omzendbrief BA-98/03 van het Ministerie van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap van 5 mei 1998 betreffende de herschikking van de taken administratief toezicht t.a.v. de OCMW’s tussen de Administratie Gezin en Maatschappelijk Welzijn en de Administratie Binnenlandse Aangelegenheden ("omzendbrief-Martens") |pages=17139–17141 |date=1998-05-05 |work=[[Belgian Official Journal]] |publisher=[[Flemish government]] |accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; that prescribed a similar arrangement for the [[Public Centre for Social Welfare|social services]].&lt;ref name="zakboekje"/&gt; Both directives were reconfirmed and specified by the Keulen directive of 8 July 2005,&lt;ref name="keulen"&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/mopdf/2005/08/08_1.pdf |title=Omzendbrief BA-2005/03 van het Ministerie van de Vlaamse Gemeeschap van 8 juli 2005 betreffende het taalgebruik in de gemeente- en OCMW-besturen en in de intergemeentelijke samenwerkingsverbanden ("omzendbrief-Keulen") |pages=34485–34492 |date=2005-07-08 |work=[[Belgian Official Journal]] |publisher=[[Flemish government]] |accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was not well received by the French-speaking press and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/belgique/article/229369/la-circulaire-keulen-plus-fine-est-plutot-dure.html |title=La circulaire Keulen, plus fine, est plutôt dure |author=Christian Laporte |date=2005-07-08 |publisher=[[La Libre Belgique]] |accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-appointment of mayors==
The municipal councils of [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]], [[Linkebeek]], [[Wezembeek-Oppem]] and [[Kraainem]] sent out convocation letters for the [[Belgian provincial and municipal elections, 2006|2006 provincial and municipal elections]] in French to the citizens of which they assumed were French-speaking.&lt;ref name="keulenknack"&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/keulen-benoemt-burgemeesters-niet/site72-section24-article9751.html |title=Keulen benoemt burgemeesters niet |author= |date=2007-11-14 |publisher=[[Knack (magazine)|Knack]] |accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was contrary to the Peeters directive ordering municipalities to send out documents in Dutch first, after which a French translation can be requested&lt;ref name="PD"/&gt; and the Keulen directive, prohibiting the stocking of language preference.&lt;ref name="keulen"/&gt; In Flanders (contrary to Wallonia), mayors are not directly elected. Instead, after the elections, the [[town council]] nominates a candidate-mayor, who then has to be appointed by the Flemish Minister of the Interior. [[Marino Keulen]], then minister, delayed the appointment of the four proposed mayors because they did not apply language legislation.&lt;ref name="keulenknack"/&gt; Three of the four mayors repeated their actions for the [[Belgian general election, 2007|2007 federal elections]]. On 14 November 2007, the appointment of Arnold d'Oreye de Lantremange ([[Front Démocratique des Francophones|FDF]], for Kraainem), François van Hoobrouck d'Aspre ([[Union des Francophones|UF]], for Wezembeek-Oppem) and Damien Thiéry ([[Front Démocratique des Francophones|FDF]], for Linkebeek) was officially rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://www.lesoir.be/actualite/belgique/politique-la-non-nomination-2007-11-16-561352.shtml |title=Ils voulaient l'apaisement ?

===Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe===
Instead of challenging their non-appointment before the Council of State, the three mayors chose to bring it before the [[Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe]]. On 13 and 14 May 2008, the Congress sent a fact-finding mission to Belgium to look into the situation.&lt;ref name="tijd"&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.tijd.be/artikel/Delegatie_Raad_van_Europa_onderzoekt_niet-benoeming_burgemeesters.6824204 |title=Delegatie Raad van Europa onderzoekt niet-benoeming burgemeesters |date=2008-04-15 |publisher=De Tijd |accessdate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delegation was led by a Frenchman and consisted further of a Serbian representative, a German expert, and two other French members of the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/onderzoeksmissie-naar-rand/site72-section24-article15707.html |title=Onderzoeksmissie naar Rand |publisher=[[Knack (magazine)|Knack]] |date=2008-04-15 |accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe can make recommendations to its 47 member states, but it cannot impose sanctions on them for non-compliance&lt;ref name="euroactiv"/&gt; and its conclusions are not legally binding.

He also questioned why the regional authority had to appoint "democratically elected mayors".&lt;ref name="michel"/&gt; He also said that in towns with French-speaking majorities, participation of the inhabitants in local politics is complicated when the official language of administration is Dutch.&lt;ref name="michel"/&gt; The decisions of the delegation were considered ridiculous in Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=LP1S1ALB |title=Vlaanderen lacht met Rand-rapport |date=2008-05-15 |publisher=[[Het Nieuwsblad]] |accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Flemish Interior Minister, [[Marino Keulen]], said they were "absurd" because they did not take into account the language legislation, the grounds on which their nomination was refused.&lt;ref name="euroactiv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/culture/council-europe-open-belgium-monitoring-procedure/article-176915 |title=Council of Europe to open Belgium monitoring procedure |author= |date=2008-11-04 |publisher=EuroActiv |accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Parliament, Frieda Brepoels ([[Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie|N-VA]]) decounced "the arrogance and thoughtlessness" of the delegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=French |url=http://www.rtbf.be/info/belgique/politique/conseil-de-leurope-fin-de-mission |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115033715/http://www.rtbf.be/info/belgique/politique/conseil-de-leurope-fin-de-mission |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-15 |title=Conseil de l'Europe : fin de mission |date=2008-05-15 |publisher=[[RTBF]] |accessdate=2009-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Flemish government ignored the resolutions of the fact-finding mission, Keulen saying the [[acting mayor]]s should take their case to the Council of State rather than to the Council of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/989/Binnenland/article/detail/276106/2008/05/14/Europa-kritisch-voor-niet-benoeming-burgemeesters.dhtml |title=Europa kritisch voor niet-benoeming burgemeesters |date=2008-05-14 |publisher=[[De Morgen]] |accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2008, the Congress voting a resolution on the issue.

{{cquote|The Congress [...] recommends that the Belgian authorities [...] review the language laws and, in particular, the way in which they are applied in municipalities with so-called special language arrangements, to allow the use of both French and Dutch by municipal councillors and by the mayor and aldermen at the meetings of the municipal council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=RES276(2008)&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original&amp;Site=Congress&amp;BackColorInternet=e0cee1&amp;BackColorIntranet=e0cee1&amp;BackColorLogged=FFC679 |title=The Congress / resolution 276(2008) / 02 December 2008: Local democracy in Belgium: non-appointment by the Flemish authorities of three mayors |date=2008-12-02 |publisher=[[Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe]] |accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Minister Keulen "took notice" of the Congress's recommendations but stressed that only the Council of State was competent to undo his decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.marinokeulen.be/mod_news/keulen-neemt-akte-van-aanbevelingen-van-congres-lokale-besturen/ |title=Keulen neemt akte van aanbevelingen Raad van Europa |author=[[Marino Keulen]] |date=2008-12-02 |publisher=[[Marino Keulen]] |accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Belgian regional elections, 2009|2009 regional elections]], the three acting mayors sent out French documents again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/verkiezingen/burgemeesters-sturen-opnieuw-franstalige-oproepingsbrieven/site72-section71-article33670.html |title=Burgemeesters sturen opnieuw Franstalige oproepingsbrieven |author= |date=2009-05-20 |publisher=[[Knack (magazine)|Knack]] |accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sint-Genesius-Rode sent out convocation letters in Dutch to all citizens, accompanied by a French translation for those considered to be French-speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/verkiezingen/tweetalige-oproepingsbrieven-in-rode/site72-section71-article33807.html |title=Tweetalige oproepingsbrieven in Rode |author= |date=2009-05-25 |publisher=[[Knack (magazine)|Knack]] |accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major distinguishing symptom of acquired phonological dyslexia is that a selective impairment of the ability to read pronounceable non-words occurs although the ability to read familiar words is not affected.

==Deep and phonological dyslexia==

Individuals who suffer from phonological dyslexia have the opposite problem to surface dyslexics. These individuals are able to read using the [[Reading education in the United States#Whole Language|whole word method]]. However, they struggle when it comes to [[Reading education in the United States#Phonics|sounding words out]]. Phonological dyslexics are able to read familiar words, but have difficulties when it comes to unfamiliar words or non-words that are pronounceable.&lt;ref name="Beauvois, 1979"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beauvois MF, Dérouesné J |title=Phonological alexia: three dissociations |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=1115–24 |date=December 1979 |pmid=533850 |pmc=490427 |doi= 10.1136/jnnp.42.12.1115|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have found that many phonological dyslexics have a good reading ability if the individual has developed a large vocabulary prior to suffering from brain damage. These individuals seem to stop developing their vocabulary post-brain damage, which affects their reading capacity.&lt;ref name="Derouesne, 1979"/&gt;

Phonological dyslexia is a reading disorder in which the patient has impaired reading of nonwords. The symptoms of phonological dyslexia are very similar to those of [[deep dyslexia]]. The major difference between these two dyslexias is that phonological dyslexics do not make semantic errors associated with deep dyslexia. Beauvois and Dérouesné (1979) studied the first case of phonological dyslexia and came up with this term.&lt;ref name="Welbourne"&gt;{{Citation|title=Proceedings of the 28th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society|author1=Welbourne S.R.|author2=Lambon Ralph M.A.|contribution= Phonological and Surface Dyslexia in a Single PDP Model of Reading|year=2006|pages=2359&amp;ndash;64|place=Mahwah, New Jersey|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|url=http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/proceedings/2006/docs/p2359.pdf|isbn=9780976831822}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem people with phonological dyslexia have is that they are able to read words using the whole word method; however, they are not able to sound words out. This means that they are able to read familiar words, but have difficulties reading new words.

Initially it was believed that the factor causing phonological dyslexia was lexicality; however, other factors such as imageability and concreteness also play a critical role in reading. A study done by Crisp and Lambon Ralph concluded that imageability has a significant effect on phonological dyslexia. The study found that eleven out of the twelve patients had more accuracy when reading words with high imageability.&lt;ref name="Welbourne" /&gt; In that study, the patient who was the exception was the least severely damaged, contributing to a view of phonological dyslexia and deep dyslexia as points on a continuum rather than discrete disorders.&lt;ref name="Welbourne" /&gt;

==Physiology==
Several studies have found that different levels of [[brain damage]] can lead to the occurrence of varying forms of non-word reading disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, R.S., Hawndiges, A.N., Mitchum, C. C., &amp; Wayland, S.C. (1996). An investigation of nonlexical reading impairments. Cognitive Neuropsychology, 13, 763-801.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dérouesné, J |author2=Beauvois, M F. |chapter=The "phonemic" state in the non-lexical reading process: Evidence from a case of phonological alexia |editors=Coltheart, Max; Patterson, Karalyn; Marshall, John F. |title=Surface dyslexia: neuropsychological and cognitive studies of phonological reading |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=1985 |pages= 399–457 |isbn=0-86377-026-6 |oclc=789357383 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that during certain tasks, dyslexics had activated one of two regions of the brain: the [[Broca's area]], which is responsible for speech, or the [[Wernicke's area]], which is responsible for forming and understanding. Both areas were seldom active together. This study has led to the conclusion that there exist neural connection breakdowns between the language centers that may be causing dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lishman WA |title=Developmental dyslexia |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=74 |issue=12 |pages=1603–5 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14638872 |pmc=1757419 |doi= 10.1136/jnnp.74.12.1603|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hyphenation==
An investigation conducted by Harley, T. A., and O'Mara, D.A. (2006) found that [[Syllabification|hyphenation]] significantly improved a participant`s reading ability. The subject suffered from phonological dyslexia that was due to a deficiency in graphemic parsing. The study suggested that hyphenation might be generally useful as a strategy to assist phonological dyslexics.&lt;ref name="Harley, O'Mara, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harley |first1=Trevor A. |last2=O'Mara|first2=David A.|title=Hyphenation can improve reading in acquired phonological dyslexia |journal=Aphasiology |volume=20|issue=8 |year=2006 |pages=744–761 |issn=0268-7038|doi=10.1080/02687030600591658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case study==
A study was done by Beauvois and Dérouesné on a 64-year-old man. The individual is described as right-handed, a retiree, and having formerly been an agricultural machinery representative. The individual had had surgery for a left parieto-occipital [[angioma]]. Scans showed a lesion at the left angular gyrus, the posterior part of the second temporal convolution, the [[inferior longitudinal fasciculus]], the geniculostriate fibres and [[tapetum of corpus callosum|tapetum]]. The patient was also found to be suffering from neurological defects such as right inferior quadrantanopia, mild memory deficit, mild calculation impairment, minimal constructional apraxia, and [[astereognosia]]. It was found that the patient did not suffer from motor or sensory defects. He had been obliged to retire as the phonological dyslexia disrupted his ability to work. He had previously enjoyed reading, but was now unable to read his own or other pieces of writing. The diagnosis was confirmed with the Alouette reading test, which concluded that the patient suffered from a reading disability. He was found to have the reading ability of a 6-year-old child, which is considered to be the lowest reading level. The level of reading was not determined from the speed, rather from the fact that the patient was not able to read more than 62 of the stimuli presented in three minutes, while 40% of the represented stimuli were either read incorrectly or left unread. The reading errors included [[adjectives]], [[possessive adjectives]], [[conjunctions]] and [[verbs]].&lt;ref name="Beauvois, 1979"/&gt;

==The dual route cascaded model==
Patients with phonological dyslexia have problem reading non-words and unfamiliar words. According to the dual route model, patients with phonological dyslexia use route 2 or 3 that have intact orthographic input lexicon which allow them to pronounce familiar words whether regular or irregular. However due to phonological dyslexia they are unable to use grapheme-phoneme conversion (Route 1), as route 1 is impaired, thus patients find it difficult to pronounce unfamiliar words and non-words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11961">The '''Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, Inc''' (RID) is a [[non-profit organization]], founded in 1964 and incorporated in 1972, that seeks to uphold standards, ethics, and professionalism for [[American Sign Language]] [[Language interpretation|interpreters]]. RID is the only organization in the United States that credentials both d/Deaf and Hearing interpreters to provide services in a wide range of settings, as well as test and certify interpreters for legal work. The RID Board is committed to the "4 R's" which are: Roots, Respect, Relevance and Results. As of 2014 there were over 15,000 members and 58 affiliate chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RID - 2014 Annual Report |url=http://www.rid.org/2014-annual-report/#mem-svcs|publisher=Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since August 2004, RID has been building stronger ties with the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] (NAD), including a joint Code of Professional Ethics and the merging of their respective certification programs. They jointly developed the National Interpreter Certification test (NIC), which was adopted in 2005.

RID is headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, with a roughly $3,000,000 annual budget and around 20 employees. The association's operations are led by an executive director (currently vacant) and governed by an eleven-member board of directors. 

== Governance and Operations ==
RID is governed by an eleven-member board of directors elected directly by the voting membership for a two-year term. Voting rights are determined by being a member in good standing of both RID (in the certified or associate category) and a sanctioned affiliate chapter. The board is made up of the following positions: 
* President
* Vice President
* Secretary
* Treasurer
* Member-at-Large
* Deaf Member-at-Large
* Region I Representative
* Region II Representative
* Region III Representative
* Region IV Representative
* Region V Representative
Following the expiration of the president's term, they serve an ex officio non-voting term on the board of directors as Immediate Past President. 

The Executive Board consists of the President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Member-at-Large, and Deaf Member-at-Large, and is elected on odd years for two-year terms. The regional representative positions are elected on even years for two-year terms. 

To run for election to the Executive Board, members must collect 25 nomination signatures from voting members with at least one from each region of RID. Regional representative candidates must collect 25 nomination signatures from within their region. All positions except the Member-at Large require the candidate to be certified member of RID for four consecutive years prior to candidacy. Member-at-Large requires either associate or certified membership in RID for four consecutive years prior to candidacy. Additionally, regional representative candidates must have resided in their region at least two years prior to candidacy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3DKvZMflFLda1BVN2EyX25FdTA/view|title=RID Bylaws|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If there are more than one candidates, an election is held via on-line balloting. p

The 2007–2018 board of directors are as follows:

RID operations are conducted by a paid staff led by an Executive Director. Since 2014, RID has not had a permanent Executive Director following the departure of Shane Feldman. The board contracted with Anna Witter-Merithew who served as Interim Executive Director until August 2017. Since that time, the board has served as Executive Director through President Melvin Walker while continuing a permanent Executive Director search.

== Code of Professional Conduct ==

As part of their push to improve the ethical behavior of practitioners in the field, RID revised and updated existing guidelines from the Code of Ethics.&lt;ref name=Code&gt;{{cite web|title=NAD-RID Code of Professional Conduct|url=http://www.rid.org/UserFiles/File/NAD_RID_ETHICS.pdf|publisher=Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf|accessdate=4 June 2013|year=2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930211448/http://www.rid.org/UserFiles/File/NAD_RID_ETHICS.pdf|archivedate=30 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Code of Professional Conduct was adopted as the newest set of principles interpreters should adhere to. Certified interpreters have an especially strong duty to follow the principles laid out by RID, for the integrity of the work, the well being of the stakeholders, and to avoid causing harm.

The tenets from the current Code of Professional Conduct are:

# Interpreters adhere to standards of confidential communication.
# Interpreters possess the professional skills and knowledge required for the specific interpreting situation.
# Interpreters conduct themselves in a manner appropriate to the specific interpreting situation.
# Interpreters demonstrate respect for consumers.
# Interpreters demonstrate respect for colleagues, interns, and students of the profession.
# Interpreters maintain ethical business practices.
# Interpreters engage in professional development.

== RID certifications ==

RID has a national certification system with three key components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About RID Overview|url=http://rid.org/aboutRID/overview/index.cfm|publisher=Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf|accessdate=4 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601064321/http://rid.org/aboutRID/overview/index.cfm|archivedate=1 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* The National Testing System (NTS)
* The Certification Maintenance Program (CMP) - assures the continual skill development of certified interpreters.
* The Ethical Practices System (EPS) - gives consumers the ability to express concerns or make complaints about the quality of interpreting/transliterating services.

In previous incarnations of the NTS, the following certifications were given to interpreters meeting the testing criteria (All credentials awarded by the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf will remain valid as long as the holder of said certification(s) maintains their membership and maintenance program.):

Previously offered certificates:

* CSC - Comprehensive Skills Certificate (1972–1988)
* MCSC - Master Comprehensive Skills Certificate (1972–1988)
* RSC - Reverse Skills Certificate - awarded only to Deaf / hard-of-hearing interpreters/transliterators (1972–1988)
* OIC:C - Oral Interpreting Certificate, Comprehensive (1979–1985)
* OIC: S/V - Oral Interpreting Certificate, Spoken to Visible (1979–1985)
* OIC: V/S - Oral Interpreting Certificate, Visible to Spoken (1979–1985)
* IC - Interpretation Certificate (1972–1988)
* TC - Transliteration Certificate (1972–1988)
* IC/TC - Interpretation and Transliteration Certificates (1972–1988)
* SC: L - Specialist Certificate: Legal (first certificate version of this certification was offered 1975–1978)
* SC: PA - Specialist Certificate: Performing Arts (1971–1988)
* OIC: C - Oral Interpreting Certificate (1979–1983)
* CI - Certificate of Interpretation (1988–2005)
* CT - Certificate of Transliteration (1988–2005)
* NIC Advanced and NIC Master (These levels were offered from 2005 to 2011) 

Currently offered certificates:

* CDI - Certified Deaf Interpreter (On moratorium since August, 2015)
* OTC - Oral Transliteration Certificate (On moratorium since August, 2015)
* SC: L - Specialist Certificate: Legal (On moratorium since August, 2015)
* NIC- National Interpreter Certification 

RID granted certified membership to holders of the defunct NAD certification at levels III, IV and V as well as those who pass the Educational Interpreter Performance Assessment (EIPA) at proficiency level 4.0 with a passing score on the EIPA written exam. The certifications for these members are listed as:
* NAD III
* NAD IV
* NAD V
* ED:K12
No new certified member status is being granted for any of these categories. 

As of July 2005, a new certification test, developed with the NAD, was implemented and the CI and CT tests began to be phased out. The new generalist certification for hearing interpreters is the NAD-RID National Interpreter Certification (NIC). In 2015 NAD decided to withdraw its involvement from the NIC resulting its name being removed from the test. 

== CASLI ==
RID formed a [[limited liability company]] called the Center for Assessment of Sign Language Interpretation (CASLI) in 2015 to carry out all testing functions. CASLI is a wholly owned subsidiary, supported operationally by RID headquarters staff and governed by a Managing Board that reports to the RID Board of Directors. As of 2017, the Board of Managers consisted of: 
{| class="wikitable"

|-

|Keith Cagle
|-

|-

|Lyle Vold
|}
In 2017, CASLI's operations began direct supervision by Star Grieser, CDI who reports to the RID Deputy Director. 

CASLI's formation began a clearer philosophical and practical split of certification from professional testing. Under this new scheme, CASLI is granted greater autonomy to design, prepare and conduct generalist testing for both Deaf and hearing interpreters. RID retains the function of certifying interpreters based on their testing results and other certification criteria. As such, the EPS and CMP systems remain under RID's direct control.

'''Sakshi''' or Sākṣī ([[Sanskrit]]: साक्षी) means – 'observer', 'eyewitness' or the 'Supreme Being' the one that lends its shine - " Chitchhaya"- to the "ego" part of the subtle body - which consists of the everchanging Mind, the decision making Intellect, the Memory &amp; the Illusory Ego ! &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit – English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.6.apte.742017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hindu philosophy]], the word, ''Sākṣī'' or 'witness' refers to the 'Pure Awareness' that witnesses the world but does not get affected or involved. ''Sakshi'' is beyond time, space and the triad of experiencer, experiencing and experienced; ''sakshi'' witnesses all thoughts, words and deeds without interfering with them or being affected by them, other than ''sakshi'' there is nothing else in the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|pages=69–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02ANh3NTm6sC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=sakshi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vyUxU_r_H8WFrAf8gYGYAQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the word, साक्षी (''sākṣī''), used in the following verse from [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]],

:एको देवः सर्वभूतेषु गूढः सर्वव्यापी सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा |
:कर्माध्यक्षः सर्वभूताधिवासः साक्षी चेता केवलो निर्गुणश्च ||

:"The same Deity remains hidden in all beings, and is all-pervasive and the indwelling Self of all beings. He is the supervisor of actions, lives in all beings, (He is) the Witness, the bestower of intelligence, the Absolute and devoid of the (three) gunas." ([[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] Sl. VI.11)
[[Pāṇini|Panini]] states that the same indicates a direct seer or eyewitness (Panini Sutras V.ii.91),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Śvetāśvatatra Upanisad 1986 Ed.|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=190–191|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/svetasvatara-upanishad-gambhirananda/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakshi means [[Ishvara]], the चेता (cetā), the sole Self-consciousness, who is the witness of all, who gives consciousness to every human being, thereby making each rational and discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kriya Yoga|author=Paramahamsa Hariharananda|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G11HR9B4io8C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=sakshi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vyUxU_r_H8WFrAf8gYGYAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vedanta]] speaks of mind (''chitta'') or ''antahkarana'' ('internal instrument'), and matter as the subtle and gross forms of one and the same reality; being the subtle aspect of matter, mind is not a tangible reality. The field of mind (''Chittakasha'') involves the duality of the seer and the seen, the observer (''drg'') and the observed (''drshya''), which duality is overcome in the field of pure Consciousness. ''[[Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka|Drg-drshya-Viveka]]'' tells us:-

:"When form is the object of observation or drshyam, then the eye is the observer or drk; when the eye is the object of observation, then the mind is the observer; when the pulsations of the mind are the objects of observation, then Sakshi or the Witnessing-Self is the real observer; and it is always the observer, and, being self-luminous, can never be the object of observation. When the notion and the attachment that one is the physical body is dissolved, and the Supreme Self is realized, wherever one goes, there one experiences [[Samadhi]]. "

''Sakshi'', the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the unchangeable eternal Reality, is the Pure Consciousness and knowledge, in which regard [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains that knowledge does not destroy or create, it only illumines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Being in Depth|author=Swami Ranganathananda|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=86–87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJGFP__WXX0C&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=sakshi+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oyExU7uCHs-GrAemvoCQBg&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the senses (''indriyas'') are not the mind, the mind uses them as an implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Pschology: Its Meaning for the West|author=Swami Akhilananda|publisher=Routledge|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSVvzCC4mVYC&amp;pg=PT54&amp;dq=sakshi+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=viIxU4rkNYLOrQfwzIAI&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Varaha Upanishad (IV) refers to the ''Bhumika'' ('stage of development of wisdom') which is of the form of ''pranava'' (''Aum'' or ''[[Om]]'') as formed of or divided into – ''akāra'', ''ukāra'', ''makāra'' and ''ardhmātra'', which is on account of the difference of ''sthula'' ('gross'), ''sukshama'' ('subtle'), ''bija'' ('seed' or 'causal') and ''sakshi'' ('witness') whose ''avasthas'' ('states') are – 'waking', 'dreaming', 'dream-less sleep' and 'turiya'. ''Sakshi'' which is '[[turiya]]' is the essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thirty Minor Upanishads|author=IslamKotob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CvXZ0j1UyAAC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=sakshi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JCUxU9rTCsWKrQflmICgAg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The faculty which perceives the individual personality is ''Sakshi'' or 'Witness' or the higher 'Ego'. Mind (''manas''), Ego (''ahankara'') and ''Sakshi'', all perform different functions but that difference of functions does not mean difference in nature or essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rambles in Vedanta|author=B.R.Rajam Iyer|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=280, 289|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89doofWiWJIC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=sakshi+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3iAxU9W8FIiFrAfQz4HQDQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Philosophy discovered the concept of ''Sakshi'', the ultimate Observer, or Witness behind the sense of individuality, or the ego; the ''Sakshi'' is the timeless Being which witnesses all this ceaseless flow and change in the world of thought and things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manoniyantran|author=T.N.Achuta Rao|publisher=Gyan Books|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okUjWme6MF8C&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=sakshi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BB0xU-DbOI6FrgeLuYD4Dw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sakshi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{essay|date=March 2012}}

A person’s '''second language''' or '''L2''' is a language that is not the [[native language]]/[[first language]]/L1 of the speaker, but is learned by the speaker after his/her native language (usually a [[foreign language]], see below). Additionally, a person’s second language can be explained as the second language in the country the speaker lives in and they may be both used in daily life. For example, [[Languages of Canada|Canada]] has two official languages (English and French) and some citizens speak and use both of them.&lt;br&gt;
A person’s dominant language, which is the language the speaker uses most or is most comfortable with, is not necessarily to be his/her first language. The second language can also be the dominant one. For example, the Canadian census defines first language for its purposes as "the first language learned in childhood and still spoken", recognizing that for some, the earliest language may be lost, a process known as [[language attrition]]. This can happen when young children move, with or without their family (because of [[immigration]] or [[international adoption]]), to a new language environment.&lt;br&gt;

==Second-language acquisition==
{{main|Second-language acquisition}}
{{Further|Theories of second-language acquisition}}
[[File:Spanish orthography.jpg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|[[Blackboard]] used in [[Class (education)|class]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] shows [[student]]s' efforts at placing the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] and [[acute accent]] [[diacritic]]s used in the [[Spanish orthography]].]]
The distinction between '''acquiring''' and '''learning''' was made by [[Stephen Krashen]] (1982) as part of his [[Monitor Theory]]. According to Krashen, the ''acquisition'' of a language is a '''natural''' process; whereas ''learning'' a language is a '''conscious''' one. In the former, the student needs to partake in natural communicative situations. In the latter, error correction is present, as is the study of grammatical rules isolated from natural language. Not all educators in second language agree to this distinction; however, the study of how a second language is ''learned/acquired'' is referred to as ''second-language acquisition'' (SLA).

Research in SLA "...focuses on the developing knowledge and use of a language by children and adults who already know at least one other language... [and] a knowledge of second-language acquisition may help educational policy makers set more realistic goals for programmes for both foreign language courses and the learning of the majority language by minority language children and adults." (Spada &amp; Lightbown, p.&amp;nbsp;115).

SLA has been influenced by both linguistic and [[psychology|psychological]] theories. One of the dominant linguistic theories hypothesizes that a ''device'' or ''module'' of sorts in the brain contains innate knowledge. Many psychological theories, on the other hand, hypothesize that [[Cognition#Cognition as social process|cognitive mechanisms]], responsible for much of human learning, process language.

Other dominant theories and points of research include 2nd language acquisition studies (which examine if L1 findings can be transferred to L2 learning), verbal behaviour (the view that constructed linguistic stimuli can create a desired speech response), morpheme studies, behaviourism, error analysis, stages and order of acquisition, structuralism (approach that looks at how the basic units of language relate to each other according to their common characteristics), 1st language acquisition studies, contrastive analysis (approach where languages were examined in terms of differences and similarities) and inter-language (which describes L2 learners’ language as a rule-governed, dynamic system) (Mitchell, Myles, 2004).  
  
These theories have all influenced second-language teaching and pedagogy. There are many different methods of second-language teaching, many of which stem directly from a particular theory. Common methods are the [[grammar-translation method]], the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]], the [[audio-lingual method]] (clearly influenced by audio-lingual research and the behaviourist approach), the [[Silent Way]], [[Suggestopedia]], [[community language learning]], the [[Total Physical Response method]], and the [[communicative approach]] (highly influenced by Krashen’s theories) (Doggett, 1994). Some of these approaches are more popular than others, and are viewed to be more effective. Most language teachers do not use one singular style, but will use a mix in their teaching. This provides a more balanced approach to teaching and helps students of a variety of learning styles succeed.

===Effect of age===
The defining difference between a first language (L1) and a second language (L2) is the age the person learned the language. For example, [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Eric Lenneberg]] used ''second language'' to mean [[language acquisition|a language consciously acquired]] or used by its speaker after puberty. In most cases, people never achieve the same level of fluency and comprehension in their second languages as in their first language. These views are closely associated with the [[critical period hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Mary|title=Arts of the Contact Zone|journal=Profession|year=1991|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beerten|first=Roeland |author2=Billiet, Jaak |author3=Bart Maddens|title=National Identity and Attitude Toward Foreigners in a Multinational State: A Replication|journal=International Society of Political Psychology|year=2003|volume=24|series=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Brian|title=Defining Culture in a Multicultural Environment: An Ethnography of Heritage High School|journal=American Journal of Education|date=Aug 1995|volume=103|series=4|pages=339–376|doi=10.1086/444107|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scarcella|first=Robin |author2=Krashen, Stephen D. |author3=Michael A. Long |title=Age, Rate and Eventual Attainment in Second Language Acquisition|journal=TESOL Quarterly|date=Dec 1979|volume=13|issue=4|pages=573–582|doi=10.2307/3586451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In acquiring an L2, Hyltenstam (1992) found that around the age of six or seven seemed to be a cut-off point for [[Multilingualism|bilinguals]] to achieve native-like proficiency. After that age, L2 learners could get ''near-native-like-ness'' but their language would, while consisting of few actual errors, have enough errors to set them apart from the L1 group. The inability of some subjects to achieve native-like proficiency must be seen in relation to the ''age of onset'' (AO). Later, Hyltenstam &amp; Abrahamsson (2003) modified their age cut-offs to argue that after childhood, in general, it becomes more and more difficult to acquire native-like-ness, but that there is no cut-off point in particular.&lt;br&gt;

As we are learning more and more about the brain, there is a hypothesis that when a child is going through puberty, that is the time that accents ''start''. Before a child goes through puberty, the chemical processes in the brain are more geared towards language and social communication. Whereas after puberty, the ability for learning a language without an accent has been rerouted to function in another area of the brain—most likely in the frontal lobe area promoting cognitive functions, or in the neural system of hormone allocated for reproduction and sexual organ growth.

As far as the relationship between age and eventual attainment in SLA is concerned, Krashen, Long, and Scarcella, say that people who encounter foreign language in early age, begin natural exposure to second languages and obtain better proficiency than those who learn the second language as an adult. However, when it comes to the relationship between age and rate [[Second-language acquisition|SLA]], “Adults proceed through early stages of syntactic and morphological development faster than children (where time and exposure are held constant)” ([[Stephen Krashen|Krashen]], Long, Scarcella 573). Also, “older children acquire faster than younger children do (again, in early stages of morphological and syntactic development where time and exposure are held constant)” (573). In other words, adults and older children are fast learners when it comes to the initial stage of foreign language education.

Gauthier and Genesee (2011) have done a research which mainly focuses on the second language acquisition of internationally adopted children and results show that early experiences of one language of children can affect their ability to acquire a second language, and usually children learn their second language slower and weaker even during the critical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gauthier |first1=Karine |last2=Genesee |first2=Fred |title=Language Development in Internationally Adopted Children: A Special Case of Early Second Language Learning |journal=Child Development |date=March 2011 |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=887-901 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01578.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As for the fluency, it is better to do foreign language education at an early age, but being exposed to a foreign language since an early age causes a “weak identification” (Billiet, Maddens and Beerten 241). Such issue leads to a "double sense of national belonging," that makes one not sure of where he or she belongs to because according to Brian A. Jacob, multicultural education affects students' "relations, attitudes, and behaviors" (Jacob 364). And as children learn more and more foreign languages, children start to adapt, and get absorbed into the foreign culture that they “undertake to describe themselves in ways that engage with representations others have made” (Pratt 35). Due to such factors, learning foreign languages at an early age may incur one’s perspective of his or her native country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Mary|title=Arts of the Contact Zone|journal=Profession|year=1991|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Similarities and differences between learned and native proficiency===
====Speed====
Acquiring a second language can be a lifelong learning process for many. Despite persistent efforts, most learners of a second language will never become fully ''native-like'' in it, although with practice considerable fluency can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lang1234.info/2/category/accent/1.html|title=Good Accents|publisher=globe1234.com |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children by around the age of 5 have more or less mastered their first language with the exception of [[vocabulary]] and a few [[Grammar|grammatical]] structures, and the process is relatively very fast because language is a very complex skill. Moreover, if children start to learn a second language when they are 7 years old or younger, they will also be fully fluent with their second language in a faster speed comparing to the speed of learning by adults who start to learn a second language later in their life. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Newport |first2=Elissa |title=Critical period effects in second language learning: The influence of maturational state on the acquisition of English as a second language |journal=Cognitive Psychology |date=January 1989 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=60-99 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028589900030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

====Correction====
In the first language, children do not respond to systematic correction. Furthermore, children who have limited input still acquire the first language, which is a significant difference between input and output. Children are exposed to a language environment of errors and lack of correction but they end up having the capacity to figure out the grammatical rules. Error correction does not seem to have a direct influence on learning a second language. Instruction may affect the rate of learning, but the stages remain the same. Adolescents and adults who know the rule are faster than those who do not. &lt;br&gt;

In the learning of a second language the correction of errors remains a controversial topic with many differing schools of thought. Throughout the last century much advancement has been made in research on the correction of students’ errors. In the 1950s and 60s the viewpoint of the day was that all errors must be corrected at all costs. Little thought went to students’ feelings or self-esteem in regards to this constant correction (Russell, 2009).

In the 1970s Dulay and Burt’s studies showed that learners acquire grammar forms and structures in a pre-determined, inalterable order, and that teaching or correcting styles would not change this (Russell, 2009).

In this same decade Terrell (1977) did studies that showed that there were more factors to be considered in the classroom than the cognitive processing of the students (Russell, 2009). He contested that the affective side of students and their self-esteem were equally important to the teaching process (Russell, 2009).

A few years later in the 1980s, the strict grammar and corrective approach of the 1950s became obsolete. Researchers asserted that correction was often unnecessary and that instead of furthering students’ learning it was hindering them (Russell, 2009). The main concern at this time was relieving student stress and creating a warm environment for them. Stephen Krashen was a big proponent in this hands-off approach to error correction (Russell, 2009).

The 1990s brought back the familiar idea that explicit grammar instruction and error correction was indeed useful for the SLA process. At this time, more research started to be undertaken to determine exactly which kinds of corrections are the most useful for students. In 1998, Lyster concluded that “recasts” (when the teacher repeats a student’s incorrect utterance with the correct version) are not always the most useful because students do not notice the correction (Russell, 2009). His studies in 2002 showed that students learn better when teachers help students recognize and correct their own errors (Russell, 2009). Mackey, Gas and McDonough had similar findings in 2000 and attributed the success of this method to the student’s active participation in the corrective processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=Victoria|title=Corrective feedback, over a decade of research since Lyster and Ranta (1997): Where do we stand today?|journal=Electronic Journal of Foreign Language Teaching|date=2009|volume=6|issue=1|pages=21–31|url=https://varussellblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/russell_eflt_2009.pdf|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Depth of knowledge====
According to [[Noam Chomsky]], children will bridge the gap between input and output by their innate grammar because the input (utterances they hear) is so poor but all children end up having complete knowledge of grammar. Chomsky calls it the [[Poverty of the stimulus|Poverty of Stimulus]]. And second language learners can do this by applying the rules they learn to the sentence-construction, for example. So learners in both their native and second language have knowledge that goes beyond what they have received, so that people can make correct utterances (phrases, sentences, questions, etc) that they have never learned or heard before.&lt;br&gt;

====Emotionality====
[[Bilingualism]] has been an advantage to today's world and being bilingual gives the opportunity to understand and communicate with people with different cultural backgrounds. However, a study done by Optiz and Degner in 2012 shows that sequential bilinguals (i.e. learn their L2 after L1) often relate themselves to the emotions more when they perceive these emotions by their first language/native language/L1, but feel less emotional when by their second language even though they know the meaning of words clearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Opitz |first1=Bertram |last2=Degner |first2=Juliane |title=Emotionality in a second language: It's a matter of time |journal=Neuropsychologia |date=July 2012 |volume=50 |issue=8 |pages=1961-1967 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393212001844}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional distinction between L1 and L2 indicates that the "effective valence" of words is processed less immediate in L2 because of the delayed vocabulary/lexical access to these two languages.&lt;br&gt;

====Success====
Success in language learning can be measured in two ways: likelihood and quality. First language learners ''will'' be successful in both measurements. It is inevitable that all people will learn a first language and with few exceptions, they will be fully successful. For second language learners, success is not guaranteed. For one, learners may become fossilized or ''stuck'' as it were with ungrammatical items. ([[Fossilization (linguistics)|Fossilization]] occurs when language errors become a permanent feature. See Canale &amp; Swain (1980), Johnson (1992), Selinker (1972), and Selinker and Lamendella (1978).) The difference between learners may be significant. As noted elsewhere, L2 learners rarely achieve complete ''native-like'' control of the second language. &lt;br&gt;
For L2 pronounciation, there are two principles that haven been put forth by Levis (2005). The first is nativeness which means the speakers' ability to approximately reach the speaking pattern of the second language of speakers; and the second, understanding, refers to the speaker's ability to make themselves understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levis |first1=John |title=Changing Contexts and Shifting Paradigms in Pronunciation Teaching |journal=TESOL Quarterly |date=Autumn 2005 |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=369-377 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/3588485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being successful in learning a second language can seem like a daunting task. Research has been done to look into why some students are more successful than others. Stern (1975), Rubin (1975) and Reiss (1985) are just a few of the researchers who have dedicated time to this subject. They have worked to determine what qualities make a "good language learner" (Mollica, Neussel, 1997). Some of their common findings are that a good language learner uses positive learning strategies, is an active learner who is constantly searching for meaning. Also a good language learner demonstrates a willingness to practice and use the language in real communication. He also monitors himself and his learning, has a strong drive to communicate, and has a good ear and good listening skills (Mollica, Neussel, 1997).&lt;br&gt;

Özgür and Griffiths have designed an experiment in 2013 about the relationship between different motivations and second language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Özgür |first1=Burcu |last2=Griffiths |first2=Carol |title=Second Language Motivation |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |date=25 January 2013 |volume=70 |pages=1109-1114 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042813001663}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have looked at four types of motivations—intrinsic (inner feelings of learner), extrinsic (reward from outside), integrative (attitude towards learning), and instrumental (practical needs). According to the test results, the intrinsic part has been the main  motivation for these student who learn English as their second language. However, students report themselves being strongly instrumentally motivated. In conclusion, learning a second language and being successful depend on every individual.&lt;br&gt;

==Foreign language==
[[File:Ldl-wortschatz.jpg|thumb|A German student learning French. [[English language|English]] (1.5 billion learners), [[French language|French]] (82 million learners) and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (30 million learners) are the three most commonly studied foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Noack and Lazaro Gamio, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/04/23/the-worlds-languages-in-7-maps-and-charts "The world’s languages, in 7 maps and charts"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 23 April 2015 (page visited on 9 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Spanish class.jpg|thumb|[[High school]] [[Spanish language|Spanish]] taught as a second [[language]] to a class of native [[English speakers]] at an [[United States|American]] [[private school]] in [[Massachusetts]].]]

In [[pedagogy]] and [[sociolinguistics]], a distinction is made between second language and foreign language, the latter is being learned for use in an area where that language is originally from another country and not spoken in the native country of the speakers. And in other words, foreign language is used from the perspective of countries; the second language is used from the perspective of individuals.

For example, arguably, [[English language|English]] in countries such as [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[the Philippines]], the [[Nordic countries]] and the [[Netherlands]] can be considered a second language for many of its speakers, because they learn it young and use it regularly; indeed in [[southern Asia]] it is the [[official language]] of the courts, government and business. The same can be said for [[French language|French]] in [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]], although French is nominally not an official language in any of these [[Arabic-speaking countries]]. In practice, French is widely used in a variety of contexts in these countries, and public signs are normally printed in both Arabic and French. A similar phenomenon exists in [[post-Soviet states]] such as the [[Ukraine]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]], where [[Russian language|Russian]] can be considered a second language, and there are large [[Russophone]] communities there.

However, in [[China]] (with the exception perhaps of Hong Kong), English must be considered a foreign language due to the lack of opportunities for use, such as historical links, media, conversation between people, and similar vocabulary. Likewise, French would be considered a foreign language in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]]. This is despite Romanian and French being [[Romance languages]] (unlike Chinese and English, which come from two different [[language families]]: [[Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]). This is also despite Romania and Moldova being the only two countries in the world where Romanian is an official language at the national level, Romania's historical links to France, and both Romanian-speaking countries' membership in the [[Francophonie]].
== Benefits of Bilingualism ==
Psychological studies have found that speaking two or more languages is good for people's cognitive process and the differences between brains of bilinguals and single language speakers usually provides some mental benefits, according to an article on [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Merritt |first1=Anne |title=Why learn a foreign language? Benefits of bilingualism |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10126883/Why-learn-a-foreign-language-Benefits-of-bilingualism.html |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=19 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including but not limited to these: &lt;br&gt;
'''Becoming smarter'''&lt;br&gt;
Speaking a second language improves the functions of the brain by thinking and using the different language systems.&lt;br&gt;
'''Building multitasking skills'''&lt;br&gt;
According to a study from the Pennsylvania State University, "juggling language can make better brains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Juggling languages can build better brains |url=https://news.psu.edu/story/160653/2011/02/18/juggling-languages-can-build-better-brains |website=PennState |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because multilingual people are usually good at switching between different language systems, they can be good multitaskers as well. &lt;br&gt;
'''Improving memory'''&lt;br&gt;
The vocabulary capacity for a high school graduate student is about 45000 words, according to Nagy and Anderson (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nagy |first1=William |last2=Anderson |first2=Richard |title=How Many Words are There in Printed School English? |journal=Reading Research Quarterly |date=Spring 1984 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=304-330 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/747823.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and being a bilingual will double this number because learning a language involves memorizing rules and vocabulary.&lt;br&gt;

==== Weber's Report ====
George H. J. Weber, a Swiss businessman and independent scholar, founder of the Andaman Association and creator of the encyclopedic andaman.org Web site, made a report in December 1997 about the number of secondary speakers of the world's leading languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.ignatius.edu/turner/languages.htm The World's Most Widely Spoken Languages] (reference for entire table)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm The World's 10 most influential Languages] (reference for entire table)&lt;/ref&gt; Weber used the [[Fischer Weltalmanach]] of 1986 as his only source&lt;ref&gt;Fig 6.

A '''true name''' is a [[name]] of a thing or being that expresses, or is somehow identical to, its true [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]].  The notion that [[language]], or some specific [[sacred language]], refers to things by their true names has been central to philosophical study as well as various traditions of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], religious [[invocation]] and mysticism ([[mantra]]s) since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/glossary/g/Magical_Name.htm Magical Name] (paganwiccan.about.com)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wicca-spirituality.com/wiccan-name.html Finding Your Wiccan Name] (wicca-spirituality.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical and religious contexts==
The true name of the Egyptian sun god [[Ra]] was revealed to [[Isis]] through an elaborate trick. This gave Isis complete power over Ra and allowed her to put her son Horus on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Geraldine (1981). ''Gods &amp; Pharaohs from Egyptian Mythology.'' London, England: Eurobook Limited. pp. 24–25. {{ISBN|0-87226-907-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Socrates]] in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' considers, without taking a position, the possibility whether names are "conventional" or "natural" ("true name" [τῇ ἀληθείᾳ ὄνομα]), that is, whether language is a system of arbitrary signs or whether words have an intrinsic relation to the things they signify &lt;ref&gt;pp. 4 &amp; 18, [[David Sedley]], [http://assets.cambridge.org/052158/4922/sample/0521584922ws.pdf ''Plato's Cratylus''], Cambridge University Press 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; (this [[Conventionalism|anti-conventionalist]] position is called [[Cratylism]]).

[[Hellenistic Judaism]] emphasized the divine nature of ''[[logos]]'', later adopted by the [[Gospel of John]].  The true [[name of God]] plays a central role in [[Kabbalism]] (see [[Gematria]], [[Temurah (Kabbalah)|Temurah]], [[YHWH]] [the [[tetragrammaton]]]) and to some extent in [[Sufism]] (see [[100th name of God]]).
The ancient [[Jews]] considered God's true name so potent that its invocation conferred upon the speaker tremendous power over His creations.  To prevent abuse of this power, as well as to avoid blasphemy, the name of God was always [[taboo]], and increasingly disused so that by the time of [[Jesus]] their [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] was supposedly the only individual who spoke it aloud&amp;nbsp;— and then only in the [[Holy of Holies]] upon the [[Day of Atonement]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stuart Gordon, ''The Encyclopedia of Myths and Legends'', pp. 480-1, Headline Book Publishing, London, 1993 {{ISBN|0-7472-3936-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in a Biblical context, in the tale of [[Jacob]]'s nocturnal [[Jacob wrestling with the angel|wrestling with an anonymous angel]], the angel refuses to reveal his own name to Jacob even after the angel's submission at dawn.  Thereafter Jacob obtains a new name which signifies his successful struggle to God and man, and names the place to commemorate his surviving an encounter with the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 32:22-31&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary pre-industrial peoples guard secret names which are only used in solemn rituals.  These names are never mentioned and kept from general knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, James, "Tabooed Words" in ''The Golden Bough'', first volume abridged edition, (New York: Mentor, 1959), pages 235-246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folklore and Literature==
In Jewish tradition, when several children have died in a family the next that is born has no name given to it, but is referred to as "[[Alter (name)|Alter]]" ({{lang-yi|אלטער}}, literally "old"), or ''Alterke'', the view being that the [[Angel of Death]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}, not knowing the name of the child, will not be able to seize it. When such a child attains the marriageable age, a new name, generally that of one of the Patriarchs, is given to it. 

When captured by [[Polyphemus]], [[Homer]]'s [[Odysseus]] is careful not to reveal his name; when asked for it, Odysseus tells the giant that he is "[[Outis|Οὖτις]]", which means "nobody"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3Dou%29%2Ftis οὔτις] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3D*ou%29%3Dtis Οὖτις], Georg Autenrieth, ''A Homeric Dictionary'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;. But later, having escaped after blinding Polyphemus and thinking himself beyond Polyphemus' power, Odysseus boastfully reveals his real name, an act of [[hubris]] that was to cause enormous problems later. Knowing his name, Polyphemus was able to call upon Odysseus the revenge of his father, the god [[Poseidon]]. Many later episodes of the [[Odyssey]] depict Odysseus facing the relentless hostility of Poseidon - which he could have avoided had he persisted in keeping his real name secret.   
 
According to practises in [[folklore]], referred to as 'the Law of Names'; knowledge of a true name allows one to affect another person or being [[Magic (paranormal)|magically]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p 134, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is stated that knowing someone's, or something's, true name therefore gives the person (who knows the true name) power over them. This effect is used in many tales,&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 260 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as in the German fairytale of ''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]'': within Rumpelstiltskin and all its variants, the girl can free herself from the power of a supernatural helper who demands her child by learning its name.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, p 128, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A legend of [[Saint Olaf]] recounts how a [[troll]] built a church for the saint at a fantastic speed and price, but the saint was able to free himself by learning the troll's name during a walk in the woods.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''[[Child Ballads|The English and Scottish Popular Ballads]]'', v 1, p 95, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the belief that children who were not baptised at birth were in particular danger of having the [[fairy|fairies]] kidnap them and leave [[changeling]]s in their place may stem from their unnamed state.&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Briggs, ''The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature'', p 115 University of Chicago Press, London, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; In the Scandinavian variants of the ballad ''[[Earl Brand]]'', the hero can defeat all his enemies until the heroine, running away with him, pleads with him by name to spare her youngest brother.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 91, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scandinavian beliefs, more magical beasts, such as the [[Neck (water spirit)|Nix]], could be defeated by calling their name.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 95-6, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason significant objects in Germanic mythology, which were considered to have some kind of intrinsic personality, had their own names too, for example the legendary Sword [[Balmung]].

Medieval beliefs about [[witchcraft]] indicated that the [[Devil]] baptized witches with a new, secret name.

In the folklore of Northern England, there was the belief that a [[boggart]] should never be named, for when the boggart was given a name, it would not be reasoned with nor persuaded, but would become uncontrollable and destructive.

[[Giacomo Puccini]] used a similar theme in the opera [[Turandot]]. The plot turns on whether or not Princess Turandot could learn the name of her unwanted suitor. If she does, she could execute him; if she doesn't, she would have to marry him.

==In cryptography==
The term "true name" is sometimes used in [[cryptography]] and [[computer security]] to refer to a name that is assumed to uniquely identify a principal in a global namespace (for example, an [[X.500]] or [[X.509]] [[Distinguished Name|Distinguished name]]). This usage is often critical, with the implication that use of true names is difficult to enforce and unwise to rely on.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} &lt;!-- possible ref: Cryptography and the Politics of One's True Name, Leonard N. Foner (in True Names: And the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier) -- but I haven't actually read it --&gt;

==In popular culture==
In [[fantasy]] where magic works by evoking true names, characters often go to great lengths to conceal their true names. In some settings, such as [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[Earthsea (book series)|Earthsea]]'', this is true for all beings. In others, as in [[Larry Niven]]'s ''[[The Magic Goes Away]]'', it applies only to those of magical inclination, as where a wizard is revived from the dead only by another who found his name, and even then only with great difficulty. Finding a true name may require arcane procedures. In ''Earthsea'', a wizard must listen for and give the hero his true name; this is performed in both Le Guin's ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'' and ''[[The Tombs of Atuan]]''.

*In Arthur C. Clarke's ''[[The Nine Billion Names of God]]'', when all of God's names are discovered by Tibetan monks, the universe ends.
*In [[Glen Cook|Glen Cook's]] ''[[The Black Company|Black Company]]'' series, speaking a sorcerer's true name aloud can snuff out their magical power. All the magic users in the series are referred to by pseudonyms, and many of them went to great lengths to kill anyone who knew their original names.
*In [[Christopher Paolini|Christopher Paolini's]] ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]'', magicians can control someone by learning their true name, and use the true name of inanimate objects in spells. 
*[[Patricia Wrede]], in her novel ''[[Snow-White and Rose-Red]]'', has a character not succumb to a spell because the caster did not know the name he was baptized by.
*[[Patricia McKillip]], in her novel ''[[The Forgotten Beasts of Eld]]'', wizards, including the main character Sybel, can call people and creatures using their true name.
*In ''[[Operation Chaos (novel)|Operation Chaos]]'', [[Poul Anderson]] has the doctor who delivers a baby issue not only a regular birth certificate, but a secret one, with the newborn's name; the hero, born before such precautions were routine, is glad to hide his daughter's true name. 
*In the ''[[Bartimaeus Trilogy]]'' by [[Jonathan Stroud]], a magician cannot have full control over a demon if the demon knows the magician's true name. As a result, all magicians have records of their true names destroyed during childhood and take a new name around adolescence.  
*In [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]'', all people and gods also have true names which give great but not total power over them. ''[[The Lightning Thief]]'', a previous novel of Riordan's, also emphasizes on the importance of using names, particularly the names of gods.
*In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[Bilbo Baggins]] uses a great deal of trickery to keep the dragon,  [[Smaug]], from learning his name; even the sheltered hobbit realizes that revealing his name would be very foolish.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 261 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Likewise, in Ursula K. Le Guin's ''Earthsea'' canon, and specifically in her seminal short story "[[The Rule of Names]]", knowledge of a dragon's or human's true name confers power over them.&lt;ref&gt;Spivack, Charlotte, ''Ursula K. Le Guin'', (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1984), page 27.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*True names and [[The Speech (fiction)|speech]] are the basis for magic in [[Diane Duane]]'s ''[[Young Wizards]]'' series. 
*The dragons of ''[[Deltora Quest (series)|Deltora Quest]]'' believe that knowledge of their true name gives others power over them, and will thus only reveal it to trusted confidants or in dire need.
*The concept is also prominently present in  ''[[The Kingkiller Chronicle]]'' by Patrick Rothfuss.&lt;ref&gt;Rothfuss, Patrick:The Name of the Wind, 27 March 2007, DAW Books Hardcover {{ISBN|978-0-7564-0407-9}}, pages=662}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Lloyd Alexander]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Prydain]]'' utilizes the concept as well.
*Multiple variants of magic utilizing or grounded in the power of true names have appeared in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]], though never as a bedrock element of the game. For instance, certain spells are more powerful if the target's true name is known.&lt;ref name="d20SRD"&gt;The spell 
*In the Cold Cereal Trilogy true names were used to control a person. Nimue (the Lady of the Lake) used it to freeze people.

''[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/trapTheSoul.htm Trap the Soul]'' is one such example, where knowledge of a true name allows the capture of even those immune to magic.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the role-playing setting [[World of Darkness|One World of Darkness]], the concept of True Names is very expansive. The True Name of a being is like a platonic blueprint to the creature. A human's True Name can even change after life-altering events. It is a description of the being, from its internal organs to its very soul. All living creatures have one, but those with more intelligence have more complex True Names. A [[Fallen angel|Fallen]] has a True Name given directly by God, but they are unpronouncable by mortal tongues because they are not words or names in the traditional sense; rather, they are a collection of abstract sounds and concepts, such as the sound of a hundred children laughing at once or the wind whistling over the entrance of a cavern. A Fallen's Celestial Name will suffice to fill out the power a True Name has over other beings. Magic is also easier to cast and stronger against a target whose True Name is known.
*In [[Jim Butcher]]'s ''[[The Dresden Files]]'' a wizard or other magical being can gain power over anyone by knowing their name, if the invoker has heard it spoken by its owner; however, as humans' names change with their nature, their magical power generally decays after a time.
*In the ''Doctor Who'' episode "[[The Shakespeare Code]]", the Carrionites are a species of witch-like beings who use words as a form of magic power. Particularly potent is someone's name, but it will only work once. The Doctor repels the Carrionites at one point using their name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Language of Doctor Who|date=May 2014|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|isbn=978-1-4422-3481-9|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ImuYAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;ots=3JybWyieMo&amp;dq=doctor%20who%20carrionites%20and%20the%20power%20of%20names&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q=doctor%20who%20carrionites%20and%20the%20power%20of%20names&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the Doctor's true name must never be said or "silence will fall".
*In the [[manga]] series ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', a [[shinigami]] (death god) must learn the true name of his or her sword, known as a [[zanpakutou]].
*In the television series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', recurring antagonist [[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin]] (portrayed by [[Robert Carlyle]]) stresses on the importance of using someone or something's proper name.
*In the book series The Symphony of Ages by Elizabeth Haydon, the main character Rhapsody is a bard who discovers the gift of True Naming, giving her the ability to do many wondrous things such as changing a person's nature, freeing them of magical slavery or granting them new supernatural abilities to even camouflaging a group of adventurers in plantlife to avoid detection by assassins and bandits.
*In the book series Skulduggery Pleasant by Derek Landy, every person has a name that they choose which is used to protect their other names: a name that is given to them at birth which can be used to control a person to a limited extent and a true name which can be used to control that person to an unlimited degree.
*In Superman comics, the 5th-dimensional imp Mr. Mxyzptlk can be banished from our dimension if he is tricked into reciting his own name backwards (Kltpzyxm).      
*The [[SCP Foundation]] object "Taboo" is described as a location containing objects and beings capable of appearing when their names are said and stealing the names of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scp-wiki.net/taboo|title=[REDACTED PER PROTOCOL 4000-ESHU] - SCP Foundation|last=|first=PeppersGhost|date=|website=www.scp-wiki.net|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A character remembering their true name may be an important means of maintaining mastery of their own life. In [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s movie ''[[Spirited Away]]'', the witch who runs the bathhouse, Yubaba, ensures loyalty by stealing the names of her subjects. For example, one of the witch's most loyal subjects, the spirit of the Kohaku River, has his name taken and is given a slave name: Haku. He forgets his name, and it is in this way 'taken' from him; he warns [[Chihiro Ogino]] against the dangers of forgetting her own name. She frees him when she recognises him and he then remembers and 'takes back' his name and is freed from the clutches of the witch.

In the [[cyberpunk]] genre following [[Vernor Vinge]]'s 1981 ''[[True Names]]'' and the work of [[William Gibson]], much of the plot involved interactions between people's virtual selves in [[cyberspace]].  Learning a fellow hacker's real-world name (i.e., their "true name") could allow you to turn them in to the government or otherwise blackmail them, conveying a kind of power that could be considered analogous to the equivalent concept of myth and legend.

'''''Truth in Translation''''' is a stage play conceived and directed by [[Michael Lessac]], with music by [[Hugh Masekela]]. It tells the story of the [[interpreter]]s at [[South Africa]]'s [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]]. 

The play was written in a collaboration between the interpreters who worked at the TRC, writer Paavo Tom Tammi and the company of South African actors. It premiered in [[Rwanda]], has toured [[South Africa]] and is touring to international conflict zones such as [[Northern Ireland]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[the Balkans]], [[Jerusalem]]/[[Ramallah]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Peru]], and [[Indonesia]]/[[Timor]] to tell the story of the South African experience. The project includes workshops with audiences, exhibitions ([[The Forgiveness Project]] and Jillian Edelstein's ''Truth and Lies'') and filming of the interaction between audiences and the company, and attempts to provoke a global dialogue around notions of healing and reconciliation.

[[File:KellsFol309r.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|The [[Book of Kells]], c. AD 800, is lettered in a script known as "insular majuscule", a variety of uncial script that originated in Ireland.]]
'''Uncial''' is a [[majuscule]]&lt;ref name=gl&gt;[[Geoffrey Glaister|Glaister, Geoffrey Ashall]]. (1996) ''Encyclopedia of the Book''. 2nd edn. New Castle, DE, and London: Oak Knoll Press &amp; [[The British Library]], p. 494. {{ISBN|1884718140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[script (styles of handwriting)|script]] (written entirely in capital letters) commonly used from the 4th to 8th centuries AD by [[Latin]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Greek]] [[scribe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of The English Language''. Ed. [[David Crystal]]. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1995. p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Uncial letters were used to write [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], and [[Gothic language|Gothic]].

==Development==
[[File:Evolution of minuscule.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|Simplified relationship between various scripts, showing the development of Uncial from Roman and the Greek Uncial.]]
Early uncial script is likely to have developed from late [[Old Roman cursive]]. Early forms are characterized by broad single stroke [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]s using simple round forms taking advantage of the new [[parchment]] and [[vellum parchment|vellum]] surfaces, as opposed to the angular, multiple stroke letters, which are more suited for rougher surfaces, such as [[papyrus]]. In the oldest examples of uncial, such as the fragment of ''[[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 30|De bellis macedonicis]]''  in the [[British Library]], of the late 1st-early 2nd century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Papyrus_745 British Library Mss]&lt;/ref&gt; all of the letters are disconnected from one another, and word separation is typically not used. Word separation, however, is characteristic of later uncial usage.

As the script evolved over the centuries, the characters became more complex. Specifically, around AD 600, flourishes and exaggerations of the basic strokes began to appear in more manuscripts. [[Ascender (typography)|Ascenders]] and [[descender]]s were the first major alterations, followed by twists of the tool in the basic stroke and overlapping. By the time the more compact [[Lower case|minuscule]] scripts arose circa AD 800, some of the evolved uncial styles formed the basis for these simplified, smaller scripts. Uncial was still used, particularly for copies of the [[Bible]], tapering off until around the 10th century. There are over 500 surviving copies of uncial script, by far the largest number prior to the [[Carolingian Renaissance]].

==Forms==
[[File:Codex bezae latin.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|A sample of the Latin text from the [[Codex Bezae]]]]

In general, there are some common features of uncial script:

* {{angle bracket|f}}, {{angle bracket|i}}, {{angle bracket|p}}, {{angle bracket|s}}, {{angle bracket|t}} are relatively narrow.
* {{angle bracket|m}}, {{angle bracket|n}} and {{angle bracket|u}} are relatively broad; {{angle bracket|m}} is formed with curved strokes (although a straight first stroke may indicate an early script), and {{angle bracket|n}} is written as {{angle bracket|ɴ}} to distinguish it from {{angle bracket|r}} and {{angle bracket|s}}.
* {{angle bracket|e}} is formed with a curved stroke, and its arm (or ''hasta'') does not connect with the top curve; the height of the arm can also indicate the age of the script (written in a high position, the script is probably early, while an arm written closer to the middle of the curve may indicate a later script).
* {{angle bracket|l}} has a small base, not extending to the right to connect with the next letter.
* {{angle bracket|r}} has a long, curved shoulder {{angle bracket|{{MUFI|&amp;#xA783;}}}}&lt;!--?--&gt;, often connecting with the next letter.
* {{angle bracket|s}} resembles (and is the ancestor of) the "[[long s]]" {{angle bracket|ſ}}; in uncial it {{angle bracket|{{MUFI|&amp;#xA785;}}}} looks more like {{angle bracket|r}} than {{angle bracket|f}}.

In later uncial scripts, the letters are sometimes drawn haphazardly; for example, {{angle bracket|ll}} runs together at the baseline, bows (for example in {{angle bracket|b}}, {{angle bracket|p}}, {{angle bracket|r}}) do not entirely curve in to touch their stems, and the script is generally not written as cleanly as previously.

==National styles==
Due to its extremely widespread use, in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[North Africa in the Roman era|Africa]]n, [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italian]], [[France in the Middle Ages|French]], [[Spain in the Middle Ages|Spanish]], and "insular" ([[Early Christian Ireland|Irish]], [[Wales in the Early Middle Ages|British]] and [[England in the Early Middle Ages|English]]) centres, there were many slightly different styles in use:

*African (i.e. [[North Africa during the Classical Period|Roman North Africa]]n) uncial is more angular than other forms of uncial. In particular, the bow of the letter {{angbr|a}} is particularly sharp and pointed.
*Byzantine uncial has two unique features: "b-d uncial" uses forms of {{angbr|b}} and {{angbr|d}}, which are closer to half-uncial (see below), and was in use in the 4th and 5th centuries; "b-r" uncial, in use in the 5th and 6th centuries, has a form of {{angbr|b}} that is twice as large as the other letters, and an {{angbr|r}} with a bow resting on the baseline and the stem extending below the baseline.
*Italian uncial has round letters ({{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|e}}, {{angbr|o}} etc.) with flatter tops, and a with a sharp bow (as in African uncial), an almost horizontal rather than vertical stem in {{angbr|d}}, and forked finials (i.e., [[serif]]s in some letters such as {{angbr|f}}, {{angbr|l}}, {{angbr|t}} and {{angbr|s}}).
*Insular uncial (not to be confused with the separate [[insular script]]) generally has definite word separation, and accent marks over stressed syllables, probably because Irish scribes did not speak a language descended from Latin. They also use specifically Insular [[scribal abbreviation]]s not found in other uncial forms, use wedge-shaped [[finial]]s, connect a slightly subscript "pendant {{angbr|i}}" with {{angbr|m}} or {{angbr|h}} (when at the end of a word), and decorate the script with animals and dots ("Insular dotting", often in groups of three).
*French (that is, [[Merovingian]]) uncial uses thin descenders (in {{angbr|g}}, {{angbr|p}} etc.), an {{angbr|x}} with lines that cross higher than the middle, and a {{angbr|d}} with a curled stem (somewhat resembling an apple), and there are many decorations of fish, trees, and birds.
*{{Anchor|ustav|semi-ustav|poluustav}}[[Cyrillic]] manuscript developed from Greek uncial in the late ninth century (mostly replacing the [[Glagolitic alphabet]]), and was originally used to write the [[Old Church Slavonic]] liturgical language. The earlier form was called ''ustav'' (predominant in the 11–14th centuries), and later developed into ''semi-ustav'' script (or ''[[poluustav]]'', 15–16th centuries).

==Etymology==
[[File:Schriftzug Unziale.svg|thumb|upright=1.36|Calligraphic writing of the word "Unziale" in a modern uncial hand]]There is some doubt about the original meaning of the word. ''Uncial'' itself probably comes from [[St. Jerome]]'s preface to the [[Book of Job]], where it is found in the form ''uncialibus'', but it is possible that this is a misreading of ''inicialibus'' (though this makes little sense in the context), and Jerome may have been referring to the larger initial letters found at the beginning of paragraphs.
:''Habeant qui volunt veteres libros, vel in membranis purpureis auro argentoque descriptos, vel '''uncialibus''' ut vulgo aiunt litteris onera magis exarata quam codices.''
:"Let those who so desire have old books, or books written in gold and silver on [[purple parchment]], or burdens {rather than books} written in uncial letters, as they are popularly called."

In classical Latin ''uncialis'' could mean both "inch-high" and "weighing an ounce", and it is possible that Jerome was punning on this; he may conceivably also have been playing with the other meaning of ''codex'', "block of wood".

The term ''uncial'' in the sense of describing this script was first used by [[Jean Mabillon]] in the early 18th century. Thereafter his definition was refined by [[Scipione Maffei]], who used to refer to this script as distinct from [[Roman square capitals]].

==Other uses==
[[File:Codex sinaticus.jpg|thumb|A portion of the [[Codex Sinaiticus]], in Byzantine uncial, containing [[Book of Esther|Esther]] 2:3–8.]]
The word, ''uncial'', is also sometimes used to refer to manuscripts that have been scribed in uncial, especially when differentiating from those penned with minuscule. Some of the most noteworthy Greek uncials are:
* [[Codex Sinaiticus]]
* [[Codex Vaticanus]]
* [[Codex Alexandrinus]]
*: — these being three of what are often called the four [[great uncial codices]]
* [[Codex Bezae]]
* [[Codex Petropolitanus Purpureus]]

The Petropolitanus is considered by some to contain optimum uncial style. It is also an example of how large the characters were getting.

For further details on these manuscripts, see Guglielmo Cavallo ''Ricerche sulla Maiuscola Biblica'' (Florence, 1967).

Modern [[calligraphy]] usually teaches a form of evolved Latin-based uncial hand that would probably be best compared to the later 7th to 10th century examples, though admittedly, the variations in Latin uncial are much wider and less rigid than Greek. Modern uncial has borrowed heavily from some of the conventions found in more [[cursive]] scripts, using flourishes, variable width strokes, and on occasion, even center axis tilt.

In a way comparable to the continued widespread use of the [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s for written [[German language|German]] until well into the 20th century, [[Gaelic type|Gaelic]] letterforms, which are similar to uncial letterforms, were conventionally used for typography in [[Irish language|Irish]] until the 1950s. The script is still widely used in this way for titles of documents, inscriptions on monuments and other 'official' uses. Strictly speaking, the Gaelic script is [[Insular script|insular]], not uncial. Uncial Greek (commonly called "Byzantine lettering" by Greeks themselves) is commonly used by the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and various institutions and individuals in [[Greece]] to this day. The Modern Greek State has also used uncial script on several occasions in official capacity (such as on seals, government documents etc.) as did many of the Greek provisional governments during the [[Revolution|Greek War of Independence]]. The height of uncial usage by the Modern Greek State was during the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74]], when even [[Greek Drachma]] coins had uncial lettering on them. Since the [[Metapolitefsi]], the Greek State has stopped using uncial script.

==Half-uncial==
The term ''half-uncial'' or ''semi-uncial'' was first deployed by Scipione Maffei, ''Istoria diplomatica'' (Mantua, 1727); he used it to distinguish what seemed like a cut-down version of uncial in the famous ''Codex Basilicanus'' of Hilary, which contains sections in each of the two types of script. The terminology was continued in the mid-18th century by [[René Prosper Tassin]] and [[Charles François Toustain]]. Despite the common and well-fixed usage, half-uncial is a poor name to the extent that it suggests some organic debt to regular uncial, though both types share features inherited from their ancient source.  See now:  L. E. Boyle, "'Basilicanus' of Hilary Revisited," in ''Integral Palaeography'', with an introduction by F. Troncarelli (Turnhout, 2001), 105-17.

Like uncial, half-uncial derived from Roman cursive, but now of a later, evolved type. It was first used around the 3rd century and remained in use until the end of the 8th century. The early forms of half-uncial were used for pagan authors and Roman legal writing, while in the 6th century the script came to be used in Africa and Europe (but not as often in insular centres) to transcribe Christian texts.

===Half-uncial forms===
Some general forms of half-uncial letters are:
* {{angbr|a}} is usually round {{angbr|ɑ}}, sometimes with a slightly open top
* {{angbr|b}} and {{angbr|d}} have vertical stems, identical to the modern letters
* {{angbr|g}} has a flat top, no bow, and a curved descender {{angbr|ᵹ}} (somewhat resembling the digit 5)
* {{angbr|t}} has a curved shaft {{angbr|ꞇ}}
* {{angbr|n}}, {{angbr|r}} and {{angbr|s}} are similar to their uncial counterparts (with the same differences compared to modern letters)

Half-uncial was brought to Ireland in the 5th century, and was then carried to England. There, it was used up to the 8th century, and developed into the [[insular script]] after the 8th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1287">The '''Union Nationale des Experts Traducteurs Interprètes près les Cours d'Appel''' is a member organization of the [[International Federation of Translators]].

Experts-traducteurs are professional [[translator]]s chosen by a jury on application to the Cour d'Appel ([[Appellate Court]]) of their home region in France. They have to show the jury, on request, that they have been working for a minimum of three years and that the result of their work corresponds exactly to the original text. They are then listed on a document tended by the regional Cour d'Appel as a regional expert translator/interpreter. They are regularly checked by police officers on their personal acquaintances and life style to ensure loyalty, lawfulness and impartiality. Translators listed at the Cour d'Appel can, after another three years, file a new application at the jury of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Cour de Cassation]] in Paris to be listed as a national expert translator.

[[Image:Duveneck Whistling Boy.jpg|thumb|''The Whistling Boy'', [[Frank Duveneck]] (1872)]]
'''Whistling''' without the use of an artificial [[whistle]] is achieved by creating a small opening with one's lips and then blowing or sucking air through the hole. The air is moderated by the lips, curled tongue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Whistle With Your Fingers|url=http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/04/08/how-to-whistle-with-your-fingers/|publisher=[[The Art of Manliness]]|date=April 8, 2012|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, teeth or fingers (placed over the mouth) to create [[turbulence]], and the curled tongue acts as a [[resonance|resonant]] chamber to enhance the resulting sound by acting as a type of [[Helmholtz resonance|Helmholtz resonator]].

==Techniques==
{{listen | help = no | pos = right| filename = Human_whistling.ogg | title = Whistling | description = A human whistling. | format = [[Ogg]]}}
Pucker whistling is the most common form in much Western music. Typically, the tongue tip is lowered, often placed behind the lower teeth, and pitch altered by varying the position of the tongue. Although varying the degree of pucker will change the pitch of a pucker whistle, expert pucker whistlers will generally only make small variations to the degree of pucker, due to its tendency to affect purity of tone. Pucker whistling can be done by either only blowing out or blowing in and out alternately. In the 'only blow out' method, a consistent tone is achieved, but a negligible pause has to be taken to breathe in. In the alternating method there is no problem of breathlessness or interruption as breath is taken when one whistles breathing in, but a disadvantage is that many times, the consistency of tone is not maintained, and it fluctuates.

Many expert musical palatal whistlers will substantially alter the position of the tongue to ensure a good quality tone. Venetian gondoliers are famous for moving the tongue while they whistle in a way that can look like singing. A good example of a palatal whistler is [[Luke Janssen]], winner of the 2009 world whistling competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?King_of_the_whistles_challenges_Boyle_for_top_talent&amp;in_article_id=638189&amp;in_page_id=34 |title=King of whistles challenges Boyle for top talent |author=Jessica Satherly |date=April 28, 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Metro (British newspaper)]] |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LeMondeSiffler.jpg|thumb|Various finger techniques (''[[Le Monde illustré]]''  14 January 1893)]]
Finger whistling is harder to control but achieves a piercing volume. In Boito's opera ''[[Mefistofele]]'' the title character uses it to express his defiance of the Almighty.

Whistling can also be produced by blowing air through enclosed, [[Hand flute|cupped hands]] or through an external [[Wind instrument|instrument]], such as a whistle or even a blade of grass or leaf.

== Competitions==
One of the most well known whistling competitions is the International Whistlers Convention (IWC). Since 1973, this annual event takes place in Louisburg, North Carolina. The awards go to whistlers ranging from international male and female, teenage male and female, and even grandchildren. It has been customary for the Governor of the State of North Carolina to sign a declaration declaring the week of the IWC as "Happy Whistlers Week," for citizens and visitors to honor the art of whistling and to participate in the scheduled events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IWC Main Website|url=http://www.whistlingiwc.com/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Guinness World Records]], the highest [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] human whistle ever recorded was measured at 4,186&amp;nbsp;Hz, which corresponds to a C8 [[musical note]]. This was done by Michael Stuart in Richmond, Virginia, on January 11, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guinness World Records, Highest note whistled|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-note-whistled}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lowest pitch whistle ever recorded was measured at 174.6&amp;nbsp;Hz, which corresponds to a F3 musical note.  This was accomplished by Jennifer Davies of Dachau, Germany on November 6, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guinness World Records, Lowest note whistled|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/lowest-note-whistled}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most people whistling simultaneously was 853, which was organized at the [[Spring Harvest]] event at Minehead, UK on April 11, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guinness World Records, Most people whistling|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-people-whistling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As communication==
On [[La Gomera]], one of Spain's [[Canary Islands]], a traditional [[whistled language]] named ''[[Silbo Gomero language|Silbo Gomero]]'' is still used. At least nine separate whistling sounds are used to produce usually four vowels and five consonants, allowing this language to convey unlimited words. This language allowed people (e.g. shepherds) to communicate over long distances in the island, when other communication means were not available. It is now taught in school so that it is not lost among the younger generation. Another group of whistlers were the Mazateco Indians of Oaxaca, Mexico. Their whistling aided in conveying messages over far distances, but was also used in close quarters as a unique form of communication with a variety of tones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Whistled_languages.html?id=l1RiAAAAMAAJ Busnel &amp; Classe 1976]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whistling can be used to control trained animals such as dogs. A [[Shepherd's whistle]] is often used instead.

Whistling has long been used as a specialized communication between laborers. For example, whistling in theatre, particularly on-stage, is used by flymen (i.e. members of a [[fly crew]]) to cue the lowering or raising of a [[Batten (theater)|batten]] pipe or [[Flats (theatre)|flat]]. This method of communication became popular before the invention of electronic means of communication, and is still in use, primarily in older "hemp" houses during the set and strike of a show.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Maureen.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qcU7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31 A History of Pantomime]'', p. 31 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asbury, Nick.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dWkwS5RHQMoC&amp;pg=PT134 Exit Pursued by a Badger: An Actor's Journey Through History with Shakespeare]'', p. 134 (Oberon Books 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
[[File:Erik Satie Musique sifflee (Le siffleur-Clodine Tardy) 29e Festival des vendanges (arts de la rue) Suresnes 2012.ogg|thumb|Whistling at the 29th Festival of Street Art in [[Suresnes]], [[France]] in 2012]]
The range of pucker whistlers varies from about one to three octaves. [[Agnes Woodward]] &lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Agnes: ''Whistling as an Art'' (Carl Fischer, New York 1923)&lt;/ref&gt; classifies by analogy to [[voice type]]s: soprano (c"-c""), mezzo (a-g'") and alto (e or d-g")&lt;ref&gt;Page x. These are written pitches, presumably sounding an octave higher and corresponding to [[Scientific pitch notation|C5-C7 &amp;c]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many performers (also known as '''siffleurs''') on the music hall and [[Vaudeville]] circuits were professional whistlers, the most famous of which were [[Ronnie Ronalde]] and [[Fred Lowery]]. The term ''puccalo'' or ''puccolo'' was coined by Ron McCroby to refer to highly skilled jazz whistling.&lt;ref&gt;Sheff, David.  [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20085638,00.html "They Laughed When Ron McCroby Puckered Up, but Now He's Whistlin' Jazz, Not Dixie"], ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' (August 8, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whistling is featured in a number of television themes, such as [[Lassie (1954 TV series)|''Lassie'']], ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and [[Mark Snow]]'s title theme for ''[[The X-Files]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Snow called it the "signature whistle" that gave the music part of its "scariness". {{cite news | url = https://www.npr.org/2016/01/22/463971641/as-x-files-returns-meet-the-man-behind-the-theme-song | website = [[NPR]] | last = Greiving | first = Tim | title = As 'X-Files' Returns, Meet The Man Behind The Theme Song | date = January 22, 2016 | accessdate = January 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It also prominently features in the score of the movie ''[[Twisted Nerve]]'', composed by [[Bernard Herrmann]], which was later used in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Kill Bill]]''.

Prominent in classic songs such as [[Bobby McFerrin]]'s "[[Don't Worry, Be Happy]]" and [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]]' "[[Wind of Change (Scorpions song)|Wind of Change]]", whistling has also been integrated in many contemporary pop hits such as [[Flo Rida]]'s "[[Whistle (Flo Rida song)|Whistle]]", [[Selena Gomez]]'s "[[Kill Em with Kindness (song)|Kill Em With Kindness]]", [[Florida Georgia Line]]'s "[[Sun Daze]]", [[Foster the People]]'s "[[Pumped Up Kicks]]", [[Maroon 5]]'s "[[Moves Like Jagger]]", [[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]]' "Home", [[OneRepublic]]'s "Good Life", [[Adam Lambert]]'s "Ghost Town", [[Kanye West]]'s "[[All Day (Kanye West song)|All Day]]", [[Peter Bjorn and John]]'s "[[Young Folks]]" and The Seekers "Georgy Girl".

==By spectators==
Whistling is often used by spectators at sporting events to express either enthusiasm or disapprobation. In the United States and Canada, whistling is used much like applause, to express approval or appreciation for the efforts of a team or a player, such as a [[starting pitcher]] in baseball who is taken out of the game after having pitched well. In much of the rest of the world, especially Europe and South America, whistling is used to express displeasure with the action or disagreement with an official's decision, like [[booing]]. This whistling is often loud and cacophonous, using [[finger whistling]].

==Superstitions==
In many cultures, whistling or making whistling noises at night is thought to attract bad luck, bad things, or [[Demon|evil spirits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tate|title=Things Fall Apart – Ch 2|url=http://www.wssb.wa.gov/content/Classrooms/tate/content/freshman/Things%20Fall%20Apart/ch-2.htm|publisher=Washington State School for the Blind|accessdate=May 20, 2012|date=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Traditions|url=http://www.fantasticasia.net/?p=17|publisher=Fantastic Asia Ltd.|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belide Tribe 22.000|url=http://www.indonesiatraveling.com/sumatra/sumatra-intro/189-riau.html|publisher=Indonesia Traveling|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evil Eye......

In the UK there is a superstitious belief in the "Seven Whistlers" which are seven mysterious birds or spirits who call out to foretell death or a great calamity. In the 19th century, large groups of coal miners were known to have refused to enter the mines for one day after hearing this spectral whistling. The Seven Whistlers have been mentioned in literature such as ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' by Edmund Spenser, as bearing an omen of death. [[William Wordsworth]] included fear of the Seven Whistlers in his poem, "Though Narrow Be That Old Man's Cares". The superstition has been reported in the [[Midlands (England)|Midland Counties]] of England but also in [[Lancashire]], Essex, [[Kent]], and even in other places such as North Wales and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Elizabeth Mary |title=Rustic speech and folk-lore |page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rB1AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA197 |publisher=H.

In Russian and other [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] cultures, and also in [[Romania]] and the [[Baltic states]], whistling indoors is superstitiously believed to bring poverty ("whistling money away"), whereas whistling outdoors is considered normal. In Estonia it is also widely believed that whistling indoors may bring bad luck and therefore set the house on fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passportmagazine.ru/article/369/ ''Passport'' magazine article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whistling on board a sailing ship is thought to encourage the wind strength to increase.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, N. V. M. "Whistling Up the Wind: Myth and Creativity." ''Philippine Studies: Historical and Ethnographic Viewpoints'' 31.2 (1983): 216–226.&lt;/ref&gt; This is regularly alluded to in the [[Aubrey-Maturin]] books by [[Patrick O'Brian]].

[[Theatrical superstitions|Theater practice has plenty of superstitions]]: one of them is against whistling. A popular explanation is that traditionally sailors, skilled in rigging and accustomed to the [[boatswain's pipe]], were often used as [[Stagehand|stage technicians]], working with the [[Counterweight fly system|complicated rope systems]] associated with [[Fly tower|flying]]. An errant whistle might cause a cue to come early or a "sailor's ghost" to drop a set-piece on top of an actor. An offstage whistle audible to the audience in the middle of a performance might also be considered bad luck.

[[Transcendental whistling]] (''chángxiào'' 長嘯) was an ancient Chinese [[Daoist]] technique of resounding breath yoga, and skillful whistlers supposedly could summon supernatural beings, wild animals, and weather phenomena.
