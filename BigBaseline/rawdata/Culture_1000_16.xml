      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">An '''ancient language''' is any [[language]] originating in times that may be referred to as ancient. There is no formal criterion for deeming a language ancient, but a traditional convention is to demarcate as "ancient" those languages that existed prior to the 5th century.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Roger D. Woodard, ''The Ancient Languages of Europe'' (2008), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Roger Woodward has said that "[p]erhaps, then, what makes an ancient language different is our awareness that it has outlived those for whom it was an intimate element of the psyche".&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;

By this definition, the term includes languages attested from ancient times in the [[list of languages by first written accounts]], and described in [[historical linguistics]], and particularly the languages of [[classical antiquity]], such as [[Tamil language]], [[Ancient Greek]], [[Hebrew language]], [[Old Persian]], [[Avestan]], [[Middle Persian]], [[Sanskrit language]],  [[Chinese language]], [[Latin]], [[Arabic language]]. The term may also encompass other [[classical language]]s and various [[extinct language]]s.

==Popular culture==
The description of fictional races and realms having their own "ancient languages" adds depth and richness to storytelling, even if the vocabulary and grammar of the languages themselves is never provided.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Conley and Stephen Cain, ''Encyclopedia of Fictional and Fantastic Languages'' (2006), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include a fictional language in the ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]'' young-adult novels, the language of the race called [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]] in the [[Mythology of Stargate]], and various languages in writings by J.R.R. Tolkien.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4549">{{about|languages that naturally emerge in computer simulations or controlled psychological experiments with humans|planned or constructed human languages|constructed language|formal computer languages|formal language}}

'''Artificial languages''' are [[language]]s of a typically very limited size which emerge either in computer simulations between artificial agents, robot interactions or controlled psychological experiments with humans. They are different from both [[constructed language]]s and [[formal language]]s in that they have '''''not''''' been consciously devised by an individual or group but are the result of (distributed) conventionalisation processes, much like [[natural language]]s. Opposed to the idea of a central ''designer'', the field of '''artificial language evolution''' in which artificial languages are studied can be regarded as a sub-part of the more general [[cultural evolution]] studies.

==Origin==
The idea of creation of artificial language arose in 17th and 18th century as a result of gradually decreasing international role of Latin. The initial schemes ere mainly aimed at the development of a rational language free from inconsistence of living language and based on classification of concepts. The material of living languages also appears later.

== Motivation ==

The lack of empirical evidence in the field of [[evolutionary linguistics]] has led many researchers to adopt computer simulations as a means to investigate the ways in which artificial agents can self-organize languages with natural-like properties.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference

 | publisher = World Scientific Publishing Co.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research is based on the hypothesis that [[natural language]] is a [[complex adaptive system]] that emerges through interactions between individuals and continues to evolve in order to remain adapted to the needs and capabilities of its users. By explicitly building all assumptions into computer simulations, this strand of research strives to experimentally investigate the dynamics underlying [[language change]] as well as questions regarding the [[origin of language]] under controlled conditions.

Due to its success the paradigm has also been extended to investigate the emergence of new languages in psychological experiments with humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading up to the new paradigm of [[experimental semiotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| pmc = 4503356
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the focus of the investigations lies on the conventionalisation dynamics and higher-level properties of the resulting languages rather than specific details of the conventions, artificially evolved languages are typically not documented or re-used outside the single experiment trial or simulation run in which they emerge. In fact, the limited size and short-lived nature of artificial languages are probably the only things that sets them apart from ''natural'' languages, since ''all'' languages are artificial insofar as they are [[conventional]] (see also [[Constructed language#Planned, constructed, artificial]]).

== Uses ==

Artificial languages have been used in research in developmental psycholinguistics. Because researchers have a great deal of control over artificial languages, they have used these languages in '''[[statistical language acquisition]]''' studies, in which it can be helpful to control the linguistic patterns heard by infants.

'''Artistic license''' (also known as '''art license''', '''historical license''', '''dramatic license''', '''poetic license''', '''narrative license''', '''licentia poetica''', '''creative license''', or simply '''license''') is a colloquial term, sometimes a [[euphemism]], used to denote the distortion of fact, alteration of the conventions of [[grammar]] or language, or rewording of pre-existing text made by an [[artist]] in the name of [[art]].

==History==
The artistic license may also refer to the ability of an artist to apply smaller distortions, such as a poet ignoring some of the minor requirements of grammar for poetic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harvey, Thomas Wadleigh |year=2008 |title=A Practical Grammar of the English Language |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC. |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Mark Antony]]'s "Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears" from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' would technically require the word "and" before "countrymen", but the conjunction "and" is omitted to preserve the rhythm of [[iambic pentameter]] (the resulting conjunction is called an [[Asyndeton|asyndetic]] [[tricolon]]). Conversely, on the next line, the end of "I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him" has an extra syllable because omitting the word "him" would make the sentence unclear, but adding a syllable at the end would not disrupt the meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herzberg, Max John |year=1933 |title=Off to Arcady: adventures in poetry |publisher=American book co. |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are examples of artistic license. 

Another example of artistic license is the way in which stylized images of an object (for instance in a [[stylized painting|painting]] or an [[stylized animation|animated movie]]) are different from their real life counterparts, but are still intended to be interpreted by the viewer as representing the same thing. This can mean the omission of details, or the simplification of shapes and color shades, even to the point that the image is nothing more than a [[pictogram]]. It can also mean the addition of non-existing details, or exaggeration of shapes and colours, as in [[fantasy art]] or a [[caricature]].

Certain stylizations have become fixed conventions in art; an agreement between artist and viewer that is understood and undebatable. A striking example is how in simple cartoon drawings' monochromatic white parts on a dark colored surface are immediately recognized by most viewers to represent the reflection of light on a smooth or wet surface.

In summary, artistic license is:

* Entirely at the artist's discretion
* Intended to be tolerated by the viewer (cf. "willing [[suspension of disbelief]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davis, Tracy C. |year=2005 |title=Do you believe in fairies? The hiss of dramatic license |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=57&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Useful for filling in gaps, whether they be factual, compositional, historical or other gaps&lt;ref&gt;Goodsell, David S.; Johnson, Graham T. (2007). "Filling in the Gaps: Artistic License in Education and Outreach". ''PLoS Biol'' '''5''' (12). {{doi|10.1371/journal.pbio.0050308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Used consciously or unconsciously, intentionally or unintentionally or in tandem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Esaak, Shelley |url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/artspeak_faqs/f/artisticlicense.htm |title=What is artistic license? |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic license==
Artistic license is often referred to as dramatic license when it involves the glamorization of real-world occupations for the sake of exciting television or cinematic experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'sa, Benicia |year=2005 |title=Social Studies in the Dark: Using Docudramas to Teach History |journal=The Social Studies |volume=96 |number=1 |pages=9&amp;ndash;13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and other [[police procedural]] programs typically omit completely the more mundane aspects of the occupation such as paperwork, reports, administrative duties and other daily "business-oriented" aspects which in reality often constitute the majority of police work. They will also present other duties with much more action, suspense or drama than would be experienced in reality. The same is also true for many military-oriented adventure stories which often show high-ranking characters being allowed to continuously enter dangerous situations when in reality, they would usually be restricted to command-oriented and administrative duties.

==Controversy and criticism==
Artistic license often provokes [[controversy]] by offending those who resent the reinterpretation of cherished beliefs or previous works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Toplin, Robert Brent |year=2002 |title=Reel history: in defense of Hollywood |publisher=University Press of Kansas |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists often respond to these criticisms by pointing out that their work was not intended to be a [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] portrayal of something previous and should be judged only on [[artistic merit]]. Artistic license is a generally accepted practice, particularly when the result is widely acclaimed. [[William Shakespeare]]'s historical plays, for example, are gross distortions of historical fact but are nevertheless lauded as outstanding literary works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barroll, J. Leeds |year=1975 |title=Shakespeare Studies: An Annual Gathering of Research, Criticism, Reviews |publisher=Ayer Publishing |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical voices are sometimes raised when artistic license is applied to cinematic and other depictions of real historical events. While slight manipulation for dramatic effect of chronology and character traits are generally accepted, some critics feel that depictions that present a significantly altered reality are irresponsible, particularly because many viewers and readers do not know the actual events and may thus take the dramatized depiction to be true to reality. Examples of films and television series criticized for excessive use of dramatic license include Disney's ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', Oliver Stone's ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', the HBO series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'', 20th Century Fox's ''[[The Greatest Showman]]'' and Showtime's ''[[The Tudors]]''. 

Writers adapting a work for another medium (e.g., a film screenplay from a book) often make significant changes, additions to, or omissions from the original plot in the book, on the grounds that these changes were necessary to make a good film.&lt;ref&gt;''Film review'' (1999). Issues 14-16. Orpheus Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are sometimes to the dismay of fans of the original work.

'''Calabash chalk''' is a [[Geophagia|geophagic]] material popularly consumed in West African countries for pleasure, and by pregnant women as a cure for nausea.&lt;ref name=[1]&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrahams|first1=P.W.|title=Human Geophagia, Calabash Chalk and Undongo: Mineral Element Nutritional Implications|journal=PLOS One|date=2013|volume=8 | issue = 1|page=e53304|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053304|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[2]&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akpantah|first1=A.O.|title=The effect of calbash chalk on some hematological parameters in female adult Wistar rats|journal=Turkish Journal of Hematology|date=2010|volume=27|issue=3|page=177|doi=10.5152/tjh.2010.25|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[3]&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anon|title=Advisories, Warnings and Recalls|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/_2007/2007_136-eng.php|website=Health Canada|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[4]&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=J.R.|last2=Deary|first2=M.E.|last3=Gbefa|first3=B.K|last4=Scott|first4=W.C.|title=Characterisation and analysis of persistent organic pollutants and major, minor and trace elements in Calabash chalk|journal=Chemosphere|date=2004|volume=57|issue=1|pages=21–25|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.05.023|pmid=15288195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[5]&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ekong|first1=M.B.|title=Evaluation of calabash chalk effect of femur bone morphometry and mineralization in young wistar rats: A pilot study|journal=International Journal of Applied Basic Medical Research|date=2012|volume=2 | issue = 2|pages=107–110|doi=10.4103/2229-516x.106352|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[6]&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moses|first1=E.B.|title=Effect of Calabash Chalk on the Histomorphology of the Gastro-Oesophageal Tract of Growing Wistar Rats|journal=The Malaysian Journal of Medical Sciences|date=2012|volume=19|issue=1|pages=30–35|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Geophagia is the practice of eating the earth, including soil and chalk. This practice is neither new nor outdated and can be associated with religious beliefs, medication or as part of a regular diet.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;  This act can expose the consumer to [[Toxic Substances|toxic substances]] and parasites found in the ingested earth.&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;

== Name ==

Calabash chalk is identified by different names such as: calabar stone (English), ''la craie'' or ''argile'' (French), ''mabele'' (Lingala in Congo), ''nzu'' ([[Igbo people|Igbo]] of Nigeria), ''ndom'' (Efik/Ibibio Nigeria) ''eko'' (Bini/Edo Nigeria). In addition it is also known as ''ebumba'', ''poto'' and ''ulo''. &lt;ref name=[1] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt; In [[Ghana]] it is known as ''shilè''.

== Location ==

Calabash chalk is found predominantly in Nigeria and other West African communities. Although this geophagic material is native to Africa, as a result of migration of West African's to other nations, it can also be found in ethnic stores in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States|US]].&lt;ref name=[1] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt; Calabash chalk is also eaten amongst women of African descent in the US state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;

== Composition ==

Calabash chalk is a naturally occurring material composed of fossilized sea shells. However it can also be prepared artificially by combining clay, sand, [[wood ash]] and even salt. By molding and heating this mixture, the calabash chalk is obtained.&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt; It is available as a powder, a molded shape or a block.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;

There are different views concerning the components of calabash chalk, the consensus being that the major component is [[Aluminium silicate|aluminum silicate]] hydroxide. This comes from the [[Kaolinite|kaolin]] clay group, making Al2Si2O5(OH)4 a possible formula for calabash chalk. Aside from aluminum silicate hydroxide, calabash chalk is also known to have very high concentrations of lead. The [[Recommendation (European Union)|European Union recommends]] (Commission Regulation, 2001) the amount of lead in food should not exceed 1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, however the amount of lead contained in calabash chalk has been reported (Codex Committee of Food Additives and Contaminants, 2003) to be between 10–50&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.
In addition, other reports of its composition include: [[Aluminium|aluminum]], persistent organic pollutants, [[silicon]], alpha lindane, [[endrin]], [[endosulfan]] 11, [[arsenic]], and [[chromium]].&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;

== Uses ==

The practice of eating calabash chalk is observed by both sexes and different age groups of people of African descent, for the purpose of pleasure. However, it is prevalent among women, predominantly during [[pregnancy]], who claim it prevents [[vomiting]], over-salivation and [[nausea]].&lt;ref name=[1] /&gt; Calabash chalk is also used to make facial masks and soaps.&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;

== Health risks ==

When geophagical materials are consumed and come in contact with [[Gastric acid|digestive fluids]], they have the potential of releasing clinical or sub-clinical toxic effects on an individual.&lt;ref name=[1] /&gt;
There are several reports regarding the health risks of consuming calabash chalk including; the alteration of the normal concentration of [[hemoglobin]], [[red blood cell]] counts and [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]]. Another possible side effect of eating this geophagia is the alteration of growth rate and de-mineralization in the [[Femur|femur bone]].&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt; Other reports suggest that calabash chalk also causes numerous [[Gastrointestinal disease|gastrointestinal disorders]] such as nausea, [[ulcer]]s and [[gastritis]]. This stems from histomorphological changes that calabash chalk causes to the [[stomach]] and [[oesophagus]].&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt;

A '''closed-ended question''' refers to any question for which a researcher provides research participants with options from which to choose a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-open-ended-and-closed-ended-questions.html|website=''yourdictionary.com''|publisher=yourdictionary.com|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open-ended questions are sometimes phrased as a [[Declarative sentence|statement]] which requires a response.

A closed-ended question contrasts with an [[open-ended question]], which cannot easily be answered with specific information.

Examples of close-ended questions which may elicit a "yes" or "no" response include:
*Were you born in {{CURRENTYEAR}}?
*Is [[Lyon]] the capital of France?
*Did you steal the money?

Similarly, variants of the above close-ended questions which possess specific responses are:
*On what day were you born? ("[[{{CURRENTWEEKDAYNAME}}]].")
*What is the capital of France? ("Paris.")
*Where did you steal the money? ("From the bank.")

At the same time, there are closed-ended questions which are sometimes impossible to answer correctly with a yes or no without confusion, for example: "Have you stopped taking heroin?" (if you never took it) or "Who told you to take heroin?"; see "[[loaded question]]".

A study by the [[University of Cincinnati]] found 20 to 40 percent of Americans will provide an opinion when they do not have one because of [[social pressure]], using [[Contextual learning|context clues]] to select an answer they believe will please the questioner. A classic example of this phenomenon was the 1947 study of the fictional [[Metallic Metals Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kivitv.com/-/the-bomb-agrabah-survey-shows-how-problematic-polling-can-be |title=The 'Bomb Agrabah' Survey Shows How Problematic Polling Can Be |last=Daniels |first=Eugene |date=18 December 2015 |publisher=[[KIVI-TV]] |access-date= 17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closed-ended questions in education ==
Some in the field of education argue that closed-ended questions are broadly speaking "bad" questions. They are questions that are often asked to obtain a specific answer and are therefore good for testing knowledge. It is often argued that open-ended questions (i.e. questions that elicit more than a yes/no answers) are preferable because they open up discussion and enquiry.

Peter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley’s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are "grammatically closed, but conceptually open".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=3 December 2016|title=Ariadne's Clew Absence and presence in the facilitation of philosophical conversations|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1350/870|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v3i2.1350|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in standard parlance, "is it ever right to lie?" would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes–no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes–no answer to it can be "opened up" by the questioner ("why do you think that?", "Could there be an instance where that's not the case?), inviting elaboration and enquiry.

This grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, "gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/question-your-questioning|title=Question your questioning|date=19 April 2017|work=Tes|access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed questions, simply require "opening up" strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential.

Worley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention "Open Questioning Mindset" (OQM). OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of student's contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genuine enquiry in the classroom. It provides teachers with the tools to move beyond what Worley calls "guess what's in my head" teaching, that relies on closed and leading questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=29 November 2015|title=Open thinking, closed questioning: Two kinds of open and closed question|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1269|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v2i2.1269|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Uncanny136.jpg|thumb|right|Cover to ''Uncanny X-Men'' #136 (August 1980, art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]), the penultimate issue of the "[[Dark Phoenix]]" saga.  [[Jean Grey]] would sacrifice herself in the following issue, but [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] later had the story [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] to allow Jean to appear in the new ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' series.]]
In the [[comic book]] fan community, the apparent [[death]] and subsequent return of a long-running [[Character (arts)|character]] is often called a '''comic book death'''. A comic book death is generally not taken seriously by readers and is rarely permanent or meaningful other than for story or thematic purposes.

==Context==
Commenting on the impact and role of comic book character deaths, writer [[Geoff Johns]] said:&lt;ref&gt;IGN Geoff Johns: Inside Blackest Night&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Death in superhero comics is cyclical in its nature, and that's for a lot of reasons, whether they are story reasons, copyright reasons, or fan reasons.}}

The phenomenon of comic book death is particularly common for superhero characters. Writer [[Danny Fingeroth]] suggests that the nature of superheroes requires that they be both [[ageless]] and [[immortality|immortal]].&lt;ref&gt;James R. Fleming, [http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v2_2/reviews/fleming.shtml Review of ''Superman on the Couch: What Superheroes Really Tell Us about Ourselves and Our Society''], ''ImageTexT: Interdisciplinary Comics Studies'', vol. 2, no. 2, Winter 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common expression regarding comic book death was once "The only people who stay dead in comics are [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]], [[Jason Todd]], and [[Uncle Ben]],"&lt;ref name="opinionjournal2007"&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110009780 Captain America, RIP], para. 5, ''Wall Street Journal'', March 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the seminal importance of those characters' deaths to the title character:  [[Captain America]]'s [[sidekick]] (retconned dead in 1964), Batman's second [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (dead in 1988), and [[Spider-Man]]'s uncle (dead since 1962), respectively. This long-held tenet was broken in 2005, when Jason Todd returned to life as the [[Red Hood (Jason Todd)|Red Hood]] and Bucky was reported to have survived the accident that seemingly killed him, brought back in 2005 as the [[Winter Soldier (comics)|Winter Soldier]], remaining in the shadows for decades. Barnes apparently died again in 2011 after a short tenure as Captain America,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Fraction, Matt]]|penciller=[[Immonen, Stuart]]|inker=von Grawbadger, Wade|story=Chapter 3: The Hammer That Fell On Yancy Street|title=Fear Itself|issue=3|date=August 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to be revived by [[Nick Fury]]'s Infinity Formula.&lt;ref&gt;''Fear Itself'' #7.1 (2011), Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because death in comics is so often temporary, readers rarely take the death of a character seriously—when a character dies, the reader feels very little sense of loss, and simply left wondering how long it will be before they return to life.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/comic-book-deaths/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbr.com/the-most-memorable-shocking-comic-book-deaths/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/logan-how-handled-death-comic-books-981835&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.se/books?id=raV6qalYZKwC&amp;pg=PA194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
Although several comic book deaths are well-known, two of the best-known are the 1980 "death" of [[Jean Grey]] in Marvel's "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix Saga]]" and that of [[Superman]] in [[DC Comics|DC]]'s highly publicized 1993 "[[The Death of Superman|Death of Superman]]" storyline. There is one major distinction between the two, however—whereas it was never intended that Superman's death be permanent, but rather that he would return to life at the conclusion of the story,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/03/29/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-96/| title = Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed # 96| author = Brian Cronin| date = March 29, 2007| publisher = Comic Book Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean's passing was intended to be permanent, as the editor [[Jim Shooter]] felt that would be the only satisfactory outcome given that she had committed [[mass murder]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Dark Phoenix Tapes", ''Phoenix: The Untold Story'' #1 (April 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ginocchio|first=Mark|title=10 Amazing Storylines Derailed by Editorial Politics|url=http://whatculture.com/comics/10-amazing-comic-storylines-derailed-editorial-politics.php/8|work=What Culture|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the story was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] a few years later to facilitate Jean's return.

In 2007, the death of [[Captain America]] made real-world headlines&lt;ref name="opinionjournal2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsweek.com/comics-captain-america-1941-2007-95787&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=2934283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/08/books/08capt.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/08/usa.arts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18520433&lt;/ref&gt; when he met his apparent end, but Steve Rogers returned in ''[[Captain America: Reborn]]'' in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/06/15/captain.america/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/captain-america-steve-rogers-coming-back-life-years-marvel-comics-killed-article-1.376815&lt;/ref&gt;

==In universe acknowledgement==
Comic book characters themselves have made comments about the frequency of resurrections. [[Professor X]] has commented "in mutant heaven there are no pearly gates, but instead revolving doors."&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #70 page 17, panel 1&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Siryn]] was made aware of [[Banshee (comics)|her father]]'s death, she refused to [[Mourning|mourn]] him, giddily claiming that since her father has died as an [[X-Men|X-Man]], he was likely going to be soon resurrected, shocking her friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[David, Peter]] (w), [[Olivetti, Ariel]] (a). "Two Meetings, One In Person, One Not", ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (vol 3) #7 (July 2006). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father is later restored to life but is recruited by the [[Apocalypse Twins]] as part of their new [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers'' #9 (June 2013). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The obituary writer of the in-universe newspaper the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' once bemoaned to reporter [[Ben Urich]] about how many retractions he has had to write after each resurrection of a superhero or [[supervillain]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Unlimited'' vol.1 #18.

Intangible cultural heritage refers to "traditions or living expressions inherited from our ancestors and passed on to our descendants, such as oral traditions, performing arts, social practices, rituals, festive events, knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe or the knowledge and skills to produce traditional crafts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01851-EN.pdf What is Intangible Cultural Heritage] p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention defines it as follows:

{{quote|Intangible Cultural Heritage means the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, and skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. For the purposes of this Convention, consideration will be given solely to such intangible cultural heritage as is compatible with existing international human rights instruments, as well as with the requirements of mutual respect among communities, groups and individuals, and of sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 2
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Function===
The Convention works on both national and international levels.
At the national level, State Parties are supposed to ‘take necessary measures to ensure the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage present in its territory.” These measures include identification of the intangible cultural heritage that exists in its territory, adoption of appropriate policies, promotion of education and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 11&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, in taking these measures, each state parties must “endeavor to ensure the widest possible participation of communities, groups, and, where appropriate, individuals that create, maintain and transmit such heritage, and to involve them actively in its management”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 15&lt;/ref&gt;

At the international level, this Convention promotes international cooperation, which includes “the exchange of information and experience, joint initiatives, and the establishment of a mechanism of assistance” to other State Parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lists'''

The Committee to the Convention publishes and keeps up to date two lists of intangible cultural heritage, which are
*the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]]
*the [[List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 16,17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund'''

The Convention establishes Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund, the use of which is decided by the Committee. The fund mainly consists of the contributions by State Parties and funds by the General Conference of UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00022 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage] Article 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===
One of the first international occasions that mentioned the preservation of 'intangible heritage' was the World Conference on Cultural Policies in Mexico City in 1982.&lt;ref name="Working towards the 2003 Convention"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention] p.6&lt;/ref&gt; This Conference defined cultural heritage as including “both tangible and intangible works through which the creativity of people finds expression,” and asked UNESCO and Member States to take measures for protecting this kind of heritage.&lt;ref name="Working towards the 2003 Convention"/&gt;

In 1989, UNESCO adopted the Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore as the first legal instrument towards the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention] p.7&lt;/ref&gt; This Recommendation reflected the ideas of the earlier Conference in Mexico City. UNESCO conducted some promotional programs for raising awareness of this Recommendation, but was not very successful.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; However, in the late 90's, there was a conference held for the assessment of this Recommendation, which pointed out some problems to be considered in drafting the Convention. In this sense, this Recommendation served as an important step.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention] p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, UNESCO launched the program of Proclamation of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, intending to raise awareness of the importance of intangible heritage. This program proclaimed a total of 90 masterpieces between 2001 and 2005, and caused the movement toward the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00103 Proclamation of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity (2001–2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation===

According to the request of Member States, a preliminary study, undertaken by Director-General, on how could the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage be conducted, recommended to create a new document that set an international standard.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2001, the General Conference adopted another instrument, [[Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity]], which also includes articles dealing with the preservation of ’heritage in all forms’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13179&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity] Article 7&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration and its Action Plan presented basic idea of the coming convention and helped to develop it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/01854-EN.pdf Working towards the 2003 Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of many meetings for two years, the draft Convention was brought into the General Conference and adopted in 2003.

==Criticism==
*The definition of intangible cultural heritage has been criticized as potentially incomplete. For example, in a 2004 article in ''[[Museum International]]'', [[Richard Kurin]] says that because the Convention does not recognize cultural activities not compatible with international human rights instruments, some activities, such as [[female genital mutilation]], that groups may themselves consider critical to their culture, are not eligible. Similarly, Kurin notes that since many group's culture is defined in opposition to other cultures, the requirement for "mutual respect" may leave out traditional songs and stories that glorify "empire, victorious kings, religious conversion, or alternatively resistance to perceived injustice, martyrdom and defeat".&lt;ref name=Kurin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurin|first=Richard|title=Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage in the 2003 UNESCO Convention: a critical appraisal|journal=Museum International|date=1 May 2004|volume=56|issue=1–2|pages=66–77|doi=10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kurin also notes that the definition can be more expansive than intended by its designers, who originally planned only to protect "traditional cultural activities". He says that it is robust enough to encompass more modern forms of culture, including things like "[[rap music]], [[Australian cricket]], modern dance, post-modernist architectural knowledge, and [[karaoke bars]]".&lt;ref name=Kurin/&gt;
*Richard Kurin has argued that dividing culture into individual units is inconsistent with modern academic views of cultures.&lt;ref name=Kurin/&gt; Additionally, Michael Brown has argued that Convention's focus on cataloging is based on an outdated belief that listing the details of a culture has some connection to preservation of that culture.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Michael F.|title=Heritage Trouble: Recent Work on the Protection of Intangible Cultural Property|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2005|volume=12|issue=01|doi=10.1017/S0940739105050010|url=http://lanfiles.williams.edu/~mbrown/Brown,%20Heritage%20Trouble,%20IJCP,%202005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; States are also encouraged to enact programs to safeguard intangible cultural heritages, though any such work must be done in cooperation with the local practitioners. This aspect has also been criticized, since it is unclear how a state can safeguard a cultural practice by force, particularly if there is insufficient interest from local practitioners.&lt;ref name =Kurin/&gt;

{{sociology}}
A '''counterculture''' (also written '''counter-culture''') is a [[subculture]] whose values and norms of behavior differ substantially from those of mainstream society, often in opposition to mainstream cultural [[mores]].&lt;ref name=MWebster/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eric Donald Hirsch 1993 p 419"&gt;Eric Donald Hirsch. ''The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy''. Houghton Mifflin. {{ISBN|0-395-65597-8}}. (1993) p. 419. "Members of a cultural protest that began in the U.S. In the 1960s and Europe before fading in the 1970s... fundamentally a cultural rather than a [[political protest]]."&lt;/ref&gt;  A countercultural movement expresses the ethos and aspirations of a specific population during a well-defined era. When oppositional forces reach [[critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]], countercultures can trigger dramatic cultural changes.  Prominent examples of countercultures in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] include [[Romanticism]] (1790–1840), [[Bohemianism]] (1850–1910), the more fragmentary counterculture of the [[Beat Generation]] (1944–1964), followed by the globalized [[counterculture of the 1960s]] (1964–1974), usually associated with the [[hippie]] subculture&lt;ref name=HarvardTR/&gt; and the diversified [[punk subculture]] of the 1970s and 1980s.

==Definition and characteristics==
[[John Milton Yinger]] originated the term "contraculture" in his 1960 article in ''[[American Sociological Review]]''. Yinger suggested the use of the term contraculture "wherever the normative system of a group contains, as a primary element, a theme of conflict with the values of the total society, where personality variables are directly involved in the development and maintenance of the group's values, and wherever its norms can be understood only by reference to the relationships of the group to a surrounding dominant culture." &lt;ref&gt;"Contraculture and Subculture" by J. Milton Yinger, ''American Sociological Review'',
Vol. 25, No. 5 (Oct., 1960) https://www.jstor.org/stable/2090136&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have attributed the ''counterculture'' to [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]],&lt;ref name=HarvardTR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Social critic Theodore Roszak *58 explores intolerance in new novel about gay Jewish writer | first = Andrea| last = Gollin | url = http://www.princeton.edu/~paw/archive_new/PAW02-03/14-0423/books.html | publisher = PAW Online | date = April 23, 2003 | accessdate = June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TRbook/&gt; author of ''[[The Making of a Counter Culture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;His conception of the counterculture is discussed in Whiteley, 2012 &amp; 2014 and Bennett, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  It became prominent in the news media amid the [[social revolution]] that swept the [[Americas]], [[Western Europe]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] during the 1960s.&lt;ref name="MWebster"&gt;"counterculture", ''Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary'', 2008, [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/counterculture MWCCul].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HarvardTR"&gt;F. X. Shea, S. J., "Reason and the Religion of the Counter-Culture", ''[[Harvard Theological Review]]'', Vol. 66/1 (1973), pp. 95–111, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1509351 JSTOR-3B2-X].
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TRbook"&gt;[[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Roszak, Theodore]], ''The Making of a Counter Culture: Reflections on the Technocratic Society and Its Youthful Opposition'', 1968/1969, Doubleday, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-385-07329-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars differ in the characteristics and specificity they attribute to "counterculture". "Mainstream" culture is of course also difficult to define, and in some ways becomes identified and understood through contrast with counterculture. Counterculture might oppose mass culture (or "media culture"),&lt;ref&gt;Gelder, ''Subcultures'' (2007) p. 4. "...to the banalities of mass cultural forms".&lt;/ref&gt; or middle-class culture and values.&lt;ref&gt;Hodkinson and Deicke, ''Youth Cultures'' (2007), p. 205. "...opposition to, the middle-class establishment of adults."&lt;/ref&gt; Counterculture is sometimes conceptualized in terms of generational conflict and rejection of older or adult values.&lt;ref&gt;Hebdige, ''Subculture'' (1979), p. 127. "defining themselves against the parent culture."&lt;/ref&gt;

Counterculture may or may not be explicitly political. It typically involves criticism or rejection of currently powerful institutions, with accompanying hope for a better life or a new society.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Jefferson, ''Resistance Through Rituals'' (1991), p. 61. "They make articulate their opposition to dominant values and institutions—even when, as frequently occurred, this does not take the form of an overtly political response."&lt;/ref&gt; It does not look favorably on party politics or [[authoritarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazlehurst &amp; Hazlehurst, ''Gangs and Youth Subcultures'' (1998), p. 59. "There does seem to be some general commitment towards antiauthoritarianism, a rejection of the traditional party political system which is considered irrelevant."&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural development can also be affected by way of counterculture. Scholars such as Joanne Martin and Caren Siehl, deem counterculture and cultural development as "a balancing act, [that] some core values of a counterculture should present a direct challenge to the core values of a dominant culture". Therefore, a prevalent culture and a counterculture should coexist in an uneasy symbiosis, holding opposite positions on valuable issues that are essentially important to each of them. According to this theory, a counterculture can contribute a plethora of useful functions for the prevalent culture, such as "articulating the foundations between appropriate and inappropriate behavior and providing a safe haven for the development of innovative ideas".&lt;ref&gt;''Organizational Culture and Counterculture: An Uneasy Symbiosis'' (1983), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a  "fringe culture" expands and grows into a counterculture by defining its own values in opposition to mainstream norms.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Countercultures tend to peak, then go into decline, leaving a lasting impact on mainstream cultural values. Their life cycles include phases of rejection, growth, partial acceptance and absorption into the mainstream.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  During the late 1960s, hippies became the largest and most visible countercultural group in the United States.&lt;ref name="Yablonsky, Lewis 1968 pp 21-37"&gt;Yablonsky, Lewis (1968), The Hippie Trip, New York: Western Publishing, Inc., {{ISBN|978-0595001163}}, pp. 21–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The "cultural shadows" left by the Romantics, Bohemians, Beats and Hippies remain visible in contemporary Western culture.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

According to Sheila Whiteley, "recent developments in sociological theory complicate and problematize theories developed in the 1960s, with digital technology, for example, providing an impetus for new understandings of counterculture".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Whiteley, 2012 &amp; 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Bennett writes that "despite the theoretical arguments that can be raised against the sociological value of counterculture as a meaningful term for categorising social action, like [[subculture]], the term lives on as a concept in social and [[cultural theory]]… [to] become part of a received, mediated memory". However, "this involved not simply the utopian but also the dystopian and that while festivals such as those held at [[Monterey]] and [[Woodstock]] might appear to embrace the former, the deaths of such iconic figures as [[Brian Jones]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jim Morrison]] and [[Janis Joplin]], the nihilistic mayhem at [[Altamont Free Concert|Altamont]], and the shadowy figure of [[Charles Manson]] cast a darker light on its underlying agenda, one that reminds us that ‘pathological issues [are] still very much at large in today's world".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Andy Bennett, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
The counterculture of the 1960s and early 1970s generated its own unique brand of notable literature, including comics and cartoons, and sometimes referred to as the [[underground press]]. In the United States, this includes the work of [[Robert Crumb]] and [[Gilbert Shelton]], and includes [[Mr. Natural (comics)|Mr. Natural]]; [[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']]; ''[[Fritz the Cat]]''; [[Fat Freddy's Cat]]; [[Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]; the album cover art for ''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]''; and in several countries contributions to ''[[International Times]]'', ''[[The Village Voice]]'', and [[Oz (magazine)|''Oz'' magazine]]. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, these comics and magazines were available for purchase in [[head shop]]s along with items like beads, incense, cigarette papers, tie-dye clothing, [[Blacklight paint|Day-Glo]] posters, books, etc.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, some of these shops selling hippie items also became cafés where hippies could hang out, chat, smoke [[marijuana]], read books, etc., e.g. [[Gandalf's Garden]] in the [[King's Road]], London, which also published a magazine of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunrise-press.co.uk/Sunrise_Press/A_psychedelic_trip_around_London_page_1.html ''London a Map of the Underground''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825021903/http://www.sunrise-press.co.uk/Sunrise_Press/A_psychedelic_trip_around_London_page_1.html |date=August 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another such hippie/anarchist bookshop was [[psychedelic mushroom|Mushroom]] Books, tucked away in the [[Lace Market]] area of [[Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesparrowsnest.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19:keith-leonard-1948-2009&amp;catid=2:blog&amp;Itemid=11 ''Mushroom Books, Nottingham'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120527014115/http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/news/Founder-radical-bookshop-dies/article-1254803-detail/article.html ''Founder of radical bookshop dies'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
Some genres tend to challenge societies with their content that is meant to outright question the norms within cultures and even create change usually towards a more modern way of thought. More often than not, sources of these controversies can be found in art such as [[Marcel Duchamp]] whose piece ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was meant to be "a calculated attack on the most basic conventions of art"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Making Sense of Marcel Duchamp|url = http://www.understandingduchamp.com/|website = www.understandingduchamp.com|accessdate = November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1917. Contentious artists like [[Banksy]] base most of their works off of mainstream media and culture to bring pieces that usually shock viewers into thinking about their piece in more detail and the themes behind them. A great example can be found in [[Dismaland]], the biggest project of "[[anarchism]]" to be organised and exhibited which showcases multiple works such as an "iconic [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] princess's horse-drawn pumpkin carriage, [appearing] to re-enact the death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Many are finding this shocking piece hidden inside Banksy's 'Dismaland' gut-wrenching|url = http://www.techinsider.io/banky-dismaland-cinderella-princess-diana-2015-8|website = Tech Insider|accessdate = November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] as a symbol of the counterculture movement in the city]]Counterculture is very much evident in music particularly on the basis of the separation of genres into those considered acceptable and within the status quo and those not. Since many minorities groups are already considered counterculture, the music they create and produce may reflect their sociopolitical realities and their musical culture may be adopted as a social expression of their counterculture. This is reflected in dancehall with the concept of base frequencies and base culture in Henriques's "Sonic diaspora", where he expounds that "base denotes crude, debased, unrefined, vulgar, and even animal" for the Jamaican middle class and is associated with the "bottom-end, low frequencies…basic lower frequencies and embodied resonances distinctly inferior to the higher notes" that appear in dancehall.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Henriques (2008) ''Sonic diaspora, vibrations, and rhythm: thinking through the sounding of the Jamaican dancehall session, ''African and Black Diaspora: An International Journal'', 1:2, 215–236, DOI: 10.1080/17528630802224163. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17528630802224163&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Henriques, "base culture is bottom-up popular, street culture, generated by an urban underclass surviving almost entirely outside the formal economy".&lt;ref&gt;Julian Henriques (2008) Sonic diaspora, vibrations, and rhythm: thinking through the sounding of the Jamaican dancehall session, African and Black Diaspora: An International Journal, 1:2, 215–236, DOI: 10.1080/17528630802224163. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17528630802224163&lt;/ref&gt; That the music is low frequency sonically and regarded as reflective of a lower culture shows the influential connection between counterculture and the music produced. It should also be noted that while music may be considered base and counter culture, it may actually enjoy a lot of popularity which can be seen by the labelling of hip hop as a counter culture genre, despite it being one of the most commercially successful and high charting genres.

=== Assimilation ===
Many of these artists though once being taboo, have been assimilated into culture and are no longer a source of moral panic since they don't cross overtly controversial topics or challenge staples of current culture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stop Fooling Yourself: Coachella Style Is Trash—"Counterculture" and "subculture" have been assimilated into a commercialized "pop culture" product|url = http://ca.complex.com/style/2015/04/coachella-style-is-trash/counterculture-and-commercialization|website = Complex CA|accessdate = November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sociology in a Changing World|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=U41tCgAAQBAJ|publisher = Cengage Learning|date = January 31, 2011|isbn = 9781133172857|first = William|last = Kornblum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of being a topic to fear, they have initiated subtle trends that other artists and sources of media may follow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== LGBT ==
[[Gay liberation]] (considered a [[wikt:precursor|precursor]] of various modern [[LGBT social movements]]) was known for its links to the counterculture of the time (e.g. groups like the [[Radical Faeries]]), and for the gay liberationists' intent to transform or abolish fundamental institutions of society such as [[gender]] and the [[nuclear family]];&lt;ref name="HoffmanIntro"&gt;Hoffman, Amy (2007) ''An Army of Ex-Lovers: My life at the Gay Community News''. University of Massachusetts Press. pp.xi-xiii. {{ISBN|978-1558496217}}&lt;/ref&gt; in general, the politics were radical, [[anti-racism|anti-racist]], and [[anti-capitalist]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/glf-london.html|title=Gay Liberation Front: Manifesto. London|origyear=1971|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve such liberation, [[consciousness raising]] and [[direct action]] were employed.&lt;ref name="HoffmanIntro" /&gt;

At the outset of the 20th century, [[homosexual]] acts were punishable offenses in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;See [[sodomy law]] for more information&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing public attitude was that homosexuality was a moral failing that should be punished, as exemplified by [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1895 trial and imprisonment for "gross indecency". But even then, there were dissenting views. [[Sigmund Freud]] publicly expressed his opinion that homosexuality was "assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function, produced by a certain arrest of sexual development".&lt;ref name="ErnstLFreud"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1992|pp=423–424}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Charles Kaiser's ''The Gay Metropolis'', there were already semi-public gay-themed gatherings by the mid-1930s in the United States (such as the annual [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] balls held during the [[Harlem Renaissance]]). There were also [[gay bar|bars]] and [[gay bathhouse|bathhouses]] that catered to gay clientele and adopted warning procedures (similar to those used by [[Prohibition]]-era [[speakeasy|speakeasies]]) to warn customers of police raids. But homosexuality was typically subsumed into [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] culture, and was not a significant movement in itself.&lt;ref name="Gay Metro"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=C|year=1997|title=The Gay Metropolis|publisher=New York: Harcourt Brace|isbn=0-15-600617-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, a genuine [[gay culture]] began to take root, albeit very discreetly, with its own styles, attitudes and behaviors and industries began catering to this growing demographic group. For example, publishing houses cranked out [[pulp novel]]s like ''[[The Velvet Underground (book)|The Velvet Underground]]'' that were targeted directly at gay people. By the early 1960s, openly gay political organizations such as the [[Mattachine Society]] were formally protesting abusive treatment toward gay people, challenging the entrenched idea that homosexuality was an aberrant condition, and calling for the decriminalization of homosexuality. Despite very limited sympathy, American society began at least to acknowledge the existence of a sizable population of gays. The film ''[[The Boys in the Band]]'', for example, featured negative portrayals of gay men, but at least recognized that they did in fact fraternize with each other (as opposed to being isolated, solitary predators who "victimized" straight men).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[Disco|Disco music]] in large part rose out of the New York gay club scene of the early 1970s as a reaction to the stigmatization of gays and other outside groups such as blacks by the counterculture of that era.&lt;ref name="alternative to rock'n'roll"&gt;(2007) ''The 1970s'', {{ISBN|978-0-313-33919-6}}, p.203–204: "During the late 1960s various male counterculture groups, most notably gay, but also heterosexual black and Latino, created an alternative to rock'n'roll, which was dominated by white—and presumably heterosexual—men.

Another element of [[LGBT]] counter-culture that began in the 1970s—and continues today—is the [[Womyn's land|lesbian land]], landdyke movement, or [[womyn's land]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Anahita, Sine. "Nestled Into Niches: Prefigurative Communities on Lesbian Land." ''Journal of Homosexuality'', 56 (2009):719.&lt;/ref&gt; Radical feminists inspired by the [[back-to-the-land]] initiative and migrated to rural areas to create communities that were often female-only and/or lesbian communes.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, A., and Zajicek, A. M. "The history of the contemporary grassroots women's movement in northwest Arkansas, 1970–2000." Fayetteville, AR&lt;/ref&gt; "Free Spaces" are defined by Sociologist Francesca Polletta as "small-scale settings within a community or movement that are removed from the direct control of dominant groups, are voluntarily participated in, and generate the cultural challenge that precedes or accompanies political mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;Polletta, Francesca. "Free Spaces in Collective Action" Theory and Society, 28/1. (Feb 1999):1.&lt;/ref&gt; Women came together in Free Spaces like music festivals, activist groups and collectives to share ideas with like-minded people and to explore the idea of the lesbian land movement. The movement is closely tied to [[eco-feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;Anahita, Sine. "Nestled Into Niches: Prefigurative Communities on Lesbian Land." Journal of Homosexuality, 56 (2009):720-722.&lt;/ref&gt;

The four tenets of the Landdyke Movement are relationship with the land, liberation and transformation, living the politics, and bodily Freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Anahita, Sine. "Nestled Into Niches: Prefigurative Communities on Lesbian Land." Journal of Homosexuality, 56 (2009):720-719.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most importantly, members of these communities seek to live outside of a [[patriarchal society]] that puts emphasis on "beauty ideals that discipline the female body, compulsive heterosexuality, competitiveness with other women, and dependence".&lt;ref name="AnahitaSine"&gt;Anahita, Sine. "Nestled Into Niches: Prefigurative Communities on Lesbian Land". Journal of Homosexuality, 56 (2009):729.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of adhering typical female [[gender roles]], the women of Landdyke communities value "self-sufficiency, bodily strength, autonomy from men and patriarchal systems, and the development of lesbian-centered community".&lt;ref name="AnahitaSine" /&gt; Members of the Landdyke movement enjoy bodily freedoms that have been deemed unacceptable in the modern Western world—such as the freedom to expose their breasts, or to go without any clothing at all.&lt;ref&gt;Anahita, Sine. "Nestled Into Niches: Prefigurative Communities on Lesbian Land." Journal of Homosexuality, 56 (2009):734.&lt;/ref&gt;  An awareness of their impact on the Earth, and connection to nature is essential members of the Landdyke Movement's way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Anahita, Sine. "Nestled Into Niches: Prefigurative Communities on Lesbian Land". Journal of Homosexuality, 56 (2009):732.&lt;/ref&gt;

The watershed event in the American gay rights movement was the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]] in New York City. Following this event, gays and lesbians began to adopt the militant protest tactics used by [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-war]] and [[black power]] radicals to confront anti-gay ideology. Another major turning point was the 1973 decision by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] to remove homosexuality from the official list of [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Conger, J. J. (1975) "Proceedings of the American Psychological Association, Incorporated, for the year 1974: Minutes of the Annual meeting of the Council of Representatives." ''American Psychologist'', 30, 620-651.&lt;/ref&gt; Although gay radicals used pressure to force the decision, Kaiser notes that this had been an issue of some debate for many years in the psychiatric community, and that one of the chief obstacles to normalizing homosexuality was that therapists were profiting from offering dubious, unproven "cures".&lt;ref name="Gay Metro" /&gt;

The [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|AIDS epidemic]] was initially an unexpected blow to the movement, especially in North America. There was speculation that the disease would permanently drive gay life underground. Ironically, the tables were turned. Many of the early victims of the disease had been openly gay only within the confines of insular "gay ghettos" such as New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] and San Francisco's [[The Castro|Castro]]; they remained closeted in their professional lives and to their families. Many heterosexuals who thought they didn't know any gay people were confronted by friends and loved ones dying of "the gay plague" (which soon began to infect [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] people also). LGBT communities were increasingly seen not only as victims of a disease, but as victims of ostracism and hatred. Most importantly, the disease became a rallying point for a previously complacent gay community. AIDS invigorated the community politically to fight not only for a medical response to the disease, but also for wider acceptance of homosexuality in mainstream America. Ultimately, [[coming out]] became an important step for many LGBT people.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== History ==
Bill Osgerby argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the counterculture's various strands developed from earlier artistic and political movements. On both sides of the Atlantic the 1950s "Beat Generation" had fused existentialist philosophy with jazz, poetry, literature, Eastern mysticism and drugs – themes that were all sustained in the 1960s counterculture.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Osgerby, "Youth Culture" in Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds. ''A Companion to Contemporary Britain: 1939–2000'' (2005) pp. 127–44, quote at p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Counterculture of the 1960s|Timeline of 1960s counterculture}}
In the United States, the counterculture of the 1960s became identified with the rejection of conventional [[social norms]] of the 1950s. Counterculture youth rejected the cultural standards of their parents, especially with respect to racial [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and initial widespread support for the [[Vietnam War]],&lt;ref name="Eric Donald Hirsch 1993 p 419"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Works Covington, ''Rockin' At the Red Dog: The Dawn of Psychedelic Rock'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and, less directly, the [[Cold War]]—with many young people fearing that America's [[nuclear arms race]] with the [[Soviet Union]], coupled with its involvement in Vietnam, would lead to a [[nuclear holocaust]].

In the United States, widespread tensions developed in the 1960s in American society that tended to flow along generational lines regarding the [[war]] in Vietnam, [[race relations]], [[sexual revolution|sexual mores]], women's rights, traditional modes of authority, and a [[economic materialism|materialist]] interpretation of the [[American Dream]]. White, [[middle class]] youth—who made up the bulk of the counterculture in western countries—had sufficient leisure time, thanks to widespread economic [[prosperity]], to turn their attention to [[social issues]].&lt;ref name="Conscience"/&gt; These social issues included support for [[civil rights]], [[Women's rights#Modern movements|women's rights]], and [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]] movements, and a rejection of the [[Vietnam War]]. The counterculture also had access to a media which was eager to present their concerns to a wider public. Demonstrations for [[social justice]] created far-reaching changes affecting many aspects of society.  [[Hippies]] became the largest countercultural group in the United States.&lt;ref name="Yablonsky, Lewis 1968 pp 21-37"/&gt;

Rejection of mainstream culture was best embodied in the new genres of [[psychedelic rock]] music, [[pop-art]] and new explorations in [[spirituality]]. Musicians who exemplified this era in the United Kingdom and United States included [[The Beatles]], [[Neil Young]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[The Doors]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Velvet Underground]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[The Who]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[The Kinks]], [[Sly and the Family Stone]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/topic/Sly-and-the-Family-Stone&lt;/ref&gt; and, in their early years, [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]. New forms of musical presentation also played a key role in spreading the counterculture, with large outdoor rock festivals being the most noteworthy.  The climactic live statement on this occurred from August 15–18, 1969, with the ''[[Woodstock]] Music Festival'' held in [[Bethel, New York]]—with 32 of [[rock music|rock]]'s and [[psychedelic rock]]'s most popular acts performing live outdoors during the sometimes rainy weekend to an audience of half a million people. ([[Michael Lang (producer)|Michael Lang]] stated 400,000 attended, half of which did not have a ticket.)&lt;ref name = "NY Times Aug 27, 1969"&gt;{{cite news | title = State Investigating Handling of Tickets At Woodstock Fair | work = New York Times | page = 45 | date = August 27, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history—with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' calling it one of the ''50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6085488/woodstock_in_1969| title=Woodstock in 1969| date=June 24, 2004| accessdate=April 17, 2008| publisher=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bill Mankin, "It seems fitting… that one of the most enduring labels for the entire generation of that era was derived from a rock festival: the ‘Woodstock Generation’."&lt;ref&gt;Mankin, Bill.

Sentiments were expressed in song lyrics and popular sayings of the period, such as "do your own thing", "[[turn on, tune in, drop out]]", "whatever turns you on", "[[Eight miles high]]", "[[Wine, women and song|sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll]]", and "[[Light My Fire|light my fire]]". Spiritually, the counterculture included interest in [[astrology]], the term "[[Age of Aquarius]]" and knowing people's [[astrological signs]] of the [[Zodiac]]. This led Theodore Roszak to state "A {{sic}} eclectic taste for [[mysticism|mystic]], [[occult]], and magical phenomena has been a marked characteristic of our [[postwar]] youth culture since the days of the [[beatnik]]s."&lt;ref name=TRbook/&gt; In the United States, even actor [[Charlton Heston]] contributed to the movement, with the statement "Don't trust anyone over thirty" (a saying coined in 1965 by activist [[Jack Weinberg]]) in the 1968 film ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''; the same year, actress and social activist [[Jane Fonda]] starred in the sexually-themed ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]''. Both actors opposed the [[Vietnam War]] during its duration, and Fonda would eventually become controversially active in the [[peace movement]].

The counterculture in the United States has been interpreted as lasting roughly from 1964 to 1972&lt;ref name="Reason"&gt;{{cite book|last=Riech|first=Robert|title=[[Reason: Why Liberals Will Win the Battle for America]]|year=2004|isbn=1-4000-4221-6|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf}} Chapter 1, pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;—coincident with America's involvement in Vietnam—and reached its peak in August 1969 at the Woodstock Festival, New York, characterized in part by the film ''Easy Rider'' (1969). Unconventional or psychedelic dress; political activism; public protests; campus uprisings; pacifist then loud, defiant music; drugs; [[communitarianism|communitarian experiments]], and [[sexual liberation]] were hallmarks of the sixties counterculture—most of whose members were young, white and middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "Counterculture of the 1960s," ''Criminology Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms'', CFM Research, Jul. 2012. p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the movement divided the  population. To some Americans, these attributes reflected American ideals of [[free speech]], equality, [[world peace]], and the pursuit of happiness; to others, they reflected a self-indulgent, pointlessly rebellious, unpatriotic, and destructive assault on the country's traditional [[argument from morality|moral order]]. Authorities banned the psychedelic drug [[LSD]], restricted political gatherings, and tried to enforce bans on what they considered [[obscenity]] in books, music, theater, and other media.

The counterculture has been argued  to have diminished in the early 1970s, and some have attributed two reasons for this. First, it has been suggested that the most popular of its political goals—[[civil rights]], [[civil liberties]], [[gender equality]], [[environmentalism]], and the end of the [[Vietnam War]]—were  "accomplished" (to at least  some degree); and also that its most popular social attributes—particularly a "[[wikt:live and let live|live and let live]]" mentality in personal lifestyles (the "[[sexual revolution]]")—were co-opted by mainstream society.&lt;ref name="Conscience"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beatles"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yenne|first=Bill|title=The Beatles|year=1989|isbn=0-681-00576-9|publisher=Longmeadow Press}} pp. 46-55&lt;/ref&gt; Second, a decline of idealism and [[hedonism]] occurred as many notable counterculture figures died, the rest settled into mainstream society and started their own families, and the "magic economy" of the 1960s gave way to the [[1973–75 recession|stagflation of the 1970s]]&lt;ref name="Conscience"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Krugman|title=[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]|year=2007|isbn=0-393-06069-1|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.}} Chapter 5. Economist Paul Krugman comments on the effects of the economy on the counterculture: "In fact," he argues, "you have to wonder whether the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] [[recession]] of 1969-1971 [which nearly doubled the [[unemployment rate]]] didn't do more to end the [[hippie movement]] than the killings at [[Altamont, California|Altamont]]."&lt;/ref&gt;—the latter costing many in the  middle-classes the luxury of being able to live outside conventional [[social institution]]s. The counterculture, however, continues to influence [[social movement]]s, art, music, and society in general, and the post-1973 mainstream society has been in many ways a hybrid of the 1960s establishment and counterculture.&lt;ref name="Beatles"/&gt;

The counterculture movement has been said to be rejuvenated in a way that maintains some similarities from the Counterculture of the 1960s, but it is different as well. Photographer Steve Schapiro investigated and documented these contemporary hippie communities from 2012 to 2014. He traveled the country with his son, attending festival after festival. These findings were compiled in Schapiro’s book ''Bliss: Transformational Festivals &amp; the Neo Hippie.'' One of his most valued findings was that these “Neo Hippies” experience and encourage such a spiritual commitment to the community.

===Australia===
Australia's countercultural trend followed the one burgeoning in the US, and to a lesser extend the one in Great Britain. Political scandals in the country, such as the [[disappearance of Harold Holt]], and the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975 constitutional crisis]], as well as Australia's involvement in [[Vietnam War]], led to a disillusionment or disengagement with political figures and the government. Large protests were held in the countries most populated cities such as [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]], one prominent march was held in Sydney in 1971 on [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]]. The photographer [[Roger Scott (photographer)|Roger Scott]], who captured the protest in front of the [[Queen Victoria Building]], remarked: "I knew I could make a point with my camera. It was exciting. The old conservative world was ending and a new Australia was beginning. The demonstration was almost silent. The atmosphere was electric. The protesters were committed to making their presence felt … It was clear they wanted to show the government that they were mighty unhappy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vietnam march George street|work=[[Art Gallery of New South Wales]]|date=2007|url=https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/114.1989/|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political upheaval made its way into art in the country: film, music and literature were shaped by the ongoing changes both within the country, the Southern Hemisphere and the rest of the world. Bands such as [[The Master’s Apprentices]], [[The Pink Finks]] and [[Normie Rowe &amp; The Playboys]], along with Sydney’s [[The Easybeats]], [[Billy Thorpe &amp; The Aztecs]] and [[The Missing Links]] began to emerge in the 1960s.

One of Australia's most noted literary voices of the counter-culture movement was [[Frank Moorhouse]], whose collection of short stories, ''Futility and Other Animals'', was first published in [[Sydney]] 1969.&lt;ref name="Rickard"&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Rickard|title=Australia: A Cultural History|pp=224|year=2017|publisher=[[Monash University Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-921867-60-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its "discontinuous narrative" was said to reflect the "ambience of the counter-culture".&lt;ref name="Rickard" /&gt; [[Helen Garner]]'s ''[[Monkey Grip (novel)|Monkey Grip]]'' (1977), released eight years later, is considered a classic example of the contemporary Australian novel, and captured the thriving countercultural movement in Melbourne's inner-city in the mid 1970s, specifically [[open relationships]] and recreational drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monkey grip / Helen Garner|work=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=2 April 2018|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/7045527}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PostColonial"&gt;{{cite book|title=Enyclopedia of Post-Colonial Literatures in English|pp=564|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-1-134468-48-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Garner revealed it was strongly autobiographical and based on her own diaries.&lt;ref name="PostColonial" /&gt; Additionally, from the 1960s, [[surf culture]] took rise in Australia given the abundance of beaches in the country, and this was reflected in art, from bands such as [[The Atlantics]] and novels like ''[[Puberty Blues (novel)|Puberty Blues]]'' as well as the [[Puberty Blues|film of the same name]].

===Great Britain===
Starting in the late 1960s the [[counterculture movement]] spread from the US like a wildfire.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Nelson, ''The British Counter-Culture, 1966-73: A Study of the Underground Press'' (1989) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dAuwCwAAQBAJ   excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;  Britain did not experience the intense social turmoil produced in America by the  [[Vietnam War]] and racial tensions. Nevertheless, British youth readily identified with their American counterparts' desire to cast off the older generation's social mores. The new music was a powerful weapon. In this case, it took the form of a wholesale revolt against the class system, which was now being questioned for the first time in the nation's history. Rock music, which had first been introduced from the US in the 1950s, became a key instrument in the social uprisings of the young generation and Britain soon became a groundswell of musical talent thanks to groups like [[the Beatles]], [[Rolling Stones]], [[the Who]], [[Pink Floyd]], and more in coming years.&lt;ref&gt;Steven D. Stark, ''Meet the Beatles: a cultural history of the band that shook youth, gender, and the world'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry J. Faulk, ''British rock modernism, 1967-1977: the story of music hall in rock'' (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Osgerby, ''Youth in Britain since 1945'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The antiwar movement in Britain closely collaborated with their American counterparts, supporting peasant insurgents in the Asian jungles.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia A. Ellis, "Promoting solidarity at home and abroad: the goals and tactics of the anti-Vietnam War movement in Britain." ''European Review of History: Revue européenne d’histoire 21.4'' (2014): 557-576.&lt;/ref&gt;  The  "[[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|Ban the Bomb]]" protests centered around opposition to [[nuclear weaponry]]; the campaign gave birth to what  was to  become the [[peace symbol]] of the 1960s.

=== Russia/Soviet Union===
Although not exactly equivalent to the English definition, the term ''Контркультура'' (''Kontrkul'tura'') became common in [[Russia]]n to define a 1990s [[cultural movement]] that promoted acting outside of cultural conventions: the use of explicit language; graphical descriptions of sex, violence and illicit activities; and uncopyrighted use of "safe" characters involved in such activities.

During the early 1970s, the [[Soviet government]] rigidly promoted optimism in Russian culture. Divorce and alcohol abuse were viewed as taboo by the media. However, Russian society grew weary of the gap between real life and the creative world,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} and underground culture became "forbidden fruit". General satisfaction with the quality of existing works led to parody, such as how the [[Russian joke|Russian anecdotal joke]] tradition turned the setting of ''[[War and Peace]]'' by [[Leo Tolstoy]] into a grotesque world of sexual excess. Another well-known example is [[Russian humour#Black humour|black humor]] (mostly in the form of short poems) that dealt exclusively with funny deaths and/or other mishaps of small, innocent children.

In the mid-1980s, the [[Glasnost]] policy permitted the production of less optimistic works. As a consequence, Russian cinema during the late 1980s and the early 1990s was [[action movie]]s with explicit (but not necessarily graphic) scenes of ruthless violence and social dramas about [[drug abuse]], [[prostitution]] and failing relationships. Although Russian movies of the time would be [[MPAA rating system|rated "R"]] in the United States due to violence, the use of explicit language was much milder than in American cinema.

In the late 1990s, Russian counterculture became increasingly popular on the [[Internet]]. Several websites appeared that posted user-created short stories dealing with sex, drugs and violence. The following features are considered the most popular topics in such works:

* Wide use of explicit language;
* Deliberate misspelling;
* Descriptions of drug use and consequences of abuse;
* Negative portrayals of alcohol use;
* Sex and violence: nothing is a taboo – in general, violence is rarely advocated, while all types of sex are considered good;
* [[Parody]]: media advertising, classic movies, [[popular culture|pop culture]] and children's books are considered fair game;
* Non-conformance; and
* [[Politically incorrect]] topics, mostly [[racism]], [[xenophobia]] and [[homophobia]].

A notable aspect of counterculture at the time was the influence of contra-cultural developments on Russian pop culture. In addition to traditional Russian styles of music, such as songs with jail-related lyrics, new music styles with explicit language were developed.

=== Asia ===
In the recent past, Dr. [[Sebastian Kappen]], an Indian theologian, has tried to redefine counterculture in the Asian context. In March 1990, at a seminar in Bangalore, he presented his countercultural perspectives (Chapter 4 in S. Kappen, ''Tradition, modernity, counterculture: an Asian perspective'', Visthar, Bangalore, 1994). Dr. Kappen envisages counterculture as a new culture that has to negate the two opposing cultural phenomena in Asian countries:
#invasion by Western [[capitalism|capitalist]] culture, and
#the emergence of [[revivalism|revivalist]] movements.

Kappen writes, "Were we to succumb to the first, we should be losing our identity; if to the second, ours would be a false, obsolete identity in a mental universe of dead symbols and delayed myths".

The most important countercultural movement in [[India]] had taken place in the state of [[West Bengal]] during the 1960s by a group of poets and artists who called themselves [[Hungry Generation|Hungryalists]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2967">'''Creative Participation''' is a term used in social sciences to describe the position of the observer towards the observed. ''Creative Participation'' - originally a [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] term from the 1920s for analysing social relations of cultural groupings, modified and revived by the German ethnologist [https://web.archive.org/web/20071125194659/http://www.ifeas.uni-mainz.de/info/Magisterabgeschlossen.html V. Dahlheimer]- rewrites the traditional [[participant observation]] approach and leaves more room for non-materialistic cognition. Dynamic movements which can not be measured from disconnected or relative viewpoints can be captured by means of feelings. Verification of data through creative participation is possible through practical conception only and can at best be validated by empirical means. ''Creative Participation'' seeks to counteract classical problems in social science like i.e. rigid defense of theory, personal ambition, and weight of tradition which can lead to social and personal fragmentation.

In consumer psychology ''Creative Participation'' is defined as consumers' co-creation of novel and valuable products, services, ideas, consumption experiences with firms during their purchase or consumption process. According to "Need for Uniqueness"- theory, one of consumers' motivations for creative participation may come from their need for unique products. When consumers need to acquire the symbol of distinct self by unique products, they are driven to create.

''Creative Participation'' is also used as an educational training method. It can breakdown barriers between participants (and agencies), and encourage creative problem-solving, and the building of positive relationships.

In the political world ''Creative Participation'' presents the theory and practice of innovative forms of political participation, i.e. citizens cooperate in public action to achieve a common good.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3714">The term '''cultural lag''' refers to the notion that [[culture]] takes time to catch up with technological innovations, and that [[social problems]] and conflicts are caused by this lag. Subsequently, cultural lag does not only apply to this idea only, but also relates to theory and explanation. It helps by identifying and explaining social problems to predict future problems.

As explained by James W. Woodward, when the material conditions change, changes are occasioned in the adaptive culture, but these changes in the adaptive culture do not synchronize exactly with the change in the material culture, this delay is the culture lag.&lt;ref name=Woodward&gt;Woodard, James W. "Critical Notes on the Culture Lag Concept." Social Forces 12.3 (Mar. 1934): 388-398. SocINDEX with Full Text. EBSCO. Langsdale Library, Baltimore, MD. 30 Sep. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by sociologist [[William F. Ogburn]] in his 1922 work ''Social change with respect to culture and original nature.''&lt;ref name=Ogburn&gt;Ogburn, William F. Social change: With respect to cultural and original nature. Oxford England: Delta Books, 1966. PsycINFO. EBSCO. Langsdale Library, Baltimore, MD. 30 Sep. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory of cultural lag suggests that a period of maladjustment occurs when the non-material culture is struggling to adapt to new material conditions.&lt;ref name=Schaefer&gt;Schaefer, Richard T. ''Sociology: A Brief Introduction 8th Edition.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This resonates with ideas of [[technological determinism]]. That is it can presuppose that technology has independent effects on society at large. However it does not necessarily assign causality to technology. Rather cultural lag focuses examination on the period of adjustment to new technologies. 

According to Ogburn, cultural lag is a common societal phenomenon due to the tendency of [[material culture]] to evolve and change rapidly and voluminously while non-material culture tends to resist change and remain fixed for a far longer period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Ogburn, William F. "Cultural Lag as Theory." Sociology &amp; Social Research 41.3 (Jan. 1957): 167-174. SocINDEX with Full Text. EBSCO. Langsdale Library, Baltimore, MD. 30 Sep. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the opposing nature of these two aspects of culture, adaptation of new technology becomes rather difficult. This distinction between material and non-material culture is also a contribution of Ogburn's 1922 work on social change.&lt;ref name="Ogburn"/&gt; 

Cultural lag creates problems for a society in a multitude of ways. The issue of cultural lag tends to permeate any discussion in which the implementation of some new technology is a topic. For example, the advent of stem cell research has given rise to many new, potentially beneficial medical technologies; however these new technologies have also raised serious ethical questions about the use of stem cells in medicine. Cultural lag is seen as a critical ethical issue because failure to develop broad social consensus on appropriate applications of modern technology may lead to breakdowns in social solidarity and the rise of social conflict.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;Marshall, Kimball P. "Has Technology Introduced New Ethical Problems?." Journal of Business Ethics 19.1 (n.d.): 81-90. SocINDEX with Full Text. EBSCO. Langsdale Library, Baltimore, MD. 30 Sep. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural Policy Research''' (or [[Cultural policy|Cultural Policy Studies]]) is a field of academic inquiry that grew out of [[Cultural Studies]] in the 1990s. A quarter of a century later, by now both “Cultural Policy Research” and "Cultural Policy Studies" each match almost 100 million entries in the World Wide Web.

Cultural Policy Research grew out of the idea that cultural studies should not only be critical, but also try to be useful.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Bennett, Culture, A reformer's Science, SAGE, London, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The Princeton University e.g. founded its Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies 1994 “to improve the clarity, accuracy and sophistication of discourse about the nation's artistic and cultural life.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.princeton.edu/~artspol/&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, combining social sciences, a wide range of the humanities, jurisprudence and economics. As all political sciences do, the research focuses on the content dimension ([[:en:policy|policy]]), the formal-institutional dimension ([[:en:polity|polity]]) and the practical dimension ([[:en:politics|politics]]), particularly affecting decision processes and the results obtained. Cultural Policy Research asks: What do the [[:en:Actor (policy debate)|actor]]s and [[:en:Structure and agency|agent]]s in the Cultural Policy sphere actually do when they do what they do? Which purposes they do pursue by that? What are their goals and which means do they use? What is the result of their action for society and for the citizens’ intellectual and artistic freedom?

Among the many departments of Cultural Policy Studies around the world, there are several UNESCO Chairs in Cultural Policy from the programme launched in 1992 by the [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref&gt;http://en.unesco.org/unitwin-unesco-chairs-programme&lt;/ref&gt; to promote international inter-university cooperation:

'''''Disclosing New Worlds: Entrepreneurship, Democratic Action, and the Cultivation of Solidarity''''' (1997)&lt;ref name=dnw&gt;{{cite book |title=Disclosing New Worlds: Entrepreneurship, Democratic Action, and the Cultivation of Solidarity|author1=Charles Spinosa|author2=Fernando Flores|author3=Hubert L. Dreyfus|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press USA|isbn=0-262-19381-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a philosophical proposal intended to restore or energize [[democracy]] by [[social constructionism]] via an [[argument]] style of [[world disclosure]] but which philosophy is distinct from:
*[[Relativism]] - a concept in which points of view have no absolute truth or validity.
*[[Formalism (philosophy)|Formalism]] - an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the arts, literature, or philosophy
*[[Essentialism]] - the view that, for any specific entity (such as an animal, a group of people, a physical object, a concept), there is a set of attributes which are necessary to its identity and function.

Nevertheless, the authors build on these ideas and seek to reformulate the relationship between democratic rights and economic progress when persistent  technological advance obscures an uncertain future for humanity threatened by multiple issues such as  [[peak oil]],  [[global warming]] and [[environmental degradation]]. The book is co-authored by [[Fernando Flores]],  [[Hubert Dreyfus]]  and Charles Spinosa (a consultant philosopher specializing in commercial innovation). They concentrate on three practical activities:

* [[social entrepreneurship]],
* [[active citizenship]] and
* [[solidarity|social solidarity]]

The authors reason that human beings are at their best when engaged in imaginative and practical innovation rather than in abstract reflection, and thus  challenging accepted wisdom and conventional practices within their particular environment, or as the authors claim, when they are making history. History-making, in this account, refers not to political power changes, wars or violent revolution, but to changes in the way people  understand their  personal qualities and deal with their particular situations.

==Structure of the work==
'''[[World disclosure]]''' (German: Erschlossenheit, literally development or comprehension) is a phenomenon first described by the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] in his landmark book [[Being and Time]]. As well as the authors of this work, the idea of disclosing has also been discussed by philosophers such as [[John Dewey]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. It refers to how things become intelligible and meaningfully relevant to ordinary people.

==Conclusion==
The authors reiterate the importance of history making and identify thee types of actors:
* The entrepreneur
* The virtuous citizen 
* The culture figure

Each has to overcome [[resistance to change]], but do so in different ways. Solving puzzles request of each a clear [[strategy|strategic]] objective, but use different [[tactic (method)|tactic]]s to overcome obstructions. By understanding and disclosing our objectives, and discovering the sort of role we may have to play according to particular situations to reach those goals, all of us can be "history makers" and make changes to our society by changing the shared narrative that binds our particular culture. The authors quote already changed collective attitudes which have recently become much less tolerant  of road accidents, various forms of discrimination and repressive public education of young people.

They promote a change to the overarching [[consumerism]] as the western world's social and economic order and ideology that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts, in favor of [[sustainable development]]  within individual communities as a precursor to disclosing a new world order that supports [[human equality]]

{{see also|Utopian and dystopian fiction}}
A '''dystopia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] δυσ- "bad" and τόπος "place"; alternatively, '''cacotopia''',&lt;ref name="Bentham"&gt;Cacotopia (from κακός ''kakos'' "bad") was the term used by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in his 19th century works ({{cite web|url=http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-dystopia.htm|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326062103/http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-dystopia.htm|archivedate=26 March 2006|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2006-03-19|df=}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3ye0vWc85eYC&amp;pg=PA230])&lt;/ref&gt; '''kakotopia''', or simply '''anti-utopia''') is a community or society that is undesirable or frightening.&lt;ref name=Merriam/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; It is translated as "not-good place" and is an [[antonym]] of [[utopia]], a term that was coined by [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] and figures as the title of his best known work, ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published 1516, a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime, violence and poverty.

Dystopian societies appear in many artistic works, particularly in stories [[setting (narrative)|set]] in the future. Some of the most famous examples are [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]''. Dystopias are often characterized by [[dehumanization]],&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;{{cite web|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|title=Definition of "dystopia"|year=2012|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dystopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tyrant|tyrannical]] governments, [[environmental disaster]],&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Definition of "dystopia"|year=2012|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/dystopia?q=dystopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to real-world issues regarding society, [[Environmental issues|environment]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[religion]], [[psychology]], [[ethics]], [[science]], or [[technology]]. However, some authors also use the term to refer to actually-existing societies, many of which are or have been [[totalitarian]] states, or societies in an advanced state of collapse and disintegration.

It should be noted that some scholars, such as [[Gregory Claeys]] and [[Lyman Tower Sargent]], make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias. For example, Claeys and Sargent define literary dystopias as societies imagined as substantially worse than the contemporaneous society in which the author writes, whereas '''anti-utopias''' function as criticisms of attempts to implement various concepts of utopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=24EUCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Utopia Reader|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Though several earlier usages are known, ''dystopia'' was deployed as an antonym for ''[[Utopia]]'' by [[John Stuart Mill|J. S. Mill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tisdall |first=Nigel |url=https://www.ft.com/content/2f94aa6a-a0f8-11e6-891e-abe238dee8e2 |title=Postcard from Belgium: the birthplace of utopia |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=4 November 2016 |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in one of his Parliamentary Speeches 1868&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1988 |title=Public and parliamentary speeches - Part I - November 1850 - November 1868 |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/262 |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=0-415-03791-3 |access-date=2015-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Hansard Commons'') by adding the prefix "dys" ({{lang-grc|δυσ-}} "bad"), reinterpreting the initial ''U'' as the prefix "eu" ({{lang-grc|ευ-}} "good") instead of "ou" ({{lang-grc|οὐ}} "not"). It was used to denounce the government's Irish land policy: "It is, perhaps, too complimentary to call them Utopians, they ought rather to be called dys-topians, or caco-topians. What is commonly called Utopian is something too good to be practicable; but what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable."&lt;ref name="Hermansson"&gt;[[Cf.]] [http://hem.passagen.se/replikant/dystopia_timeline.htm "Dystopia Timeline"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503015002/http://hem.passagen.se/replikant/dystopia_timeline.htm|date=3 May 2006}}, in ''Exploring Dystopia'', "edited and designed by Niclas Hermansson; Contributors: Acolyte of Death ('Gattaca'), John Steinbach ('Nuclear Nightmare'), [and] David Clements ('From Dystopia to Myopia')" (''hem.passagen.se''), Niclas Hermansson, n.d., [[World Wide Web|Web]], 22 May 2009.&lt;!--This site appears to be a self-published website and its reliability may be dubious.

"An imaginary place or condition in which everything is as bad as possible; opp. UTOPIA (cf. CACOTOPIA). So dystopian n., one who advocates or describes a dystopia; dystopian a., of or pertaining to a dystopia; dystopianism, dystopian quality or characteristics."  The example of first usage given in the ''OED'' (1989 ed.) refers to the 1868 speech by John Stuart Mill quoted above. Other examples given in the ''OED'' include:

Roth, "A Dystopia of the Spirit" 230ff., Chap. 15 in Jörn Rüsen, Michael Fehr, and Thomas Rieger, eds., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3ye0vWc85eYC&amp;pg=PA230 Thinking Utopia]'', ''[[Google Books]]'' Preview, n.d., [[World Wide Web|Web]], 22 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades before the first documented use of the word "dystopia" was "cacotopia" (using {{lang-grc|κακόs}}, "bad, wicked")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkako%2Fs κακόs], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; originally proposed in 1818 by [[Jeremy Bentham]]: "As a match for utopia (or the imagined seat of the best government) suppose a cacotopia (or the imagined seat of the worst government) discovered and described."&lt;ref name="bentham"&gt;Bentham, Jeremy. (1818). ''Plan of Parliamentary Reform, in the form of a catechism''.&lt;/ref&gt; Though dystopia became the most popular term, cacotopia finds occasional use, for example by [[Anthony Burgess]], author of ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', who said it was a better fit for Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' because "it sounds worse than dystopia".&lt;ref name="beaumont"&gt;Beaumont, Matthew. (2006). [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/elh/summary/v073/73.2beaumont.html Cacotopianism, the Paris Commune, and England's Anti-Communist Imaginary, 1870-1900]. ''ELH, 73''(2): 465-487.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Common theme==

===Politics===
In ''[[When the Sleeper Wakes]]'', [[H.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;Wells]] depicted the governing class as hedonistic and shallow.&lt;ref name=Steinhoff153&gt;William Steinhoff, "Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''" 153, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Orwell]] contrasted Wells's world to that depicted in Jack London's ''[[The Iron Heel]]'', where the dystopian rulers are brutal and dedicated to the point of fanaticism, which Orwell considered more plausible.&lt;ref name=Steinhoff147&gt;William Steinhoff, "Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''" 147, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the political principles at the root of fictional utopias (or "perfect worlds") are [[idealistic]] in principle and successfully result in positive consequences for the inhabitants,&lt;ref name="Utopia"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Utopia "Utopia"], ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', 4th ed., 2004, ''[[Dictionary.com]]'', [[World Wide Web|Web]], 11 Feb. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the political principles on which fictional dystopias are based, while often based on utopian ideals, result in negative consequences for inhabitants because of at least one [[fatal flaw]].&lt;ref name=Snodgrass&gt;[[Mary Ellen Snodgrass]], ''Encyclopedia of Utopian Literature'', ABC-Clio Literary Companion Ser. (Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio Inc., 1995) xii.  {{ISBN|0-87436-757-3}} (10).  {{ISBN|978-0-87436-757-7}} (13).&lt;!--not verified.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Dystopias are often filled with [[pessimism|pessimistic]] views of the ruling class or a government that is brutal or uncaring, ruling with an "iron hand" or "iron fist".{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Dystopian governments are sometimes ruled by a fascist regime or dictator. These dystopian government establishments often have protagonists or groups that lead a "[[Resistance movement|resistance]]" to enact change within their society, as is seen in [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]''.&lt;ref name=Donawerth&gt;Jane Donawerth, "Genre Blending and the Critical Dystopia", in ''Dark Horizons: Science Fiction and the Dystopian Imagination'', ed. Raffaella Baccolini and Tom Moylan (New York: Routledge, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dystopian political situations are depicted in novels such as ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]'', ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'', ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games]]'', ''[[Divergent (book)|Divergent]]'', and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]''; and in such films as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions]]'', ''[[Soylent Green]]'', and ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]''.

===Economics===
The economic structures of dystopian societies in literature and other media have many variations, as the economy often relates directly to the elements that the writer is depicting as the source of the oppression. However, there are several [[archetypes]] that such societies tend to follow.

A commonly occurring theme is the dichotomy of [[Planned economy|planned economies]] versus [[free market]] economies, a conflict which is found in such works as [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''Anthem'' and [[Henry Kuttner]]'s short story "The Iron Standard". Another example of this is reflected in [[Norman Jewison]]'s 1975 film ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]''.

Some dystopias, such as that of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', feature [[black market]]s with goods that are dangerous and difficult to obtain, or the characters may be totally at the mercy of the state-controlled economy. [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'' depicts a dystopia in which the centrally controlled economic system has indeed made material abundance plentiful, but deprived the mass of humanity of meaningful labor; virtually all work is menial and unsatisfying, and only a small number of the small group that achieves education is admitted to the elite and its work.&lt;ref&gt;Howard P. Segal, "Vonnegut's ''Player Piano'': An Ambiguous Technological Dystopia," 163 in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Tanith Lee]]'s ''[[Don't Bite the Sun]]'', there is no want of any kind &amp;ndash; only unabashed consumption and hedonism, leading the protagonist to begin looking for a deeper meaning to existence.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Tanith. ''Don't Bite the Sun''. Bantam Books:1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in dystopias where the economic system is not the source of the society's flaws, as in ''Brave New World'', the state often controls the economy. In ''Brave New World'', a character, reacting with horror to the suggestion of not being part of the social body, cites as a reason that everyone works for everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On Brave New World" 98, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works feature extensive [[privatization]] and [[corporatism]]; both byproducts of [[capitalism]], where privately owned and unaccountable large corporations have effectively replaced the government in setting policy and making decisions. They manipulate, infiltrate, control, bribe, are contracted by, or otherwise [[corporate republic|function as government]]. This is seen in the novels ''[[Jennifer Government]]'' and ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' and the movies ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[Visioneers]]'', ''[[Idiocracy]]'', ''Soylent Green'', ''[[THX 1138]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'' and ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]''. Corporate republics common in the [[cyberpunk]] genre, as in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' and [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (as well as the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', loosely based on Dick's novel).

====Social stratification====
Dystopian fiction frequently draws stark contrasts between the privileges of the ruling class and the dreary existence of the working classes.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In the novel ''Brave New World'', written in 1931 by [[Aldous Huxley]], a class system is prenatally designated in terms of Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons, with the lower classes having reduced brain-function and special conditioning to make them satisfied with their position in life.&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On ''Brave New World''" 95, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of this society there also exist several human settlements that still exist in the ''conventional'' way but which the class system describe as "savages".

In ''Ypsilon Minus'' by [[Herbert W. Franke]], people are divided into numerous alphabetically ranked groups.

===Family===
Some fictional dystopias, such as ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', have eradicated the family and deploy continuing efforts to keep it from re-establishing itself as a social institution. In ''Brave New World'', where children are reproduced artificially, the concepts "mother" and "father" are considered obscene.  In some novels, the State is hostile to motherhood: for example, in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', children are organized to spy on their parents; and in ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], the escape of a pregnant woman from One State is a revolt.&lt;ref name=Beauchamp&gt;Gorman Beauchamp, "Zamiatin's ''We''" 70, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Religious groups play the role of the oppressed and oppressors. In ''Brave New World'', for example, the establishment of the state included lopping off the tops of all crosses (as symbols of Christianity) to make them "T"s, (as symbols of [[Ford Model T|Henry Ford's Model T]]).&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On ''Brave New World''" 94, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]]'s novel ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', on the other hand, takes place in a future United States under a Christianity-based theocratic regime.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Atwood, ''The Handmaid's Tale'', McClelland and Stewart, 1985. {{ISBN|0-7710-0813-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest examples of this theme is [[Robert Hugh Benson]]'s ''[[Lord of the World]]'', about a futuristic world where the [[Freemasons]] have taken over the world and the only other religion left is a [[Roman Catholic]] minority.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Identity===
In the Russian novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], first published in 1921, people are permitted to live out of public view twice a week for one hour and are only referred to by numbers instead of names.

In some dystopian works, such as [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Harrison Bergeron]]'', society forces individuals to [[conformity|conform]] to radical [[egalitarian]] social norms that discourage or suppress accomplishment or even competence as forms of inequality.

===Violence===
[[Violence]] is prevalent in many dystopias, often in the form of [[war]] (e.g. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''); urban crimes led by gangs (often of teenagers) (e.g. ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''); rampant crime met by [[blood sport]]s (e.g. ''[[Battle Royale (novel)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' and ''[[Divergent (novel)|Divergent]]''). Also explained in Suzanne Berne's essay "Ground Zero", where she explains her experience with the aftermath of 11 September 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berne|first1=Suzanne|title=Patterns for College Writing|journal=Ground Zero|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature===
Fictional dystopias are commonly urban and frequently isolate their characters from all contact with the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;"Avatism and Utopia" 4, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.{{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they require their characters to avoid nature, as when walks are regarded as dangerously [[Anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] in Ray Bradbury's ''Fahrenheit 451'', as well as within Bradbury's short story "[[The Pedestrian]]."{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', science coordinated by government is directed toward the control of nature and the elimination of natural human instincts.  In ''Brave New World'', the lower classes of society are conditioned to be afraid of nature, but also to visit the countryside and consume transportation and games to promote economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|title=Brave New World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lois Lowry's "[[The Giver]]", in a manner similar to Brave New World, shows a society where technology and the desire to create a utopia has led humanity to enforce climate control on the environment, as well as to eliminate many undomesticated species, and to provide psychological and pharmaceutical repellent against basic human instincts.

Excessive pollution that destroys nature is common in many dystopian films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', and ''Soylent Green''.  A few "green" fictional dystopias do exist, such as in [[Michael Carson (author)|Michael Carson]]'s short story "[[The Punishment of Luxury]]", and [[Russell Hoban]]'s ''[[Riddley Walker]]''. The latter is set in the aftermath of nuclear war, "a post-nuclear holocaust Kent, where technology has reduced to the level of the [[Iron Age]]".&lt;ref&gt;

===Science and technology===
Contrary to the [[Technological utopianism|technologically utopian]] claims, which view technology as a beneficial addition to all aspects of humanity, technological dystopia concerns itself with and focuses largely (but not always) on the negative effects caused by new technology.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Rushkoff, D. (2002). Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative.Explorations in Media Ecology, 1(1), 21-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Typical dystopian claims====
1. ''Technologies reflect and encourage the worst aspects of human nature.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
[[Jaron Lanier]], a digital pioneer, has become a technological dystopian. “I think it’s a way of interpreting technology in which people forgot taking responsibility,” he says.

“‘Oh, it’s the computer that did it, not me.’ ‘There’s no more middle class? Oh, it’s not me. The computer did it’” (Lanier). This quote explains that people begin to not only blame the technology for the changes in lifestyle but also believe that technology is an omnipotence. It also points to a technological determinist perspective in terms of reification.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, D. (2013, July 3). Technological or Media Determinism. Retrieved March 2, 2015, from http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/tecdet/tdet05.html&lt;/ref&gt;

2. ''Technologies harm our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Rosenbaum, R. (2013, January 1). What Turned Jaron Lanier Against the Web? Retrieved March 2, 2015, from http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/what-turned-jaron-lanier-against-the-web-165260940/?all&amp;no-ist&lt;/ref&gt;''
* decrease in communication within family members and friend groups due to increased time in technology use
* virtual space misleadingly heightens the impact of real presence; people resort to technological medium for communication nowadays

3. ''Technologies reinforce hierarchies - concentrate knowledge and skills; increase surveillance and erode privacy; widen inequalities of power and wealth; giving up control to machines). ''
[[Douglas Rushkoff]], a technological utopian, states in his article that the professional designers “re-mystified” the computer so it wasn’t so readable anymore; users had to depend on the special programs built into the software that was incomprehensible for normal users.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

4. ''New technologies are sometimes regressive (worse than previous technologies).&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''

5. ''The unforeseen impacts of technology are negative.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
“ ‘The most common way is that there’s some magic artificial intelligence in the sky or in the cloud or something that knows how to translate, and what a wonderful thing that this is available for free. But there’s another way to look at it, which is the technically true way: You gather a ton of information from real live translators who have translated phrases… It’s huge but very much like Facebook, it’s selling people back to themselves… [With translation] you’re producing this result that looks magical but in the meantime, the original translators aren’t paid for their work… You’re actually shrinking the economy.’”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

6. ''More efficiency and choices can harm our quality of life (by causing stress, destroying jobs, making us more materialistic).&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Heitman, B. (2011, April 13). The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood.(Books)(Book review). The Christian Science Monitor, 146-150.&lt;/ref&gt;''
In his article “Prest-o! Change-o!,” technological dystopian James Gleick mentions the remote control being the classic example of technology that does not solve the problem “it is meant to solve.” Gleick quotes Edward Tenner, a historian of technology, that the ability and ease of switching channels by the remote control serves to increase distraction for the viewer. Then it is only expected that people will become more dissatisfied with the channel they are watching.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

7. ''New technologies cannot solve problems of old technologies or just create new problems.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
The remote control example explains this claim as well, for the increase in laziness and dissatisfaction levels was clearly not a problem in times without the remote control. He also takes social psychologist Robert Levine’s example of Indonesians “‘whose main entertainment consists of watching the same few plays and dances, month after month, year after year,’ and with Nepalese Sherpas who eat the same meals of potatoes and tea through their entire lives. The Indonesians and Sherpas are perfectly satisfied.” Because of the invention of the remote control, it merely created more problems.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

8. ''Technologies destroy nature (harming human health and the environment). ''
The need for business replaced community and the “story online” replaced people as the “soul of the Net.” Because information was now able to be bought and sold, there was not as much communication taking place.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Dystopias typically reflect contemporary sociopolitical realities and extrapolate worst-case scenarios as warnings for necessary social change or caution.&lt;ref name=theguardian1&gt;{{cite web|title=Dystopian stories used to reflect our anxieties.

In a 1967 study [[Frank Kermode]] suggests that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode. Christopher Schmidt notes that while the world goes to waste for future generations we distract ourselves from disaster by passively watching it as entertainment.&lt;ref name=jstor1/&gt;

You grow up in a world where it's part of the conversation all the time – the statistics of [[global warming|our planet warming up]]. The environment is changing. The weather is different. There are things that are very visceral and very obvious, and they make you question the future and how we will survive. It's so much a part of everyday life that young people inevitably — consciously or not — are questioning their futures and how the Earth will be. I certainly do. I wonder what kind of world my children's kids will live in."&lt;ref name=time1/&gt;

Some have commented on this trend, saying that "it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the [[post-capitalism|end of capitalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Stephen|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Greg|title=From Belfast to Bamako: Cinema in the Era of Capitalist Realism|journal=Ireland and Cinema|date=1 January 2015|pages=107–116|doi=10.1057/9781137496362_10|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaviro|first1=Steven|title=Post Cinematic Affect|publisher=John Hunt Publishing|isbn=9781846944314|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=MetRyPdbh9QC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Kieran|title=Marx and the Alternative to Capitalism|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc.|isbn=9781312382626|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=khVdCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT94|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hassler-Forest|first1=Dan|title=Capitalist Superheroes: Caped Crusaders in the Neoliberal Age|publisher=John Hunt Publishing|isbn=9781780991795|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=xFMEjZW-XTEC&amp;pg=PA207|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pueblo01.png|thumb|350px|Location of '''Eight Northern Pueblos''' and neighboring pueblos in New Mexico]]
The '''Eight Northern Pueblos''' of [[New Mexico]] are [[Taos Pueblo|Taos]], [[Picuris Pueblo, New Mexico|Picuris]], [[Santa Clara Pueblo, New Mexico|Santa Clara]], [[Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo|Ohkay Owingeh]] (formerly San Juan), [[San Ildefonso Pueblo, New Mexico|San Ildefonso]], [[Nambé Pueblo|Nambé]], [[Pojoaque Pueblo|Pojoaque]], and [[Tesuque, New Mexico|Tesuque]]. 

Taos and Picuris are [[Tiwa language|Tiwa]]-speaking [[pueblo]]s; the rest speak [[Tewa language|Tewa]].  Tiwa and Tewa are closely related languages of the [[Tanoan language]] family.  These pueblos make up the ''Eight Northern Pueblos Council'', which sponsors craft fairs, advocates for the legal interests of the pueblos, etc. The Capital of the Eight Northern Pueblos is located in [[Ohkay Owingeh]]. Ohkay Owingeh was formerly known as San Juan, but changed to its original Tewa name in 2005.

'''''Encyclopedia of White Power: A Sourcebook on the Radical Racist Right''''' is a [[reference work|reference book]] edited by [[Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|Jeffrey Kaplan]].  It focuses on the [[White nationalism#White power|White Power]] movement, mainly United States groups and individuals (with a few Norwegian and [[Sweden|Swedish]] groups and individuals also included).

In addition to contributions by academics, it includes entries by far-right-wing people, as well as a section of [[primary sources]].  Kaplan's criteria for inclusion was that "the movements and individuals should be (i) strongly [[Racism|racialist]], (ii) [[revolution]]ary, and (iii) have a strong religious streak."  He approached contributors with the requirement that the authors "write an entry that would 'neither demonize nor proselytize, but would leave an accurate and unbiased historical record.'"  It contains analysis of the organizations and philosophies in the white power movement and the inter-relationships that exist between the movement's leaders and groups. It was published by [[Altamira Press]], a division of [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.]], as a 585-page hardcover in 2000 ({{ISBN|0-7425-0340-2}}).

==Quotation==
{{quote|The demonization of the radical right ill serves us when now, more than ever before, it is vitally important to know all we can about this esoteric milieu's nature and potentialities.

Moreover, at the end of this quest, I did find something even more remarkable than the fact that "we" and "they" are both human beings and have important commonalties. This discovery was more unsettling still, for just as Doug Milford had warned, I found that there IS genuine evil in the world. It is rare. It is subtle. But it ''is'' real.

By demonizing the many, we cloak the few, and, however unwittingly, ourselves facilitate the existence of evil in the world.

==Overview==
Each author has recorded the subjective experiences of various persons in violent environments and surroundings. These are the perspectives of the offenders, victims, noncombatants, soldiers, insurgents, black marketers, heroes, scavengers and researchers. Articles also show how anthropologists are often compelled to create innovative data gathering strategies when working in the midst of dangerous environments.

'''Harry Underwood''' (1969) is a painter known for his use of stenciled images and literary elements atop wood panels. His pictures are painted with house paints and written upon with ordinary No. 2 pencils. His subjects are an eclectic mix of realism, surrealism, pop art and invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry has been labelled an [[outsider artist]], a pop artist, and a folk artist. However, unlike most folk artists, his paintings are carefully planned often taking months prior to their execution. One critic said of the detailed planning that goes into Harry's work that "what results is more a cocktail of realism, surrealism, and pop, of [[Edward Hopper]] meets [[Salvador Dali]] meets [[Andy Warhol]]."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is popularly known by his first name "Harry", and distinctively signs his paintings with this moniker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nolan |first1=Joe |title=Harry Underwood at Estel Gallery |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/arts-culture/article/13017001/harry-underwood-at-estel-gallery |website=Nashville Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Harry Underwood was born in 1969 in Miami, FL. His father was a carpenter and his mother worked in a supermarket. His family was deeply religious and he attended the Church of God pentecostal church with them until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Harry cleaned pools at motels and bussed tables at the Capri Italian Restaurant in Florida City, FL. He was uprooted by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992 and spent time in Austin, TX and New Orleans, LA before settling in Nashville, TN where he found work in the construction industry. He began painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry's work is infused with romanticism and an undercurrent of nostalgia for a life not necessarily experienced, but wished for. Repeated images flesh out his work; bathing beauties, motel pools, vintage cars, commercial signs, palm trees, old bicycles, and dancing couples. There is a sense of mid-twentieth century Americana in his works which evokes nostalgia or longing for the vacation one never got to take, or the life one might have lived in the past, with touches of irony and commercialization that relate to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Harry Underwood |url=https://www.justfolk.com/product-category/outsider-art/underwood/ |website=Just Folk |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Harry first started painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer and house painter in Nashville, TN. He discovered his color palette while going through half-used paint cans in the garage of a house at which he was working.

His first major solo show was titled "A Pictorial History of Wishful Thinking" and hosted by the Estel Gallery in Nashville, TN in 2007. Since then, his work has been exhibited at numerous leading galleries and institutions across the United States, United Kingdom, and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response to "Outsider Artist" Label ==

Though labeled an outsider artist, Harry avoids the term. When asked about it once by a University of North Carolina (Wilmington) researcher, he answered "I don’t think of that label as having anything to do with my vision or how I approach work each day. I don’t consider myself part of a movement. I wasn’t aware of artists like Darger or Edward Hopper until I was meeting people at my shows and they began telling me I reminded them of all that. Persistence is what making art is about. The world is designed to wreck your imagination. I don’t expect I’ll be tied to folk art forever. It wouldn’t be bad if I was. A friend recently called it “Americana,” and I kind of like that." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Louise Smith |first1=Emily |title=A Conversation with Harry Underwood |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/464134/pdf |website=John Hopkins University |publisher=University of North Carolina, Wilmington |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Heritage Council''' ({{lang-ga|An Comhairle Oidhreachta}}) is an organisation created by the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] government to "engage, educate and advocate to develop a wider understanding of the vital contribution that our heritage makes to our social, environmental and economic well-being."&lt;ref name="bom"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/about-us/about-us/ | title=About us | publisher=The Heritage Council | work=Web site | date=February 2012 | accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heritage Council was established under the Heritage Act of 1995.&lt;ref name="bom"/&gt;

The Council's purview includes [[monuments]], [[archaeology|archaeological objects]], heritage objects such as [[art]] and [[industry|industrial works]], documents and [[genealogy|genealogical records]], [[architecture|architectural heritage]], [[flora (plants)|flora]], [[fauna (animals)|fauna]], wildlife habitats, landscapes, seascapes, wrecks, geology, heritage gardens, parks and inland waterways.&lt;ref name="web"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0809/1224321790005.html | title=Political courage required to save Heritage Council | publisher=The Irish Times | date=9 August 2012 | accessdate=October 19, 2012 | author=Woodworth, Paddy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heritage Council organizes the annual [[Heritage Week]] in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritageweek.ie/ Heritage Week], Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt; It also has a grants scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meath.ie/LocalAuthorities/Heritage/HeritageFunding/HeritageCouncilGrantsScheme/ Heritage Council Grants Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127135433/http://meath.ie/LocalAuthorities/Heritage/HeritageFunding/HeritageCouncilGrantsScheme/ |date=2010-11-27 }}, [http://www.meath.ie/ Meath County Council], Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Heritage Council formed the [http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/projects/irish-walled-towns-network Irish Walled Towns Network] (IWTN).&lt;ref&gt; Michael Starrett, [https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/blueprint-for-revitalising-irish-towns-1.2403658 "Blueprint for revitalising Irish towns"], ''Irish Times'', October 2015 &lt;/ref&gt; The role of the IWTN is to help the walled towns of Ireland become better places in which to live, work and visit. The network does this through providing grants for medieval town wall repairs, secondly, by providing grants for community festivals and heritage interpretation, thirdly, training community groups on how best to use their place's heritage and finally, by coordinating research and publishing advisory documents. In 2013, the IWTN's education programme won the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage/Europa Nostra Award. The 29 member towns of the network are: Athenry, Athlone, Athy, Bandon, Buttevant, Carlingford, Carrickfergus, Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel, Castledermot, Clonmel, Cork City, Derry-Londonderry City, Drogheda, Dublin City, Fethard, Galway City, Kells, Kildare Town, Kilkenny City, Kilmallock, Limerick City, Loughrea, New Ross, Rindoon, Trim, Waterford, Wexford Town and Youghal.

'''Integral humanism''' Integral Humanism was a set of concepts drafted by [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]] as political program and adopted in 1965 as the official doctrine of the [[Jan Sangh]].&lt;ref name=hansen84&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Thomas |title=The Saffron Wave: Democracy and Hindu nationalism in modern India |date=1999 |publisher=NJ: Princeton University Press|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/6652.html|page=84|archiveurl= https://archive.org/stream/ThomasBlomHansenTheSaffronWaveDemocracyABookZZ.org_201803/%5BThomas_Blom_Hansen%5D_The_Saffron_Wave_Democracy_a%28BookZZ.org%29_djvu.txt | archivedate= 2 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upadhyaya borrowed the [[Gandhian economics|Gandhian principles]] such as [[sarvodaya]] (progress of all), [[swadeshi]] (Indianisation), and [[Gandhism#Antecedents|Gram Swaraj]] (village self rule) and these principles were appropriated selectively to give more importance to cultural-national values. These values were based on an individual's undisputed subservience to nation as a corporate entity. Richard Fox has characterised this as "ideological hijacking" and a "transplant" that was designed with a purpose to appropriate the authority that the Gandhian idioms had on Indian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rao |first=Nitya |chapter=Social justice and gender rights |editor1=Katharine Adeney |editor2=Lawrence Saez |title=Coalition Politics and Hindu Nationalism |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1134239785 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sll_AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT178 |pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Golwalkar believed in the concept of [[Organicism]], from which the Integral Humanism was not very different. In Integral Humanism, Golwalkar's thoughts were supplemented by appropriating major Gandhian principles and presented as version of Hindu Nationalism. The objective of this version was to erase the image of Jan Sangh from 'communal' and modify it to a milder, spiritual, and non aggressive image that favours equality in society. The creation and adoption of these concepts helped to suit the major discourses in the Indian political arena of 1960s and 1970s. This highlighted efforts to portray the Jan Sangh and Hindu nationalist movement as a high profile right fringe of the Indian political mainstream. A major change here in compared to Golwalkar's works was the use of the word "Bhartiya" which Richard Fox had translated as "Hindian", combination of Hindu Indian. Due to the official secularism in politics, it had become impossible to invoke explicit reference to "Hindu" and the usage of the word Bhartiya allowed to circumvent this political reality.&lt;ref name=hansen85&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Thomas |title=The Saffron Wave: Democracy and Hindu nationalism in modern India |date=1999 |publisher=NJ: Princeton University Press|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/6652.html|page=85|archiveurl= https://archive.org/stream/ThomasBlomHansenTheSaffronWaveDemocracyABookZZ.org_201803/%5BThomas_Blom_Hansen%5D_The_Saffron_Wave_Democracy_a%28BookZZ.org%29_djvu.txt | archivedate= 2 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upadhyaya considered that it was of utmost importance for India to develop an indigenous economic model with human being at center stage. This approach made this concept different from [[Socialism]] and [[Capitalism]]. Integral Humanism was adopted as Jan Sangh's political doctrine and its new openness to other opposition forces made it possible for the hindu nationalist movement to have an alliance in the early 1970s with the prominent Gandhian [[Sarvodaya#Sarvodaya_movement|Sarvodaya movement]] going on under the leadership of [[J. P. Narayan]]. This was considered as the first major public breakthrough for the hindu nationalist movement.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|p=85}}&lt;ref&gt;http://180.179.170.85/en/about-the-party/philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
According to Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, the primary concern in India should be to develop an indigenous development model that has human beings as its core focus.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|p=85}} 

It is opposed to both western [[capitalist]] [[individualism]] and [[Marxism|Marxist socialism]], though welcoming to [[western science]].{{sfn|Gosling|2001|p=124}} It seeks a middle ground between capitalism and socialism, evaluating both systems on their respective merits, while being critical of their excesses and alienness.{{sfn|Téatreault|2004|p=122}}

===Four objectives of humankind===
Humankind, according to Upadhyaya, had four hierarchically organized attributes of [[Human body|body]], [[mind]], [[intellect]] and [[soul]] which corresponded to the four universal objectives of [[dharma]] (moral duties), [[artha]] (wealth), [[kama]] (desire or satisfaction), and [[moksha]] (total liberation or 'salvation'). While none could be ignored, dharma is the 'basic', and moksha the 'ultimate' objective of humankind and society. He claimed that the problem with both [[capitalist]] and [[socialist]] ideologies is that they only consider the needs of body and mind, and were hence based on the materialist objectives of desire and wealth.{{sfn|Bhatt|2001|p=155}}

===Rejection of individualism===
Upadhyaya rejected social systems in which individualism 'reigned supreme'. He also rejected communism in which individualism was 'crushed' as part of a 'large heartless machine'. Society, according to Upadhyaya, rather than arising from a [[social contract]] between individuals, was fully born at its inception itself as a natural living organism with a definitive 'national soul' or 'ethos' and its needs of the social organism paralleled those of the individual.{{sfn|Bhatt|2001|p=155}}

==Origins==

===Advaita Vedanta===
Upadhyaya was of the opinion that Integral Humanism followed the tradition of [[advaita]] developed by [[Adi Sankara]]. [[Non-dualism]] represented the unifying principle of every object in the universe, and of which humankind was a part. This, claimed Upadhyaya, was the essence and contribution of Indian culture.{{sfn|Bhatt|2001|p=154-155}}

===Gandhi===
Integral humanism is almost an exact paraphrase of Gandhi's vision of a future India. Both seek a distinctive path for India, both reject the [[materialism]] of socialism and capitalism alike, both reject the individualism of modern society in favor of a holistic, varna-dharma based community, both insist upon an infusion of religious and moral values in politics, and both seek a culturally authentic mode of modernization that preserves [[Hindu values]].{{sfn|Nanda|2003|p=217}}

Integral humanism contains visions organized around two themes: morality in politics and [[swadeshi]], and small-scale industrialization in economies, all [[Gandhian]] in their general thematic but distinctly [[Hindu nationalist]]. These notions revolve around the basic themes of harmony, primacy of cultural-national values, and discipline.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|p=85}}{{sfn|Marty|1993|p=418}}

==Contrast with Nehruvian economic policies==
Upadhyaya rejects [[Nehruvian]] economic policies and industrialization on the grounds that they were borrowed uncritically from the West, in disregard of the cultural and spiritual heritage of the country. There is a need, according to Upadhyaya, to strike a balance between the Indian and Western thinking in view of the dynamic nature of the society and the cultural heritage of the country. The Nehruvian model of economic development, emphasizing the increase of material wealth through rapid industrialization, promoted [[consumerism]] in Indian society. Not only has this ideology of development created social disparities and regional imbalances in economic growth, but it has failed to alleviate poverty in the country. The philosophy of integral humanism, like Gandhism, opposes unbridled consumerism, since such an ideology is alien to Indian culture. This traditional culture stresses putting restraints on one's desires and advocates contentment rather than ruthless pursuit of material wealth.{{sfn|Malik|1994|p=16}}

'''Intercultural communication''' (or [[cross-cultural communication|'''cross-cultural communication''']]) is a discipline that studies [[communication]] across different [[culture]]s and [[social group]]s, or how culture affects communication. It describes the wide range of communication processes and problems that naturally appear within an organization or social context made up of individuals from different religious, social, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. In this sense it seeks to understand how people from different countries and cultures act, communicate and [[perception|perceive]] the world around them. Many people in intercultural business communication argue that culture determines how individuals encode messages, what medium they choose for transmitting them, and the way messages are interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauring|first=Jakob|title=Intercultural Organizational Communication: The Social Organizing of Interaction in International Encounters|journal=Journal of Business and Communication|year=2011|volume=48 |issue=3|pages=231–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
With regard to intercultural communication proper, it studies situations where people from different cultural backgrounds ''interact''. Aside from language, intercultural communication focuses on social attributes, thought patterns, and the cultures of different groups of people. It also involves understanding the different cultures, languages and customs of people from other countries. Intercultural communication plays a role in [[social science]]s such as [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[communication studies]]. Intercultural communication is also referred to as the base for international businesses. Several cross-cultural service providers assist with the development of intercultural communication skills. Research is a major part of the development of intercultural communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://communication-design.net/3-tips-for-effective-global-communication// | title=3 Tips For Effective Global Communication | date=April 9, 2010 | author=Drary, Tom | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413232213/http://communication-design.net/3-tips-for-effective-global-communication// | archivedate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/intercultural-communication// |title=Intercultural Communication Law &amp; Legal Definition |publisher=Definitions.uslegal.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity and culture are also studied within the discipline of communication to analyze how globalization influences ways of thinking, beliefs, values, and identity, within and between cultural environments. Intercultural communication scholars approach theory with a dynamic outlook and do not believe culture can be measured nor that cultures share universal attributes. Scholars acknowledge that culture and communication shift along with societal changes and theories should consider the constant shifting and nuances of society.

The study of intercultural communication requires intercultural understanding, which is an ability to understand and value cultural differences. Language is an example of an important cultural component that is linked to intercultural understanding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Saint-Jacques, Bernard. 2011. “Intercultural Communication in a Globalized World.” In Intercultural Communication: A Reader, edited by Larry A. Samovar, Richard E. Porter, and Edwin R. McDaniel, 13 edition, 45-53. Boston, Mass: Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Intercultural communication'' is in a way the 'interaction with speakers of other languages on equal terms and respecting their identities'.&lt;ref&gt;Byram, Gribkova &amp; Starkey, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of interest ==

=== Cross-cultural business communication ===
Cross-cultural business communication is very helpful in building cultural intelligence through coaching and training in cross-cultural communication management and facilitation, cross-cultural negotiation, multicultural conflict resolution, customer service, business and organizational communication. Cross-cultural understanding is not just for incoming expats. Cross-cultural understanding begins with those responsible for the project and reaches those delivering the service or content.  The ability to communicate, negotiate and effectively work with people from other cultures is vital to international business.

====Management====
Important points to consider:

* Develop cultural sensitivity
* Anticipate the meaning the receiver will get.
* Careful encoding
* Use words, pictures, and gestures.
* Avoid slang, idioms, regional sayings.
* Selective transmission 
* Build relationships, face-to-face if possible.
* Careful decoding of feedback
* Get feedback from multiple parties.
* Improve listening and observation skills.
* Follow-up actions

====Facilitation====
There is a connection between a person's personality traits and the ability to adapt to the host-country's environment—including the ability to communicate within that environment.

Two key personality traits are openness and resilience. Openness includes traits such as tolerance for ambiguity, extrovertedness, and open-mindedness. Resilience includes having an internal locus of control, persistence, tolerance for ambiguity, and resourcefulness.

These factors, combined with the person's cultural and racial identity and level of preparedness for change, comprise that person's potential for adaptation.

=== Cultural&amp;nbsp;perceptions ===
There are common conceptualizations of attributes that define [[Collectivism|collectivistic]] and [[Individualism|individualistic]] cultures. Operationalizing the perceptions of cultural identities works under the guise that cultures are static and homogeneous, when in fact cultures within nations are multi-ethnic and individuals show high variation in how cultural differences are internalized and expressed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Globalization ===
[[Globalization]] plays a central role in theorizing for mass communication, media, and cultural communication studies.&lt;ref&gt;Crofts Wiley, Stephen B. 2004. “Rethinking Nationality in the Context of Globalization.” Communication Theory 14 (1):78–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Intercultural communication scholars emphasize that globalization emerged from the increasing diversity of cultures throughout the world and thrives with the removal of cultural barriers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The notion of nationality, or the construction of national space, is understood to emerge dialectically through communication and globalization.

The Intercultural Praxis Model by Kathryn Sorrells, PH.D shows us how to navigate through the complexities of cultural differences along with power differences. This model will help you understand who you are as an individual, and how you can better communicate with others that may be different from you. In order to continue living in a globalized society one can use this Praxis model to understand cultural differences (based on race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, etc.) within the institutional and historical systems of power. Intercultural Communication Praxis Model requires us to respond to someone who comes from a different culture than us, in the most open way we can. The media are influential in what we think of other cultures and also what we think about our own selves. However it is important, we educate ourselves, and learn how to communicate with others through Sorrells Praxis Model.[https://www.csun.edu/sites/default/files/field_download/page/Difficult%20Dialogues%20Learning%20Activity%20-%20Kathryn%20Sorrells.pdf]

== Problems ==
The problems in intercultural communication usually come from problems in message transmission and in reception. In communication between people of the same culture, the person who receives the message interprets it based on values, beliefs, and expectations for behavior similar to those of the person who sent the message. When this happens, the way the message is interpreted by the receiver is likely to be fairly similar to what the speaker intended. However, when the receiver of the message is a person from a different culture, the receiver uses information from his or her culture to interpret the message. The message that the receiver interprets may be very different from what the speaker intended.

Nonverbal communication has been shown to account for between 65% and 93% of interpreted communication.&lt;ref name="Samovar Larry 2006. pp13"&gt;Samovar Larry, Porter Richard, McDaniel Edwin, Roy Carolyn. 2006. Intercultural Communication A Reader. Nonverbal Communication. pp13.&lt;/ref&gt; Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause mistrust and misperception of the situation among cross-cultural parties. This is where nonverbal communication can cause problems with intercultural communication. Misunderstandings with nonverbal communication can lead to miscommunication and insults with cultural differences. For example, a handshake in one culture may be recognized as appropriate, whereas another culture may recognize it as rude or inappropriate.&lt;ref name="Samovar Larry 2006. pp13" /&gt;

Effective communication depends on the informal understandings among the parties involved that are based on the trust developed between them. When trust exists, there is implicit understanding within communication, cultural differences may be overlooked, and problems can be dealt with more easily. The meaning of trust and how it is developed and communicated vary across societies. Similarly, some cultures have a greater propensity to be trusting than others.

==Theories==
The following types of theories can be distinguished in different strands: focus on effective outcomes, on accommodation or adaption, on [[identity negotiation]] and management, on [[communication network]]s,on [[acculturation]] and [[Adjustment disorder|adjustment]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Gudykunst 2003 for an overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social engineering effective outcomes ===
*Cultural convergence
**In a relatively closed social system in which communication among members is unrestricted, the system as a whole will tend to ''converge'' over time toward a state of greater cultural ''uniformity''. The system will tend to diverge toward diversity when communication is restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid, D. L. (1988). The convergence theory of intercultural communication. In Y. Y. Kim &amp; W. B. Gudykunst (Eds.), Theories in intercultural communication (pp. 280–298). Newbury Park, CA: Sage. p.289&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Communication accommodation theory]]
**This theory focuses on linguistic strategies to decrease or increase communicative distances.Communication accommodation theory seeks to explain and predict why, when, and how people adjust their communicative behavior during social interaction, and what social consequences result from these adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1002/9781118540190.wbeic006|chapter=Communication Accommodation Theory|title=The International Encyclopedia of Interpersonal Communication|pages=1–21|year=2015|last1=Dragojevic|first1=Marko|last2=Gasiorek|first2=Jessica|last3=Giles|first3=Howard|isbn=9781118540190|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/306556/files/2007_gilesogay_cat.pdf|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Intercultural adaption
**Intercultural adaptation involves learned communicative competence. Communicative competence is defined as thinking, feeling, and pragmatically behaving in ways defined as appropriate by the dominant mainstream culture. Communication competence is an outcomes based measure conceptualized as functional/operational conformity to environmental criteria such as working conditions. Beyond this, adaptation means "the need to conform" to mainstream "objective reality" and "accepted modes of experience".&lt;ref name="Gudykunst, W. 2003"&gt;Gudykunst, W. &amp; Kim, Y. Y. (2003). Communicating with strangers: An approach to intercultural communication, 4th ed., 378. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;  
*[[Co-cultural communication theory|Co-cultural theory]]
**In its most general form, co-cultural communication refers to interactions among underrepresented and dominant group members.&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, 1998. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Co-cultures include but are not limited to people of color, women, people with disabilities, gay men and lesbians, and those in the lower social classes. Co-cultural theory, as developed by Mark P. Orbe, looks at the strategic ways in which co-cultural group members communicate with others. In addition, a co-cultural framework provides an explanation for how different persons communicate based on six factors.

===Identity negotiation or management===
*[[Identity management theory]]
*[[Identity negotiation]]
*Cultural identity theory
*[[Double-swing model]]

=== Communication networks ===
*Networks and outgroup communication competence
*[[Intracultural]] versus intercultural networks
*Networks and acculturation

=== Acculturation and adjustment ===
*Communication acculturation
**This theory attempts to portray "cross-cultural adaptation as a collaborative effort in which a stranger and the receiving environment are engaged in a joint effort."&lt;ref&gt;Kim Y.Y.(1995), p.192&lt;/ref&gt;
*Anxiety/Uncertainty management
**When strangers communicate with hosts, they experience uncertainty and anxiety. Strangers need to manage their uncertainty as well as their anxiety in order to be able to communicate effectively with hosts and then to try to develop accurate predictions and explanations for hosts' behaviors.
*[[Cultural assimilation|Assimilation]], [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]], and [[Social alienation|alienation]] states
**Assimilation and adaption are not permanent outcomes of the adaption process; rather, they are temporary outcomes of the communication process between hosts and immigrants. "Alienation or assimilation, therefore, of a group or an individual, is an outcome of the relationship between deviant behavior and neglectful communication."&lt;ref&gt;Mc.Guire and Mc.Dermott, 1988, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;
*Assimilation
** Assimilation is the process of absorbing the traits of the dominant culture to the point where the group that was assimilated becomes indistinguishable from the host culture. Assimilation can be either forced or done voluntarily depending on situations and conditions. Regardless of the situation or the condition it is very rare to see a minority group replace and or even forget their previous cultural practices.&lt;ref name="Assimilation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pauls|first1=Elizabeth|title=Assimilation|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/assimilation-society|website=www.britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alienation
** Alienation  frequently refers to someone who is ostracized or withdrawn from other people with whom they would ordinarily be expected to associate with. Hajda, a representative theorist and researcher of social alienation says: " alienation is an individuals feeling of uneasiness or discomfort which reflects his exclusion or self-exclusion from social and cultural participation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Giffin|first1=Kim|title=Social alienation by communicaton denial|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=56|issue=4|pages=347–357|doi=10.1080/00335637009383022|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theories===
* [[Meaning of meanings theory]] – "A misunderstanding takes place when people assume a word has a direct connection with its referent. A common past reduces misunderstanding. Definition, metaphor, feedforward, and Basic English are partial linguistic remedies for a lack of shared experience."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Face negotiation theory]] – "Members of collectivistic, high-context cultures have concerns for mutual face and inclusion that lead them to manage conflict with another person by avoiding, obliging, or compromising. Because of concerns for self-face and autonomy, people from individualistic, low-context cultures manage conflict by dominating or through problem solving"&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Standpoint theory]] – An individual's experiences, knowledge, and communication behaviors are shaped in large part by the social groups to which they belong. Individuals sometimes view things similarly, but other times have very different views in which they see the world. The ways in which they view the world are shaped by the experiences they have and through the social group they identify themselves to be a part of.&lt;ref&gt;[[Social group]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, P. H. (1990). Black feminist thought: Knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment. Boston: Unwin Hyman.&lt;/ref&gt; "Feminist standpoint theory claims that the social groups to which we belong shape what we know and how we communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 2005 {{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory is derived from the Marxist position that economically oppressed classes can access knowledge unavailable to the socially privileged and can generate distinctive accounts, particularly knowledge about social relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://read.amazon.com/?asin=B00DG8M7EU | title=Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice | publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc | year=2013 | isbn=978-1412927444 | edition=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stranger theory]] – At least one of the persons in an intercultural encounter is a stranger.  Strangers are a 'hyperaware' of cultural differences and tend to overestimate the effect of cultural identity on the behavior of people in an alien society, while blurring individual distinctions.
* [[Feminist genre theory]] – Evaluates communication by identifying feminist speakers and reframing their speaking qualities as models for women's liberation.
* [[Genderlect theory]] – "Male-female conversation is cross-cultural communication. Masculine and feminine styles of discourse are best viewed as two distinct cultural dialects rather than as inferior or superior ways of speaking. Men's report talk focuses on status and independence. Women's support talk seeks human connection."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin (2000), p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cultural critical studies theory]] – The theory states that the mass media impose the dominant ideology on the rest of society, and the connotations of words and images are fragments of ideology that perform an unwitting service for the ruling elite.
* [[Marxism]] – aims to explain class struggle and the basis of social relations through economics.

==History of assimilation==
* Forced assimilation was very common in the European colonial empires the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Colonial policies regarding religion conversion, the removal of children, the division of community property, and the shifting of gender roles primarily impacted North and South America, Australia, Africa, and Asia. 
Voluntary assimilation has also been a part of history dating back to the Spanish Inquisition of the late 14th and 15th centuries, when many Muslims and Jews voluntarily converted to Roman Catholicism as a response to religious prosecution while secretly continuing their original practices. Another example is when the Europeans moved to the United States.&lt;ref name="Assimilation"/&gt;

== Intercultural competence ==

Intercultural communication is competent when it accomplishes the objectives in a manner that is appropriate to the context and relationship. Intercultural communication thus needs to bridge the dichotomy between appropriateness and effectiveness:&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt; Proper means of intercultural communication leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/| title=Facts and Figures| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Appropriateness:''' Valued rules, norms, and expectations of the relationship are not violated significantly.
*'''Effectiveness:''' Valued goals or rewards (relative to costs and alternatives) are accomplished.

'''Competent communication''' is an interaction that is seen as effective in achieving certain rewarding objectives in a way that is also related to the context in which the situation occurs. In other words, it is a conversation with an achievable goal that is used at an appropriate time/location.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"&gt;(Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components===

Intercultural communication can be linked with identity, which means the competent communicator is the person who can affirm others' avowed identities. As well as goal attainment is also a focus within intercultural competence and it involves the communicator to convey a sense of communication appropriateness and effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

Ethnocentrism plays a role in intercultural communication. The capacity to avoid ethnocentrism is the foundation of intercultural communication competence. Ethnocentrism is the inclination to view one's own group as natural and correct, and all others as aberrant.

People must be aware that to engage and fix intercultural communication there is no easy solution and there is not only one way to do so. Listed below are some of the components of intercultural competence.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

* Context: A judgment that a person is competent is made in both a relational and situational context.This means that competence is not defined as a single attribute, meaning someone could be very strong in one section and only moderately good in another. Situationally speaking competence can be defined differently for different cultures. For example, eye contact shows competence in western cultures whereas, Asian cultures find too much eye contact disrespectful.
* Appropriateness: This means that one's behaviours are acceptable and proper for the expectations of any given culture.
* Effectiveness: The behaviours that lead to the desired outcome being achieved.
* Motivations:This has to do with emotional associations as they communicate interculturally. Feelings which are one's reactions to thoughts and experiences have to do with motivation. Intentions are thoughts that guide one's choices, it is a goal or plan that directs one's behaviour. These two things play a part in motivation.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;

=== Basic tools for improvement ===

The following are ways to improve communication competence:
* Display of interest: showing respect and positive regard for the other person.
* Orientation to knowledge: Terms people use to explain themselves  and their perception of the world.
* Empathy:  Behaving in ways that shows one understands the point of view of others
* Task role behaviour: initiate ideas that encourage problem solving activities.
* Relational role behaviour: interpersonal harmony and mediation.
* Tolerance for unknown and ambiguity: The ability to react to new situations with little discomfort.
* Interaction posture: Responding to others in descriptive, non-judgmental ways.&lt;ref name="Lustig &amp; Koester, 2010"/&gt;
* Patience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geldart|first1=Phil|title=Excellent Communication Requires Patience|url=https://www.eaglesflight.com/blog/bid/153152/Excellent-Communication-Requires-Patience|website=eaglesflight}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Active listening&lt;ref name="linguasoftech.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Importance of Communication Skills at Work Place|url=https://www.linguasoftech.com/blog/importance-of-communication-skills-at-work-place/|website=linguasofttech|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clarity  &lt;ref name="linguasoftech.com"/&gt;

=== Important factors===

* Proficiency in the host culture language: understanding the grammar and vocabulary.
* Understanding language pragmatics: how to use politeness strategies in making requests and how to avoid giving out too much information.
* Being sensitive and aware to nonverbal communication patterns in other cultures.
* Being aware of gestures that may be offensive or mean something different in a host culture rather than one's own culture.
* Understanding a culture's proximity in physical space and paralinguistic sounds to convey their intended meaning.&lt;ref name="Intercultural Communication"&gt;(Intercultural Communication)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traits ===

* Flexibility.
* Tolerating high levels of uncertainty.
* Self-reflection.
* Open-mindedness.
* Sensitivity.
* Adaptability.
* "[[Thinking outside the box]]" and [[lateral thinking]]&lt;ref name="Intercultural Communication"/&gt;

==Verbal communication==
Verbal communication consist of messages being sent and received continuously with the speaker and the listener, it is focused on the way messages are portrayed. Verbal communication is based on language and use of expression, the tone in which the sender of the message relays the communication can determine how the message is received and in what context.

'''Factors that affect verbal communication:'''

* Tone of voice
* Use of descriptive words
* Emphasis on certain phrases
* Volume of voice

The way a message is received is dependent on these factors as they give a greater interpretation for the receiver as to what is meant by the message. By emphasizing a certain phrase with the tone of voice, this indicates that it is important and should be focused more on.

Along with these attributes, verbal communication is also accompanied with non-verbal cues. These cues make the message clearer and give the listener an indication of what way the information should be received.&lt;ref&gt;Hinde, R. A. (1972). Non-verbal communication; edited by R. A. Hinde. -. Cambridge [Eng.]: University Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example of non-verbal cues'''

* Facial expressions
* Hand gestures
* Use of objects
* Body movement

In terms of intercultural communication there are language barriers which are effected by verbal forms of communication. In this instance there is opportunity for miscommunication between two or more parties.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, A. (2007). Verbal and nonverbal communication behaviours [electronic resource] : COST Action 2102 International Workshop, Vietri sul Mare, Italy, March 29–31, 2007 : revised selected and invited papers / Anna Esposito ... [et al.] (eds.). Berlin ; New York : Springer, c2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other barriers that contribute to miscommunication would be the type of words chosen in conversation. Due to different cultures there are different meaning in vocabulary chosen, this allows for a message between the sender and receiver to be misconstrued.&lt;ref&gt;Scollon, R., &amp; Scollon, S. K. (2001). Intercultural communication : a discourse approach / Ron Scollon and Suzanne Wong Scollon. Malden, MA : Blackwell Publishers, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nonverbal communication ==
Nonverbal communication is behavior that communicates without words—though it often may be accompanied by words. Minor variations in body language, speech rhythms, and punctuality often cause differing interpretations of the situation among cross-cultural parties.

Kinesic behavior is communication through body movement—e.g., posture, gestures, facial expressions and eye contact. The meaning of such behavior varies across countries.

Occulesics are a form of kinesics that includes eye contact and the use of the eyes to convey messages.

[[Proxemics]] concern the influence of proximity and space on communication (e.g., in terms of personal space and in terms of office layout). For example, space communicates power in the US and Germany.

[[Paralanguage]] refers to how something is said, rather than the content of what is said—e.g., rate of speech, tone and inflection of voice, other noises, laughing, yawning, and silence.

Object language or material culture refers to how people communicate through material artifacts—e.g., architecture, office design and furniture, clothing, cars, cosmetics, and time. In monochronic cultures, time is experienced linearly and as something to be spent, saved, made up, or wasted. Time orders life, and people tend to concentrate on one thing at a time. In polychronic cultures, people tolerate many things happening simultaneously and emphasize involvement with people. In these cultures, people may be highly distractible, focus on several things at once, and change plans often.

Clothing and the way people dress is used as a form of nonverbal communication.

== Interdisciplinary orientation ==
Cross-cultural communication endeavours to bring together such relatively unrelated areas as [[cultural anthropology]] and established areas of communication. Its core is to establish and understand how people from different cultures communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other.

Cross-cultural communication, as with many scholarly fields, is a combination of many other fields. These fields include [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]] and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by [[co-cultural populations]], i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations.

The study of languages other than one's own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages' methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs.

Language socialization can be broadly defined as “an investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context”.&lt;ref name="Rymes"&gt;Rymes, (2008). Language Socialization and the Linguistic Anthropology of Education. Encyclopedia of Language and Education, 2(8, Springer)&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|4}} There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however. Sometimes people can over-generalize or label cultures with stereotypical and subjective characterizations. Another primary concern with documenting alternative cultural norms revolves around the fact that no social actor uses language in ways that perfectly match normative characterizations.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|8}} A methodology for investigating how an individual uses language and other semiotic activity to create and use new models of conduct and how this varies from the cultural norm should be incorporated into the study of language socialization.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|11,12}}

'''Jeremy Lent''' (born 1960) is an author whose writings investigate the patterns of thought that have led civilization to its current crisis of sustainability. He is the founder of the non-profit Liology Institute, which is dedicated to a worldview that could enable humanity to thrive sustainably. He is the author of ''The Patterning Instinct'' and ''Requiem of the Human Soul''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Earlier in his career, Lent was the founder, chairman and CEO of the internet company [[NextCard]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=899887|title=NEXTCARD INC (Form: S-1/A, Received: 04/30/1999 09:49:46)|website=www.nasdaq.com|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Lent was born and raised in [[London]]. He graduated from the [[University College School]] and earned an undergraduate degree in [[English literature|English Literature]] at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jeremylent.com/|title=Website of Jeremy Lent – Author of The Patterning Instinct|website=Jeremy Lent  Author and Integrator|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lent left the UK to live in the United States. In 1986, he earned an [[MBA]] from the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He is married and currently lives in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

In addition to his writing, Lent is a practitioner of meditation, [[Qigong]], and [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]]. He is a Level II certified teacher of Radiant Heart Qigong.

== Career ==
Lent joined Strategic Planning Associates, a strategy consulting company based in Washington, D.C. In 1989, he joined First Deposit Corporation (later renamed [[Providian]]), a direct mail [[credit card]] company in San Francisco. Lent was named [[Chief financial officer|Chief Financial Officer]] of Providian in 1991 and left the company in 1994.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1996, Lent founded [[NextCard]], an internet [[financial services]] company. NextCard was the first company to enable consumers to apply for a credit card over the internet and be approved in real time and the first company to offer consumers the ability to design their own card by uploading a personalized image during the application process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As chairman and CEO, Lent took NextCard public in 1999 and led a secondary offering in 2000. However, due to his first wife’s illness, Lent stepped down as CEO later in 2000, to care for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/1012883/1/nextcard-mixes-good-news-quicker-profitability-with-bad-ceos-departure.html|title=NextCard Mixes Good News, Quicker Profitability, With Bad, CEO's Departure|last=Eavis|first=Peter|date=2000-07-24|work=TheStreet|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Lent’s departure, NextCard suffered serious setbacks. It was announced in late 2001, that the company was undercapitalized, and it was taken over by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) in 2002.  Along with the other board members, Lent was involved for several years in shareholder lawsuits and investigations by the FDIC and [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). These were eventually settled, and in 2005 the SEC dismissed fraud charges that it had levied against Lent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2006/lr19903.htm|title=Jeremy R.

== Writing ==

=== ''The Patterning Instinct'' ===
''The Patterning Instinct: A Cultural History of Humanity’s Search for Meaning'' ([[Prometheus Books]], May 2017) is a cognitive history of humanity, tracing how different cultures patterned meaning into the universe and how that has affected history. The result of ten years of research, the book offers a thesis that “culture shapes values and those values shape history.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This approach is in contrast to the predominant [[Geographic determinism|geographic determinist]] approach to history, exemplified by historians such as [[Jared Diamond]], [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]] and [[Kenneth Pomeranz]]. Lent argues that “The cognitive frames through which different cultures perceive reality have had a profound effect on their historical direction. The worldview of a given civilization—the implicit beliefs and values that create a pattern of meaning in people’s lives—has, in my opinion, been a significant driver of the historical path each civilization has taken.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lent|first=Jeremy|date=|title=Patterning Instinct|url=|journal=Origins: The Bulletin of the International Big History Association|volume=VI|pages=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book conducts what Lent calls an “archaeological exploration of the mind,” using findings from [[cognitive science]] and [[systems theory]] to reveal the implicit layers of values that form cultural norms. In a departure from the mainstream science-religion debate, ''The Patterning Instinct'' shows how medieval Christian rationalism acted as an incubator for scientific thought, which in turn, shaped the modern vision of the “conquest of nature.” Evaluating the sustainability crisis, Lent argues that it is culturally driven: a product of particular patterns that could be reshaped.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edelweiss.abovethetreeline.com/ProductDetailPage.aspx?sequence=18&amp;group=catalog&amp;mailingID=0&amp;mailingGroupID=0&amp;catalogID=4016922&amp;org=&amp;sku=1633882934|title=The Patterning Instinct|website=edelweiss.abovethetreeline.com|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book concludes by exploring scenarios for humanity’s future, foreseeing a coming struggle between two contrasting views: one driving to a technological world of artificially enhanced humans, the other enabling a sustainable future arising from intrinsic connectedness among people and to the natural world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''The Patterning Instinct'' contains a foreword by [[Fritjof Capra]]. Prior to publication, the book received favorable endorsements from notables such as [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich,]] [[Thom Hartmann]], Rick Hanson, [[J. R. McNeill]], and [[Jonathon Porritt]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Guardian journalist, George Monbiot, has called it "the most profound and far-reaching book I have ever read."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2018/01/31/stepping-back-from-the-brink/|title=Stepping Back from the Brink|work=George Monbiot|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received a Silver Award from [http://nautilusbookawards.com/2017-silver-winners/ Nautilus Book Awards] in April, 2018 in the Social Sciences &amp; Education category.

=== ''Requiem of the Human Soul'' ===
Beginning around 2005, Lent began an inquiry into the various constructions of meaning formed by cultures around the world and throughout history. The first expression of this investigation was his science fiction novel, ''Requiem of the Human Soul'' (Libros Libertad, 2009)..

The novel is set in the late 22nd century when most people are genetically enhanced. The minority that remains genetically unadulterated, known as Primals, consists mostly of the impoverished global underclass. The UN is holding a hearing in New York to consider whether to make the Primals extinct. The novel is written from the viewpoint of a Primal, Eusebio, who has been picked to represent his race in a last-ditch legal effort to save the Primals from extinction.

The novel raises questions about spirituality, history and global politics: Can the human race enhance itself to a higher plane? At what cost and benefit? If some “essence” of humanity was lost as a result, would that be so bad, given our sordid and shameful history? On the other hand, is there something special—a human soul—worth keeping at any price? Ultimately, the novel invites the reader to grapple with a fundamental question: what does it mean to be human?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Requiem of the Human Soul|last=Lent|first=Jeremy|publisher=Libros Libertad|year=2009|isbn=|location=Vancouver|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liology Institute ==
Lent founded the nonprofit Liology Institute in 2012, with the aim of fostering a worldview that could enable humanity to thrive sustainably. The institute, according to its website, “is dedicated to fostering a worldview in which the human discovery and experience of meaning in our lives is compatible with the findings of scientific investigation, offering a deeply integrated and coherent understanding of humanity’s place in our cosmos which could enable us to thrive on our planet harmoniously and sustainably.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liology.org/|title=The Liology Institute|website=The Liology Institute|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lent coined the term "liology" from the Chinese word ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]],'' meaning organizing principles of the universe, and “ology” of Greek etymology meaning “the study of.” The institute is intended to integrate traditional East Asian practices with the findings of modern systems science.

Its stated objectives are to:
* Stimulate and encourage a deep integration of scientific rigor with spiritual meaning.
* Distill East Asian spiritual traditions and integrate them with findings in systems biology, complexity science and neuroscience.
* Replace the mind/body duality of conventional Western thought with a concept that value is intrinsic to our experience.
* Join the worldwide movement towards achieving a sustainable way of living.
* Adopt an interdisciplinary approach to understanding humanity's history, current condition and trajectory.
* Cultivate skills that promote integration within a person and harmonization between humanity and the natural world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
In 2014, the institute began an annual series of workshops, exploring how the values and insights of Liology apply to people’s everyday lives.

== Great Transformation ==
Lent asserts that humanity is entering a period of transformation, of a scale that has occurred twice before in history: the [[First agricultural revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] twelve thousand years ago, and the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific]] and [[Industrial Revolution]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s several hundred years ago. The trajectories he consider include a [[collapse of civilization]], a [[Posthumanism|posthuman]] techno society and sustainable human flourishing (a "Great Transformation").

Lent claims that, to secure the latter humanity needs a new suite of values based on a sense of intrinsic connectedness. These values emphasize:
* Quality of life, rather than material possessions
* Political, social, and economic choices based on shared humanity
* Environmentally sustainable societies.&lt;ref&gt;“The Great Transformation, Or How We (Just) Avoided a Climate Catastrophe: A historian in 2050 looks back at the first half of the century.” Presented at the UC Santa Barbara virtual conference: ''The World In 2050: Creating/Imagining Just Climate Futures.'' October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish studies''' (or '''Judaic studies''') is an [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] centered on the study of [[Jew]]s and [[Judaism]]. Jewish studies is [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] and combines aspects of [[history]] (especially [[Jewish history]]), [[Middle Eastern studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[Oriental studies]], [[religious studies]], [[archeology]], [[sociology]], [[language]]s ([[Jewish languages]]), [[political science]], [[area studies]], [[women's studies]], and [[ethnic studies]]. Jewish studies as a distinct field is mainly present at colleges and universities in [[North America]].

Related fields include [[Holocaust research]] and [[Israel Studies]], and in Israel, [[Jewish thought]].

==History==
[[File:Kurtze Beschreibung einer wohleingerichteten Synagog.jpg|thumb|300px|In the 18th century, as interest in the "curiosities" of the Jewish religion rose, some non-Jews had models of synagogues erected, furnished with a full array of Jewish books and ceremonial objects, and accessible to a broad public, constituting the world's first "Jewish museums." This title page is from a book by Moritz Wilhelm Christiani, which describes such a replica, owned by Georg Serpilius, a Christian Hebraist.]]
The Jewish tradition generally places a high value on learning and study, especially of [[religious text]]s. [[Torah study]] (study of the [[Torah]] and more broadly of the entire [[Hebrew Bible]] as well as [[Rabbinic literature]] such as the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]) is considered a [[Mitzvah|religious obligation]].

Since the [[Renaissance]] and the growth of [[higher education]], many people, including people not of the Jewish faith, have chosen to study Jews and Judaism as a means of understanding the Jewish religion, heritage, and Jewish history.

Religious instruction specifically for Jews, especially for those who wish to join the [[rabbi]]nate, is taught at Jewish [[Seminary|seminaries]] (and in [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[yeshiva]]s). Among the most prominent are the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] and the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[Hebrew Union College]]. For the majority of Jewish students attending regular academic colleges and universities there is a growing choice of Jewish studies courses and even degrees available at many institutions.

The subject of [[antisemitism]] and [[the Holocaust]], as well as the establishment of the modern [[Israel|State of Israel]] and the revival of the [[Hebrew language]] have all stimulated unusual interest in greater in-depth academic study, research, reading and lecturing about these core areas of knowledge related to current events. In the United States, the unique position that [[American Jews|Jewish Americans]] have held within the nation's complex social structure has created substantial scholarship, especially with regards to topics such as interfaith marriage, political activism, and influence on popular culture.

In a 1966 article published in the ''[[American Jewish Year Book]]'', the Hebrew literature scholar [[Arnold Band|Arnold J. Band]] was among the first to call attention to the "spread of Jewish studies as an accepted academic discipline in the American liberal arts colleges and universities since the Second World War".&lt;ref name="Band"&gt;Band, Arnold (1966).

The political situation in the [[Middle East]], especially the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], has raised the profile of Jews, Judaism, and [[Zionism]] on campuses, spurring many on to study this subject for non-degree as well as for credits in obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts]] or [[Master of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]]. A growing number of mature students are even obtaining [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.s]] in Jewish studies judging by the quantity of courses and programs available. Many hope to obtain employment in the field of Jewish education or in Jewish communal service agencies.

Some Christians search for an understanding of the Jewish background for [[Jesus Christ]] and [[Christianity]] and for the source of [[monotheism]] that sprang from Judaism. There are those who are seeking an understanding of the complex and volatile relationship between [[Islam]] and Judaism. Others are searching for [[spirituality]] and [[philosophy]] and therefore seek classes in [[Kabbalah]] (Jewish mysticism) and [[Jewish philosophy]]. There are also those who have a genuine concern and attachment to modern [[Israel]] as [[Christian Zionists]] and therefore seek to learn more about the subjects related to their beliefs.

Jewish studies have been offered at universities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, Mervin F. (ed.) (1985).

Markus Wiener Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are only a few significant examples of places where Jewish studies are offered and flourish in an academic setting:

'''Karl Marx'''&lt;ref name="his_name group=note"&gt;The name "Karl Heinrich Marx", used in various lexicons, is based on an error. His birth certificate says "Carl Heinrich Marx", while elsewhere "Karl Marx" is used. "K. H. Marx" is used only in his poetry collections and the transcript of his dissertation; since Marx wanted to honour his father, who had died in 1838, he called himself "Karl Heinrich" in three documents.[https://archive.org/stream/handwrterbuchder04conr#page/1130/mode/1up The article] by Friedrich Engels "Marx, Karl Heinrich" in ''Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften'' (Jena, 1892, column 1130 to 1133 see ''[[Marx/Engels Collected Works|MECW]]'' Volume 22, pp. 337–345) does not justify assigning Marx a middle name. See Heinz Monz: ''Karl Marx. Grundlagen zu Leben und Werk''. NCO-Verlag, Trier 1973, p. 214 and 354, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-de|ˈkaɐ̯l ˈmaɐ̯ks|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Karl|title=Duden {{!}} Karl {{!}} Rechtschreibung, Bedeutung, Definition|work=[[Duden]]|quote=Kạrl|language=de|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Marx|title=Duden {{!}} Marx {{!}} Rechtschreibung, Bedeutung, Definition|work=Duden|quote=Mạrx|language=de|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German [[philosopher]], [[economist]], [[historian]], [[sociologist]], [[Political philosophy|political theorist]], [[journalist]] and [[revolutionary socialism|socialist revolutionary]].

Born in [[Trier]], Germany, to a [[History of Jews in Germany|Jewish]] middle-class family, Marx studied [[law]] and [[philosophy]] at university. Due to his political publications, Marx became [[Statelessness|stateless]] and lived in exile in [[London]] for decades, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker [[Friedrich Engels]] and publish his writings, researching in the [[British Museum Reading Room|reading room of the British Museum]]. His best-known titles are the 1848 [[pamphlet]], ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', and the three-volume ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]]''. His political and philosophical thought had enormous influence on subsequent intellectual, economic and political history and his name has been used as an adjective, a noun and a school of social theory.

Marx's theories about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as [[Marxism]]—hold that human societies develop through [[class struggle]]. In [[capitalism]], this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the [[bourgeoisie]]) that control the [[means of production]] and the working classes (known as the [[proletariat]]) that enable these means by selling their [[labour power]] in return for wages.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt; Employing a critical approach known as [[historical materialism]], Marx predicted that, like previous socio-economic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]]. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and [[crisis theory|crisis-prone nature]], would eventuate the working class' development of [[class consciousness]], leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, [[communist]] society constituted by a [[free association (communism and anarchism)|free association of producers]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm ''Critique of the Gotha Program'']&lt;/ref&gt; Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised [[Revolution|revolutionary action]] to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic [[emancipation]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24" /&gt;

Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and his work has been both lauded and [[Criticisms of Marxism|criticised]].&lt;ref name="Manchester"/&gt; His work in economics laid the basis for much of the current understanding of labour and its relation to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and subsequent economic thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]].

Marx is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern [[social science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~delittle/Marxism%20and%20Method%203.htm |title=Marxism and Method |last=Little |first=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/weber/ |title=Max Weber |last=Kim |first=Sung Ho |date=2017 |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=10 December 2017 |quote=Max Weber is known as a principal architect of modern social science along with Karl Marx and Emil Durkheim.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Childhood and early education: 1818–1836===
Marx was born on 5 May 1818 to [[Heinrich Marx]] (1777–1838) and [[Henriette Pressburg]] (1788–1863). He was born at Brückengasse 664 in [[Trier]], a town then part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]'s [[Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine|Province of the Lower Rhine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=8, 12}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx was ethnically [[Jewish]]. His maternal grandfather was a Dutch [[rabbi]], while his paternal line had supplied Trier's rabbis since 1723, a role taken by his grandfather Meier Halevi Marx.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=4–5}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=7–9, 12}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=2–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, as a child known as Herschel, was the first in the line to receive a secular education. He became a lawyer and lived a relatively wealthy and middle-class existence, with his family owning a number of [[Moselle wine|Moselle]] vineyards. Prior to his son's birth, and after the abrogation of [[Jewish emancipation]] in the Rhineland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6q0OHHNyFeEC&amp;pg=PA419|title=Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews – A History|last=Carroll|first=James|date=1 April 2002|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0547348889|location=|pages=419|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herschel converted from [[Judaism]] to join the state [[Prussian Union of Churches|Evangelical Church of Prussia]], taking on the German forename Heinrich over the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] Herschel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=4–6}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=2–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx was a third cousin once removed of German Romantic poet [[Heinrich Heine]], also born to a German Jewish family in the [[Rhineland]], with whom he became a frequent correspondent in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Raddatz ''Karl Marx: A Political Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

Largely non-religious, Heinrich was a man of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], interested in the ideas of the philosophers [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Voltaire]]. A [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]], he took part in agitation for a constitution and reforms in Prussia, at that time being an [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=5, 8–12}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=11}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=5–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, Heinrich Marx began working as an attorney and in 1819 moved his family to a ten-room property near  the [[Porta Nigra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=10}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, [[Henriette Pressburg]], was a Dutch Jewish woman from a prosperous business family that later founded the company [[Philips Electronics]]. Her sister Sophie Pressburg (1797–1854) married Lion Philips (1794–1866) and was the grandmother of both [[Gerard Philips|Gerard]] and [[Anton Philips]] and great-grandmother to [[Frits Philips]]. Lion Philips was a wealthy Dutch tobacco manufacturer and industrialist, upon whom Karl and [[Jenny von Westphalen|Jenny Marx]] would later often come to rely for loans while they were exiled in London.&lt;ref&gt;''Francis Wheen, Karl Marx: A Life'', (Fourth Estate, 1999), {{ISBN|1-85702-637-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known of Marx's childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=12}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The third of nine children, he became the eldest son when his brother Moritz died in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Young Marx and his surviving siblings, Sophie, Hermann, Henriette, Louise, Emilie and Caroline, were [[baptism|baptised]] into the Lutheran Church in August 1824 and their mother in November 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Karl Marx: Dictionary of National Biography. Volume 37|pp=57–58 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0198613873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young Marx was privately educated by his father until 1830, when he entered Trier High School, whose headmaster, Hugo Wyttenbach, was a friend of his father. By employing many [[Liberal humanism|liberal humanists]] as teachers, Wyttenbach incurred the anger of the local conservative government. Subsequently, police raided the school in 1832 and discovered that literature espousing political liberalism was being distributed among the students. Considering the distribution of such material a seditious act, the authorities instituted reforms and replaced several staff during Marx's attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976 |pp=12–15}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=13}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=7–11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1835 at the age of 17, Marx travelled to the [[University of Bonn]] wishing to study philosophy and literature, but his father insisted on law as a more practical field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=15–16}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=14}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a condition referred to as a "weak chest",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx was excused from military duty when he turned 18. While at the University at Bonn, Marx joined the Poets' Club, a group containing political radicals that were monitored by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=20}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx also joined the Trier Tavern Club drinking society (''Landsmannschaft der Treveraner''), at one point serving as club co-president.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=16}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Marx was involved in certain disputes, some of which became serious: in August 1836 he took part in a duel with a member of the university's Borussian Korps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=21–22}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his grades in the first term were good, they soon deteriorated, leading his father to force a transfer to the more serious and academic [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=16–17}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hegelianism and early journalism: 1836–1843===
Spending summer and autumn 1836 in Trier, Marx became more serious about his studies and his life. He became engaged to [[Jenny von Westphalen]], an educated baroness of the Prussian ruling class who had known Marx since childhood. As she had broken off her engagement with a young aristocrat to be with Marx, their relationship was socially controversial owing to the differences between their religious and class origins, but Marx befriended her father [[Ludwig von Westphalen]] (a liberal aristocrat) and later dedicated his doctoral thesis to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fedoseyev|1973|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=23–30}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=16–21, 33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=15, 20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years after their engagement, on 19 June 1843 they got married in a Protestant church in [[Bad Kreuznach|Kreuznach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=70–71}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=52–53}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=61–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1836, Marx arrived in Berlin, matriculating in the university's faculty of law and renting a room in the Mittelstrasse.  &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=31}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the first term, Marx attended lectures of [[Eduard Gans]] who represented the progressive Hegelian standpoint, elaborated on rational development in history by emphasizing particularly its libertarian aspects, and the importance of social question, and lectures of [[Karl von Savigny]] who represented the [[Historical School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although studying law, he was fascinated by philosophy and looked for a way to combine the two, believing that "without philosophy nothing could be accomplished".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx became interested in the recently deceased German philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], whose ideas were then widely debated among European philosophical circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=32–34}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=21–22}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=21–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During a convalescence in Stralau, he joined the Doctor's Club (''Doktorklub''), a student group which discussed Hegelian ideas and through them became involved with a group of [[Political radicalism|radical thinkers]] known as the [[Young Hegelians]] in 1837. They gathered around [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Bruno Bauer]], with Marx developing a particularly close friendship with Adolf Rutenberg. Like Marx, the Young Hegelians were critical of Hegel's [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] assumptions, but adopted his [[Marxist dialectic|dialectical method]] in order to criticise established society, politics and religion from a leftist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=34–38}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=34}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=25–27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's father died in May 1838, resulting in a diminished income for the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=44,69–70}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=17–18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx had been emotionally close to his father and treasured his memory after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sperber|2013|pp=55–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jenny-von-Westphalen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jenny von Westphalen]] in the 1830s]]

By 1837, Marx was writing both fiction and non-fiction, having completed a short novel, ''[[Scorpion and Felix]]'', a drama, ''[[Oulanem]]'', as well as a number of love poems dedicated to Jenny von Westphalen, though none of this early work was published during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=18–19}}. These love poems would be published posthumously in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 1'' (New York: International Publishers, 1975) pp. 531–632.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx soon abandoned fiction for other pursuits, including the study of both English and Italian, [[art history]] and the translation of Latin classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=25–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He began co-operating with [[Bruno Bauer]] on editing Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion|Philosophy of Religion]]'' in 1840. Marx was also engaged in writing his doctoral thesis, ''[[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Marx's thesis was posthumously published in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 1'' (New York: International Publishers, 1975) pp. 25–107.&lt;/ref&gt; which he completed in 1841. It was described as "a daring and original piece of work in which Marx set out to show that theology must yield to the superior wisdom of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The essay was controversial, particularly among the conservative professors at the University of Berlin. Marx decided instead to submit his thesis to the more liberal [[University of Jena]], whose faculty awarded him his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in April 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=45}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=33}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=28–29, 33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://willamette.edu/cla/classics/careers/marx/index.html | title=Classics: Karl Marx}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Marx and Bauer were both [[atheism|atheists]], in March 1841 they began plans for a journal entitled ''Archiv des Atheismus'' (''Atheistic Archives''), but it never came to fruition. In July, Marx and Bauer took a trip to [[Bonn]] from Berlin. There they scandalised their class by getting drunk, laughing in church and galloping through the streets on donkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=38–45}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=34}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=32–33, 37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx was considering an academic career, but this path was barred by the government's growing opposition to classical liberalism and the Young Hegelians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=49}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx moved to [[Cologne]] in 1842, where he became a journalist, writing for the radical newspaper ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]]'' (''Rhineland News''), expressing his early views on socialism and his developing interest in economics. Marx criticised both right-wing European governments as well as figures in the liberal and socialist movements whom he thought ineffective or counter-productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=50–51}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=34–36, 42–44}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=35–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper attracted the attention of the Prussian [[censorship|government censors]], who checked every issue for seditious material before printing, as Marx lamented: "Our newspaper has to be presented to the police to be sniffed at, and if the police nose smells anything un-Christian or un-Prussian, the newspaper is not allowed to appear".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=57}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=47}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=48–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the ''Rheinische Zeitung'' published an article strongly criticising the Russian monarchy, Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] requested it be banned and Prussia's government complied in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=60–61}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=47–48}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=50–51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris: 1843–1845===
In 1843, Marx became co-editor of a new, radical leftist Parisian newspaper, the ''[[Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher]]'' (''German-French Annals''), then being set up by the German socialist [[Arnold Ruge]] to bring together German and French radicals&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=68–69, 72}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=48}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus Marx and his wife moved to Paris in October 1843. Initially living with Ruge and his wife communally at 23 [[Rue Vaneau]], they found the living conditions difficult, so moved out following the birth of their daughter Jenny in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=77–79}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=62–66}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=73–74, 94}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although intended to attract writers from both France and the German states, the ''Jahrbücher'' was dominated by the latter and the only non-German writer was the exiled Russian [[Collectivist anarchism|anarchist collectivist]] [[Mikhail Bakunin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|p=72}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=64–65}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=71–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx contributed two essays to the paper, "[[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right|Introduction to a Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]"&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, "Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Law", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[On the Jewish Question]]",&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, "On the Jewish Question", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;  the latter introducing his belief that the [[proletariat]] were a revolutionary force and marking his embrace of communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=65–70, 74–80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Only one issue was published, but it was relatively successful, largely owing to the inclusion of [[Heinrich Heine]]'s satirical odes on King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|Ludwig of Bavaria]], leading the German states to ban it and seize imported copies (Ruge nevertheless refused to fund the publication of further issues and his friendship with Marx broke down).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolaievsky|Maenchen-Helfen|1976|pp=72, 75–76}}; {{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=65}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=88–90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the paper's collapse, Marx began writing for the only uncensored German-language radical newspaper left, ''[[Vorwärts!]]'' (''Forward!''). Based in Paris, the paper was connected to the [[League of the Just]], a [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] secret society of workers and artisans. Marx attended some of their meetings, but did not join.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|pp=66–67, 112}}; {{harvnb|McLellan|2006|pp=79–80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Vorwärts!'', Marx refined his views on socialism based upon Hegelian and Feuerbachian ideas of dialectical materialism, at the same time criticising liberals and other socialists operating in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheen|2001|p=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Engels 1856.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Engels]], whom Marx met in 1844; the two became lifelong friends and collaborators]]

On 28 August 1844, Marx met the German socialist [[Friedrich Engels]] at the [[Café de la Régence]], beginning a lifelong friendship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Engels showed Marx his recently published ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Mansel, Philip: ''Paris Between Empires'', p. 390 (St. Martin Press, NY) 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, "The Condition of the Working Class in England", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 4'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 295–596.&lt;/ref&gt; convincing Marx that the working class would be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history.&lt;ref name="Bottomore1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Marx and Engels were collaborating on a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Marx's former friend, [[Bruno Bauer]]. This work was published in 1845 as ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Holy Family", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 4'', pp. 3–211.&lt;/ref&gt; Although critical of Bauer, Marx was increasingly influenced by the ideas of the Young Hegelians [[Max Stirner]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], but eventually Marx and Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.&lt;ref name="et"/&gt;

During the time that he lived at 38 Rue Vanneau in Paris (from October 1843 until January 1845),&lt;ref&gt;Taken from the caption of a picture of the house in a group of pictures located between pages 160 and 161 in the book "Karl Marx: A Biography", written by a team of historians and writers headed by P. N. Fedoseyev (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; Marx engaged in an intensive study of [[political economy]] ([[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]], ''etc.'')'',''&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'' ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; the French socialists (especially [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Claude Henri St. Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]])&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'' (Oxford University Press: London, 1963) pp. 90–94.&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of France.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of political economy is a study that Marx would pursue for the rest of his life&lt;ref&gt;Larisa Miskievich, "Preface" to Volume 28 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) p. XII&lt;/ref&gt; and would result in his major economic work{{mdash}}the three-volume series called ''Capital''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', ''Volume 36'' and ''Volume 37'' (International Publishers: New York, 1996, 1997 and 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxism]] is based in large part on three influences: [[Hegel]]'s dialectics, French utopian socialism and English economics. Together with his earlier study of Hegel's dialectics, the studying that Marx did during this time in Paris meant that all major components of "Marxism" were in place by the autumn of 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'', pp. 35–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marx was constantly being pulled away from his study of political economy{{mdash}}not only by the usual daily demands of the time, but additionally by editing a radical newspaper and later by organising and directing the efforts of a political party during years of potentially revolutionary popular uprisings of the citizenry. Still Marx was always drawn back to his economic studies:  he sought "to understand the inner workings of capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

An outline of "Marxism" had definitely formed in the mind of Karl Marx by late 1844. Indeed, many features of the Marxist view of the world's political economy had been worked out in great detail, but Marx needed to write down all of the details of his economic world view to further clarify the new economic theory in his own mind.&lt;ref&gt;Note 54 contained on page 598 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3''.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Marx wrote ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844" ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 229–346.&lt;/ref&gt; These manuscripts covered numerous topics, detailing Marx's concept of [[alienated labour]].&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; However, by the spring of 1845 his continued study of political economy, capital and capitalism had led Marx to the belief that the new political economic theory that he was espousing—scientific socialism—needed to be built on the base of a thoroughly developed materialistic view of the world.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'' had been written between April and August 1844, but soon Marx recognised that the ''Manuscripts'' had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach.  Accordingly, Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach's philosophy in favour of historical materialism, thus a year later (in April 1845) after moving from Paris to Brussels, Marx wrote his eleven "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 3–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Theses on Feuerbach" are best known for Thesis 11, which states that "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, the point is to change it".&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theses on Feuerbach," contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This work contains Marx's criticism of [[materialism]] (for being contemplative), [[idealism]] (for reducing practice to theory) overall, criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx's [[historical materialism]], an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Engels1999"/&gt; In 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the French government shut down ''Vorwärts!'', with the interior minister, [[François Guizot]], expelling Marx from France.&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 90"/&gt; At this point, Marx moved from Paris to Brussels, where Marx hoped to once again continue his study of capitalism and political economy.

===Brussels: 1845–1848===
[[File:Communist-manifesto.png|thumb|upright|The first edition of ''[[The Communist Manifesto|The Manifesto of the Communist Party]]'', published in German in 1848]]

Unable either to stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845. However, to stay in Belgium he had to pledge not to publish anything on the subject of contemporary politics.&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 90"/&gt; In Brussels, Marx associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including [[Moses Hess]], [[Karl Heinzen]] and [[Joseph Weydemeyer]]. In April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join Marx and the growing cadre of members of the League of the Just now seeking home in Brussels.&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 90" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild ["New Book Publishing House"]: Dresden, 1972) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Mary Burns]], Engels' long-time companion, left Manchester, England to join Engels in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-July 1845, Marx and Engels left Brussels for England to visit the leaders of the [[Chartism|Chartists]], a socialist movement in Britain. This was Marx's first trip to England and Engels was an ideal guide for the trip. Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester from November 1842&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild [New Book Publishing House]: Dresden, 1972) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; to August 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did Engels already know the English language,&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 89"&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; he had also developed a close relationship with many Chartist leaders.&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 89"/&gt; Indeed, Engels was serving as a reporter for many Chartist and socialist English newspapers.&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 89"/&gt; Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with Engels, Marx also set about writing a book which is often seen as his best treatment of the concept of [[historical materialism]], ''[[The German Ideology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "German Ideology" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 19–539.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Marx broke with [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Bruno Bauer]], [[Max Stirner]] and the rest of the Young Hegelians, while he also broke with [[Karl Grun]] and other "true socialists" whose philosophies were still based in part on "idealism". In ''German Ideology'', Marx and Engels finally completed their philosophy, which was based solely on materialism as the sole motor force in history.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; ''German Ideology'' is written in a humorously satirical form, but even this satirical form did not save the work from censorship. Like so many other early writings of his, ''German Ideology'' would not be published in Marx's lifetime and would be published only in 1932.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing ''German Ideology'', Marx turned to a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding "the theory and tactics" of a truly "revolutionary proletarian movement" operating from the standpoint of a truly "scientific materialist" philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See Note 71 on p. 672 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx's own scientific socialist philosophy. Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded one person at a time to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests, thus appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society. This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning, but to get the manuscript past the government censors he called the book ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1847)&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6''(International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 105–212.&lt;/ref&gt; and offered it as a response to the "petty bourgeois philosophy" of the French anarchist socialist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] as expressed in his book ''[[The Philosophy of Poverty]]'' (1840).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marx+Family and Engels.jpg|thumb|Marx, Engels and Marx's daughters]]

These books laid the foundation for Marx and Engels's most famous work, a political pamphlet that has since come to be commonly known as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. While residing in Brussels in 1846, Marx continued his association with the secret radical organisation [[League of the Just]].&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1973) p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted above, Marx thought the League to be just the sort of radical organisation that was needed to spur the working class of Europe toward the mass movement that would bring about a working class revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Note 260 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 671–672.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to organise the working class into a mass movement the League had to cease its "secret" or "underground" orientation and operate in the open as a political party.&lt;ref&gt;Note 260 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'', p. 672.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the League eventually became persuaded in this regard. Accordingly, in June 1847 the League was reorganised by its membership into a new open "above ground" political society that appealed directly to the working classes.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev,''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', pp. 123–125.&lt;/ref&gt; This new open political society was called the Communist League.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Marx and Engels participated in drawing up the programme and organisational principles of the new [[Communist League]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, "Principles of Communism" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'' (International Publishers, New York, 1976) pp. 341–357.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1847, Marx and Engels began writing what was to become their most famous work — a programme of action for the [[Communist League]]. Written jointly by Marx and Engels from December 1847 to January 1848, ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' was first published on 21 February 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "The Communist Manifesto" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'', pp. 477–519.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Communist Manifesto'' laid out the beliefs of the new Communist League. No longer a secret society, the Communist League wanted to make aims and intentions clear to the general public rather than hiding its beliefs as the League of the Just had been doing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening lines of the pamphlet set forth the principal basis of Marxism: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".&lt;ref name="ShillingMellor2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Shilling|author2=Philip A Mellor|title=The Sociological Ambition: Elementary Forms of Social and Moral Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CdgJe9Jx0UC&amp;pg=PA114|year=2001|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-6549-7|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It goes on to examine the antagonisms that Marx claimed were arising in the clashes of interest between the [[bourgeoisie]] (the wealthy capitalist class) and the [[proletariat]] (the industrial working class). Proceeding on from this, the ''Manifesto'' presents the argument for why the Communist League, as opposed to other socialist and liberal political parties and groups at the time, was truly acting in the interests of the proletariat to overthrow capitalist society and to replace it with socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mar48|Marx and Engels 1848]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Europe experienced a series of protests, rebellions and often violent upheavals that became known as the [[Revolutions of 1848]].&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 125"/&gt; In France, [[French Revolution of 1848|a revolution]] led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the [[French Second Republic]].&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 125"/&gt; Marx was supportive of such activity and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father (withheld by his uncle Lionel Philips since his father's death in 1838) of either 6,000&lt;ref name="MaltsevN.-93"/&gt; or 5,000 francs&lt;ref&gt;Saul Kussiel Padover, ''Karl Marx, an intimate biography'', McGraw-Hill, 1978, page 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; he allegedly used a third of it to arm [[Belgium|Belgian]] workers who were planning revolutionary action.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although the veracity of these allegations is disputed,&lt;ref name="MaltsevN.-93"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David McLellan 1973 ''Karl Marx: His life and Thought''.

===Cologne: 1848–1849===
Temporarily settling down in Paris, Marx transferred the Communist League executive headquarters to the city and also set up a [[German Workers' Club]] with various German socialists living there.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to see the revolution spread to Germany, in 1848 Marx moved back to Cologne where he began issuing a handbill entitled the ''Demands of the Communist Party in Germany'',&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, "Demands of the Communist Party" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 7'' (International Publishers: New York, 1977) pp. 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  in which he argued for only four of the ten points of the ''Communist Manifesto'', believing that in Germany at that time the bourgeoisie must overthrow the [[feudalism|feudal]] monarchy and aristocracy before the proletariat could overthrow the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June, Marx started publication of a daily newspaper, the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', which he helped to finance through his recent inheritance from his father. Designed to put forward news from across Europe with his own Marxist interpretation of events, the newspaper featured Marx as a primary writer and the dominant editorial influence. Despite contributions by fellow members of the Communist League, according to [[Friedrich Engels]] it remained "a simple dictatorship by Marx".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 130–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seigel, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DL-Marx"/&gt;

Whilst editor of the paper, Marx and the other revolutionary socialists were regularly harassed by the police and Marx was brought to trial on several occasions, facing various allegations including insulting the Chief Public Prosecutor, committing a press misdemeanor and inciting armed rebellion through tax boycotting,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolaievsky2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Splichal2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehring2003"/&gt; although each time he was acquitted.&lt;ref name="Nicolaievsky2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehring2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the democratic parliament in [[Prussia]] collapsed and the king, [[Frederick William IV]], introduced a new cabinet of his reactionary supporters, who implemented counter-revolutionary measures to expunge leftist and other revolutionary elements from the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Consequently, the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' was soon suppressed and Marx was ordered to leave the country on 16 May.&lt;ref name="DL-Marx"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 137–146.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx returned to Paris, which was then under the grip of both a reactionary counter-revolution and a [[cholera]] epidemic and was soon expelled by the city authorities, who considered him a political threat. With his wife Jenny expecting their fourth child and not able to move back to Germany or Belgium, in August 1849 he sought refuge in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson2010"/&gt;

===Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860===
Marx moved to London in early June 1849 and would remain based in the city for the rest of his life. The headquarters of the Communist League also moved to London. However, in the winter of 1849–1850 a split within the ranks of the Communist League occurred when a faction within it led by [[August Willich]] and [[Karl Schapper]] began agitating for an immediate uprising. Willich and Schapper believed that once the Communist League had initiated the uprising, the entire working class from across Europe would rise "spontaneously" to join it, thus creating revolution across Europe. Marx and Engels protested that such an unplanned uprising on the part of the Communist League was "adventuristic" and would be suicide for the Communist League.&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 233"&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an uprising as that recommended by the Schapper/Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe. Marx maintained that this would spell doom for the Communist League itself, arguing that changes in society are not achieved overnight through the efforts and will power of a handful of men.&lt;ref name="N. Fedoseyev, p. 233"/&gt; They are instead brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development. In the present stage of development (''circa'' 1850), following the defeat of the uprisings across Europe in 1848 he felt that the Communist League should encourage the working class to unite with progressive elements of the rising bourgeoisie to defeat the feudal aristocracy on issues involving demands for governmental reforms, such as a constitutional republic with freely elected assemblies and universal (male) suffrage. In other words, the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working class revolution.

After a long struggle which threatened to ruin the Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and eventually the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society.&lt;ref&gt;Note 269 contained on page 674 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society held their meetings in [[Great Windmill Street]], [[Soho]], central London's entertainment district.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 151–155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harriss2006"/&gt; This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.&lt;ref&gt;Note 269 on page 674 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''New-York Daily Tribune'' and journalism ===
In the early period in London, Marx committed himself almost exclusively to revolutionary activities, such that his family endured extreme poverty.&lt;ref name="DusselMoseley2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="egsbio"/&gt; His main source of income was Engels, whose own source was his wealthy industrialist father.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; In Prussia as editor of his own newspaper, and contributor to others ideologically aligned, Marx could reach his audience, the working classes. In London, without finances to run a newspaper themselves, he and Engels turned to international journalism.  At one stage they were being published by six newspapers from England, the United States, [[Prussia]], Austria and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's principal earnings came from his work as European correspondent, from 1852 to 1862, for the ''[[New-York Daily Tribune]]'',&lt;ref name="Kluger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kluger|first=Richard|title=The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} and from also producing articles for more "bourgeois" newspapers.  Marx had his articles translated from German by {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Pieper (revolutionary)|de|3=Wilhelm Pieper (Revolutionär)|lt=Wilhelm Pieper}}, until his proficiency in English had become adequate.&lt;ref name="Dispatches"/&gt;

The ''New-York Daily Tribune'' had been founded in April 1841 by  [[Horace Greeley]].&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Its editorial board contained progressive bourgeois journalists and publishers, among them [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]] and the journalist [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles Dana]], who was editor-in-chief.  Dana, a [[fourierist]] and an [[abolitionist]], was Marx's contact. 

The ''Tribune'' was a vehicle for Marx to reach a transatlantic public to make a "hidden war" to [[Henry Charles Carey]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Perelman : How Karl Marx Helped Shape the Republican Party [https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/12/25/how-karl-marx-helped-shape-the-republican-party] - More : Karl Mary and Henry Carey in the New-York Tribune [https://michaelperelman.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/political-economy-and-the-press-karl-marx-and-henry-carey-at-the-new-york-tribune/]&lt;/ref&gt;. The journal had wide working-class appeal from its foundation;  at two cents, it was inexpensive;&lt;ref&gt;Taken from a picture on page 327 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and, with about 50,000 copies per issue, its circulation was the widest in the United States.&lt;ref name="Kluger"/&gt;{{rp|14}} Its editorial ethos was progressive and its anti-slavery stance reflected Greeley's.&lt;ref name="Kluger"/&gt;{{rp|82}}  Marx's first article for the paper, on the British parliamentary elections, was published on 21 August 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Elections in England – Tories and Whigs" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 327–332.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 1857 Dana informed Marx that, due to the economic recession, only one article a week would be paid for, published or not; the others would be paid for only if published. Marx had sent his articles on Tuesdays and Fridays, but, that October, the ''Tribune'' discharged all its correspondents in Europe except Marx and B. Taylor, and reduced Marx to a weekly article. Between September and November 1860, only five were published. After a six-month interval, Marx resumed contributions in September 1861 until March 1862, when Dana wrote to inform him that there was no longer space in the ''Tribune'' for reports from London, due to American domestic affairs.&lt;ref name="MECW"&gt;[https://ia801605.us.archive.org/29/items/MarxEngelsCollectedWorksVolume10MKarlMarx/Marx%20%26%20Engels%20Collected%20Works%20Volume%2041_%20Ka%20-%20Karl%20Marx.pdf Marx &amp; Engels Collected Works, vol.41]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1868, Dana set up a rival newspaper, the ''New York Sun'', at which he was editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kluger, ''The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune'' (Alfred A. Knopf Publishing, New York, 1986) p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1857, Dana invited Marx to contribute articles, mainly on military history, to the ''[[New American Cyclopedia]]'', an idea of George Ripley, Dana's friend and literary editor of the ''Tribune''. In all, 67 Marx-Engels articles were published, of which 51 written by Engels, although Marx did some research for them in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLellan|2006|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1850s, American popular interest in European affairs waned and Marx's articles turned to topics such as the "slavery crisis" and the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, in the "War Between the States".&lt;ref&gt;Note 1 at page 367 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 19'' (International Publishers: New York, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;
Between December 1851 and March 1852, Marx worked on his theoretical work about the [[French Revolution of 1848]], titled  ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon" contained in the ''Collected Works of KarlMarx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 99–197.&lt;/ref&gt; In this he explored concepts in [[historical materialism]], [[class struggle]], [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], and victory of the proletariat over the [[bourgeois]] state.&lt;ref name="Marx2008"/&gt;

The 1850s and 1860s may be said to mark a philosophical boundary distinguishing the [[young Marx]]'s [[Hegelian]] [[idealism]] and the more [[mature Marx]]'s&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hook1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston2000"/&gt; scientific ideology associated with [[structural Marxism]];&lt;ref name="Johnston2000"/&gt;  however, not all scholars accept this distinction.&lt;ref name="Hook1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GeorgeScanlan1975"/&gt; For Marx and Engels, their experience of the [[Revolutions of 1848]] to 1849 were formative in the development of their theory of economics and historical progression. After the "failures" of 1848, the revolutionary impetus appeared spent and not to be renewed without an economic recession. Contention arose between Marx and his fellow communists, whom he denounced as "adventurists". Marx deemed it fanciful to propose that "will power" could be sufficient to create the revolutionary conditions when in reality the economic component was the necessary requisite.

Recession in the United States' economy in 1852 gave Marx and Engels grounds for optimism for revolutionary activity. Yet, this economy was seen as too immature for a capitalist revolution. Open territories on America's western frontier dissipated the forces of social unrest. Moreover, any economic crisis arising in the United States would not lead to revolutionary contagion of the older economies of individual European nations, which were closed systems bounded by their national borders. When the so-called "[[Panic of 1857]]" in the United States spread globally, it broke all economic theory models,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first truly global economic crisis.

Financial necessity had forced Marx to abandon economic studies in 1844 and give thirteen years to working on other projects. He had always sought to return to economics.

===The First International and ''Capital''===
[[File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich Das Kapital Marx 1867.jpg|thumb|upright|The first volume of ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]]'']]

Marx continued to write articles for the ''New York Daily Tribune'' as long as he was sure that the ''Tribune's'' editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; No longer was the ''Tribune'' to be a strong [[abolitionist]] paper dedicated to a complete [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the ''Tribune.''&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, Marx became involved in the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (also known as the First International),&lt;ref name="Nicolaievsky2007"/&gt; to whose General Council he was elected at its inception in 1864.&lt;ref name="Nicolaievsky2007-267"/&gt; In that organisation, Marx was involved in the struggle against the anarchist wing centred on [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814–1876).&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; Although Marx won this contest, the transfer of the seat of the General Council from London to New York in 1872, which Marx supported, led to the decline of the International.&lt;ref name="JessopWheatley1999-526"/&gt; The most important political event during the existence of the International was the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871, when the citizens of Paris rebelled against their government and held the city for two months. In response to the bloody suppression of this rebellion, Marx wrote one of his most famous pamphlets, "[[The Civil War in France]]", a defence of the Commune.&lt;ref name="Curtis1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "The Civil War in France" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 22'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) pp. 307–359.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the repeated failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx also sought to understand capitalism and spent a great deal of time in the reading room of the [[British Museum]] studying and reflecting on the works of [[political economy|political economists]] and on economic data.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20"/&gt; By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, [[landed property]], wage labour, the state and foreign trade and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939 under the title ''[[Grundrisse|''Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy'']]''.&lt;ref name="Segrest2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Economic Manuscripts of 1857–1858" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 28'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) pp. 5–537.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Economic Manuscripts of 1857–1858" contained in the Preparatory Materials section of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'' (International Publishers: New York, 1987) pp. 421–507.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally in 1859, Marx published ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', pp. 257–417.&lt;/ref&gt; his first serious economic work. This work was intended merely as a preview of his three-volume ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (English title: ''Capital: Critique of Political Economy''), which he intended to publish at a later date. In ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'', Marx expands on the [[labour theory of value]] advocated by [[David Ricardo]]. The work was enthusiastically received, and the edition sold out quickly.&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl-Marx.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Marx in the 1870s]]

The successful sales of ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' stimulated Marx in the early 1860s to finish work on the three large volumes that would compose his major life's work—''Das Kapital'' and the ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', which discussed the theoreticians of political economy, particularly [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]].&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; ''Theories of Surplus Value'' is often referred to as the fourth volume of ''Das Kapital'' and constitutes one of the first comprehensive treatises on the [[history of economic thought]].&lt;ref name="Rockmore2002"/&gt; In 1867, the first volume of ''Das Kapital'' was published, a work which analysed the capitalist process of production.&lt;ref name="BrewerMarx1984-15"/&gt; Here Marx elaborated his [[labour theory of value]], which had been influenced by [[Thomas Hodgskin]]. Marx acknowledged Hodgskin's "admirable work" ''Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital'' at more than one point in ''Capital.''&lt;ref&gt;See footnote #2 on the bottom of page 360 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35''.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Marx quoted Hodgskin as recognising the alienation of labour that occurred under modern capitalist production. No longer was there any "natural reward of individual labour. Each labourer produces only some part of a whole, and each part having no value or utility of itself, there is nothing on which the labourer can seize, and say: 'This is my product, this will I keep to myself'".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hodgskin, ''Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital'' (London, 1825) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In this first volume of ''Capital'', Marx outlined his conception of [[surplus value]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], which he argued would ultimately lead to a falling rate of profit and the collapse of industrial capitalism.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; Demand for a Russian language edition of ''Capital'' soon led to the printing of 3,000 copies of the book in the Russian language, which was published on 27 March 1872. By the autumn of 1871, the entire first edition of the German language edition of ''Capital'' had been sold out and a second edition was published.

Volumes II and III of ''Capital'' remained mere manuscripts upon which Marx continued to work for the rest of his life. Both volumes were published by Engels after Marx's death.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; Volume II of ''Capital'' was prepared and published by Engels in July 1893 under the name ''Capital II: The Process of Circulation of Capital''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Capital II: The Process of Circulation of Capital" embodying the whole volume of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 36'' (International Publishers: New York, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Volume III of ''Capital'' was published a year later in October 1894 under the name ''Capital III: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Capital III: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole" embodying the whole volume of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 37'' (International Publishers: New York, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Theories of Surplus Value'' derived from the sprawling ''Economic Manuscripts of 1861-1863'', a ''second'' draft for ''Capital'', the latter spanning volumes 30-34 of the ''Collected Works of Marx and Engels''.  Specifically, ''Theories of Surplus Value'' runs from the latter part of the ''Collected Works' '' thirtieth volume through the end of their thirty-second volume;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theories of Surplus Value" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 30'' (International Publishers: New York, 1988) pp. 318–451.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theories of Surplus Value" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 31'' (International Publishers: New York, 1989) pp. 5–580.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Theories of Surplus Value" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 32'' (International Publishers: New York, 1989) pp. 5–543.&lt;/ref&gt; meanwhile, the larger ''Economic Manuscripts of 1861-1863'' run from the start of the ''Collected Works' '' thirtieth volume through the first half of their thirty-fourth volume.  The latter half of the Collected Works' thirty-fourth volume consists of the surviving fragments of the ''Economic Manuscripts of 1863-1864'', which represented a ''third'' draft for Capital, and a large portion of which is included as an appendix to the Penguin edition of ''Capital'', volume I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/economic/introduction.htm |title=Economic Works of Karl Marx 1861-1864 |website=marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German language abridged edition of ''Theories of Surplus Value'' was published in 1905 and in 1910. This abridged edition was translated into English and published in 1951 in London, but the complete unabridged edition of ''Theories of Surplus Value'' was published as the "fourth volume" of ''Capital'' in 1963 and 1971 in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;See note 228 on page 475 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 30''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marx old.jpg|thumb|upright|Marx in 1882]]

During the last decade of his life, Marx's health declined and he became incapable of the sustained effort that had characterised his previous work.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; He did manage to comment substantially on contemporary politics, particularly in Germany and Russia. His ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'' opposed the tendency of his followers [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] and [[August Bebel]] to compromise with the [[state socialism]] of [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] in the interests of a united socialist party.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt; This work is also notable for another famous Marx quote: "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]".&lt;ref name="CGP P1"/&gt;

In a letter to [[Vera Zasulich]] dated 8 March 1881, Marx contemplated the possibility of Russia's bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism on the basis of the common ownership of land characteristic of the village ''[[mir (social)|mir]]''.&lt;ref name=egsbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, ''Collected Works Volume 46'' (International Publishers: New York, 1992) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; While admitting that Russia's rural "commune is the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia", Marx also warned that in order for the mir to operate as a means for moving straight to the socialist stage without a preceding capitalist stage it "would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences which are assailing it (the rural commune) from all sides".&lt;ref name="k72"/&gt; Given the elimination of these pernicious influences, Marx allowed that "normal conditions of spontaneous development" of the rural commune could exist.&lt;ref name=k72/&gt; However, in the same letter to Vera Zasulich he points out that "at the core of the capitalist system&amp;nbsp;... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production".&lt;ref name=k72/&gt; In one of the drafts of this letter, Marx reveals his growing passion for anthropology, motivated by his belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past. He wrote that "the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak, a crisis that will end in its destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type—collective production and appropriation". He added that "the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, ''etc''. societies, and, a fortiori, that of modern capitalist societies".&lt;ref&gt;K. Marx, First draft of letter to Vera Zasulich [1881]. In Marx-Engels 'Collected Works', Volume 24, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; Before he died, Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas, which were published in 1884 under the title ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]''.

Marx a very short introduction''. p. 5. {{ISBN|0-19-285405-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children were: [[Jenny Longuet|Jenny Caroline]] (m. Longuet; 1844–1883); [[Laura Marx|Jenny Laura]] (m. Lafargue; 1845–1911); Edgar (1847–1855); Henry Edward Guy ("Guido"; 1849–1850); Jenny Eveline Frances ("Franziska"; 1851–1852); [[Eleanor Marx|Jenny Julia Eleanor]] (1855–1898) and one more who died before being named (July 1857). There are allegations that Marx also fathered a son, Freddy,&lt;ref name=Montefiore&gt;{{cite news |last=Montefiore|first=Simon Sebag|title=The Means of Reproduction|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/books/review/love-and-capital-by-mary-gabriel-book-review.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; out of wedlock by his housekeeper, [[Helene Demuth]].&lt;ref name="Karl Marx"/&gt;

Marx frequently used pseudonyms, often when renting a house or flat, apparently to make it harder for the authorities to track him down. While in Paris, he used that of "Monsieur Ramboz", whilst in London he signed off his letters as "A. Williams". His friends referred to him as "Moor", owing to his dark complexion and black curly hair, while he encouraged his children to call him "Old Nick" and "Charley".&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 152"/&gt; He also bestowed nicknames and pseudonyms on his friends and family as well, referring to Friedrich Engels as "General", his housekeeper Helene as "Lenchen" or "Nym", while one of his daughters, Jennychen, was referred to as "Qui Qui, [[Emperor of China]]" and another, Laura, was known as "[[Cockatoo|Kakadou]]" or "the [[Khoikhoi|Hottentot]]".&lt;ref name="Wheen 2001. p. 152"/&gt;

===Health===
Marx was afflicted by poor health (what he himself described as "the wretchedness of existence")&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; and various authors have sought to describe and explain it. His biographer Werner Blumenberg attributed it to liver and gall problems which Marx had in 1849 and from which he was never afterwards free, exacerbated by an unsuitable lifestyle. The attacks often came with headaches, eye inflammation, neuralgia in the head and rheumatic pains. A serious nervous disorder appeared in 1877 and protracted insomnia was a consequence, which Marx fought with narcotics. The illness was aggravated by excessive nocturnal work and faulty diet. Marx was fond of highly seasoned dishes, smoked fish, caviare, pickled cucumbers, "none of which are good for liver patients", but he also liked wine and liqueurs and smoked an enormous amount "and since he had no money, it was usually bad-quality cigars". From 1863, Marx complained a lot about boils: "These are very frequent with liver patients and may be due to the same causes".&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The abscesses were so bad that Marx could neither sit nor work upright. According to Blumenberg, Marx's irritability is often found in liver patients:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The illness emphasised certain traits in his character. He argued cuttingly, his biting satire did not shrink at insults, and his expressions could be rude and cruel. Though in general Marx had a blind faith in his closest friends, nevertheless he himself complained that he was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them. His verdicts, not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence… There must have been few whom he did not criticize like this… not even Engels was an exception.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Princeton historian J.E. Seigel, in his late teens Marx may have had pneumonia or pleurisy, the effects of which led to his being exempted from Prussian military service. In later life whilst working on ''Capital'' (which he never completed),&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg, 98; Siegel, 494.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx suffered from a trio of afflictions. A liver ailment, probably hereditary, was aggravated by overwork, bad diet and lack of sleep. Inflammation of the eyes was induced by too much work at night. A third affliction, eruption of carbuncles or boils, "was probably brought on by general physical debility to which the various features of Marx's style of life — alcohol, tobacco, poor diet, and failure to sleep — all contributed. Engels often exhorted Marx to alter this dangerous regime". In Professor Siegel's thesis, what lay behind this punishing sacrifice of his health may have been guilt about self-involvement and egoism, originally induced in Karl Marx by his father.&lt;ref&gt;Seigel, 495-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a [[retrodiagnosis]] of Marx's skin disease was made by [[dermatologist]] Sam Shuster of [[Newcastle University]] and for Shuster the most probable explanation was that Marx suffered not from liver problems, but from [[hidradenitis suppurativa]], a recurring infective condition arising from blockage of [[apocrine]] ducts opening into [[hair follicles]]. This condition, which was not described in the English medical literature until 1933 (hence would not have been known to Marx's physicians), can produce joint pain (which could be misdiagnosed as rheumatic disorder) and painful eye conditions. To arrive at his retrodiagnosis, Shuster considered the primary material: the Marx correspondence published in the 50 volumes of the ''Marx/Engels Collected Works''. There, "although the skin lesions were called 'furuncules', 'boils' and 'carbuncles' by Marx, his wife and his physicians, they were too persistent, recurrent, destructive and site-specific for that diagnosis". The sites of the persistent 'carbuncles' were noted repeatedly in the armpits, groins, [[perianal]], [[genital]] ([[Human penis|penis]] and [[scrotum]]) and [[suprapubic]] regions and inner thighs, "favoured sites of hidradenitis suppurativa". Professor Shuster claimed the diagnosis "can now be made definitively".&lt;ref&gt;Shuster, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuster went on to consider the potential [[psychosocial]] effects of the disease, noting that the skin is an organ of communication and that hidradenitis suppurativa produces much psychological distress, including loathing and disgust and depression of self-image, mood and well-being, feelings for which Shuster found "much evidence" in the Marx correspondence. Professor Shuster went on to ask himself whether the mental effects of the disease affected Marx's work and even helped him to develop [[Marx's theory of alienation|his theory of alienation]].&lt;ref&gt;Shuster, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Grave of Karl Marx Highgate Cemetery in London 2016 (10).jpg|thumb|[[Tomb of Karl Marx]], East [[Highgate Cemetery]], London]]

Following the death of his wife Jenny in December 1881, Marx developed a [[catarrh]] that kept him in ill health for the last 15 months of his life. It eventually brought on the [[bronchitis]] and [[pleurisy]] that killed him in London on 14 March 1883 (age 64), dying a [[Statelessness|stateless person]].&lt;ref name="stateless"/&gt; Family and friends in London buried his body in [[Highgate Cemetery]] (East), London, on 17 March 1883 in an area reserved for agnostics and atheists ([[George Eliot]]'s grave is nearby). There were between nine and eleven mourners at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KOyuSakn80C&amp;pg=PA382 p. 382].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt;

Several of his closest friends spoke at his funeral, including [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] and Friedrich Engels. Engels' speech included the passage: {{quote|On the 14th&amp;nbsp;of March, at a quarter to three in the afternoon, the greatest living thinker ceased to think. He had been left alone for scarcely two minutes, and when we came back we found him in his armchair, peacefully gone to sleep—but forever.&lt;ref name="1883: The death of Karl Marx"/&gt;}}

Marx's surviving daughters [[Eleanor Marx|Eleanor]] and [[Laura Marx|Laura]], as well as [[Charles Longuet]] and [[Paul Lafargue]], Marx's two French socialist sons-in-law, were also in attendance.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; He had been predeceased by his wife and his eldest daughter, the latter dying a few months earlier in January 1883. Liebknecht, a founder and leader of the German Social Democratic Party, gave a speech in German and Longuet, a prominent figure in the French working-class movement, made a short statement in French.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; Two [[telegram]]s from workers' parties in France and Spain were also read out.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; Together with Engels's speech, this constituted the entire programme of the funeral.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; Non-relatives attending the funeral included three communist associates of Marx: Friedrich Lessner, imprisoned for three years after the Cologne communist trial of 1852; G. Lochner, whom Engels described as "an old member of the Communist League"; and [[Carl Schorlemmer]], a professor of chemistry in Manchester, a member of the [[Royal Society]] and a communist activist involved in the 1848 [[Revolution in Baden|Baden revolution]].&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt; Another attendee of the funeral was [[Ray Lankester]], a British zoologist who would later become a prominent academic.&lt;ref name="GouldMcGarr2007"/&gt;

Upon his own death in 1895, Engels left Marx's two surviving daughters a "significant portion" of his considerable estate (valued in 2011 at US$4.8m).&lt;ref name=Montefiore /&gt;

Marx and his family were reburied on a new site nearby in November 1954. The [[Tomb of Karl Marx|tomb]] at the new site, unveiled on 14 March 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The posthumous life of Karl Marx, Highgate Cemetery|url=http://thelondondead.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/the-posthumous-life-of-karl-marx.html|website=The London Dead|date=7 July 2014|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; bears the carved message: "[[Workers of the world, unite!|Workers of All Lands Unite]]", the final line of ''The Communist Manifesto''; and, from the 11th "[[Theses on Feuerbach|Thesis on Feuerbach]]" (as edited by Engels), "The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways{{mdash}}the point however is to change it".&lt;ref name="wh1" /&gt; The [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] had the monument with a portrait bust by [[Laurence Bradshaw]] erected and Marx's original tomb had only humble adornment.&lt;ref name="wh1"/&gt; In 1970, there was an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the monument using a homemade bomb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/111705/cn111705_11.htm "Tomb raiders' failed attack on Marx grave"], ''Camden New Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] remarked: "One cannot say Marx died a failure" because although he had not achieved a large following of disciples in Britain, his writings had already begun to make an impact on the leftist movements in Germany and Russia. Within 25 years of his death, the continental European socialist parties that acknowledged Marx's influence on their politics were each gaining between 15 and 47 per cent in those countries with [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] elections.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hob11|Hobsbawm 2011]]. pp. 03–04.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==
{{Marxism}}

===Influences===
{{Main article|Influences on Karl Marx}}
Marx's thought demonstrates influences from many thinkers including, but not limited to:
* [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus']] philosophy, including the forceful and equal redistribution of resources (land) and the equality of all citizens&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/lycurgus.html Biography of Lycurgus]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s philosophy&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt;
* The classical [[political economy]] (economics) of [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt;, as well as [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]]'s critique of laissez-faire economics and analysis of the precarious state of the proletariat&lt;ref name="Paresh" /&gt;
* [[History of the Left in France|French socialist thought]],&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt; in particular the thought of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Charles Fourier]]&lt;ref name="Beilharz1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;
* Earlier German philosophical materialism among the [[Young Hegelians]], particularly that of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Bruno Bauer]],&lt;ref name=et/&gt; as well as the French materialism of the late 18th century, including [[Diderot]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]] and [[d'Holbach]]
* The working class analysis by [[Friedrich Engels]],&lt;ref name="Bottomore1991"/&gt; as well as the early descriptions of class provided by French liberals and Saint-Simonians such as [[François Guizot]] and [[Augustin Thierry]]
* Marx's Judaic legacy has been identified as formative to both his moral outlook&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry ''Why Marx Was Right''  Yale University Press, 2011, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; and his materialist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Seigel, Jerrold  ''Marx's Fate'' Princeton University Press, 1978, pp.  112–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx's view of history, which came to be called [[historical materialism]] (controversially adapted as the philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]] by Engels and Lenin), certainly shows the influence of Hegel's claim that one should view reality (and history) [[dialectic]]ally.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; However, Hegel had thought in [[idealist]] terms, putting ideas in the forefront, whereas Marx sought to rewrite dialectics in [[materialist]] terms, arguing for the primacy of matter over idea.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Where Hegel saw the "spirit" as driving history, Marx saw this as an unnecessary mystification, obscuring the reality of humanity and its physical actions shaping the world.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; He wrote that Hegelianism stood the movement of reality on its head, and that one needed to set it upon its feet.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Despite his dislike of mystical terms, Marx used [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] language in several of his works: in ''The Communist Manifesto'' he proclaims "A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre", and in ''The Capital'' he refers to capital as "[[necromancy]] that surrounds the products of labour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/OPE/archive/0604/att-0138/01-PoliticalEconOfTheDead.pdf|author=Mark Neocleous|title=THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE DEAD: MARX's VAMPIRES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though inspired by French socialist and sociological thought,&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt; Marx criticised [[utopian socialists]], arguing that their favoured small-scale socialistic communities would be bound to marginalisation and poverty and that only a large-scale change in the [[economic system]] can bring about real change.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;

The other important contributions to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of [[class conflict]] and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution&lt;ref name="Bottomore1991"/&gt;, as well as from the social democrat [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schulz]], who in ''Die Bewegung der Produktion'' described the movement of society as "flowing from the contradiction between the forces of production and the mode of production."&lt;ref name="Levine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx believed that he could study history and society scientifically and discern tendencies of history and the resulting outcome of social conflicts. Some followers of Marx therefore concluded that a communist revolution would inevitably occur. However, Marx famously asserted in the eleventh of his "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]" that "philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point however is to change it" and he clearly dedicated himself to trying to alter the world.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wh1"/&gt;

===Philosophy and social thought===
Marx's polemic with other thinkers often occurred through [[critique]] and thus he has been called "the first great user of [[critical method]] in social sciences".&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt; He criticised speculative philosophy, equating [[metaphysics]] with ideology.&lt;ref name="Bannerji2001"/&gt; By adopting this approach, Marx attempted to separate key findings from ideological biases.&lt;ref name="Sherman1995"/&gt; This set him apart from many contemporary philosophers.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/&gt;

Like Tocqueville, who described a faceless and bureaucratic despotism with no identifiable despot,&lt;ref&gt;Annelien de Dijn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a3SFelqBLw8C&amp;dq= ''French Political Thought from Montesquieu to Tocqueville''], Cambridge University Press, 2008, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx also broke with classical thinkers who spoke of a single tyrant and with [[Montesquieu]], who discussed the nature of the single despot. Instead, Marx set out to analyse "the despotism of capital".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx. ''Capital: A Critique of Political Economy'', vol. 1, trans. Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling (New York: Modem Library, 1906), 440.&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamentally, Marx assumed that [[human history]] involves transforming [[human nature]], which encompasses both human beings and material objects.&lt;ref name="Ollman1973"/&gt; Humans recognise that they possess both actual and potential selves.&lt;ref name = "Marx_labour"&gt;Marx K (1999).

Original work published 1844.&lt;/ref&gt; For both Marx and Hegel, self-development begins with an experience of internal [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] stemming from this recognition, followed by a realisation that the actual self, as a [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] agent, renders its potential counterpart an [[Object (philosophy)|object]] to be apprehended.&lt;ref name = "Marx_critique"/&gt; Marx further argues that by moulding nature&lt;ref name = "Lefever"&gt;See also Lefever DM; Lefever JT (1977).

[[File:Marx et Engels à Shanghai.jpg|upright|thumb|A monument dedicated to Marx and Engels in [[Shanghai]], [[China]]]]
Marx had a special concern with how people relate to their own labour power.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt; He wrote extensively about this in terms of the problem of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]].&lt;ref name="Mészáros2006"/&gt; As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt; Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt; For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt; Marx described this loss as [[commodity fetishism]], in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.&lt;ref name="Balibar1995"/&gt;

[[Commodity fetishism]] provides an example of what Engels called "[[false consciousness]]",&lt;ref name="KołakowskiFalla2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Leszek Kołakowski|author2=Paul Stephen Falla|title=Main currents of Marxism: the founders, the golden age, the breakdown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUCxpznbkaoC&amp;pg=PA226|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=29 October 2005|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-06054-6|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; which relates closely to the understanding of ideology. By "ideology", Marx and Engels meant ideas that reflect the interests of a particular class at a particular time in history, but which contemporaries see as universal and eternal.&lt;ref name="Hernadi1989"/&gt; Marx and Engels's point was not only that such beliefs are at best half-truths, as they serve an important political function. Put another way, the control that one class exercises over the means of production includes not only the production of food or manufactured goods, but also the production of ideas (this provides one possible explanation for why members of a subordinate class may hold ideas contrary to their own interests).&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson1990"/&gt; An example of this sort of analysis is Marx's understanding of religion, summed up in a passage from the preface&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm Introduction] to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, in: ''[[Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher]]'', February 1844&lt;/ref&gt; to his 1843 ''Contribution to the [[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]'': {{quote|Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering.

Whereas his [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] senior thesis at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium (Trier)|de|3=Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium (Trier)|lt=Gymnasium zu Trier}} argued that religion had as its primary social aim the promotion of [[solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]], here Marx sees the social function of religion in terms of highlighting/preserving political and economic ''status quo'' and [[Economic inequality|inequality]].&lt;ref name="SwatosKivisto1998"/&gt;

====Economy, history and society====
{{further information|Marxian economics}}
[[File:Murales Rivera - Treppenhaus 7 Marx.jpg|thumb|right|Mural by [[Diego Rivera]] showing Karl Marx. In the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] in [[Mexico City]].]]
Marx's thoughts on labour were related to the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also [[economic determinism]]).&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; [[Accumulation of capital]] shapes the [[social system]].&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; For Marx, [[social change]] was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the [[conflict theory]].&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; In his [[sociocultural evolution|evolutionary]] model of history, he argued that [[human history]] began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;

The organisation of society depends on [[means of production]]. The means of production are all things required to produce material goods, such as land, natural resources and technology but not human labor.  The [[relations of production]] are the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Together, these compose the [[mode of production]] and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of modes of production. Marx differentiated between [[base and superstructure]], where the base (or substructure) is the economic system and superstructure is the cultural and political system.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Marx regarded this mismatch between economic base and social [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] as a major source of social disruption and conflict.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;

Despite Marx's stress on critique of capitalism and discussion of the new [[communist society]] that should replace it, his explicit critique is guarded, as he saw it as an improved society compared to the past ones ([[slavery]] and [[feudalism]]).&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Marx never clearly discusses issues of [[morality]] and [[justice]], but scholars agree that his work contained [[Logical implication|implicit]] discussion of those concepts.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

Marx's view of capitalism was two-sided.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood1993"/&gt; On one hand, in the 19th century's deepest critique of the dehumanising aspects of this system he noted that defining features of capitalism include alienation, exploitation and recurring, cyclical [[economic depressions|depressions]] leading to mass unemployment. On the other hand, he characterized capitalism as "revolutionising, industrialising and universalising qualities of development, growth and progressivity" (by which Marx meant industrialisation, urbanisation, [[technological progress]], increased [[productivity]] and growth, [[rationality]] and [[scientific revolution]]) that are responsible for progress.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Marx considered the capitalist class to be one of the most revolutionary in history because it constantly improved the means of production, more so than any other class in history and was responsible for the overthrow of [[feudalism]].&lt;ref name="Clark1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert2010" /&gt; Capitalism can stimulate considerable growth because the capitalist has an incentive to reinvest profits in new technologies and [[capital equipment]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-22"/&gt;

According to Marx, capitalists take advantage of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce. Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices. Marx called the difference "[[surplus value]]" and argued that it was based on [[surplus labour]], the difference between what it costs to keep workers alive and what they can produce.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Although Marx describes capitalists as [[vampire]]s sucking worker's blood,&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; he notes that drawing profit is "by no means an injustice"&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; and that capitalists cannot go against the system.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; The problem is the "cancerous cell" of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], understood not as property or equipment, but the relations between workers and owners—the economic system in general.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt;

At the same time, Marx stressed that capitalism was unstable and prone to [[crisis theory|periodic crises]].&lt;ref name=wk/&gt; He suggested that over time capitalists would invest more and more in new technologies and less and less in labour.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Since Marx believed that profit derived from surplus value appropriated from labour, he concluded that the rate of profit would fall as the economy grows.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; Marx believed that increasingly severe crises would punctuate this [[business cycles|cycle]] of growth and collapse.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; Moreover, he believed that in the long-term, this process would enrich and [[empowerment|empower]] the capitalist class and impoverish the proletariat.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; In section one of ''The Communist Manifesto'', Marx describes [[feudalism]], capitalism and the role internal social contradictions play in the historical process:
{{quote|We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged&amp;nbsp;... the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder. Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it, and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class. A similar movement is going on before our own eyes&amp;nbsp;... The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring order into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;}}

[[File:MandK Industrial Revolution 1900.jpg|thumb|Outside a factory in [[Oldham]]. Marx believed that industrial workers (the [[proletariat]]) would rise up around the world.]]

Marx believed that those structural contradictions within capitalism necessitate its end, giving way to socialism, or a post-capitalistic, communist society:
{{quote|The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.&lt;ref name="manifesto"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Thanks to various processes overseen by capitalism, such as urbanisation, the working class, the proletariat, should grow in numbers and develop [[class consciousness]], in time realising that they can and must change the system.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; Marx believed that if the proletariat were to seize the means of production, they would encourage social relations that would benefit everyone equally, abolishing exploiting class and introduce a system of production less vulnerable to cyclical crises.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-20-23"/&gt; Marx argued in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' that capitalism will end through the organised actions of an international working class: {{quote|Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality will have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.&lt;ref name="Elster1985"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In this new society, the alienation would end and humans would be free to act without being bound by the labour market.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; It would be a democratic society, enfranchising the entire population.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; In such a [[utopia]]n world, there would also be little need for a state, whose goal was previously to enforce the alienation.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23"/&gt; Marx theorised that between capitalism and the establishment of a socialist/communist system, would exist a period of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]—where the working class holds political power and forcibly socialises the means of production.&lt;ref name="Clark1998"/&gt; As he wrote in his ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'', "between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat".&lt;ref name="Karl Marx:Critique of the Gotha Programme"/&gt; While he allowed for the possibility of peaceful transition in some countries with strong democratic institutional structures (such as Britain, the United States and the Netherlands), he suggested that in other countries in which workers cannot "attain their goal by peaceful means" the "lever of our revolution must be force".&lt;ref&gt;"You know that the institutions, mores, and traditions of various countries must be taken into consideration, and we do not deny that there are countries – such as America, England, and if I were more familiar with your institutions, I would perhaps also add Holland – where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means. This being the case, we must also recognise the fact that in most countries on the Continent the lever of our revolution must be force; it is force to which we must some day appeal to erect the rule of labour."

Marx viewed [[Russian Empire|Russia]] as the main counter-revolutionary threat to European revolutions.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;Kevin B. Anderson (2016).

University of Chicago Press. pp.49-239. {{ISBN|022634570X}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Crimean War]], Marx backed the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its allies Britain and France against Russia.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt; He was absolutely opposed to [[Pan-Slavism]], viewing it as an instrument of Russian foreign policy.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt; Marx had considered the [[Slavs|Slavic]] nations except [[Poles]] as 'counter-revolutionary'. Marx and Engels published in the ''Neue Rheinische Zeitung'' in February 1849:

{{quote|To the sentimental phrases about brotherhood which we are being offered here on behalf of the most counter-revolutionary nations of Europe, we reply that hatred of Russians was and still is the primary revolutionary passion among Germans; that since the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolution]] [of 1848] hatred of Czechs and Croats has been added, and that only by the most determined use of terror against these Slav peoples can we, jointly with the Poles and Magyars, safeguard the revolution. We know where the enemies of the revolution are concentrated, ''viz''. in Russia and the Slav regions of Austria, and no fine phrases, no allusions to an undefined democratic future for these countries can deter us from treating our enemies as enemies. Then there will be a struggle, an “inexorable life-and-death struggle”, against those Slavs who betray the revolution; an annihilating fight and ruthless terror — not in the interests of Germany, but in the interests of the revolution!"&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: B. Hepner, “Marx et la puissance russe,” in: K. Marx, ''La Russie et l'Europe'', Paris, 1954, p. 20.

Marx and Engels sympathised with the [[Narodniks|Narodnik]] revolutionaries of the 1860s and 1870s. When the [[Narodnaya Volya|Russian revolutionaries]] assassinated Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], Marx expressed the hope that the assassination foreshadowed ‘the formation of a Russian commune’.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels to the Chairman of the Slavonic Meeting, 21 March 1881. Source: Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, ''Selected Correspondence'' (Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; Marx supported the [[Polish–Russian Wars|Polish uprisings]] against tsarist Russia.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt; He said in a speech in London in 1867:

{{quote|In the first place the policy of Russia is changeless... Its methods, its tactics, its manoeuvres may change, but the polar star of its policy – world domination – is a fixed star. In our times only a civilised government ruling over barbarian masses can hatch out such a plan and execute it. ... There is but one alternative for Europe. Either Asiatic barbarism, under Muscovite direction, will burst around its head like an avalanche, or else it must re-establish Poland, thus putting twenty million heroes between itself and Asia and gaining a breathing spell for the accomplishment of its social regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Speech delivered in London, probably to a meeting of the International’s General Council and the Polish Workers Society on 22 January 1867, text published in ''Le Socialisme'', 15 March 1908; ''Odbudowa Polski'' (Warsaw, 1910), pp. 119–23; ''Mysl Socjalistyczna'', May 1908.

Marx supported the cause of [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish independence]]&lt;!--The quote shows he meant more than Home Rule. He also seemed to be confusing England and Great Britain.--&gt;. In 1867, he wrote Engels: "I used to think the separation of Ireland from England impossible. I now think it inevitable. The English working class will never accomplish anything until it has got rid of Ireland. ... English reaction in England had its roots ... in the subjugation of Ireland."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/01/archives/karl-marx-and-the-irish.html Karl Marx and the Irish]". ''The New York Times.'' December 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx spent some time in [[French Algeria]], which had been [[French conquest of Algeria|invaded]] and made a [[French colonial empire |French colony]] in 1830, and had opportunity to observe life in colonial North Africa. He wrote about the colonial justice system, in which "a form of torture has been used (and this happens ‘regularly’) to extract confessions from the Arabs; naturally it is done (like the English in India) by the ‘police’; the judge is supposed to know nothing at all about it."&lt;ref name="alahram"/&gt; Marx was surprised by the arrogance of many [[Pied-Noir|European settlers]] in Algiers and wrote in a letter: "when a European colonist dwells among the ‘lesser breeds,’ either as a settler or even on business, he generally regards himself as even more inviolable than handsome William I [a Prussian king]. Still, when it comes to bare-faced arrogance and presumptuousness vis-à-vis the ‘lesser breeds,’ the British and Dutch outdo the French."&lt;ref name="alahram"/&gt; 

According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'': "Marx’s analysis of colonialism as a progressive force bringing modernization to a backward feudal society sounds like a transparent rationalization for foreign domination. His account of British domination, however, reflects the same ambivalence that he shows towards capitalism in Europe. In both cases, Marx recognizes the immense suffering brought about during the transition from feudal to bourgeois society while insisting that the transition is both necessary and ultimately progressive. He argues that the penetration of foreign commerce will cause a social revolution in India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Colonialism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/ |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Marx discussed [[British Empire|British]] [[British Raj|colonial rule]] in [[Colonial India|India]] in the ''New York Herald Tribune'' in June 1853: 

{{quote|There cannot remain any doubt but that the misery inflicted by the British on Hindostan [India] is of an essentially different and infinitely more intensive kind than all Hindostan had to suffer before. England has broken down the entire framework of Indian society, without any symptoms of reconstitution yet appearing... [however], we must not forget that these idyllic village communities, inoffensive though they may appear, had always been the solid foundation of Oriental despotism, that they restrained the human mind within the smallest possible compass, making it the unresisting tool of superstition.&lt;ref name="alahram"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marx in Algiers |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/24784.aspx |work=Al-Ahram}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marx on India under the British |url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/marx-on-india-under-the-british/article3209143.ece |work=The Hindu |date=13 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Marx's ideas have had a profound impact on world politics and intellectual thought.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manchester"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, Francis (17 July 2005).

''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan2010"/&gt; Followers of Marx have often debated amongst themselves over how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world.&lt;ref name="AndersenKaspersen2000"/&gt; The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include [[Leninism]], [[Marxism–Leninism]], [[Trotskyism]], [[Maoism]], [[Luxemburgism]] and [[libertarian Marxism]].&lt;ref name="AndersenKaspersen2000"/&gt; Various currents have also developed in [[Marxism#Academic Marxism|academic Marxism]], often under influence of other views, resulting in [[structuralist Marxism]], historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, [[analytical Marxism]] and Hegelian Marxism.&lt;ref name="AndersenKaspersen2000"/&gt;

From an academic perspective, Marx's work contributed to the birth of modern sociology. He has been cited as one of the 19th century's three masters of the "school of suspicion" alongside [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]&lt;ref&gt;Ricoeur, Paul. ''Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1970, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and as one of the three principal architects of modern [[social science]] along with [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; In contrast to other philosophers, Marx offered theories that could often be tested with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-23-24"/&gt; Both Marx and [[Auguste Comte]] set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European [[secularisation]] and new developments in the [[philosophy of history|philosophies of history]] and science. Working in the Hegelian tradition, Marx rejected Comtean [[sociological positivism]] in attempt to develop a ''science of society''.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-19"/&gt; [[Karl Löwith]] considered Marx and [[Søren Kierkegaard]] to be the two greatest Hegelian philosophical successors.&lt;ref&gt;Löwith, Karl. ''From Hegel to Nietzsche''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1991, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[sociological theory]], [[Marxist sociology]] is recognised as one of the main classical perspectives.

Social theorists of the 20th and 21st centuries have pursued two main strategies in response to Marx. One move has been to reduce it to its analytical core, known as analytical Marxism. Another, more common, move has been to dilute the explanatory claims of Marx's social theory and emphasise the "relative autonomy" of aspects of social and economic life not directly related to Marx's central narrative of interaction between the development of the "forces of production" and the succession of "modes of production". Such has been for example the neo-Marxist theorising adopted by historians inspired by Marx's social theory, such as [[E. P. Thompson]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. It has also been a line of thinking pursued by thinkers and activists like [[Antonio Gramsci]] who have sought to understand the opportunities and the difficulties of transformative political practice, seen in the light of Marxist social theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kołakowski, Leszek.

As the term may have multiple meanings in multiple environments, research on locura is limited and conflicting.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The term can be used loosely in Spanish when discussing madness in other psychological meaning, specifically describing a "deviance from the norm due to mental illness."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Besides for the implications found in the DSM-IV, the word is not used in English.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Classification ==
In the fourth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-IV]]), locura is classified as a culture-bound syndrome. Culture-bound syndromes can be found in an appendix of the manual named, ''Outline for Cultural Formulation and Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes.''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the [[DSM-5|DSM - 5]] does not include locura in its equivalent appendix named, ''Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|last=|first=|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|isbn=|edition=Fifth|location=Arlington, VA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One author chooses to describe the symptoms as correlating to a [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatoform disorder]] of conversive type.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Locura is thought to develop during times of stress or vulnerability in one's life, as well as the accumulation of difficulties or traumas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another possible cause is through the manifestation of supernatural maneuvers,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; or maleficios (meaning "curses").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spanishcentral.com/translate/maleficio|title=Maleficio - Spanish to English Translation {{!}} Spanish Central|website=www.spanishcentral.com|language=en_US|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-IV includes symptoms of incoherence, agitation, inability to follow rules of social interaction, unpredictability, and possible violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other sources include headache, fainting, convulsive attacks, difficulty in breathing, an urge to run away, hallucinations, and visions of people, visions, or demons.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== History  ==
Locura has been examined in an indigenous group in [[Colombia]] called [[Emberá people|Embera]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After four members of the Embera community began exhibiting symptoms later described as, "repetitive episodes of what resembled a dissociative fugue disorder,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a local shaman explained that the outbreak could be attributed to a shaman from a different region. The local shaman attempted their own treatment, but the affected member's symptoms continued and after six months, they eventually chose to seek help in the closest province. Soon after they arrived, their local relatives began to develop the same symptoms. After five more individuals presented similarly, all nine members began seeking forms of treatment including care from different types of religious healers, psychiatrists, and antipsychotic drugs. After none of these tactics proved successful, a shaman from the [[Chocó Department|Chocó]] province in Columbia was brought to attempt treatment. The shaman's treatments reportedly reduced the frequency of the symptoms greatly in all of the patients and eliminated symptoms completely in two patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">[[Mahjong]] is a strategy-based title game developed during the Qing dynasty in China&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516224304/http://gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Culin/Majong1924/index.html|title=Majong|last=|first=|date=|website=Game Museum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=11/02/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since spread worldwide. The game has a long history and significance in many countries particularly in Asia. Places like China and Japan has especially strong cultural ties to the game. In China, the game has evolved to represent peace and friendship. Inviting someone to a game of Mahjong almost synonymous with friendship. Expensive Mahjong sets can be seen as a status symbol and are a source of pride among Chinese families.

==Hong Kong==
In [[Hong Kong]]:

*During a [[Chinese marriage|Chinese wedding banquet]], guests play Mahjong during the waiting time.  
*A count-down Mahjong before the [[Chinese New Year]] or the [[New Year]] is a typical practice for many [[Hong Kong]] families.
*While most people have a Mahjong set at home, most Chinese restaurants offer sets of Mahjong equipment for their customers.
*Officially, [[casino]]s are illegal in Hong Kong. However, there are legal [[Mahjong school]]s, where gamblers can play Mahjong.
*The elderly are encouraged to play Mahjong as brain exercise.
*To invite a person to a Mahjong game is an indication of friendliness in [[Chinese Culture]].
 
However, Mahjong games also create problems.  Addiction to Mahjong is a common type of [[problem gambling]].  Mahjong is also a favourite medium for [[bribery]] - the person giving the bribe will intentionally lose large sums of money to the person being bribed. Recent studies also suggest Mahjong can cause epilepsy &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6931119.stm http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6931119.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hindu philosophy}}

'''Mīmāṃsā''' is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means "reflection" or "critical investigation" and thus refers to a tradition of brahminical thought which reflected on the meanings of certain [[Vedic]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mimamsa Mimamsa] Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britenc&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/383181/Mimamsa Mimamsa] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition is also known as '''Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā''' because of its focus on the earlier (''pūrva'') Vedic texts dealing with ritual actions, and similarly as '''Karma-Mīmāṃsā''' due to its focus on ritual action (''karma'')&lt;ref name=olil2&gt;Chris Bartley (2013), Purva Mimamsa, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'' (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, 978-0415862530, page 443-445&lt;/ref&gt;. It is one of six Vedic "affirming" ([[Āstika and nāstika|āstika]]) schools of [[Hinduism]]. This particular school is known for its philosophical theories on the nature of [[dharma]], based on [[hermeneutics]] of the [[Vedas]], especially the [[Brahmana|Brāḥmanas]] and [[Saṃhita|Saṃhitas]].&lt;ref name=olil&gt;Oliver Leaman (2006), Shruti, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, page 503&lt;/ref&gt; The Mīmāṃsā school was foundational and influential for the [[Vedanta|vedāntic]] schools, which were also known as '''Uttara-Mīmāṃsā''' for their focus on the "later" (''uttara'') portions of the Vedas, the [[Upaniṣads]]. While both "earlier" and "later" Mīmāṃsā investigate the aim of human action, they do so with different attitudes towards the necessity of ritual praxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ram-Prasad |first1=Chakravarti |title=Knowledge and Action 1: Means to the Human End in Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā and Advaita Vedānta |journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy |date=2000 |volume=1 |issue=28 |pages=1-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mīmāṃsā has several sub-schools, each defined by its [[epistemology]]. The Prābhākara sub-school, which takes its name from the seventh-century philosopher [[Prabhākara]], described the five epistemically reliable means to gaining knowledge: ''[[pratyaksha|pratyakṣa]]'' or perception; ''anumāna'' or inference; ''[[upamāṇa]]'', by comparison and analogy; ''arthāpatti'', the use of postulation and derivation from circumstances; and ''[[śabda]]'', the word or testimony of past or present reliable experts.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt; The Bhāṭṭa sub-school, from philosopher [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]], added a sixth means to its canon; ''[[anupalabdhi]]'' meant non-perception, or proof by the absence of cognition (e.g., the ''lack'' of gunpowder on a suspect's hand)&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=jag&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The school of Mīmāṃsā consists of both [[atheism|atheistic]] and [[theism|theistic]] doctrines, but the school showed little interest in systematic examination of the existence of Gods. Rather, it held that the soul is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active spiritual essence, and focused on the epistemology and metaphysics of ''dharma''.&lt;ref name=olil2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neville|first=Robert|title=Religious truth|year=2001|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Worthington|first=Vivian|title=A history of yoga|year=1982|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aI9AAAAIAAJ|page=66|isbn=9780710092588}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Mīmāṃsā school,  ''[[dharma]]'' meant rituals and social duties, not ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]]'', or gods, because gods existed only in name.&lt;ref name=olil2/&gt; The Mīmāṃsakas also held that Vedas are "eternal, author-less, [and] infallible", that Vedic ''vidhi'', or injunctions and [[mantra]]s in rituals are prescriptive ''kārya'' or actions, and the rituals are of primary importance and merit. They considered the Upaniṣads and other texts related to self-knowledge and spirituality as subsidiary, a philosophical view that Vedānta disagreed with.&lt;ref name=olil/&gt;&lt;ref name=olil2/&gt;

Mīmāṃsā gave rise to the study of [[philology]] and the [[philosophy of language]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Scharf, ''The Denotation of Generic Terms in Ancient Indian Philosophy'' (1996), Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; While their deep analysis of language and [[linguistics]] influenced other schools of Hinduism,&lt;ref&gt;Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus (2011), Sound and Communication: An Aesthetic Cultural History of Sanskrit Hinduism, Walter de Gruyter GmbH (Berlin), {{ISBN|978-3110181593}}, pages 23-24, 551-663&lt;/ref&gt; their views were not shared by others. Mīmāṃsakas considered the purpose and power of language was to clearly ''prescribe'' the proper, correct and right. In contrast, Vedāntins extended the scope and value of language as a tool to also ''describe'', ''develop'' and ''derive''.&lt;ref name=olil2/&gt; Mīmāṃsakas considered orderly, law driven, procedural life as central purpose and noblest necessity of [[dharma]] and society, and divine (theistic) sustenance means to that end.

The Mīmāṃsā school is a form of [[philosophical realism]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120810860}}, page 323-325&lt;/ref&gt; A key text of the Mīmāṃsā school is the [[Purva Mimamsa Sutras|Mīmāṃsā Sūtra]] of [[Jaimini]].&lt;ref name=olil2/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhiri&gt;M. Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120810860}}, page 298-335&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Mīmāṃsā, also romanized Mimansa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M.C. Nyayaratna|title=The Mimansa Darsana |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Welq8SN8tPEC|year=1863|publisher=Bishop's College Press|pages=Cover Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Mimamsa,&lt;ref name=britenc/&gt; means "reflection, consideration, profound thought, investigation, examination, discussion" in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsm&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html Mimamsa], Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon (Germany)&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to the "examination of the Vedic text"&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsm/&gt; and to a school of Hindu philosophy that is also known as {{IAST|''Pūrva Mīmāṃsā''}} ("prior" inquiry, also {{IAST|''Karma-Mīmāṃsā''}}), in contrast to  {{IAST|''Uttara Mīmāṃsā''}} ("posterior" inquiry, also {{IAST|''Jñāna-Mīmāṃsā''}}) – the opposing school of [[Vedanta]]. This division is based on classification of the Vedic texts into ''{{IAST|karmakāṇḍa}}'', the early sections of the Veda treating of mantras and rituals ([[Samhita]]s and [[Brahmana]]s), and the ''{{IAST|jñānakāṇḍa}}'' dealing with the meditation, reflection and knowledge of Self, Oneness, [[Brahman]] (the Upaniṣads).&lt;ref name=olil/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhiri/&gt; Between the ''Samhitas'' and ''Brahmanas'', the Mīmāṃsā school places greater emphasis to the Brahmanas - the part of Vedas that is a commentary on Vedic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120810860}}, page 299&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Davis translates Mīmāṃsā as the "desire to think", and in colloquial historical context as "how to think and interpret things".&lt;ref name="DonaldRDavidJr2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald R. Davis, Jr |title=The Spirit of Hindu Law |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9oEhAwAAQBAJ |year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-48531-9 |pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last centuries of the first millennium BCE, the word Mīmāṃsā began to denote the thoughts on and interpretation of the Vedas, first as ''Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā'' for rituals portions in the earlier layers of texts in the Vedas, and as ''Uttara-Mīmāṃsā'' for the philosophical portions in the last layers.&lt;ref name="DonaldRDavidJr2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fxclooneyp25"/&gt; Over time, Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā was just known as the Mīmāṃsā school, and the Uttara-Mīmāṃsā as the [[Vedanta]] school.&lt;ref name="fxclooneyp25"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Xavier Clooney |title=Thinking Ritually: Rediscovering the Pūrva Mīmāṃsā of Jaimini |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86zWAAAAMAAJ |year=1990|publisher=De Nobili, Vienna |isbn=978-3-900271-21-3 |pages=25–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mīmāṃsā scholars are referred to as ''Mīmāṃsāka''s.{{sfn|Francis X. Clooney|1997|p=337}}

{{See|Hindu philosophy}}

Mīmānsā is one of the six classical Hindu ''darśanas''. It is among the earliest schools of Hindu philosophies.&lt;ref name=britenc/&gt; It has attracted relatively less scholarly study, although its theories and particularly its questions on exegesis and theology have been highly influential on all classical Indian philosophies.{{sfn|Francis X. Clooney|1997|pp=337-340}}{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=26-31}}{{sfn|Dan Arnold|2008|pp=57-61, 89-98}} Its analysis of language has been of central importance to the legal literature of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurice Winternitz|authorlink=Moriz Winternitz|title=History of Indian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ql0BmInD1c4C |year=1963|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0056-4|pages=511–512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Mīmānsā's central concern was [[epistemology]] (''[[pramana]]''), that is what are the reliable means to knowledge. It debated not only "how does man ever learn or know, whatever he knows", but also whether the nature of all knowledge is inherently circular, whether those such as [[Foundationalism|foundationalists]] who critique the validity of any "justified beliefs" and knowledge system make flawed presumptions of the very premises they critique, and how to correctly interpret and avoid incorrectly interpreting [[dharma]] texts such as the [[Vedas]].{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=28-32}} It asked questions such as "what is ''devata'' (god)?", "are rituals dedicated to ''devatas'' efficacious?", "what makes anything efficacious?", and "can it be proved that the Vedas, or any canonical text in any system of thought, fallible or infallible (''svatah pramanya'', intrinsically valid)?, if so, how?" and others.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=26-33}}{{sfn|Francis X. Clooney|1997|pp=337-342}} To Mīmānsā scholars, the nature of non-empirical knowledge and human means to it are such that one can never demonstrate certainty, one can only falsify knowledge claims, in some cases.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=27, 29-30}} According to [[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis Clooney]], a professor at Harvard Divinity School specializing on Hinduism, the Mīmānsā school is "one of the most distinctively Hindu forms of thinking; it is without real parallel elsewhere in the world".{{sfn|Francis X. Clooney|1997|p=337}}

The central text of the Mīmānsā school is Jamini's ''Mīmānsā Sutras'', along with the historically influential commentaries on this [[sutra]] by Sabara and by Kumarila Bhatta.{{sfn|Francis X. Clooney|1997|p=337}}{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=27-29}} Together, these texts develop and apply the rules of language analysis (such as the rules of contradiction), asserting that one must not only examine injunctive propositions in any scripture, but also examine the alternate related or reverse propositions for better understanding. They suggested that to reach correct and valid knowledge it is not only sufficient to demand proof of a proposition, it is important to give proof of a proposition's negative as well as declare and prove one's own preferred propositions. Further, they asserted that whenever perception is not the means of direct proof and knowledge, one cannot prove such non-empirical propositions to be "true or not true", rather one can only prove a non-empirical proposition is "false, not false, or uncertain".{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=28-35}}

For example, Mīmānsākas welcome not only the demand for proof of an injunctive proposition such as "[[agnihotra]] ritual leads one to heaven", but suggest that one must examine and prove alternate propositions such as "ritual does not lead one to heaven",  "something else leads one to heaven", "there is heaven", "there is no heaven" and so on. Mīmānsā literature states that if satisfactory, verifiable proof for all of such propositions cannot be found by its proponents and its opponents, then the proposition needs to be accepted as a part of a "belief system".{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=27-29}}{{sfn|Dan Arnold|2008|pp=57-79}} Beliefs, such as those in the scriptures (Vedas), must be accepted to be true unless its opponents can demonstrate the proof of validity of their own texts or teacher(s) these opponents presume to be ''prima facie justified'', and until these opponents can demonstrate that the scriptures they challenge are false. If they do not try to do so, it is hypocrisy; if they try to do so, it can only lead to infinite regress, according to Mīmānsākas.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=28-32}}{{sfn|Dan Arnold|2008|pp=89-114}} Any historic scripture with widespread social acceptance, according to Mīmānsāka, is an activity of communication (''vyavaharapravrtti'') and is accepted as authoritative because it is socially validated practice, unless perceptually verifiable evidence emerges that proves parts or all of it as false or harmful.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=31-33, 36-38}}

Mīmānsākas were predominantly concerned with the central motivation of human beings, the [[summum bonum|highest good]], and actions that make this possible.{{sfn|Prasad|1994|pp=317-318}} They stated that human beings seek ''niratisaya priti'' (unending ecstatic pleasure, joy, happiness) in this life and the next. They argued that this highest good is the result of one's own ethical actions (''[[dharma]]''), that such actions are what the Vedic sentences contain and communicate, and therefore it important to properly interpret and understand Vedic sentences, words and meaning.{{sfn|Prasad|1994|pp=317-318}}{{sfn|P. T. Raju|1985|pp=17, 41-47, 61-63, Quote (p. 62): "The ideal life, according to the Mimamsa, is thus a life of continuous ethical activity and enjoyment of its fruits."}} Mīmānsā scholarship was centrally concerned with the philosophy of language, how human beings learn and communicate with each other and across generations with language in order to act in a manner that enables them to achieve that which motivates them.{{sfn|Prasad|1994|pp=317-319}}{{sfn|J.F. Staal|1976|pp=112-117}} The Mīmānsā school focussed on ''dharma'', deriving ethics and activity from the ''karma-kanda'' (rituals) part of the Vedas, with the argument that ethics for this life and efficacious action for ''svarga'' (heaven) cannot be derived from sense-perception, and can only be derived from experience, reflection and understanding of past teachings.{{sfn|Shyam Ranganathan|2007|pp=298-302, 348-349}}

In every human activity, the motivating force to perform an action is his innate longing for ''priti'' (pleasure, happiness&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda, Johannes Bronkhorst and Elisa Freschi translate "priti" as happiness; e.g. see, {{cite book|author=Elisa Freschi|title=Duty, Language and Exegesis in Prabhakara Mimamsa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhX3I99EbQ0C&amp;pg=PA380|year=2012|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-22260-1|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;),
whether at the lowest level or the highest level.
At the highest level, it is nothing but an unsurpassed state of ''priti'',
which is ensured only by performing ethical actions.

According to Daniel Arnold, Mīmānsā scholarship has "striking affinities" with that of [[William Alston]], the 20th century Western philosopher, along with some notable differences.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=41-43}} The Mīmānsākas subjected to a radical critique, more than two thousand years ago, states Francis Clooney, the notions such as "God," the "sacred text," the "author" and the "anthropocentric ordering of reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Why the Veda Has No Author: Language as Ritual in Early Mīmāṃsā and Post-Modern Theology |author= Francis X.

==Epistemology==
In the field of [[epistemology]], later Mīmāṃsākas made some notable contributions. Unlike the [[Nyaya]] or the [[Vaisheshika]] systems, the {{IAST|Prābhākara}} sub-school of Mīmāṃsā recognizes five means of valid knowledge (Skt. ''[[pramāṇa]]''). The {{IAST|Bhāṭṭa}} sub-school of Mīmāṃsā recognizes one additional sixth, namely ''anuapalabdhi'', just like [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism. These six epistemically reliable means of gaining knowledge are:

===Pratyaksa===
Main article : [[Pratyaksha]]

''[[Pratyaksha|Pratyakṣa]]'' (प्रत्यक्ष्य) means perception. It is of two types in Mīmānsā and other schools of Hinduism: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind.&lt;ref name=kamal&gt;MM Kamal (1998), The Epistemology of the Carvaka Philosophy, Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies, 46(2): 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B Matilal (1992), Perception: An Essay in Indian Theories of Knowledge, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198239765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient and medieval Indian texts identify four requirements for correct perception:&lt;ref name=kpmat/&gt; ''Indriyarthasannikarsa'' (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), ''Avyapadesya'' (non-verbal; correct perception is not through [[hearsay]], according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), ''Avyabhicara'' (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and ''Vyavasayatmaka'' (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe).&lt;ref name=kpmat&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 160-168&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient scholars proposed "unusual perception" as ''pramana'' and called it internal perception, a proposal contested by other Indian scholars. The internal perception concepts included ''pratibha'' (intuition), ''samanyalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and ''jnanalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 168-169&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some schools of Hinduism considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from ''Pratyakṣa-pramana'', so as to contrast ''nirnaya'' (definite judgment, conclusion) from ''anadhyavasaya'' (indefinite judgment).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 170-172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anumana===
Main article : [[Anumana]]

''[[Anumāṇa]]'' (अनुमान) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason.&lt;ref&gt;W Halbfass (1991), Tradition and Reflection, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, page 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of ''Anumana''.&lt;ref name=kamal/&gt; In all except one Hindu philosophies,&lt;ref&gt;Carvaka school is the exception&lt;/ref&gt; this is a valid and useful means to knowledge. The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts: ''pratijna'' (hypothesis), ''hetu'' (a reason), and ''drshtanta'' (examples).&lt;ref name=jl4647&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Anumana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts, state the ancient Indian scholars: ''sadhya'' (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and ''paksha'' (the object on which the ''sadhya'' is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if ''sapaksha'' (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if ''vipaksha'' (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps. For example, they demand ''Vyapti'' - the requirement that the ''hetu'' (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in "all" cases, in both ''sapaksha'' and ''vipaksha''.&lt;ref name=jl4647/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0779-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a ''nigamana'' (conclusion).&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upamana===
Main article : [[Upamāṇa]]

''[[Upamāṇa]]'' means comparison and analogy.&lt;ref name=dpsb&gt;DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, page 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood&gt;[[Gavin Flood]], An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, page 225&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hindu schools consider it as a proper means of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;VN Jha (1986), "The upamana-pramana in Purvamimamsa", SILLE, pages 77-91&lt;/ref&gt; ''Upamana'', states Lochtefeld,&lt;ref name=jl721/&gt; may be explained with the example of a traveller who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later.&lt;ref name=jl721&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Upamana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 721&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of comparison is formally called ''upameyam'', the object of comparison is called ''upamanam'', while the attribute(s) are identified as ''samanya''.&lt;ref name=mw457&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, pages 457-458&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, explains [[Monier Monier-Williams]], if a boy says "her face is like the moon in charmingness", "her face" is ''upameyam'', the moon is ''upamanam'', and charmingness is ''samanya''. The  7th century text [[Bhaṭṭikāvya]] in verses 10.28 through 10.63 discusses many types of comparisons and analogies, identifying when this epistemic method is more useful and reliable, and when it is not.&lt;ref name=mw457/&gt; In various ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism, 32 types of ''Upanama'' and their value in epistemology are debated.

===Arthāpatti===
{{Main|Arthāpatti}}

''[[Arthāpatti]]'' (अर्थापत्ति) means postulation, derivation from circumstances.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt; In contemporary logic, this ''pramāṇa'' is similar to circumstantial [[Modus ponens|implication]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/36920/arthapatti Arthapatti] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; As example, if a person left in a boat on river earlier, and the time is now past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this ''pramāṇa'' as invalid or at best weak, because the boat may have gotten delayed or diverted.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Arthapatti" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable. Another common example for ''arthāpatti'' found in the texts of Mīmāṃsā  and other schools of Hinduism is, that if "Devadatta is fat" and "Devadatta does not eat in day", then the following must be true: "Devadatta eats in the night". This form of postulation and deriving from circumstances is, claim the Indian scholars, a means to discovery, proper insight and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Phillips (1996), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814899}}, pages 41-63&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu schools that accept this means of knowledge state that this method is a valid means to conditional knowledge and truths about a subject and object in original premises or different premises. The schools that do not accept this method, state that postulation, extrapolation and circumstantial implication is either derivable from other ''pramāṇas'' or flawed means to correct knowledge, instead one must rely on direct perception or proper inference.&lt;ref&gt;DM Datta (1932), The Six Ways of Knowing: A Critical study of the Advaita theory of knowledge, University of Calcutta, Reprinted in 1992 as {{ISBN|978-8120835269}}, pages 221-253&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anupalabdhi===
Main article : [[Anupalabdhi]], See also: [[Abhava]]

''[[Anupalabdhi|Anupalabdi]]'' (अनुपलब्धि), accepted only by Kumarila Bhatta sub-school of Mīmāṃsā, means non-perception, negative/cognitive proof.&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt; ''Anupalabdhi pramana'' suggests that knowing a negative, such as "there is no jug in this room" is a form of valid knowledge. If something can be observed or inferred or proven as non-existent or impossible, then one knows more than what one did without such means.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Abhava" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the two schools of Hinduism that consider ''Anupalabdhi'' as epistemically valuable, a valid conclusion is either ''sadrupa'' (positive) or ''asadrupa'' (negative) relation - both correct and valuable. Like other ''pramana'', Indian scholars refined ''Anupalabdi'' to four types: non-perception of the cause, non-perception of the effect, non-perception of object, and non-perception of contradiction. Only two schools of Hinduism accepted and developed the concept "non-perception" as a ''pramana''. The schools that endorsed ''Anupalabdi'' affirmed that it as valid and useful when the other five ''pramanas'' fail in one's pursuit of knowledge and truth.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;

''[[Abhava]]'' (अभाव) means non-existence. Some scholars consider ''Anupalabdi'' to be same as ''Abhava'',&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt; while others consider ''Anupalabdi'' and ''Abhava'' as different.&lt;ref name=ds&gt;D Sharma (1966), Epistemological negative dialectics of Indian logic — Abhāva versus Anupalabdhi, Indo-Iranian Journal, 9(4): 291-300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 155-174, 227-255&lt;/ref&gt; ''Abhava-pramana'' has been discussed in ancient Hindu texts in the context of ''[[Padārtha]]'' (पदार्थ, referent of a term). A ''Padartha'' is defined as that which is simultaneously ''Astitva'' (existent), ''Jneyatva'' (knowable) and ''Abhidheyatva'' (nameable).&lt;ref name=chba/&gt; Specific examples of ''padartha'', states Bartley, include ''dravya'' (substance), ''[[guna]]'' (quality), ''karma'' (activity/motion), ''samanya/jati'' (universal/class property), ''samavaya'' (inherence) and ''vishesha'' (individuality). ''Abhava'' is then explained as "referents of negative expression" in contrast to "[[Sense and reference|referents]] of positive expression" in ''Padartha''.&lt;ref name=chba/&gt; An absence, state the ancient scholars, is also "existent, knowable and nameable", giving the example of negative numbers, silence as a form of testimony, ''asatkaryavada'' theory of causation, and analysis of deficit as real and valuable. ''Abhava'' was further refined in four types, by the schools of Hinduism that accepted it as a useful method of epistemology: ''dhvamsa'' (termination of what existed), ''atyanta-abhava'' (impossibility, absolute non-existence, contradiction), ''anyonya-abhava'' (mutual negation, reciprocal absence) and ''pragavasa'' (prior, antecedent non-existence).&lt;ref name=chba&gt;Chris Bartley (2013), ''Padartha'', in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, pages 415-416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohan Lal (Editor), The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, Vol. 5, Sahitya Akademy, {{ISBN|81-260-1221-8}}, page 3958&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sabda===
{{Main|Sabda}}

''[[Śabda]]'' (शब्द) means relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag&gt;
*Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, pages 245-248;
*John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt; Hiriyanna explains ''Sabda-pramana'' as a concept which means reliable expert testimony. The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly.&lt;ref name=mhir&gt;M. Hiriyanna (2000), The Essentials of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813304}}, page 43&lt;/ref&gt;  He must rely on others, his parent, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other's lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through ''Sabda'' (words).&lt;ref name=mhir/&gt; The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the ''Sabda'' of reliable sources.&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhir/&gt; The disagreement between the schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability. Some schools, such as [[Carvaka]], state that this is never possible, and therefore ''Sabda'' is not a proper pramana. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.&lt;ref&gt;P. Billimoria (1988), Śabdapramāṇa: Word and Knowledge, Studies of Classical India Volume 10, Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-7810-8}}, pages 1-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to Vedanta school===
An interesting feature of the Mīmāṃsā school of philosophy is its unique epistemological theory of the intrinsic validity of all cognition as such. It is held that all knowledge is ''ipso facto'' true (Skt. ''svataḥ prāmāṇyavāda''). Thus, what is to be proven is not the truth of a cognition, but its falsity. The Mīmāṃsākas advocate the self-validity of knowledge both in respect of its origin (''utpatti'') and ascertainment (''jñapti''). Not only did the Mīmāṃsākas make the very great use of this theory to establish the unchallengeable validity of the [[Veda]]s, but later Vedantists also drew freely upon this particular Mīmāṃsā contribution.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Metaphysics and beliefs==
The core tenets of {{IAST|''Pūrva Mīmāṃsā''}} are [[ritual]]ism ([[orthopraxy]]), anti-asceticism and anti-mysticism. The central aim of the school is elucidation of the nature of ''[[dharma]]'', understood as a set ritual obligations and prerogatives to be performed properly.

===Atheism===
Mīmāṃsā theorists decided that the evidence allegedly proving the [[existence of God]] was insufficient. They argue that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a God to validate the rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious truth|first=Robert|last=Neville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThLR13JpCWsC|page=51|isbn=9780791447789|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mīmāṃsā argues that the Gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the ''[[mantra]]s'' that speak their names. To that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of Gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The perfectibility of human nature in eastern and western thought |first=Harold |last=Coward |authorlink=Harold Coward |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkE_8uch5P0C|page=114|isbn=9780791473368 |date=2008-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dharma''===
[[Dharma]] as understood by Pūrva Mīmāṃsā can be loosely translated into English as "virtue", "morality" or "duty". The Pūrva Mīmāṃsā school traces the source of the knowledge of dharma neither to sense-experience nor inference, but to verbal [[cognition]] (i.e. knowledge of words and meanings) according to Vedas. In this respect it is related to the [[Nyāya]] school, the latter, however, accepts only four sources of knowledge (''pramāṇa'') as valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapoor|first=Subodh|title=The Philosophy Of Vaisnavism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lariw7EILCAC&amp;pg=PA60|year=2004|publisher=Cosmo Publications|isbn=978-81-7755-886-9|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pūrva Mīmāṃsā school held [[dharma]] to be equivalent to following the prescriptions of the [[Samhita|Saṃhitās]] and their [[Brāhmaṇa]] commentaries relating the correct performance of [[yajña|Vedic ritual]]s. Seen in this light, Pūrva Mīmāṃsā is essentially ritualist ([[orthopraxy]]), placing great weight on the performance of [[karma]] or action as enjoined by the Vedas.

===Relation to Vedānta===
Emphasis of Yajnic Karmakāṇḍas in Pūrva Mīmāṃsā is erroneously interpreted by some to be an opposition to Jñānakāṇḍa of Vedānta and Upaniṣads. Pūrva Mīmāṃsā does not discuss topics related to Jñānakāṇḍa, such as salvation (''mokṣa''), but it never speaks against [[mokṣa]]. Vedānta quotes Jaimini's belief in Brahman as well as in mokṣa:

In Uttara-Mīmāṃsā or Vedānta (4.4.5-7), Bāḍarāyaṇa cites Jaimini as saying (ब्राह्मेण जैमिनिरूपन्यासादिभ्यः) "''(The mukta Puruṣa is united with the Brahman) as if it were like the Brahman, because descriptions (in Śruti etc) prove so''".

In Vedānta (1.2.28), Bāḍarāyaṇa cites Jaimini as saying that "There is no contradiction in taking Vaishvānara as the supreme Brahman".

In 1.2.31, Jaimini is again quoted by Bāḍarāyana as saying that the nirguna (attribute-less) Brahman can manifest itself as having a form.

In 4.3.12, Bādarāyana again cites Jaimini as saying that the mukta Purusha attains Brahman.

In Pūrva Mīmāṃsā too, Jaimini emphasises the importance of faith in and attachment to the Omnipotent Supreme Being Whom Jaimini calls "The Omnipotent Pradhaana" (The Main):

Pūrva Mīmāṃsā 6.3.1: "sarvaśaktau pravṛttiḥ syāt tathābhūtopadeśāt" (सर्वशक्तौ प्रवृत्तिः स्यात् तथाभूतोपदेशात्). The term ''upadeśa'' here means instructions of the śāstras as taught. We should tend towards the omnipotent supreme being. In the context of Pūrva Mīmāṃsā 6.3.1 shown above, next two sutras becomes significant, in which this Omnipotent Being is termed as "[[Pradhana|pradhāna]]", and keeping away from Him is said to be a "doṣa", hence all beings are asked to get related ("abhisambandhāt" in  tadakarmaṇi ca doṣas tasmāt tato viśeṣaḥ syāt pradhānenābhisambandhāt; Jaimini 6, 3.3) to the "Omnipotent Main Being" (api vāpy ekadeśe syāt pradhāne hy arthanirvṛttir guṇamātram itarat tadarthatvāt; Jaimini 6, 3.2). Karma-Mīmāṃsā supports the Vedas, and Rgveda says that one Truth is variously named by the sages. It is irrelevant whether we call Him as Pradhāna or Brahman or Vaishvānara or Shiva or God.

==History==
The school's origins lie in the scholarly traditions of the final centuries BCE, when the priestly ritualism of Vedic sacrifice was being marginalized by [[Buddhism]] and [[Vedanta]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} To counteract this challenge, several groups emerged dedicated to demonstrating the validity of the Vedic texts by rigid formulation of rules for their interpretation. The school gathers momentum in the [[Gupta period]] with [[Śābara]], and reaches its apex in the 7th to 8th centuries with {{IAST|[[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]]}} and [[Prabhākara]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The school for some time in the Early Middle Ages exerted near-dominant influence on learned Hindu thought, and is credited as a major force contributing to the [[decline of Buddhism in India]], but it has fallen into decline in the High Middle Ages and  today is all but eclipsed by Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;Göhler (1995), p. 5f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mīmānsā texts==
The foundational text for the Mīmāṃsā school is the [[Purva Mimamsa Sutras|Purva Mīmāṃsā Sutras]] of [[Jaimini]] (ca. 5th to 4th century BCE). A major commentary was composed by [[Śābara]] in ca. the 1th century BC. The school reaches its height with [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa|{{IAST|Kumārila Bhaṭṭa}}]] and {{IAST|[[Prabhākara]]}} (fl. ca. 700 CE). Both Kumarila Bhatta and Prabhākara (along with {{IAST|Murāri}}, whose work is no more extant) have written extensive commentaries on [[Śābara]]'s Mīmāṃsāsūtrabhāṣyam.
Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, Mandana Miśra, Pārthasārathi Miśra, Sucarita Miśra, Ramakrishna Bhatta, Madhava Subhodini, Sankara Bhatta, Krsnayajvan, Anantadeva, Gaga Bhatta, Ragavendra Tirtha, VijayIndhra Tirtha, Appayya Dikshitar, Paruthiyur Krishna Sastri, Mahomahapadyaya Sri Ramsubba Sastri, Sri Venkatsubba Sastri, Sri A. Chinnaswami Sastri, Sengalipuram Vaidhyanatha Dikshitar were some of Mīmānsā scholars.

The ''{{IAST |Mīmāṁsā Sūtra}}'' of Jaimini (c. 3rd century BCE) has summed up the general rules of ''{{IAST |nyāya}}'' for Vedic interpretation. The text has 12 chapters, of which the first chapter is of philosophical value. The commentaries on the ''{{IAST |Mīmāṁsā Sūtra}}'' by {{IAST |Bhartṛmitra}}, {{IAST |Bhavadāsa}}, Hari and {{IAST|Upavarṣa}} are no more extant. {{IAST |Śabara}} (c. 1st century BCE) is the first commentator of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā Sūtra}}'', whose work is available to us. His ''{{IAST |bhāṣya}}'' is the basis of all later works of ''{{IAST |Mīmāṁsā }}''. {{IAST |Kumārila Bhaṭṭa}} (7th century CE), the founder of the first school of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' commented on both the ''{{IAST|Sūtra}}'' and its ''{{IAST |Śabara Bhāṣya}}''. His treatise consists of 3 parts, the ''{{IAST|Ślokavārttika}}'', the ''{{IAST |Tantravārttika}}'' and the ''{{IAST |Ṭupṭīkā}}''. {{IAST|Manḍana Miśra}} (8th century CE) was a follower of {{IAST |Kumārila}}, who wrote ''Vidhiviveka'' and  ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsānukramaṇī}}''. There are several commentaries on the works of {{IAST|Kumārila}}. {{IAST|Sucarita Miśra}} wrote a ''{{IAST|Kāśikā}}'' (commentary) on the ''{{IAST|Ślokavārttika}}''. {{IAST|Someśvara Bhatta}} wrote ''{{IAST|Nyāyasudhā}}'', also known as ''{{IAST|Rāṇaka}}'', a commentary on the ''{{IAST |Tantravārttika}}''. {{IAST|Pārthasarathi Miśra}} wrote ''{{IAST|Nyāyaratnākara}}'' (1300 CE), another commentary on the ''{{IAST|Ślokavārttika}}''. He also wrote ''{{IAST |Śāstradīpikā}}'', an independent work on the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' and ''Tantraratna''. {{IAST|Venkaṭa Dīkṣita}}’s   ''{{IAST|Vārttikabharaṇya}}'' is a commentary on the ''{{IAST |Ṭupṭīkā}}''. {{IAST |Prabhākara}} (8th century CE), the originator of the second school of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' wrote his commentary ''{{IAST|Bṛhatī}}'' on the ''{{IAST |Śabara Bhāṣya}}''. {{IAST |Śālikanātha}}’s ''{{IAST |Ṛjuvimalā}}'' (ninth century CE) is a commentary on the ''{{IAST|Bṛhatī}}''. His ''{{IAST |Prakaraṇapañcikā}}'' is an independent work of this school and the ''{{IAST|Pariśiṣṭa}}'' is a brief explanation of the ''{{IAST |Śabara Bhāṣya}}''. {{IAST |Bhavanātha}}’s ''{{IAST|Nyāyaviveka}}'' deals with the views of this school in details. The founder of the third school of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' was {{IAST|Murāri}}, whose works have not reached us.

{{IAST|Āpadeva}} (17th century) wrote an elementary work on the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'', known as ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsānyāyaprakaśa}}'' or ''{{IAST|Āpadevī}}''.  ''{{IAST |Arthasaṁgraha}}'' of  {{IAST |Laugākṣi Bhāskara}} is based on the ''{{IAST|Āpadevī}}''. {{IAST|Vedānta Deśika}}’s ''{{IAST |Śeśvara Mīmāṁsā}}'' was an attempt to combine the views of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' and the ''{{IAST|Vedānta}}'' schools.&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan, S. ''Indian Philosophy'', Vol. II, Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-563820-4}}, pp.376-78&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2799">'''Narreme''' is the basic unit of [[narrative structure]]. According to [[Helmut Bonheim]] (2000), the concept of ''narreme'' was developed three decades earlier by [[Eugene Dorfman]] and expanded by [[Henri Wittmann]], The narreme is to [[narratology]] what the [[sememe]] is to [[semantics]], the [[morpheme]] is to [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and the [[phoneme]] to [[phonology]]. The narreme, however, has yet to be persuasively defined in practice.  In [[Interpretative phenomenological analysis|interpretative]] narratology constrained in a framework of [[Principles and parameters]], narration is the projection of a narreme N&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, the abstract head of a narrative macrostructure where N&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; dominates immediately N&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt; (Wittmann 1995).&lt;ref&gt;In this author's views, narremes are the [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]]s of narrative [[algorithm]]s, a concept that has found applications in [[game theory]] and [[game semantics]] (Shivel 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nature, Culture and Gender''''' is a book length [[social science]] essay collection that analyzes views that describe "nature" as inferior to "[[culture]]". Hence, the authors draw on anthropology and history to critique ideologies that, by equating women with nature, renders the [[female gender]] as inferior, while the male, equated to culture is seen as superior. The [[editor-in-chief|co-editors]] of this book published in 1980 by [[Cambridge University Press]] are [[Carol MacCormack]] and [[Marilyn Strathern]]. The contributing authors are Carol P. MacCormack, [[Maurice Bloch]], Jean H. Bloch, L. J. Jordanova, Olivia Harris, [[Jane C. Goodale]], Gillian Gillison, Marilyn Strathern.&lt;ref name=rimoldi&gt;

'''“Nowhere Girls”''' or '''“Mei Nu”'''（{{zh|沒女}}）is an [[neologism]] coined to describe women who have no money, no job, no education, no prospects, no looks, no friends and no sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = TV show Nowhere Girls is nasty name-calling dressed up as entertainment.| date = 18 August 2014 | url = http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1574261/tv-show-nowhere-girls-nasty-name-calling-dressed | work = South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pinyin and pronunciation of “Nowhere Girls” is the same as that of “Beautiful Girls” in Putonghua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=呂|first=書練|url=http://paper.wenweipo.com/2014/09/04/OT1409040011.htm|title=獨家風景：大家都是沒女|date=4 September 2014|work=Wen Wei Po}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used to characterise those women who refuse to conform to male expectations and are therefore thought to be unattractive by men, and has strong pejorative connotations. A [[calque]] of a South Korean term, it spread to Hong Kong via China, and became popularised through its use in a reality show called “Nowhere Girls”, which was broadcast by Television Broadcasts Limited. This show has aroused much public discussion on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=徐|first=詠璇|title=「沒女」有道義?|url=http://www1.hkej.com/dailynews/arts/article/741650/「沒女」有道義%3F | date=11 October 2014|work=Hong Kong Economic Journal}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Description==
In the TV programme “Nowhere Girls”, women are called “Nowhere Girls” because they are lazy, selfish, short-tempered, rude to others, unfashionable and are self-deluded.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite web| title=沒女大翻身簡介 | url= http://programme.tvb.com/variety/nowheregirls/ | publisher=TVB.COM }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

===Individual===
Nowhere girls usually experience different psychological traumas. According to the reality show “Nowhere Girls”, they suffer from personal setbacks such as parental divorce, personal breakups, or infidelity in relationships. They are stressed, so they tend to escape reality, place blame on a third person, refuse to take responsibility for personal problems, and have a tendency towards self-victimization or self-pity.

===Family===
As nowhere girls experience distinct family affairs, leaving them psychologically-hurt. Moreover, Hong Kong has low birth rates from time to time &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citymetric.com/horizons/hong-kong-s-low-birth-rate-blamed-women-s-sexual-problems-343 |title=Hong Kong’s low birth rate blamed on women’s "sexual problems" |last1=Speed |first1=Barbara |date=30 September 2014 |work=CityMetric}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to single-child families. They become the treasure of their parents. They are pampered and spoiled &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edu.sina.com.hk/news/42/4/1/77629/1.html|title=Hong Kong kids|date=28 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223828/http://edu.sina.com.hk/news/42/4/1/77629/1.html|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which results in weakened coping abilities. In addition, children nowadays engage in less communication with their parents who  are always out for work, and thus children receive less parental mental support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=何|first=詩韻| title = 少溝通 損孩子情緒礙發展 | date = 10 May 2013 | url = http://www.hket.com/eti/article/a59a6bb7-0f47-4d59-93e0-3d25e68ecef0-430214 | work = Hong Kong Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Societal===
Nowhere girls do not conform to traditional notions of beauty. In addition, they are self-centered and short-tempered. It is difficult for them to engage in the society with appropriate communication and to cooperate with others. As they are spoiled by their parents, they lack essential skills like problem-solving skills. Therefore, they do not appeal to employers and thus cannot find a job, while they insist that it is a social discrimination.

==Effects==

===Low self-esteem===
Nowhere girls become less confident and inferior in front of their friends and families because they are not appreciated. For instance, the participants in the “Nowhere Girls” show cried frequently in front of the camera. They were being teased in the cyber world. in which their background informations were being disclosed in the public. In severe cases, they may suffer from depression or psychological illnesses.

===Socially withdrawn===
Nowhere girls are less willing to engage in social activities. They prefer being alone instead of participating in social gatherings to avoid any embarrassment. They have low sense of connection with their social circles. Moreover, they may undergo difficulties in meeting new friends as they are not being recognised.

===High family pressure===
Most of the nowhere girls are either single or unmarried. Their parents will be anxious about their marital status as Chinese people values marriage. They will be pressurised to find their partners as soon as possible. This brings them great pressure in fulfilling their parents’ expectations, and also deteriorates their family relationships.

===Pessimistic attitude towards life===
Nowhere girls hold negative attitudes towards their futures. They perceive their life as unfortunate. Therefore, they always think pessimistically since they consider their lives as hopeless. Lacking of security in their family will further result in their inclination into pessimism.

==Media==

===TV Programme===

"Nowhere Girls” (Chinese [[:zh:沒女大翻身|沒女大翻身]])is a reality show produced by Television Broadcasts Limited. It was broadcast in August 2014 and there are 20 episodes in total. The show focuses on seven women who are described as "have nots" and each of them is said to represent one of "seven deadly sins", including laziness, selfishness, ugliness and being a recent mainland immigrant etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chow|first1=Vivienne|last2=Nip|first2=Amy|last3=Lau|first3=Jessie|title= Discrimination turns critics off TVB 'reality' hit|url= http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1568567/discrimination-turns-critics-tvb-reality-hit|newspaper=The South China Morning Post|date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This programme stirred up much controversy since it discriminated against so-called “Mei Nu” and brought out wrong messages -  “makeovers, working with fitness trainers and life coaches can lead to better lives"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wu|first=Alice|title=TV show Nowhere Girls is nasty name-calling dressed up as entertainment|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1574261/tv-show-nowhere-girls-nasty-name-calling-dressed|newspaper=The South China Morning Post|date=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the audience. There were also suspicions that seven women got paid to act and some incidents were staged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chow|first1=Vivienne|last2=Nip|first2=Amy|last3=Lau|first3=Jessie|title= Discrimination turns critics off TVB 'reality' hit|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1568567/discrimination-turns-critics-tvb-reality-hit|newspaper=The South China Morning Post|date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the show hurt the professional image of psychologists in Hong Kong because Wong Hoi-man, who is a clinical psychologist and the guest counsellor of “Nowhere Girls”, handled cases in improper ways. It led to misunderstandings towards therapeutic techniques of qualified psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Siu|first=Jasmine|title= Hit reality TV show blasted

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4368">'''Paratext''' is a concept in [[literature|literary interpretation]].  The [[Text (literary theory)|main text]] of published authors (e.g. the story, non-fiction description, poems, etc.) is often surrounded by other material supplied by the authors, editors, printers, and publishers, which is known as the paratext. These added elements form a frame for the main text, and can change the reception of a text or its interpretation by the public. Paratext is most often associated with [[book]]s, as they typically include a cover (with associated [[cover art]]), title, [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]] (dedication, opening information, foreword), [[Book design#Back matter (end matter)|back matter]] (endpapers, colophon) footnotes, and many other materials not crafted by the author. Other editorial decisions can also fall into the category of paratext, such as the formatting or typography. Because of their close association with the text, it may seem that authors should be given the final say about paratextual materials, but often that is not the case. One example of controversy surrounding paratext is the case of the 2009 young adult novel ''[[Liar (novel)|Liar]]'', which was initially published with an image of a white girl on the cover, although the narrator of the story was identified in the text as black.

The concept of paratext is closely related to the concept of [[hypotext]], which is the earlier text that serves as a source for the current text.

==Theory==
[[literary theory|Literary theorist]] [[Gérard Genette]] defines paratext as those things in a published work that accompany the text, things such as the author's name, the title, [[preface]] or [[introduction (essay)|introduction]], or [[illustration]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Genette ''Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation'' page 1&lt;/ref&gt;
Genette states "More than a boundary or a sealed border, the paratext is, rather, a threshold." It is "a zone between text and off-text, a zone not only of transition but also of transaction: a privileged place of pragmatics and a strategy, of an influence on the public, an influence that ... is at the service of a better reception for the text and a more pertinent reading of it". Then quoting [[Philippe Lejeune]], Genette further describes paratext as "a fringe of the printed text which in reality controls one's whole reading of the text". This threshold consists of a peritext, consisting of elements such as titles, chapter titles, prefaces and notes. It also includes an epitext, which consists of elements such as interviews, publicity announcements, reviews by and addresses to critics, private letters and other authorial and editorial discussions – 'outside' of the text in question. The paratext is the sum of the peritext and epitext.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Intertextuality|last=Allen|first=Graham|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0-415-17475-6|location=USA and Canada|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7995">The '''repatriation and reburial of human remains''' is a current debate in [[archaeology]]. Various indigenous peoples around the world, such as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and [[Indigenous Australians]] have requested that human remains from their respective communities be repatriated for reburial. A famous case is that of the [[Kennewick Man]] in the United States. Similarly, contemporary [[Neo-druidism|Druids]] have requested the reburial of ancient human remains in the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaeology Live, English Heritage repatriation request notes. ''"a test case for the Druids to gain a precedent for more repatriations all over the British isles [sic]"'' |url=http://archaeological.livejournal.com/449932.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130626191502/http://archaeological.livejournal.com/449932.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 June 2013 |accessdate=30 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repatriation in general seems to be concerned with objects, in the broadest sense of the word, ranging from human remains to [[art repatriation]]. But it actually is about people in the present and their perception of the past in the present. Repatriation claims are linked to politics, ethnic identity, and other debates or problems in contemporary society that have or claim to have a historical link to the object.

== Ethical considerations ==
The controversy comes from the fact that some believe that it is disrespectful to the dead and to their contemporary descendants for their remains to be displayed in a [[museum]] or stored in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre and Scarre (2006). ''The ethics of archaeology : philosophical perspectives on archaeological practice'', p. 206-208. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. {{ISBN|0-521-54942-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The trauma of history ==
The first and foremost undercurrent of repatriation is the ill treatment of people in the past, the repatriation of human remains is to a degree part of a healing process bandaging the traumas of history.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, J. and C. Fforde (2002). Introduction: the reburial issue in the twenty-first century. In: ''The dead and their possessions: repatriation in principle, policy and practice''.C. Fforde, J. Hubert and P. Turnbull (Ed). Routledge, London and New York, p. 1. {{ISBN|0-415-34449-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence it is important that this ill treatment is addressed but with the repatriation and reburial of remains they are essentially lost to the world as a reminder of that part of the object's history or biography. Repatriation also presents an opportunity for people to lay claim to their own past and actively decide what is and what is not a part of their cultural heritage. The basis beneath the open wounds of history is the difference in treatment of remains that were seen as sufficiently other and could therefore be studied without any ethical considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, J. and C. Fforde (2002). Introduction: the reburial issue in the twenty-first century. In: ''The dead and their possessions: repatriation in principle, policy and practice''.C. Fforde, J. Hubert and P. Turnbull (Ed). Routledge, London and New York, p. 2. {{ISBN|0-415-34449-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contesting of ownership of human remains in museums and other institutions, and demands of return to cultural groups is largely fuelled by the difference in the handling of ‘white’ and indigenous remains. Where the former were reburied the latter were subjects of study and eventually ending up in museums. In a sense one cultural group assumed the right to carry out scientific research upon another cultural group.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, J. and C. Fforde (2002). Introduction: the reburial issue in the twenty-first century. In: ''The dead and their possessions: repatriation in principle, policy and practice''.C. Fforde, J. Hubert and P. Turnbull (Ed). Routledge, London and New York, p. 1-3. {{ISBN|0-415-34449-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This disrespectful unequal treatment stems from a time when race and cultural differences had huge social implications. These are changing but the aftermath of centuries of inequality cannot be corrected so easily. This frustration is what partly fuels the repatriation and ownership claims that seem to have increased in the last 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, J. and C. Fforde (2002). Introduction: the reburial issue in the twenty-first century. In: ''The dead and their possessions: repatriation in principle, policy and practice''.C. Fforde, J. Hubert and P. Turnbull (Ed). Routledge, London and New York, p. 1. {{ISBN|0-415-34449-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The “traumas of history” can be addressed by reconciliation, repatriation and formal governmental apologies disapproving of conducts in the past by the institutions they now represent. A good example of a repatriation case is described by Thorton where a large group of massacred Indians is returned to their tribe, showing the healing power of the repatriation gesture.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, R. (2002). Repatriation as healing the wounds of the trauma of history: cases of Native Americans in the United States of America. In: ''The dead and their possessions: repatriation in principle, policy and practice''. C. Fforde, J. Hubert and P. Turnbull (Ed). London and New York, Routledge: 17-25. {{ISBN|0-415-34449-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Druids and human remains==
The [[Neo-druidism|Neo-druidic]] movement is a modern religion, with some groups originating in the 18th century and others in the 20th century. They are generally inspired by either Victorian-era ideas of the [[druids]] of the [[Iron Age]], or later [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] movements. Some practice [[ancestor veneration]], and because of this may believe that they have a responsibility to care for the ancient dead where they now live. In 2006 Paul Davies requested that the Alexander Keiller Museum in [[Avebury]], [[Wiltshire]] rebury their [[Neolithic]] human remains, and that storing and displaying them was "immoral and disrespectful"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/12766795/Request_for_the_Reburial_of_Ancestral_Human_Remains_at_Avebury_Wiltshire_2008_&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] refused to allow reburial, but did allow for Neo-druids to perform a healing ritual in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Consultation on ancient human remains ends Jan 31 |journal=British Archaeology |issue=104 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological community has voiced criticism of the Neo-druids, making statements such as "no single modern ethnic group or cult should be allowed to appropriate our ancestors for their own agendas. It is for the international scientific community to curate such remains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Letters: Human Remains |journal=British Archaeology |issue=105 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An argument proposed by archaeologists is that, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Druids are not the only people who have feelings about human remains... We don't know much about the religious beliefs of these [Prehistoric] people, but know that they wanted to be remembered, their stories, mounds and monuments show this. Their families have long gone, taking all memory with them, and we archaeologists, by bringing them back into the world, are perhaps the nearest they have to kin. We care about them, spending our lives trying to turn their bones back into people... The more we know the better we can remember them. Reburying human remains destroys people and casts them into oblivion: this is at best, misguided, and at worse cruel."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Letters: Human Remains |journal=British Archaeology |issue=105 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Royal Albatross''''' is a four-masted [[Barquentine]] privately owned, built as a luxury vessel. She operates from her home berth at [[Resorts World Sentosa]] on the island of [[Sentosa]] in [[Singapore]].
[[File:RAatRWS.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Royal Albatross'' at her home berth in Singapore.]]

The ''Royal Albatross'' is a unique luxury [[tall ship]] with four masts, 22-sails, more than 200 ropes, three decks and is comparable with a [[luxury yacht]]; but unlike the typical super-yacht, it looks and operates like an old-world galleon or pirate ship. After a 5.5 year reconstruction inside out, the Royal Albatross is one of Singapore’s premier hospitality venues with a passenger capacity of 200 (alongside) and 149 (sailing) all of which can be accommodated on a continuous upper deck.

The ''Royal Albatross'' started its operating life in Chicago where it was known at '''''Windy II''''', cruising the Great Lakes prior to a journey in 2008 that brought it over 15,000 kilometres from the moderate climes of North America to the tropical waters of South East Asia. She was the first U.S. certified four-masted barquentine since about 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoonerman.com/windy_ii_Grandhaven.htm Schooner Man]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since arriving in Singapore, approximately 360,000 man hours were invested re-designing, re-fitting and certifying the ''Royal Albatross''. It features 22 sails, over 650 square meters of canvas and over 60,000 RGB lights.

== Sunset Sail City Lights ==
In October 2016, the Royal Albatross launched its first Sunset Sail on the weekends to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tallship.com.sg/events/sunset-sail-city-lights/ Tallship.com.sg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryna Singh, [https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/sail-away-for-a-sunset-party "Sail and dine on Batman's yacht from $195 a person"], ''Straits Times'', 14 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The harbour cruise starting from Resorts World Sentosa, is a 2.5-hour dinner cruise with live entertainment on board, sailing towards the outskirts of Marina Bay with the city skyline in the distance, and then heading back between the Southern Islands of Singapore to Sentosa. The Royal Albatross sailing tickets can be purchased on its website and other resellers like SISTIC.

== Malaysian/Indonesian origin ==
Amok originated from the Malaysian/Indonesian word ''meng-âmuk'', which when roughly defined means "to make a furious and desperate charge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hempel A. A., Levine R. D., Meloy J. D., Westermeyer J.

H. G. (1927). "Amok and Latah". Retrieved March 30, 2013 from PsychINFO. [http://huie.hsu.edu:2308/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=a71ca420-96ff-40e4-be67-3ac88801c158%40sessionmgr12&amp;hid=3&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2006-01643-010]&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that amok was caused by the ''hantu belian'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pusat Rujukan Persuratan Melayu: hantu belian|url=http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Search.aspx?k=hantu+belian|publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka|accessdate=6 November 2011|location=Malaysia|language=Malay, English|quote=hantu belian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was an evil tiger spirit that entered one’s body and caused the heinous act. As a result of the belief, those in Indonesian culture tolerated amok and dealt with the after-effects with no ill will towards the assailant.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Saint Martin | first = Michael | year = 1999 | title = Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | issn = 0160-6689| pmc = 181064 | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pmid = 15014687 | pages = 66–70 | doi=10.4088/pcc.v01n0302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although commonly used in a colloquial and less-violent sense, the phrase is particularly associated with a specific sociopathic [[culture-bound syndrome]] in the cultures of [[Culture of Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesia]] and [[Culture of Brunei|Brunei]]. In a typical case of ''running amok'', an individual (often male), having shown no previous sign of anger or any inclination to violence, will acquire a weapon (traditionally a sword or dagger, but presently any of a variety of weapons) and in a sudden frenzy, will attempt to kill or seriously injure anyone he encounters and himself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=181064|year=1999|author1=Saint Martin|first1=M. L.|title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome|journal=Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=1|issue=3|pages=66–70|pmid=15014687|doi=10.4088/pcc.v01n0302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amok typically takes place in a well populated or crowded area. Amok episodes of this kind normally end with the attacker being killed by bystanders or committing [[suicide]], eliciting theories that amok may be a form of intentional suicide in cultures where suicide is heavily stigmatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23464 |title=Definition of Amok |publisher=Medterms.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who do not commit suicide and are not killed typically lose consciousness, and upon regaining consciousness, claim amnesia.

An early Western description of the practice appears in the journals of [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]], a British explorer, who encountered amok firsthand in 1770 during a voyage around the world. Cook writes of individuals behaving in a reckless, violent manner, without cause and "indiscriminately killing and maiming villagers and animals in a frenzied attack."&lt;ref&gt;(Jackson, Y. (Ed.).(2006). Encyclopedia of multicultural psychology. University of Kansas: Sage Publications)&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely accepted explanation links amok with male [[honor]] (amok by women and children is virtually unknown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexanra Ringe|first=Carrie McLaren|title=Curious Mental Illnesses Around the World|url=http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/21/mental_illness.html|publisher=stayfreemagazone.org|accessdate=March 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218053501/http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/21/mental_illness.html#|archive-date=2012-12-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Running amok would thus be both a way of escaping the world (since perpetrators were normally killed or committed suicide) and re-establishing one's reputation as a man to be feared and respected.

== Contemporary syndrome ==
"Running amok" is used to refer to the behavior of someone who, in the grip of strong emotion, obtains a weapon and begins attacking people indiscriminately, often with multiple fatalities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; An episode of amok may be triggered by a period of depression or highly aggressive behavior. The slang terms ''[[going postal]]'' or ''going ballistic'' are similar in scope.
Police describe such an event as a [[spree killer|killing spree]]. If the individual is seeking death an alternate method is often "[[suicide by cop]]".

Amok is often described as a culture-bound (or culture-specific) syndrome,&lt;ref name="pmid15014687"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saint Martin ML |title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome |journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=66–70 |date=June 1999 |pmid=15014687 |pmc=181064 |doi= 10.4088/pcc.v01n0302|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1427677"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gaw AC, Bernstein RL |title=Classification of amok in DSM-IV |journal=Hosp Community Psychiatry |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=789–93 |date=August 1992 |pmid=1427677 |doi= |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1427677 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a psychological condition whose manifestation is strongly shaped by cultural factors. Other reported culture-bound syndromes are [[latah]] and [[Penis panic|koro]]. Amok is also sometimes considered one of the subcategories of [[dissociative disorders]] (cross-cultural variant).

== Officially classified as a psychiatric condition ==
In 1849, amok was officially classified as a psychiatric condition based on numerous reports and case studies that showed the majority of individuals who committed amok were, in some sense, mentally ill.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; The modern [[DSM-IV]] method of [[classification of mental disorders]] contains two official types of amok disorder; beramok and amok. Beramok is considered to be the more common of the two and is associated with the depression and sadness resulting from a loss and the subsequent brooding process. Loss includes, but is not limited to, the death of a spouse or loved one, divorce, loss of a job, money, power, etc. Beramok is associated with mental issues of severe depression or other mood disorders. Amok, the rarer form, is believed to stem from rage, insult, or a vendetta against a person, society, or object for a wide variety of reasons. Amok has been more closely associated with psychosis, personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and delusions.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

== Historical and cross-cultural comparisons ==
Early travelers in Asia sometimes describe a kind of military amok, in which soldiers apparently facing inevitable defeat suddenly burst into a frenzy of violence which so startled their enemies that it either delivered victory or at least ensured what the soldier in that culture considered an honourable death.

An example would be during the [[Battle of Bukit Chandu]] in Singapore during WWII when 41 outnumbered soldiers of the Malay Regiment, led by [[Adnan Saidi]], charged and went all out against a 13 000 strong invading Japanese Army. They continued the fight armed with just knives and bayonets for three days before they were finally defeated.

This form of amok appears to resemble the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ''[[Berserker]]'', the ''cafard'' or ''cathard'' (Polynesia), ''mal de pelea'' (Puerto Rico), and ''iich'aa'' (Navaho).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/ant100/pdf/MedicalAnthropology.pdf |title=Medical Anthropology: Culture-bound syndromes |accessdate=2009-04-29 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary [[Indonesia]], the term ''amok'' (''amuk'') generally refers not to individual violence, but to frenzied violence by mobs. Indonesians now commonly use the term 'gelap mata' (literally 'darkened eyes') to refer to individual amok. [[Laurens van der Post]] experienced the phenomenon in the East Indies and wrote in 1955:

{{quote|'Gelap mata', the Dark Eye, is an expression used in Sumatra and Java to describe a curious and disturbing social phenomenon. Socially speaking, the Malays, Sumatrans and Javanese are the best behaved people I have ever encountered. On the surface they are an extremely gentle, refined, submissive people. In fact the word 'Malay' comes from 'malu', 'gentle', and gentleness is a quality prized above all others among the Malays and their neighbours. In their family life, in their submission to traditional and parental authority, in their communal duties, they are among the most obedient people on earth. But every now and then something very disturbing happens. A man who has behaved in this obliging manner all his life and who has always done his duty by the outside world to perfection, suddenly finds it impossible to keep doing so. Overnight he revolts against goodness and dutifulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Laurens van der Post|van der Post, Laurens]], ''The Dark Eye in Africa'' (London, 1955), p.51-52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[Philippines]], ''amok'' also means unreasoning murderous rage by an individual. In 1876, the Spanish governor-general of the Philippines [[José Malcampo]] coined the term ''[[juramentado]]'' for the behavior (from ''juramentar'' - "to take an oath"), surviving into modern [[Philippine languages]] as ''huramentado''.&lt;ref name=Hurley14&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hurley |first1=Vic |title=Swish of the Kris; The Story of the Moros |url=http://www.nikhef.nl/~tonvr/keris/keris2/swish/index.html |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |edition= |series= |volume= |issue= |date= |year=1936 |month= |origyear= |publisher=E.P.

Norse [[Berserker]]s and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] battle trance are two other examples of the tendency of certain groups to work themselves up into a killing frenzy.

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], some notable cases have occurred among the [[Rajputs]]. In 1634, the eldest son of the [[raja]] of [[Jodhpur]] ran amok at the court of [[Shah Jahan]], failing in his attack on the emperor, but killing five of his officials. During the 18th century, again, at [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] (Sind), two envoys, sent by the Jodhpur chief in regard to a quarrel between the two states, stabbed the prince and twenty-six of his suite before they themselves fell.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amuck, Running|volume=1|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''secret history''' (or '''shadow history''') is a [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] interpretation of either fictional or real [[history]] which is claimed to have been deliberately suppressed, forgotten, or ignored by established scholars. "Secret history" is also used to describe an alternative interpretation of documented facts which portrays a drastically different motivation or history from established historical events.

==Secret histories of the real world==
{{main article|Historical revisionism}}
Originally, secret histories were designed as non-fictional, revealing or claiming to reveal the truth behind the "[[Spin (public relations)|spin]]": one such example is ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]''. Secret histories can range from standard [[historical revisionism]] with proper critical reexamination of historical facts to [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|negative historical revisionism]] wherein facts are deliberately omitted, [[suppression of dissent|suppressed]] or distorted.

The quintessential example secret history is the ''[[Procopius#Secret History|Anecdota]]'' of [[Procopius of Caesarea]] (known for centuries as the ''Secret History''). It was discovered, centuries after it was written, in the [[Vatican Library]] and published in 1623, although its existence was already known from the ''[[Suda]]'', which referred to it as the ''Anekdota'' ("the unpublished composition"). The ''Secret History'' covers roughly the same years as the first seven books of the ''History of Justinian's Wars'' and appears to have been written after they were published. Current consensus generally dates it to 550 or 558, possibly as late as 562. It portrays the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] to the great disadvantage of the Emperor, the Emperor's wife, and some of his imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Procopius/Anecdota/home.html The Secret History], English translation (Dewing, 1935) at [[LacusCurtius]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional secret histories==
Secret history is sometimes used in a long-running [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] universe to preserve [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] with the present by reconciling [[paranormal]], [[anachronistic]], or otherwise notable but unrecorded events with what actually happened in known history; for instance, in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]]'s novels ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'' cast the devastating [[Eugenics Wars]] of the 1990s (still well into the future when first mentioned in an episode from 1967) as shadow wars most people never knew about, in which such real-life events from that era as the [[Smiling Buddha]] nuclear test, the [[Yugoslav Wars]] during the 1990s, and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] were all part of one wider conflict.

===Secret history thrillers===
A certain type of [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] can be defined as secret history. In such novels, a daring spy, assassin or commando ''nearly'' carries out a coup which would have drastically changed history as we know it. Since this is not [[alternate history]] but a secret event in our own history, the reader knows in advance that this attempt would be foiled, that all persons in the know would be sworn to secrecy and all evidence be consigned to a top secret archive, where supposedly it still is. Nevertheless, the plot fascinates many readers who want to see how close history comes to being changed (usually very, very close) and exactly how the attempt would be foiled.

Two highly successful novels are considered to have started this subgenre:

* ''[[Eye of the Needle (novel)|Eye of the Needle]]'' by [[Ken Follett]]: a German spy in 1944 nearly succeeds in foiling [[D-Day]];
* ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]'' by [[Frederick Forsyth]]: an assassin nearly succeeds in killing [[Charles De Gaulle]], president of France, in 1963.

These two novels set the framework for many later books: following step by step both the fiendishly clever, competent and ruthless perpetrator in carrying out his design and the equally clever and competent hunter, hot on his heels throughout the book, but who would catch up with him only at the very end. Typically, historical figures – including very famous ones – appear in some key scenes, but are not major actors.

Many other novels of this type followed, most of them with [[World War II]] backgrounds. Follet himself published at least two others:
* ''[[The Key to Rebecca]]'': a German spy in [[Cairo]] nearly succeeds in letting [[Erwin Rommel]] win at [[El Alamein]].
* ''[[The Man from St. Petersburg]]'': a [[Russian anarchist]] in 1914 Britain nearly succeeds, by assassinating a key envoy of the Tsar, in averting the [[First World War]].

Works of other writers fitting within this type include:
* ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]: an embittered code-breaker nearly betrays to Nazi Germany the vital and closely guarded secret that the Allies are able to read its secret messages.
* ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (novel)|The Eagle Has Landed]]'' by [[Jack Higgins]]: German commandos nearly succeed in kidnapping British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] out of wartime England.
* ''[[The Romanov Succession]]'' by [[Brian Garfield]]: taking advantage of the 1941 Nazi attack on the Soviet Union, [[Russia]]n exiles attempt to assassinate Soviet premier [[Joseph Stalin]] and restore the monarchy.
* ''[[The Night Letter]]'' by [[Paul Spike]]: In 1940, Nazi agents nearly succeed in blackmailing U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] into not running for a third term.
* ''[[The Ninth Man]]'' by [[John Lee (author)|John Lee]]: a few years later, a Nazi agent penetrates the White House and nearly succeeds in assassinating Roosevelt.
* ''[[Stalag Texas]]'', also by [[John Lee (author)|John Lee]]: escaped German prisoners nearly succeed in destroying the American nuclear laboratory at [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]].
* ''An Exchange of Eagles'' by [[Owen Sela]]: In 1940, senior officers of the German [[Abwehr]] and the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army) |American Military Intelligence]] make a secret deal to simultaneously assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] with the assumption that they would be replaced by [[Hermann Göring]] and [[Henry A. Wallace]] - who would make peace and prevent World War II from further escalating.
* In the 2006 [[historical detective]] novel, ''[[The Janissary Tree]]'' by [[Jason Goodwin]], a power-mad [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] general in 1836 nearly succeeds in overthrowing Sultan [[Mehmet II]] and proclaiming a republic almost 90 years in advance of [[Ataturk]].
* In the thriller ''[[The Redbreast]]'' by [[Jo Nesbø]], a former World War II Norwegian collaborator with the Nazi occupation nearly succeeds in assassinating the Norwegian Crown Prince.

Different types of secret history thriller include:

* ''[[The Leader and the Damned]]'' by [[Colin Forbes (novelist)|Colin Forbes]]: [[Adolf Hitler]] was assassinated in 1943 but his death was kept secret and the man who led Nazi Germany in the last two years of the war was a [[Look-alike|double]]. This book also provides a detailed view on the role of [[Martin Bormann]] in the Nazi leadership and of his eventual fate, completely at odds with the official historical record. 
* ''[[XPD]]'' by [[Len Deighton]]: [[Winston Churchill]] was far more of an [[appeaser]] than official history records, and in June 1940 he had a secret meeting with Hitler to discuss peace on the basis of recognizing the German domination of Europe; decades later, the documents recording this shameful secret are the subject of an intensive and deadly power struggle.
* The mystery series by [[Elliott Roosevelt]] in which his mother, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], is the detective – placing murder mysteries in the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] White House and other actual locations and involving many historical persons in the fictional events depicted. In one book of the series, ''[[Murder at the Chateau]]'', Eleanor Roosevelt is involved not only in a murder mystery but also in a high-level secret conference in Occupied France, which nearly ends with a diplomatic deal to end World War II in 1941.
* ''[[The Berkut]]'' by Joseph Heywood. [[Adolf Hitler]] did not really commit suicide in 1945, it was a double who died together with [[Eva Braun]]. The real Hitler tried to escape from Berlin, was captured by Soviet commandos after the long chase making most of the book, and was secretly kept under horrible and degrading conditions in the [[Kremlin]] basement until the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, when he was secretly executed.
* Many of the "Blackford Oakes" spy novels, by conservative writer William F. Buckley, Jr., which are secret-history thrillers claiming that historical events considered to have been setbacks for the United States were actually brilliant strategic coups by the CIA which were merely allowed to look like defeats for security purposes, or at least were the product of the US's moral superiority. For instance, in ''[[Who's on First (novel)|Who's on First]]'', Oakes deliberately chooses not to stop the Soviet Union from launching [[Sputnik]] ahead of the otherwise-superior US satellite program, in order to protect the life of a Soviet contact (and thus the seeming Soviet technological triumph was actually authorized by a US agent, who allowed it to happen); in ''[[Marco Polo, if You Can]]'', Oakes is the real-life [[U2]] pilot [[Gary Powers]], and allows himself to be captured while flying over the Soviet Union in order to create a cover story for a secret US intelligence operation (and thus the [[U2 incident]] was actually planned from the start, [[Gary Powers]] was not shot down by the Soviet military but deliberately set up his own capture, and U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s subsequent humiliation by Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] never happened).
* The plot of [[Clive Cussler]]'s ''[[Night Probe!]]'' is based on the assumption that on the eve of [[World War I]] in 1914, a secret treaty was signed between the British Prime Minister, [[H. H. Asquith]], with the cooperation of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], and US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] – to sell [[Canada]] to the United States for the sum of one billion dollars. The treaty was aborted at the time and reference to it erased from all official records – to resurface explosively in 1989 (as future date at the time of writing).
* An interesting example of a science-fiction secret history novel can be found in the [[BBC]] ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[Past Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[Imperial Moon]]'', which sees the [[Fifth Doctor]] and his companions [[Vislor Turlough]] and [[Kamelion]] learn about a secret trip to the Moon by the British Imperial Spacefleet in 1878. On first hearing of the expedition, the Doctor notes that Victorian science could have built a structurally sound spaceship capable of going to the Moon, with the only thing beyond them being a conventional propulsion system; the events of the novel reveal that information about how to create the ships' engines was secretly provided by an alien race trapped on the Moon who sought to escape to Earth. At the novel's conclusion, after the alien race decimates the spaceport where the ships returned to Earth before being defeated by the Doctor and his companions, the Doctor arranges for Queen Victoria to cancel the space program as he recognises that Victorian Britain is not psychologically ready to travel in space, with all records of the expedition being destroyed apart from the expedition leader's diary, which he entrusts to the Doctor for safe keeping.
* Another example of a science-fiction secret history is ''[[The Proteus Operation]]'' by [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]]. Its plot tells the most closely guarded secret of [[World War II]]: in 1939 there arrived in New York City a group of time-travelers from a future timeline in which the Nazis won the war and took over most of the world. The arrivals secretly contacted [[Franklin Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] and provided invaluable  information about how the Germans won in their history – which enabled the Allies to do better this time and win the war. This time-travel secret was only known to  Roosevelt and Churchill, to a few of their close advisers such as [[Harry Hopkins]], and to a few scientists such as [[Einstein]]. After the victory in 1945, all who knew it were sworn to secrecy – and strictly kept it until their deaths – and all records destroyed, this secret considered too explosive to be ever told.
* [[James A. Hetley]]'s [[Contemporary Fantasy]] books ''Dragon's Eye'' and ''Dragon's Teeth'' are based on the assumption that in the Fourteenth Century several boatloads of rebellious [[Welsh people|Welsh]], opposing the [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages| English conquest of their homeland]], secretly crossed the Atlantic and established themselves at what would become the State of [[Maine]]. Being not very numerous and not the harbingers of further immigrants, they were able to reach a reasonable accommodation with the matrilineal leadership of the local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribe. Centuries later they blended with later European immigrants, stating truthfully that their name was Morgan and that they were of Welsh origin, while being vague on when they had come to America. In the 17th and 18th Century they were involved in piracy, later shifted to other lucrative (and highly illegal) activities. By the present time, the Welsh Morgans along with the Native American Haskells are still the two leading families of Stonefort, Maine. In their well-guarded home are preserved various artifacts of their ancestors, and manuscripts in Medieval Latin and Welsh  - which historians would have loved to see, but the Morgans prefer not to share them with outsiders.

===Fictional "secret" versions of historical events===
* [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]' last major work, ''[[The Knight of Sainte-Hermine]]'' asserts that it was the novel's protagonist who killed the British Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] and that the true circumstances of Nelson's death were kept secret for reasons which form part of the book's plot. 
* Dumas' earlier and more well-known work, ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', provides a detailed and entirely fictional account of the background to the 1628 assassination of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] by the junior officer [[John Felton (assassin)#In fiction| John Felton]]. At the time and up to the present, Felton's act was considered as part of the turbulent 17th Century English politics. As depicted by Dumas, however, the assassination of Buckingham was the result of a convoluted plot hatched by the French [[Cardinal Richelieu]], while Felton himself was unaware of being manipulated by Richelieu's female agent. 
* [[Elizabeth Bear]]'s "Promethean Age" series constitutes a massive secret history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monette|first=Sarah|title=An Interview with Elizabeth Bear, conducted by Sarah Monette|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0#hl=en&amp;sugexp=les%3B&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;tok=fGCbg3M4XX5PLux3JCZiJA&amp;pq=elizabeth%20bear%27s%20%22promethean%20age%22%20%22secret%20history%22%20review&amp;cp=51&amp;gs_id=iw&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22+%22secret+history%22&amp;pf=p&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22+%22secret+history%22+&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=22adff2dc2288598&amp;biw=840&amp;bih=359&amp;bs=1|publisher=Subterranean Press|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Elizabethan]] England, with considerable [[fantasy]] elements. Among other things the series asserts that [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]] was a secret illegitimate son of [[Queen Elizabeth I]]; that Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], the Queen's spymaster, did not die in 1590 as history records but lived in secret for another five years; that playwrights [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson]] were all secret agents of the Queen and underwent dangerous missions in her service, in addition to their theatrical activities; that the plays of all three had profound secret political and magical meanings; that Shakespeare and Marlowe were lovers, and homoerotic elements in [[Shakespeare's Sonnets]] were dedicated to Marlowe; that [[Edmund Spencer]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' was not a fictional work but was based on a true Kingdom of Faerie, whose Queen had a secret pact of mutual help with the English Queen Elizabeth; that Christopher Marlowe was not assassinated in 1593 as history records but was taken into Faerie where he became the lover of the witch [[Morgan le Fay]]; and that Shakespeare had also visited Faerie and personally met with [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]] and other supposedly legendary characters depicted in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.
* The [[The Black Adder|first series]] of ''[[Blackadder]]'', in which [[Henry VII of England]] comes to power in a completely different way and removes the reign of "Richard IV" from the history books.  Note that in recorded history England had only three kings named Richard.
*The ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' video game franchise is built around a conspiracy-laden story involving a "[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]" organization that originated with the [[Knights Templar]]. According to the game's fiction, many historical figures were secretly Templars, manipulating history and those around them in a quest for power. They were opposed by the Assassins, another secret order that considered themselves defenders of humanity's free will. It is implied, and confirmed in ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'', that certain powerful artifacts that the Templars sought in their quest for power were remnants of a secret "First Civilization", the basis for most real-world religion and mythology. The true history of the world has long been lost and/or intentionally obscured, possibly by the Templars.
* The background of [[Ben Aaronovitch]]'s ''[[Rivers of London (novel)|Rivers of London]]'' series of [[contemporary fantasy]] detective thrillers includes the assertion that [[Isaac Newton]], in addition to his well-known scientific achievements, was also a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] who codified the basic principles of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Unlike Newton's writings on other subjects, his ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Artes Magicis'' ([[Latin]] for "Natural Philosophy Principles of The Magical Arts") was never made known to the general public. However, copies of Newton's book, as of other books on magic, were kept at a secret section of the [[Bodleian Library]] in the [[University of Oxford]], and it remained the basic text for practitioners of magic into the twenty-first century. The same series also assumes that, in addition to the various weapons deployed, [[World War II]] had also been fought by magical means, with [[Nazi Germany]], [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|Britain]], the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] each raising its own secret corps of warrior-wizards. Specifically, official World War II histories omit all mention of a major battle fought on January 1945 at Ettersberg, Germany – where thousands of British wizards gave their lives in the effort to destroy a secret magical facility, from where Nazi wizards were seeking to unleash [[vampire]]s and other nasty magical surprises upon the world. Scattered in the series are minor other tidbits of secret history: The practice of magic flourished among the court ladies of [[Caroline of Ansbach]]; during the [[War of 1812]] British wizards trained [[Tecumseh]]'s [[medicine men]] in up to date Newtonian magic, for which American wizards kept a grudge even centuries later; [[Maynard Keynes]], though not practicing magic himself, was associated with the British wizards and helped them locate various magical manuscripts; in 2009, American wizards trying a magical operation as part of the [[Iraq War]] suffered a major fiasco at [[Falluja]] which was covered up but got their contract with the US Army terminated.  
* [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[Baudolino]]'' suggests that Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], who died while on the [[Second Crusade]], had not drowned in a river, as history records. Rather, he had died mysteriously at night while hosted at the castle of a sinister Armenian noble. According to the book, the only people who knew the truth had an excellent reason to hide it - since they had been in charge of guarding the Emperor, and if the truth became known they might have been executed out of hand for failing in their task.
* Gore Vidal's novel "Creation", purporting to disclose many facts on Greek-Persian Wars that were not known to Herodotus, asserts that the Persian King Darius planned a major military campaign in India, with the aim of annexing the entire Gangetic Plain to the Persian Empire. But the Greeks, entagling the Persians in a major war on their other flank and proving a tougher opponent than the Persian counted on, caused that Indian campaign to be aborted.  Thus, according to Vidal, the Greeks unknowingly greatly influenced India's history and - since this was the Buddha's lifetime - also the character of Buddhism, a major world religion.

* The books of [[Steve Berry (novelist)|Steve Berry]] often have secret history elements which are critical to their plots. For example, ''The Jefferson Key'', part of Berry's [[Cotton Malone]] series, is based on the assumption that all four assassinations of a US President ([[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1865, [[James A. Garfield]] in 1881,[[William McKinley]] in 1901 and [[John Kennedy]] in 1963) were in fact organized by a secret "Commonwealth" of pirates (or "privateers"), founded during the American Revolution, which still exists into the 21st Century and wields considerable power behind the scenes, and whose lucrative activities were in one way or another disrupted by each of these four Presidents. The pirates had, in each case, located a person who had a reason to hate the President and manipulated him into unknowingly carrying out their design. Other Presidents, like [[Woodrow Wilson]] during WWI and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in WWII, knew of this Commonwealth, recognized its secret role and made secret use of it - and thus avoided being assassinated. The book's plot hinges on a page torn from the Congressional Record, confirming that Congress in the early years of the US did give  this Commonwealth "a perpetual authorization" to act as [[privateer]]s. Once the current President's agent has located and destroyed this document, ensuring that this piece of secret history will remain forever secret, the President is free to act decisively and break up the pirate Commonwealth. Other Steve Berry books feature such pieces of secret history as Treasure hidden by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], secret survivals of the [[Knights Templar]] and the fate of the books of the [[Alexandrine Library]].

==Secret histories of fictional worlds==
"[[Retcon]]", alteration of the [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] account of past events in serial fiction, often employs aspects of secret history. A seeming [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] breach might be "revealed" to alter the truth of what readers were previously led to believe was a definitive story. A retcon might equally well convert an established history into a secret history. Such transformations occur with particular frequency in long-running [[superhero]] comic books.

===Examples===
* When [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] wrote ''[[The Final Problem]]'' he fully intended to kill off [[Sherlock Holmes]] and write no further books and stories about him. Faced with massive pressure and protests by the famous detective's fans, he finally gave in. "[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]" revealed that Holmes did not die after all, and recounted a secret history of three years in which Holmes had been wandering the world while everybody – including even his close friend Dr. Watson – believed him to be dead. What differentiates this case from many other retcons and reboots is the fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did not need to alter the initial stories in any ways, since he had never given any substantial evidence that Sherlock Holmes died, in the first place : the "death" of the Great Detective was only a mistake on the part of the police and Dr Watson who misread the signs on the place of his apparent death.
* The ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' also alludes to hidden ''fictional'' history, establishing that during the events of the serial ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', the [[First Doctor]] had in his possession a super-weapon, the [[Hand of Omega]] stolen from his own people, the [[Time Lord]]s. The story also implies that he knew of the [[Daleks]] before he "first" met them.
* [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' made years of "established" events and characters from the [[DC Universe]] (for example the existence of [[Krypto]]) "un-happen". In the revised continuity only a few privileged characters remember the old continuity, making it "secret".
* [[Philip Jose Farmer]]'s [[Wold Newton family|Wold Newton]] universe heavily influenced Alan Moore's subsequent ''[[League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. Both these universes tie together many disparate fictional creations in a variety of surprising ways.
* [[Warren Ellis]]'s comic book series ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'' offers a secret history look at the origin of comic book and literary type superheroes.
* [[Philip José Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'' reinterprets [[Jules Verne]]'s famous tale with the assumption that in fact Fogg was the immortal foster child of a race of hominid aliens known as the Eridani, and that his travel around the world was part of a secret mission on their behalf.
* Many of the novels by American [[Tim Powers]] are secret histories. For example, his 1987 novel ''[[On Stranger Tides]]'' had a different interpretation of pirate [[Blackbeard]]'s death at Ocracoke Inlet. After finding the [[Fountain of Youth]], Blackbeard planned to go in battle and knew it would lead to his death, which he wanted to be a widely known event. After Blackbeard's death, his head was severed and hung on the bowsprit, in which the pirate's blood fell into the sea, thereby letting the effects of the Fountain work. Blackbeard's soul would gain a new body, where he would assume a new identity as "Edmund Morcilla" until he was killed again, for once and all, by the book's protagonist, Jack Shandy. Powers's 2001 novel ''[[Declare]]'' presents a secret history of the Cold War, with America and the U.K. jousting with the Soviet Union over the control of powerful supernatural forces.

==Time travel secret histories==

The plots of some [[Time travel]] books and stories make it possible to count them as secret histories as well – since they posit that the truth about various historical figures and events is quite different from what history books recount.

For example, [[Poul Anderson]]'s story "Brave to be a King" asserts that King [[Cyrus the Great]], founder of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], was in fact a twentieth-century American time traveler stranded in the past who became a King by strange circumstances. (However, this is "cancelled out" at the end of the story, when the real Cyrus is restored to the timeline, and the American goes home to his own century.) Another Anderson story, "The Sorrow of Odin the Goth", asserts that also the Nordic god [[Odin]]/[[Wodan]] was a twentieth-century American time traveler, who sought to study the culture of the ancient [[Goths]] and ended up being regarded as a god and starting an enduring myth. 

[[Paul Levinson]]'s "[[The Plot to Save Socrates]]" asserts (as its title suggests), that the philosopher [[Socrates]] did not drink hemlock, as history tells. Rather, a clone died in his place and the true Socrates lived some more years in Twenty First Century America. Also according to the same book, the politician and general [[Alcibiades]] had a long life and many adventures after the moment when history records his death; Alcibiades' mistress Timandra and the famous  fourth-century  mathematician [[Hypatia]] of [[History of Alexandria#Late Roman and Byzantine period|Alexandria]] were one and the same person, a time-traveling American woman; the inventor [[Hero of Alexandria]] was also an American time traveler; and finally, according to the same book, the  nineteenth-century publisher [[William Henry Appleton]] had an extensive secret life as a time traveler, had visited [[Classical Greece]] and met some of the famous ancient Greek writers and philosophers whose works he published, and also several times visited the twenty-first century – but always found his own nineteenth-century milieu to be the most congenial.

According to [[David Drake]]'s novel "[[Birds of Prey (Drake novel)|Birds of Prey]]", the [[Roman Empire]]'s [[Third Century Crisis]] was far more severe than modern historians realize, and the Empire was on the verge of final collapse and disintegration already then. The situation was saved by a time traveler from the very far future, endowed with telepathic and other superhuman powers. That traveler encountered a young junior Roman officer named [[Diocletian]], realized his enormous potential and gave him the final push to eventually become a strong Emperor, revive and restructure the Roman Empire and give it another two hundred years of life (and much longer for its Eastern portion). Diocletian himself was completely unaware of this crucial help to his career.

[[Ray Nelson]]'s novel ''Bĺake's Progress'' assumes that the poet [[William Blake]] and his wife [[Catherine Blake| Kate]] were accomplished time travelers who had many adventures in past and future times and in various [[alternate timeline]]s, their actions profoundly effecting the course of human history. They had a child never known to recorded history, since the child - also a time traveler - was born in the distant past and lived out his life in the distant future. While it is well-known that Blake revered the poetry of [[John Milton]], the book discloses that the two of them often met personally - the century separating them being no hindrance since Milton, too, was a time traveler and both could travel freely over millions of years. [[William Blake's mythology]] is not fictional but features actual people - or beings - whom  Blake met on his wanderings through time. The character [[Urizen]] was in fact Blake's own son, born of a relationship with a woman of the far future. In addition to all the above, the book makes the more mundane assertion that many of the engravings attributed to Blake were in fact made by Kate and that in fact she was the better engraver of the two.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia''''' (''SJE'' - {{lang-ru|Краткая еврейская энциклопедия}}, Kratkaya Yevreyskaya Entsiklopedia) was published in 11 volumes in [[Jerusalem]] from 1976 to 2005 in [[Russian language|Russian]] by the [[Society for Research on Jewish Communities]] with the support of [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem. The ''SJE'' is the only comprehensive encyclopedia on Judaism published in Russian, and followed an almost 70-year gap following the publication of the "[[Yevreyskaya Entsiklopedia]]" (''Encyclopedia Judaica'') of [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary|Brokhaus and Efron]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1908.
&lt;ref name=JE_EJE&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://eleven.co.il/article/15092 Jewish encyclopedias] in ''Electronic Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Although it was originally planned as an abridged translation of the English-language ''[[Encyclopedia Judaica]]'', it became clear as the work progressed that readers raised in the [[Soviet Union]] would not be familiar with the concepts lying at the foundation of the cultural and historical system known as [[Jewish civilization]]. Therefore, these concepts were elaborated on in greater detail in the ''SJE'', and terms were introduced which lacked equivalents in modern Russian. Most personal and geographic names (in [[Israel]]) from the [[Bible]] are given in the accepted [[Hebrew]] form. The conceptual foundation of the ''SJE'' is characterized by a thematic bipolarity: [[Eretz Israel]], and in particular the [[State of Israel]] on the one hand, and [[Russian Jews|Russian (i.e., Soviet) Jewry]] on the other, which nevertheless does not exclude the broad scope of different aspects of the lives and history of Jews in all the other countries of the [[diaspora]].&lt;ref name=JE_EJE/&gt;

A group of editors worked on the ''SJE'' who prepared articles with the participation of invited specialists and also academic consultants, including the well-known Israeli academics and public figures [[Shraga Abramson]], [[Mordechai Altschuler]], [[Shlomo Pines]], [[Hayim Tadmor]], [[Chone Shmeruk]], [[Hayyim Schirmann]], [[Menachem Stern]], [[Yaakov Tsur]], [[Yaakov Landau]], [[Israel Bartal]], and [[Michael Liebman]]. Chairing the editorial board were [[Shmuel Ettinger]] and [[Haim Beinhart]]. Chief editors were [[Yitzhak Oren]] (Nadel), [[Michael Zand]], [[Naftali Prat]], and [[Ari Avner]]. The senior academic editors were [[Peretz Hein]], [[Yosef Glozman]], [[Amnon Ginzai]], and [[Mark Kipnis]]. The managing editors were [[Ella Slivkina]] (vol. 1-10) and [[Marina Gutgarts]].&lt;ref name=JE_EJE/&gt;

In practical terms, the ''SJE'' was no longer "shorter," and aside from the 11 volumes a "[[Jewish calendar]] juxtaposed with a [[Gregorian calendar]] (1948-2048)" was published as a pamphlet along with three supplements. Volume 10 also contains a "thematic bibliographic index" with 2,114 items. There are more than 5,300 vocabulary entries, and the total number of words exceeds six million. Volume 11, the final one, included an alphabetized index of subjects, including geographic and personal names and events with references to the volume and column where they are located. A system of citations indicating links between concepts serves as the only cross-reference in the entire corpus of the encyclopedia.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

In 1996, the Society for Research on Jewish Communities undertook a reprinting of the first seven volumes of the ''SJE'', which were printed by the printing and publishing house [[Krasnyj Proletarij]] in Moscow.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

In 2005, the ''Electronic Jewish Encyclopedia'' (EJE), {{lang-ru|Электронная еврейская энциклопедия}} (Elektronnaja Evrejskaja Entsiklopedia) was made available on the internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [https://eleven.co.il/ Electronic Jewish Encyclopedia] based on ''The Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia'' (Краткая еврейская энциклопедия) published in Jerusalem in 1976-2005. The Society for Research on Jewish Communities in cooperation with The Hebrew University, Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt; presenting an expanded and more precise version of the ''SJE''. Work on the ''EJE'' continues today.

'''Sino-American Youth Ambassador (SAYA)''' ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Chinese Simplified]]: 中美青年大使; [[Pinyin]]: zhōngměi qīngnián dàshǐ) is an [[Student exchange program|exchange program]] run by the [[Ameson Education and Cultural Exchange Foundation]] seeking to build capacity for campus internationalization and cultural awareness in school campuses. Currently, SAYA program is open to Chinese and American students who serve as cultural ambassadors in both countries.

==Background==

The Sino-American Youth Ambassadors (SAYA) program started in 2010 as part of the [[Ameson Education and Cultural Exchange Foundation|Ameson Foundation]]'s program with the intention of bringing greater international awareness and cultural diversity in campus with American and Chinese high school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ameson.org/programs/capacity-building/saya |title=SAYA Program page |website=ameson.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAYA program seeks to build capacity for international education and provide new perspectives on education by exchanging student ambassadors. Each year, SAYA organizes two exchanges: one is American students go abroad in China and the other is Chinese students go abroad in United States. In 2012, approximately 20 American students participated the SAYA program in Beijing No. 4 High School where they learned Chinese language and cultural with SAYA Chinese students and travelled with their Chinese peers. In the return exchange in 2012, SAYA students had an opportunity to meet the U.S. Vice President, [[Joe Biden]] and the Chinese current [[paramount leader]], [[Xi Jinping]] during the exchange program in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ameson.org/foundation-news/1376-joe-biden-and-xi-jinping-meet-with-ameson-saya-students-joe-biden-and-xi-jinping-meet-with-ameson-saya-students |title= Joe Biden and Xi Jinping meet with Ameson SAYA Students|website=amesn.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, approximately 100 Chinese students participated the SAYA program during the Chinese New Year and introduced the Chinese New Year traditions to their American classmates in [[Belmont High School (Belmont, Wisconsin)|Belmont High School]], Thomas Jefferson High School, and [[Providence Day School]] and host families in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ameson.org/events/1453-saya-2013-saya-2013|title= Largest SAYA exchange to date concludes successfully|website=ameson.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return exchanges, students from Branson High School visited [[Shanghai]] Gezhi High School,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ameson.org/events/1454-changing-places-gezhi|title= Changing places: Branson students visit Shanghai Gezhi High School|website=ameson.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and students from [[Providence Day School]] visited Jingling High School’s Hexi campus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ameson.org/events/1500-saya-2013-hexi |title= Latest SAYA exchange comes to Hexi|website=ameson.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; later in the year 2013.

==Program==

SAYA programs take place during school holidays. Prior to the exchange, students undergo cultural training to learn about different cultures. During the exchange students immerse themselves in regular classes for a week and travel with their peers for another week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/us/2016-02/10/content_23442519.htm|last= Hua ShengDun|title=Students bring Chinese culture to US high schools|website=usa.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As cultural ambassadors, students share their culture with other students through [[presentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/local/madeira/2016/01/28/madeiraschools/79454692/|last= Sheila A. Vilven|title=Madeira City Schools host Chinese student ambassadors|website=www.cincinnati.com|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the exchange, students return to their countries and share what they learned with classmates.

SAYA connects American and Chinese high schools interested in cultural exchanges and arranges home-stays for participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.burnettcountysentinel.com/news/chinese-students-enjoy-grantsburg-visit/article_2ddb477e-d001-11e5-a52c-b3259c3fa815.html|last=Steve Briggs Sentinel|title=Chinese students enjoy Grantsburg visit|website=www.burnettcountysentinel.com|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAYA serves as an intermediary between American and Chinese students to facilitate cultural exchanges in personal level.

{{refimprove|date=June 2009}}
A '''soliloquy''' (from Latin ''solo'' "to oneself" + ''loquor'' "I talk") is a device often used in drama when a character speaks to him- or herself, relating thoughts and feelings, thereby also sharing them with the audience, giving off the illusion of being a series of unspoken reflections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy|title=Definition of SOLILOQUY|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; If other characters are  present, they keep silent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/553410/soliloquy|title=Soliloquy - drama|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or are disregarded by the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/soliloquy|title=the definition of soliloquy|author=|date=|website=www.dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it should be said that sometimes, depending on the performance, a monologue that is written as a soliloquy, will be addressed directly to the audience. And sometimes it is hard to tell if what is being heard is a monologue, or a duologue or a soliloquy; in which case choosing the right term may be a matter of interpretation.

A soliloquy is a type of [[monologue]], but it is not an [[aside]]: a monologue is a speech where one character addresses other characters, or the audience; or it is a speech that is self-directed; an aside is a (usually short) comment by one character towards the audience, though during the play it may seem like the character is addressing him or herself.

Soliloquies were frequently used in dramas but went out of fashion when [[Literary#drama|drama]] shifted towards [[Realism (literature)|realism]] in the late 18th century. But nowadays, with budget restrictions in theatre, they have come back into fashion. 

Good examples in literature can be seen in the words of the character of [[Iago]], who has a leading role in [[Shakespeare]]'s famous play ''[[Othello]]''.

Examples of a present form of soliloquy are found in the sitcom ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'' and the political drama ''[[House of Cards (UK TV series)|House of Cards]]''.

==Soliloquies in Shakespeare==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
Shakespeare’s soliloquies contain some of his most original and powerful writing. Possibly prompted by the essays of [[Montaigne]], he explores in his greatest tragedies the way someone wrestles with their private thoughts under pressure, often failing to perceive the flaws in their own thinking, as in the great galloping I-vii soliloquy (‘if ‘twere done when ‘tis done…’) in which Macbeth unconsciously reveals through his imagery his fear of damnation.  That is part of it; he actually has a variety of thoughts. But he fails to realise what really holds him back from murdering his king: simply the fact that it is wrong.  And if he does indeed realize that, and is choosing not to give that fear greater importance, he also expresses his fear of getting caught, and feeling guilty, and how things will play out.

The earliest of the mature soliloquies occur in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' where Shakespeare develops Brutus as a forerunner of Hamlet: the self-critical and honest man struggling to do what’s right in unpropitious circumstances. Hamlet’s seven soliloquies, and the single major soliloquy of Claudius in ''Hamlet'' can all be described as ‘a search for a difficult sincerity’, and represent Shakespeare’s most extended study of the workings of the human mind; it is not until the novels of Dostoyevsky that a character’s inner self is examined with such power, discrimination and technical skill.

Shakespeare’s soliloquies are written in blank verse of unparalleled variety, invention and rhythmic flexibility, suggestive of the rapidly changing moods of their speakers. Often, it is through vivid and memorable imagery that an individual registers his unique take on the world: Hamlet’s perception of Elsinore as ‘an unweeded garden that grows to seed’, the frantically deluded Leontes who feels he has ‘drunk and seen the spider’, the self-dramatising murderer, Othello ‘Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse’ or Antony’s transcendent vision of his afterlife with Cleopatra: ‘Where souls do couch on flowers, we’ll hand in hand, And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze’.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13035">'''Somatic theory''' is a theory of human social behavior based loosely on the [[somatic marker hypothesis]] of [[António Damásio]], which proposes a mechanism by which emotional processes can guide (or bias) behavior, particularly decision-making, as well as the [[attachment theory]] of [[John Bowlby]] and the [[self psychology]] of [[Heinz Kohut]], especially as consolidated by [[Allan Schore]]. 

It draws on various philosophical models from ''[[Genealogy of Morals|On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] through [[Martin Heidegger]] on ''das Man'', [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] on the [[lived body]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] on social practices to [[Michel Foucault]] on discipline, as well as theories of [[performativity]] emerging out of the [[speech act]] theory of [[J. L. Austin]], especially as developed by [[Judith Butler]] and [[Shoshana Felman]];&lt;ref&gt;See Felman, Shoshana. (1980/2003). ''The Scandal of the Speaking Body: Don Juan With J.L. Austin, or Seduction in Two Languages''. Translated by Catherine Porter. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; some somatic theorists have also tied somaticity to performance in the schools of actor training developed by [[Constantin Stanislavski|Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]].

=== Barbara Sellers-Young ===

[[Barbara Sellers-Young]]&lt;ref&gt;Sellers-Young, Barbara. (2002).

''Consciousness, Literature and the Arts'' 3.2 (August).&lt;/ref&gt; applies Damasio’s somatic-marker hypothesis to critical thinking as an embodied performance, and provides a review of the theoretical literature in performance studies that supports something like Damasio’s approach:

* [[Howard Gardner]]’s [[theory of multiple intelligences]], especially bodily-kinesthetic intelligence
* Thomas Hanna’s insistence that “We cannot sense without acting and we cannot act without sensing”&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Thomas. (1995). “What is Somatics?” In Don Hanlon Johnson, ed., ''Bone, Breath and Gesture'', 345. Berkeley: North Atlantic.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen's movement-pedagogy
* [[Constantin Stanislavski|Konstantin Stanislavski]]’s acting theory that “In every physical action, unless it is purely mechanical, there is concealed some inner action, some feelings. This is how the two levels of life in a part are created, the inner and the outer. They are intertwined. A common purpose brings them together and reinforces the unbreakable bond.”&lt;ref&gt;Stanislavski, Konstantin. (1961/1989). ''Creating a Role'', 228. Translated by Elizabeth Reynolds Hapgood. London and New York: Routledge, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

See also Slingerland, Edward G., Eric Blanchard and Lyn Boyd-Judson. (2007).

''International Studies Quarterly'' 51: 53-77.&lt;/ref&gt; applies Damasio's somatic-marker hypothesis to the [[cognitive linguistics]] of [[Gilles Fauconnier]] and [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]]&lt;ref&gt;See Fauconnier and Turner (2002), ''The Way We Think''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Mark Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;See Lakoff and Johnson (1999), ''Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Thought''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; especially Fauconnier and Turner's theory of [[conceptual blending]] and Lakoff and Johnson's [[embodied mind]] theory of [[metaphor]]. His goal in importing somatic theory into cognitive linguistics is to show that

:the primary purpose of achieving human scale is not to help us ''apprehend'' a situation, but rather to help us to know how to ''feel'' about it. Especially in political and religious discourse--situations where speakers are attempting to influence their listeners' values and decision-making processes--I would like to argue that the achievement of human scale is intended primarily to import normativity to the blend, which is accomplished through the recruitment of human-scale emotional-somatic reactions. This argument is essentially an attempt to connect of conceptual blending theorists with those of neuroscientists who argue for the importance of somatic states and emotional reactions in human value-creation and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;"Conceptual Blending," p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Douglas Robinson ===

[[Douglas Robinson (academic)|Douglas Robinson]] first began developing a somatic theory of language for a keynote presentation at the 9th American Imagery Conference in Los Angeles, October, 1985, based on [https://archive.is/20130122002312/http://eideticinstitute.com/joomla/more-infmormation/6-more-about-dr-akhter-ahsen Ahkter Ahsen]'s theory of somatic response to images as the basis for therapeutic transformations; in contradistinction to Ahsen's model, which rejected Freud's "[[talking cure]]" on the grounds that words do not awaken somatic responses, Robinson argued that there is a very powerful somatics of language. He later incorporated this notion into ''The Translator's Turn'' (1991), drawing on the (passing) somatic theories of [[William James]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and [[Kenneth Burke]] in order to argue that somatic response may be "idiosomatic" (somatically idiosyncratic) but typically is "ideosomatic" (somatically ideological, or shaped and guided by society), and that the ideosomatics of language explains how language remains stable enough for communication to be possible. This work preceded the Damasio group's first scientific publication on the somatic-marker hypothesis in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, Antonio R., Daniel Tranel, and Hannah Damasio. (1991). "Somatic Markers and the Guidance of Behaviour: Theory and Preliminary Testing." In H.S. Levin, H.M. Eisenberg and A.L. Benton (eds.), ''Frontal lobe function and dysfunction'', 217-229. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and Robinson did not begin to incorporate Damasio's somatic-marker hypothesis into his somatic theory until later in the 1990s.

In ''Translation and Taboo'' (1996) Robinson drew on the protosomatic theories of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jacques Lacan]], and [[Gregory Bateson]] to explore the ways in which the ideosomatics of [[taboo]] structure (and partly sanction and conceal) the translation of [[Religious text|sacred texts]]. His first book to draw on Damasio's somatic-marker hypothesis is ''Performative Linguistics'' (2003); there he draws on [[J. L. Austin]]'s theory of [[speech acts]], [[Jacques Derrida]]'s theory of [[Citationality|iterability]], and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s theory of [[dialogism]] to argue that performativity as an activity of the speaking body is grounded in somaticity. He also draws on Daniel Simeoni's application of [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s theory of ''[[habitus (sociology)|habitus]]'' in order to argue that his somatics of translation as developed in ''The Translator's Turn'' actually explains translation norms more fully than [[Gideon Toury]] in ''Descriptive Translation Studies and beyond'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdam and Philadelphia: John Benjamins, 1995, pp. 56ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Robinson began writing a series of books exploring somatic theory in different communicative contexts: [[modernism|modernist]]/[[Russian formalism|formalist]] theories of [[Defamiliarization|estrangement]] (Robinson 2008), translation as ideological pressure (Robinson 2011), [[first-year composition|first-year writing]] (Robinson 2012), and the [[refugee]] experience, [[decolonization|(de)colonization]], and the [[transgenerational trauma|intergenerational transmission of trauma]] (Robinson 2013).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Somatic theory#Further reading|Further Reading]] for bibliographical information.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Robinson's articulation, somatic theory has four main planks:

# the ''stabilization'' of social constructions through '''[[somatic marker hypothesis|somatic markers]]'''
# the ''interpersonal sharing'' of such stabilizations through the '''mimetic somatic transfer'''
# the regulatory ('''ideosomatic''') ''circulation'' or ''reticulation'' of such somatomimeses through an entire group in the '''somatic exchange'''
# the "[[kludge|klugey]]" nature of social regulation through the somatic exchange, leading to various '''idiosomatic''' failures and refusals to be fully regulated

In addition, he has added concepts along the way: '''the [[proprioception]] of the body politic''' as a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] balancing between too much familiarity and too much strangeness (Robinson 2008); tensions between '''loconormativity''' and '''xenonormativity''', the '''[[Exosomatic memory|exosomatization]]''' of places, objects, and skin color, and '''paleosomaticity''' (Robinson 2013); '''ecosis''' and '''icosis''' (unpublished work).

'''Global communication''' is the term used to describe ways to connect, share, relate and mobilize across geographic, political, economic, social and cultural divides. It redefines soft and hard power as well as information power and diplomacy in ways not considered by traditional theories of [[International relations theory|international relations]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Global Communication implies a transfer of knowledge and ideas from centers of power to peripheries and the imposition of a new intercultural hegemony by means of the "[[soft power]]" of global news and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tehranian|first1=Maijd|title=Global Communication and international relations: changing paradigms and policies|journal=The International Journal of Peace Studies|url=http://www.gmu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''study of global communication''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies the continuous flows of information used in transferring values, opinions, knowledge, culture across boundaries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=="International" Or "Global"==
With the end of the twentieth century and the turn of a new millennium, the global arena and the field of international communication were undergoing significant changes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some authors started to use the term global communication because it goes beyond the bounds of individual states and emphasizes communication between and among peoples across borders and, importantly, the rise of transnational media corporations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[International communication]] traditionally refers to communication between and among nation-states and connotes issues of national sovereignty, control of national information resources, and the supremacy of national governments.

Nevertheless, earlier International communication theories have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The old theories only explain part of the global picture and the theories of modernization, dependency, and cultural imperialism have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The term "global", implies a declining role of the state and state sovereignty. As a term, "international" has within it notions of bilateral or multilateral decisions. "Global" could be seen as an aspiration, also as a fear, of the weakening of the state. In addition, global may imply something more pervasive, more geographically inclusive than international. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==

The study of global communication increased dramatically after World War II due to military considerations coupled with their economic and political implications. Earlier attempts at theorizing have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

More global communication research was written in the decade from 1945–1955; most of the research of the 1950s dealt with propaganda and the cold war. By 1970, global communication research had grown to include a great variety of subjects, especially comparative mass communication systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |edition=1st |title=The Handbook of Comparative Communication Research |url= |publisher=Routledge |date=2012-03-21 |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-415-80275-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; communication and national development and propaganda and public opinion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frederick |first1=Howard H. |title=Global communication and international relations |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RBsQAQAAMAAJ|isbn=9780534193447 |date=1993-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of global communication scholars, previous theories of [[Modernization theory|modernization]], dependency, and [[cultural imperialism]] have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication. The old theories only explain part of the global picture.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mcphail |first1=Thomas L. |title=Global Communication Theories, stakeholders, and Trends |date=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Global_Communication.html?id=MAco-KZGZNIC|isbn=9781444358100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological development===
The emergence of global communication technologies may be considered the origin of the field of global communication in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Numerous technical advances such as the creation of a new major global communication phenomenon, [[Telecommunication convergence|convergence]], digital environments and the internet are some of the major engines driving the change from [[international communication]] to global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Global power shifts===
With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union's collapse|Soviet Union]], the shadow of [[Cold War]] has lifted to reveal shifting political, economic, and cultural alliances and conflicts. The increasing importance of these currents, especially in the cultural sphere, demands a reconsideration of the nature of the international communication field within the rubric of international relations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Global Communication in Transition: The End of Diversity?|url = https://www.amazon.com/Global-Communication-Transition-Diversity-Values-ebook/dp/B00YFRD9G6/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450650195&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=global+communication+in+transition|publisher = SAGE Publications, Inc|date = 1996-02-05|first = Hamid|last = Mowlana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News agencies and propaganda===
Three key players are usually recognized as the founders of the international [[News agency|news agencies]]. In 1835, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] created the world's first news agency; In 1849, [[Bernhard Wolff]] started publishing stock market news and daily reports from Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt; In 1849, [[Paul Reuter|Paul Julius Freiherr von Reuter]] established his own commercial service, the [[Reuters|Reuter]] agency, and organized a worldwide exchange of news in 1870.

In 1859, Reuter, [[Havas]] and the German [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau|Wolff]] agency reached an agreement to exchange news from all over the world, which was known as the League of Allied Agencies, or the " Ring Combination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "The Ring Combination": Information, Power, and the World News Agency Cartel|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YDVlAAAAMAAJ|publisher = University of Chicago, Department of History|date = 1999-01-01|first = Alexander Scott|last = Nalbach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, [[Associated Press|American News Agency Associated Press]] was founded and was formally admitted into the "Ring Combination" in 1887.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are some major factors that point to the growing importance of global communication in the world of the twenty-first century:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# world population explosion

# from [[geopolitics]] to [[Gaia philosophy|gaiapolitics]]

# increased [[cross-cultural communication]]
# changing concept of community
# greater [[Centralisation|centralization of control]]
# information explosion
# changes in technologies
# greater dependence on global communication
# greater [[interdependence]] and democracy
# impact of communication on peace and war

== Theoretical approaches and perspectives ==

=== Transcultural political economy ===

Transcultural Political Economy is a concept that is presented in Global Communications by Paula Chakravartty and Yeuzhi Zhao. This concept looks at global communications and media studies in three major areas: global flows of information and culture, decentralizing the conceptual parameters of global information and media studies, and the normative debates in global communications in the context of neoliberalism. Transcultural Political Economy is a multidisciplinary study that focuses on the tensions between political economy and cultural studies. It "integrate[s] institutional and cultural analyzes and address urgent questions in global communications in the context of economic integration, empire formation, and the tensions associated with adapting new privatized technologies, neoliberalized and globalized institutional structures, and hybrid cultural forms and practices". Transcultural Political Economy addresses the issues surrounding the practice of neoliberalism and its creation of unequal power structures within the world system.

=== Globalization theory ===
{{See also|Globalization}}

Globalization theory was popularized in the 1990s as a model for understanding global communication. The concept of [[globalization]] inspired a number of theories from various schools of thought in communication studies that each emphasize different aspects of [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization, development and the mass media |last=Sparks |first=Colin |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7619-6161-1 |location=Thousand Oaks, California |pages=126–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many globalization theories highlight actors in the business sector as leaders in the processes of global integration. Transnationalizing business is often celebrated as progression toward a more interconnected world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Globalization theories are often associated with theories of modernity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some scholars view globalization as the social, political, economic, and cultural integration of societies into a capitalist system; Others see globalization as a successor to modernity, while some see it as an iteration of imperialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some question the usefulness and legitimacy of globalization theory, arguing that it does not adequately conceptualize current international relations or function as a lens through which to examine everyday events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Globalization Theory: A Post Mortem |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/pal/ip/2005/00000042/00000001/art00002 |journal=International Politics |date=2005-03-01 |pages=2–74 |volume=42 |issue=1 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800098 |first=Justin |last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars criticize globalization theories as overzealous toward and unrealistic about the extent of global integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why the World Isn't Flat in International Politics: Enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last=Ghemawat |first=Pankaj |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-205-77876-8 |location=United States |pages=322–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars criticize social theorists for offering opinions and predictions based on theory with little practical evidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In contrast, some scholars work to dispute the pessimistic views of globalization theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Art |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Jervis |editor2-first=Robert |title=International politics: enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last1=Micklethwait |first1=John |last2=Woolridge |first2=Adrian |chapter=Why the Globalization Backlash is Stupid in International Politics |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn= |location=United States |pages=348–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World systems theory ===
World-system theory is a macro-sociological perspective that seeks to explain the dynamics of the "capitalist world economy" as a "total social system". A world-system is what Wallerstein terms a "world-economy", integrated through the market rather than a political centre, in which two or more regions are interdependent with respect to necessities like food, fuel, and two or more polities compete for domination without the emergence of one single centre forever.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfrank, Walter L. (2000). "Paradigm Regained? The Rules of Wallerstein's World-System Method. Journal of World-Systems Research. Vol. 6. N. 2 pp. 150-195&lt;/ref&gt; World-system theory was first articulated by Immanuel Wallerstein. There are three major sources of the world-system theory which conceived by Wallerstein: the Annales school's general methodology, Marx's focus on accumulation process and competitive class struggles and so on, and dependence theory's neo-Marxist explanation of development processes.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barfield (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=&amp;redir_esc=y The dictionary of anthropology, Wiley-Blackwell]'', {{ISBN|1-57718-057-7}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the transnational division of labor, world-system divides the world into core countries, peripheral countries, semi-peripheral countries and external areas. The core countries usually developed a strong central governments, extensive bureaucracies and large mercenary armies, which permit the local bourgeoisie to obtain control over international commerce and extract capital surpluses from the trade for benefits.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Paul Halsall(1997) [https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/Wallerstein.asp Modern History Sourcebook: ''Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral countries often lack strong central governments or been controlled by core countries, they export raw materials and rely on coercive labor practices.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Semi-peripheries which served as buffers between the core and the peripheries. They retain limited but declining access to international banking and the production of high-cost high-quality manufactured goods.[3] External areas such as Russia maintain their own economic systems, they want to remain outside the modern world economy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Modernisation theory ===

The theory of modernization was developed by Daniel Lerner (1958) in the "Passing of traditional society." Lerner's description of "modernised" is an individual having the ability to be empathetic and being able to see oneself in another person's situation. This concept has come from the transition of traditional societies to modern societies, where modern societies is distinctively industrial, urban, literate, and participant. This theory looks at development in a linear fashion, concluding that nations need to develop into a modern society to make it a sustainable and flourishing nation. Developing modernized societies include technological advancement, and developing media sectors to help create a participatory culture.

=== Post-colonialism ===
''See also:'' [[Post-structuralism]], [[imperialism]], [[modernity]],

Post-colonialism is a theoretical approach to looking at literature that examines the colonizer-colonized experience. It deals with the adaptation of formerly colonized nations and their development in cultural, political, economical aspects. Some Notable theoreticians include: [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Edward Said]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], [[R Siva Kumar]], [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[Derek Gregory]].

=== Cultural imperialism ===
Cultural imperialism is a mighty civilization exerts culture influence over another. Less economically prominent cultures often import culture from Western countries, which have the economic means to produce a majority of the world's cultural media, mostly via the global transmission of media.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ketchum, [http://classroom.synonym.com/meaning-cultural-imperialism-7841.html What Is the Meaning of Cultural Imperialism?]&lt;/ref&gt; The weak civilization adopts the mighty civilization's customs, philosophies, worldviews and general ways of life. The theoretical foundations of the academic study of cultural imperialism mostly come from Michel Foucault's concept of biopower, governmentality and Edward Saïd's concept of Post-colonialism, which theories see cultural imperialism as the cultural legacy of colonialism or forms of Western hegemony. Media effect study which integrated with political-economy traditional is the core argument of cultural imperialism. There are two opposite effects of media study. The negative one is that Western media imposes socio-political conflicts to the developing country and the latter one's resistance to the media effects to preserve their traditional cultural identities.&lt;ref&gt;G. K., &amp; Tan. A.S. (1987), ''American TV in the Philippines: A test of cultural impact''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; The positive effects are the issues of the process of civilization such as women's right or racial equality with exposing to Western media.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, J. G., &amp; Morgan, M. (1988). ''Culture clash: Impact of U.S. television in Korea''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; Now the term of cultural imperialism usually refers to America's global culture expansion to the rest of world, which include brand name products, video media, fast food and so on.

=== Communication for development (C4D) ===
[[Communication for Development|Communication for Development (C4D)]] is a [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] oriented aspect of global communication studies that approaches [[Global Development|global development]] with a focus on action and participation for social change enacted through communication systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Evaluating Communication for Development: A Framework for Social Change|last = Lennie &amp; Tacchi|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D underlines "voice, citizenship and collective action" as central values that promote citizen-led development where the visiting party provides guidance rather than direction within the host community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Speaking up and talking back?: Media empowerment and civic engagement among east and southern African youth|last = Tufte, Wildermuth, Hansen-Skovmoes, &amp; Mitullah|first = |publisher = [UNESCO] International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media, Nordicom.|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Göteborg, Sweden|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D often incorporates bottom-up theories of social change with the aim to create sustainable change which is believed to be more likely to occur if the efforts are planned, implemented, and sustained by community members themselves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some development workers and academics suggest that a shared definition of communication for development should be clarified, because disagreement within the field can detract from the characteristics that most scholars view as central to current development, including [[participatory action research]] (PAR).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many C4D projects revolve around media systems as a central site for social change,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which differentiates C4D from other approaches to development. Theories behind C4D highlight that development projects should be contextually situated and that communication technology will affect different types of social change accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Global media studies ===
Global media studies is a field of media study in a global scope. Media study deals with the content, history and effects of media. Media study often draws on theories and methods from the disciplines of cultural studies, rhetoric, philosophy, communication studies, feminist theory, political economy and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan, Daniel and Katz, Elihu (1992). ''Media Events''. London, England: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-55956-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these study approaches, political economic analysis is non-ignorable in understanding the current media and communication developments. But the political economic research has become more resilient because of stronger empirical studies, and the potential connections to policy-making and alternative praxis.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Wasko (2009). Global Media Studies. Television &amp; New Media. Volume 10 Number 1 January 2009 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country has its own distinct media ecosystem. The media of mainland China is state-run, so the political subjects are under the strict regulations set by the government while other areas such as sports, finance, and increasingly lucrative entertainment industry face less regulation from government.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cfr.org/about/ Council on Foreign Relations.]''&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has a well-developed media sector, but the mass media is threatened by the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism which hinder the form of Canada's media identity.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, John A. (1969). ''Mass Media in Canada''. The Ryerson Press. p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the media in America are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenues from advertisings, subscriptions and the sale of copyrighted materials. Currently, six corporations (Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom and CBS Corporation) have controlled roughly 90% of the America media.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Lutz (2012) ''[http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6 These 6 Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America.]'' Business Insider. 14 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Such successes come from the policies of the federal government or the tendency to natural monopolies in the industry.

== Central debates ==

=== Global power shifts ===

[[Frog#Locomotion|Immanuel Wallerstein]]'s world system theory develops a basic framework to understand global power shifts in the rise of the modern world. Wallerstein proposes four different categories: '''core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external''', in terms of different region's relative position in the world system. The core regions are the ones that benefited the most from the capitalist world economy, such as England and France. The peripheral areas relied on and exported raw materials to the core, such as Eastern Europe and Latin America. The semi-peripheries are either core regions in decline or peripheries attempting to improve their relative position in the world system, such as Portugal and Spain. The external areas managed to remain outside the modern world economy, such as Russia.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/wallerstein_summary.php/ Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic types of global power shifts in the 21st century. One is traditional power transition amongst states, which follows Wallerstein's world system theory. For instance, the global power shifts from the West to the East since the rise of Asia. The other is power diffusion, the way that power move from states to non-states actors. For instance, "climate change, drug trade, financial flows, pandemics, all these things that cross borders outsider the control of governments."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/joseph_nye_on_global_power_shifts/transcript?language=en#t-832180/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global public sphere ===
[[Public sphere]] theory, attributed to [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]], is a theory that in its basic premise conceives of [[democratic governments]] as those that can stand criticism that comes from public spheres. [[Public sphere]]s are places, physical or imagined, where people discuss any kind of topic, particularly topics of a societal or political nature. Global public sphere is, therefore, a public that is made of people from across the globe, who come together to discuss and act on issues that concern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of global public sphere is linked to the shift of public sphere, from restricted to nation-state, to made of individuals and groups connected across as well as within borders.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Plato, it can be argued that philosophers have been thinking about versions of a common space for all people to debate in; however, a global public sphere that can fit the description above began to appear much later. In the second half of the 20th century, the legacy of World War II and technological advancements created a new sense of the global and started the economic and political phenomena that we now call [[globalization]]. This includes the expansion of humankind into space, which gave individuals the sense of a global unity, the growth of satellite technology, which allowed for people across the globe to view the same television channels, and the internet, which can provide access to an unprecedented amount of information and spaces to connect with other people.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Cultural industries ===
The term "[[culture industry]]" appeared in the [[post-war period]]. At that time, culture and industry were argued to be opposites.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unctad.org/en/Docs/ditctab20103_en.pdf|title = Creative Economy 2010 Report|date = 2010|publisher = UNCTAD}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural industry|Cultural industries]]" are also referred to as the "[[Creative industries]].

==== Definitions and scope of cultural industries ====

In the present day, there remain different interpretations of culture as an industry. For some, cultural industries are simply those industries that produce cultural goods and services.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the cultural industries are regarded as those industries that "combine the creation, production and commercialization of contents which are intangible and cultural in nature. These contents are typically protected by copyright and they can take the form of goods or services". According to [[UNESCO]], an essential part of cultural industries is that they are "central in promoting and maintaining cultural diversity and in ensuring democratic access to culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.unesco.org/themes/protecting-our-heritage-and-fostering-creativity |title=Protecting Our Heritage and Fostering Creativity |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cultural industries" combines the cultural and economic, which gives the cultural industries a distinctive profile.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In France, the "cultural industries" have recently been defined as a set of economic activities that combine the functions of conception, creation and production of culture with more industrial functions in the large-scale manufacture and commercialization cultural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/Politiques-ministerielles/Etudes-et-statistiques|title = de la prospective et des statistiques|last = |first = |date = 2006|journal = Département des études|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, economic activities involved in the preservation of heritage are also included in the definition of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/87-542-x/2011001/section/s3-eng.htm|title=Defining culture|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global cultural industries ====
Since the rise of the cultural industries has occurred simultaneously with [[economic globalization]], cultural industries have close connections with globalization and global communication.

[[Herbert Schiller]] argued that the 'entertainment, communications and information (ECI) complex were having a direct impact on culture and human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Culture Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science Press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Herbert Schiller|Schiller]] argued, the result of transnational corporate expansion is the perpetuation of [[cultural imperialism]], defined as "the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Cultural Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave of transnational corporate expansion, which began in the 1970s with the emergence of [[Free trade zone|Export Processing Zones]] in developing countries, is focused on the development of [[global production networks]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Creative Industries|last=Flew|first=Terry|publisher=Polity Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7456-4839-2|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=19–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was described as a "new international division of labour" (NIDL) by the German political economists Frӧbel et al. (1980).

Ernst and Kim have argued that GPNs are changing the nature of the multinational corporation itself, from "stand alone overseas investment projects, to "global network [[flagship]]s" that integrate their dispersed supply, knowledge and customer bases into global and regional production networks", entailing a shift from top-down hierarchical models of corporate control to increasingly networked and collective forms of organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Production Networks, Knowledge Diffusion, and Local Capacity Formation|last = Ernst |first=D. |last2=Kim |first2=L. |date = 2002|journal = Research Policy |volume=31|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global media empires ====
The largest firms in media and media-related industries have a very high international profile.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Global media empires such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[News Corporation]], [[Time Warner|Time-Warner]] and [[Viacom]]-[[CBS]] now derive 25-45 per cent of their revenues outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding Global Media|last = Flew.T|first = |publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Basingstoke, UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often argued that the global media are dominated by a small number of powerful media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Herman and McChesney (1997) argued that the global media were "dominated by three or four dozen large [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporations]] (TNCs) with fewer than ten mostly US-based media conglomerates towering over the global market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Global Media: The New Missionaries of Global Capitalism|last = Herman,E.S &amp; McChesney, R.W|first = |publisher = Cassell|year = 1997|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Manfred Steger]] has observed that " to a very large extent, the global cultural flows of our time are generated and directed by global media empires that rely on powerful communication technologies to spread their message."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last = Steger.M|first = |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2003|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that during the last two decades, a few very large TNCs would come to dominate the global market for entertainment, news, television, and film.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Diaspora ===
[[Diaspora]] is often confused with [[wikt:exodus|exodus]]. Diasporas are minority groups that have a sense of connection with a larger community outside of the borders they currently inhabit, and through diasporic media create a sense of a larger identity and community, whether imagined or real.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In scholarly work about diaspora in communication studies, the view of nation and culture as interchangeable terms is no longer prevalent. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] theorized of hybridity, which he distinguished from "old style pluralism", "nomadic voyaging of the postmodern", and "global homogenization". Hybridity is the retention of an original identity and strong ties to an original country and tradition, but with the understanding that there is no unchanged, ideal nation of the past that they can return to. To be hybrid is to also adapt to a new culture and tradition without simply assimilating in it, but rather negotiating a place between the "original" and "new" cultures.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In Communication studies, diaspora is discussed as the identity that unifies people across time and space, sometimes existing in physical spaces and other times existing in imagined 'non-spaces'. However, it has been argued that the concept of 'diaspora' implies ethnic homogeneity and essentializes identity to only ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; One of the most cited and well-known works in the field of diasporic media is [[Hamid Naficy]]'s work on exiled Iranian Americans' creation of cable television in the United States.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Diasporic media refer to media that address the needs of particular ethnic, religious, and/or linguistic groups that live in multicultural settings {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . Diasporic media can be in the diaspora's traditional language or in another language, and they can include news or media from the "origin" country or they can contain the diaspora's local news or media. Diasporic media can be created in radio, television, film, music, in newspapers, magazines, and other publishing, as well as online. It can be argued that the development and spread of satellite television is an instrumental element of the growth of diasporic media today. Satellite television allowed migrants to access the news and popular culture from their homeland, as well as allowing people who speak the same language to access the same channels that might be produced outside of the "homeland"&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diasporic Media Across Europe: Multicultural Societies and the Universalism–Particularism Continuum|journal = Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|pages = 481–498|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/13691830500058794|first = Myria|last = Georgiou|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary studies of diaspora show that diasporic media are part of the change in the tendency Immanuel Wallerstein described in his world systems theory. The world systems theory postulates that much of the flow of people in the world has been from the 'periphery', or economically-developing states, towards the centre; which are often metropolitan, economically-wealthy states that grew their wealth in colonialist entrepreneurship. However, contrary to the movement of people, the flow of information (including media products), has tended to be from the centre to the periphery.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Go with the Flow: Diasporas and Media|last = Sinclair|first = John|date = February 2000|journal = Television &amp; New Media|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Cunningham|first2 = Stuart|issue = 1:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology and media ===
The advancement of media and technology have played the pivotal role in process of [[globalization]] and global communication.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding the media|last = Devereux|first = Eoin|publisher = SAGE|year = 2007|isbn = 9781412929912|location = London, Los Angeles|pages = 28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cable television]], [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], [[digitalization]], direct broadcast [[satellite]]s as well as the [[Internet]] have created a situation where vast amounts of information can be transferred around the globe in a matter of seconds.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

During the early 20th century, [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephony]], and [[radio]] started the process of global communication.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Media, Historic Development of|last = Monroe|first = E. Price|date = 2003|journal = Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications, Volume 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As media technologies developed intensely, they were thought to create, in Marshall McLuhan’ s famous words, a ‘‘global village.’’&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]], the world’ s first [[artificial satellite]], on October 4, 1957, marked the beginning of technologies that would further interconnect the world.  The first live global television broadcast occurred when [[Neil Armstrong]] stepped onto the moon in July 1969.  In November 1972, pay TV caused expansion of cable when [[Service Electric]] offered Home Box Office over its cable system. By 2000, over direct broadcast satellite, a household could receive channels from all over the world. Now with the [[World Wide Web]], [[Smartphone|smart phones]], [[Tablet computer|tablet devices]], smart televisions and other digital media devices, billions of people are now able to access media content that was once tied to particular communications media ([[Input/output|print]], broadcast) or platforms ([[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], [[Film|cinema]]).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Justice ===
Justice in communication studies includes, but is not limited to, the concern with democratic process and fostering democratic publics  {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]] theorized of [[public sphere]] (in ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'') as the space that is created whenever matters of common concern are discussed between the state and civil society. Thus, public sphere includes not only the media, but also public protest in the form of marches, demonstrations, et cetera. There are, however, critiques of political economy in whose view it is impossible to work within the current system to produce democratic publics. Such a critique is that produced by [[Karl Marx]], who saw institutions such as parliament, the state, the 'acceptable' public sphere, economic enterprises, and so on as structurally produced and perpetuated by a capitalist system, and thus they can not be mobilized to change it. In such a system, there can only be illusory justice, which is fair only within the logic of the system. This illusion of justice is produced through dominating [[ideology]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Justice and Communication: Mill, Marx, and Habermas|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|journal = Social Justice Research|date = 2009-02-19|issn = 0885-7466|pages = 134–155|volume = 22|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|language = en|first = Martin|last = Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue of justice in communication studies is the question of decolonizing research methods and theoretical discourse {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . The idea of decolonizing research comes from a rejection of the functionalist approach, which assumed that research can be conducted in a vacuum, free of ideology or the researcher's biases. This approach assumed cultures to be unchanging, homogenous, and isolated from each other. The purpose of decolonizing research and discourse is to 'uncloak' research as an unbiased power structure, and produce research that is more self-aware. The approach in decolonizing research methods attempts to create methodologies that treat the people in the study as participants or partners, rather than subjects - which is a term that in itself carries strong connotations of colonialism. Decolonizing research also involves moving away from Eurocentric models that are assumed to work anywhere else, and instead to create work that is more useful in local contexts. Decolonial approaches specifically seek to produce knowledge about the mechanisms and effects of colonialism. These approaches allow former subjects to 'talk back', which is a reflection of independent agency, on the colonizer's own terms of research, rather than to be 'given' a voice, which is an unequal power structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decolonial Methodologies: Social Justice Perspectives in Intercultural Technical Communication Research|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2190/TW.44.3.e|journal = Journal of Technical Writing and Communication|pages = 297–327|volume = 44|issue = 3|doi = 10.2190/tw.44.3.e|first = Godwin Y.|last = Agboka|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sociology}}
In any given society, a '''taboo''' is an implicit prohibition on something (usually against an utterance or behavior) based on a cultural sense that it is excessively repulsive or, perhaps, too sacred for ordinary people.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. "[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/579821/taboo Taboo]." Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Retrieved 21 Mar. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, 11th Edition. "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/taboo Taboo]."&lt;/ref&gt; Such prohibitions are present in virtually all societies.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; On a comparative basis taboos, for example related to food items, seem to make no sense at all as what may be declared unfit for one group by [[Custom (law)|custom]] or [[religion]] may be perfectly acceptable to another.

Whether scientifically correct or not, taboos are often meant to protect the human individual, but there are numerous other reasons for their existence. An ecological or medical background is apparent in many, including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin. Taboos can help utilize a resource more efficiently, but when applied to only a subsection of the community they can also serve to suppress a subsection of the [[community]]. A taboo acknowledged by a particular group or [[tribe]] as part of their ways, aids in the cohesion of the group, helps that particular group to stand out and maintain its identity in the face of others and therefore creates a feeling of "belonging".&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 2009" /&gt;

The meaning of the word "taboo" has been somewhat expanded in the [[social science]]s to strong prohibitions relating to any area of human activity or custom that is sacred or forbidden based on [[Morality|moral judgment]], religious beliefs, or cultural [[norm (sociology)|norms]].&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer-Rochow| first= Victor Benno | title= Food taboos: their origins and purposes|journal= Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine | date=2009| volume=5-18:|

==Etymology==
The term "taboo" comes from the [[Tongan language|Tongan]] ''[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]'' or [[Fijian language|Fijian]] ''tabu'' ("prohibited", "disallowed", "forbidden"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; related among others to the [[Maori language|Maori]] ''tapu'', [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] ''kapu'', and [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] ''fady''. Its English use dates to 1777 when the British explorer [[Captain James Cook|James Cook]] visited [[Tonga]], and referred to the [[Tongans]]' use of the term "taboo" for "any thing is forbidden to be eaten, or made use of".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|King|1821|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=h6UFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA462 462]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:
{{Quote|Not one of them would sit down, or eat a bit of any thing.... On expressing my surprise at this, they were all taboo, as they said; which word has a very comprehensive meaning; but, in general, signifies that a thing is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|King|1821|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=h6UFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA348 348]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term was translated to him as "consecrated, inviolable, forbidden, unclean or cursed."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Cook|King|1821}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tabu'' itself has been derived from alleged Tongan [[Morpheme|morphemes]] ''ta'' ("mark") and ''bu'' ("especially"), but this may be a [[False etymology|folk etymology]] (Tongan does not actually have a [[phoneme]] /b/), and ''tapu'' is usually treated as a unitary, non-[[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] word inherited from [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] *''tapu'', in turn inherited from [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]] *''tabu'', with the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] meaning "sacred, forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]. "[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=taboo&amp;searchmode=none Taboo]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

On the main island, the word is often appended to the end of "Tonga" as ''Tongatapu'', here meaning "Sacred South" rather than "Forbidden South".

[[Sigmund Freud]] speculated that [[incest taboo|incest]] and [[patricide]] were the only two universal taboos and formed the basis of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''[[Totem and Taboo]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, although [[cannibalism]], in-group [[murder]], and [[incest]] are taboo in the majority of societies, exceptions can be found, such as marriages between brothers and sisters in [[Roman Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;

Common taboos involve restrictions or ritual regulation of killing and hunting; sex and sexual relationships; reproduction; the [[taboo on the dead|dead]] and their graves; as well as food and dining (primarily cannibalism and [[dietary laws]] such as [[vegetarianism]], ''[[kashrut]]'', and ''[[halal]]'') or religious ([[treif]] and [[haram]]). In [[Madagascar]], a strong code of taboos, known as ''[[fady (taboo)|fady]]'', constantly change and are formed from new experiences. Each region, village or tribe may have its own ''fady''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The word "taboo" gained popularity at times, with some scholars looking for ways to apply it where other English words had previously been applied. For example, [[John Merlin Powis Smith|J. M. Powis Smith]], in his book ''The American Bible'' (editor's preface 1927), used "taboo" occasionally in relation to Israel's [[Tabernacle]] and ceremonial laws, including {{Bibleverse|Exodus|30:36}}, {{Bibleverse|Exodus|29:37}}; {{Bibleverse|Numbers|16:37–38}}; {{Bibleverse|Deuteronomy|22:9}}, {{Bibleverse|Isaiah|65:5}}, {{Bibleverse|Ezekiel|44:19}} and {{Bibleverse|Ezekiel|46:20}}.

[[Albert Schweitzer]] wrote a chapter about taboos of the people of Gabon. As an example, it was considered a misfortune for twins to be born, and they would be subject to many rules not incumbent on other people.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Albert. ''African Notebook'' 1958. Indiana University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
[[Communist]] and [[materialist]] theorists have argued that taboos can be used to reveal the histories of societies when other records are lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Marta Dyczok|author2=Oxana Gaman-Golutvina|title=Media, Democracy and Freedom: The Post-Communist Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meUcrEBRpgMC|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-0343-0311-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=meUcrEBRpgMC&amp;pg=PA209 209]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvin Harris]] particularly endeavored to explain taboos as a consequence of ecologic and economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://sociology101.net/readings/Indias-sacred-cow.pdf |author=Marvin Harris |title=India's Sacred Cow |access-date=2015-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610221816/http://sociology101.net/readings/Indias-sacred-cow.pdf |archive-date=2015-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==
Some argue that contemporary [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] societies have taboos against [[tribalism]]s (for example, [[ethnocentrism]] and [[nationalism]]) and [[prejudice]]s ([[racism]], [[sexism]], [[religious extremism]]).&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Putnam | first = Robert D. | author-link = Robert D.

Changing social customs and standards also create new taboos, such as bans on [[history of slavery|slavery]]; extension of the [[pedophilia]] taboo to [[ephebophilia]];&lt;ref name="www.usccb.org"&gt;{{cite web|first=Frederick |last=S.

In medicine, professionals who practice in ethical and moral [[Loophole|grey areas]], or fields subject to [[social stigma]] such as [[late termination of pregnancy]], may refrain from public discussion of their practice.

'''''Taboo''''' is a [[documentary television series]] that premiered in 2002 on the [[National Geographic Channel]]. The program is an educational look into "[[taboo]]" rituals and traditions practiced in some societies, yet forbidden and illegal in others.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite news |first=Russell |last=Howard |title='Taboo: Sexuality' Premiers on National Geographic Channel |url=http://www.tgcrossroads.org/news/archive.asp?aid=486 |publisher=tgcrossroads.org |date=November 20, 2002 |accessdate=2007-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004214402/http://www.tgcrossroads.org/news/archive.asp?aid=486 |archivedate=October 4, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each hour-long episode details a specific topic, such as marriage or initiation rituals, and explores how such topics are viewed throughout the world. ''Taboo'' generally focuses on the most misunderstood, despised, or disagreed-upon activities, jobs, and roles.

==Episodes==
[[National Geographic TV]] producers did not produce ''Taboo'' in seasons of fixed episode counts, thus the number of episodes in each production batch varies wildly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/taboo/|title=Taboo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='NGC Forum |url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/community/forums/?plckForumPage=ForumDiscussion&amp;plckDiscussionId=Cat%3aPublicForum%3ab311e06a-705e-49a9-a942-61b8501f1ec6Discussion%3a1091244d-e085-421b-825c-2d8ada7b54ba |publisher=National Geographic Channel Forum |date=February 20, 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production order does not necessarily match the order episodes were arranged into for DVD "season" boxsets.

'''''The Encyclopaedia Sinica''''' is a 1917 [[English language|English-language]] [[encyclopedia]] on [[China]] and China-related subjects [[editing|edit]]ed by [[English people|English]] [[missionary]] [[Samuel Couling]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="615">In the performing arts, the '''wardrobe''' is the actor's costumes, shoes, undergarments, hats and costume related personal props such as gloves, jewelry, parasols, fans and pocket books. The name ''wardrobe'' is a [[metonym]] for the contents of a [[wardrobe]]. In theater, a [[wardrobe supervisor]] is responsible for supervising all wardrobe related activities during the course of a theatrical run. A wardrobe department in film production employs [[costume designer]]s and [[Costume coordination|coordinators]] who clothe the performers.
