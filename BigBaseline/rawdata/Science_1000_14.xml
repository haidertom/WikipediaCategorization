'''''A Letter to a Friend''''' (written 1656; published posthumously in 1690), by Sir [[Thomas Browne]], the 17th century [[philosopher]] and [[physician]], is a medical treatise of case-histories and witty speculations upon the [[human condition]].

It is believed to be the source of a term Mary Leitao found in 2001 to describe her son's skin condition. She chose the name "[[Morgellons]] disease" from a skin condition described by Browne in ''Letter to a Friend'', thus:

:''"...&amp;nbsp;that endemial distemper of children in Languedoc, called the morgellons, wherein they critically break out with harsh hairs on their backs."''&lt;ref&gt;"The Major Works of Sir Thomas Browne", edited and with an Introduction by C.&amp;nbsp;A. Partides. Penguin 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

There is, however, no suggestion that the symptoms described by Browne are linked to the alleged modern cases of Morgellons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2875">'''Advancing Secondary Science Education thru Tetrahymena''' ([[Asset (disambiguation)|ASSET]]) is an [[organization]] at [[Cornell University]] that is dedicated to expanding the use of the protist ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' in K-12 classrooms.  They are funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] through the SEPA (Science Education Partnership Award) Program.  Although their name includes the word "secondary," they have worked in recent years to develop materials for students in elementary, middle and high schools.  The group develops modules, which are stand-alone labs or lessons that can be inserted into the curriculum of a class at the discretion of the teacher.

==Modules==

Modules are designed to be stand-alone lessons that fit into and compliment a life [[science]] curriculum.  The ASSET program ships all the equipment that is needed to complete the modules to the [[teacher]] in a reusable plastic container, at ASSET's expense. The teacher who requested the materials can use them for up to two weeks.  At the end of the two weeks, the teacher uses a pre-paid return label to send the materials back in the same container.  Some materials, such as live cells, may be sent separately to provide for a chance for the [[culture]] to be established in the teacher's classroom.

===Science Modules===

ASSET has created fifteen science modules, each of which addresses a particular topic relevant to life science education in [[United States]] school curricula.

====Cannibalism and Interspecefic Predation====

This module utilizes two species of ''[[Tetrahymena]]'':  ''Tetrahymena thermophilia'' and ''Tetrahymena vorax''.   In the lab, an extract, called [[stomatin]], is made from the thermophilia, then placed into the vorax culture.  There, it induces a transformation from the microstome form to the macrostome form in T. vorax.  This transformation is most notable by a marked increase in the size of the cell (doubling or sometimes more), the resorption of the microstomal oral apparatus and the construction of a much larger macrostomal oral apparatus.  This transformation allows the macrostomal T. vorax cells to prey on T. thermophilia, but also to cannibalize the microstomes of their own species.&lt;ref name="vorax paper"&gt;[http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/14/2089.long] In the polymorphic ciliate Tetrahymena vorax, the non-selective phagocytosis seen in microstomes changes to a highly selective process in macrostomes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and Society Modules===

ASSET has also created five science and society modules, which are designed to integrate social studies and science education into one unit.

===Elementary School Modules===

'''''African Genesis: A Personal Investigation into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man,''''' usually referred to as ''African Genesis,'' is a 1961 nonfiction work by [[Robert Ardrey]]. It posited the hypothesis that man evolved on the African continent from carnivorous, predatory ancestors who distinguished themselves from apes by the use of weapons.&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;Ardrey, Robert. ''African Genesis: A Personal Investigation into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man.'' New York: Atheneum. 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AGkindle"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/African-Genesis-Personal-Investigation-Origins/dp/0988604302 Kindle Edition Description via Amazon Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The work bears on questions of human origins, human nature, and human uniqueness. It has been widely read and continues to inspire significant controversy.&lt;ref name="Brain"&gt;Brain, C.K. 1983. "Robert Ardrey and the 'Killer-Apes'" in Brain, C.K. 1983 ''The Hunters of the Hunted: An Introduction to African Cave Taphonomy.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

''African Genesis'' is the first in Robert Ardrey's ''[[Nature of Man Series]]''. It is followed by ''[[The Territorial Imperative]]'' (1966), ''[[The Social Contract (1970 book)|The Social Contract]]'' (1970), and ''[[The Hunting Hypothesis]]'' (1976). It was illustrated by Ardrey's wife, the [[South Africa]]n actress and illustrator Berdine Ardrey (née Grunewald).

==Background==

Robert Ardrey, at the time a working playwright and screenwriter, travelled in 1955 to [[Africa]], partly at the behest of [[Richard Foster Flint]], to investigate claims made by [[Raymond Dart]] about a specimen of [[Australopithecus africanus]].&lt;ref name="Education"&gt;Ardrey, Robert; Ardrey, Daniel (ed.). “The Education of Robert Ardrey: An Autobiography” (unpublished manuscript ca. 1980, available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}}

He met Dart in March 1955. Dart, in his laboratory at [[University of the Witwatersrand|Witwatersrand University Medical School]], had assembled evidence for a controversial thesis. Among the collection were fossil baboon skulls from the caves of [[Taung]], Terkfontein and Makapan that he believed showed fractures caused by ''Australopithecus'' wielding bone clubs; the jaw of a juvenile ape-man from [[Makapansgat]] which had been fractured and lost its incisors; and 7,000 fossil bones from the Makapansgat cave. Among the fossils, skulls and lower leg bones were disproportionately represented, leading Dart to theorize that man's ancestors were hunters who used bones as weapons.&lt;ref name="Education" /&gt;{{rp|125–6}}&lt;ref name="NatureOfMan" /&gt;{{rp|41:20}} His overall thesis was that "it was the ape-man's instinct for violence, and his successful development of lethal weapons, that gave him his dominance in the animal world from the very beginning. Those instincts are with us today."&lt;ref name="KillerApes"&gt;Brain, C.K. 1981. "Robert Ardrey and the 'Killer-Apes'" in Brain, C.K. 1983 ''The Hunters of the Hunted: An Introduction to African Cave Taphonomy.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ardrey was initially much taken by the theory. As a correspondent he wrote an article about it for [[The Reporter (magazine)|''The Reporter'']]. After receiving significant attention the article was reprinted in ''[[Science Digest]],'' which marked the beginning of the spread of popular notions about ''Australopithecus.'' The article in ''Science Digest'' also led to The [[Smithsonian Institution]] contacting Dart and eventually providing him funding to continue his research.&lt;ref name="Education" /&gt;{{rp|123–5}}

Following a visit by [[Kenneth Oakley|Dr. Kenneth P. Oakley]] Ardrey agreed to write a book on the subject. Oakley secured an office for Ardrey in the National History Museum in London, as well as access to its private libraries. Ardrey spent six years traveling between Northern universities and African archeological sites. During this time he worked with many notable scientists, including [[Louis Leakey]] (then affiliated with the [[National Museums of Kenya#Coryndon Museum|Coryndon Museum]] in [[Kenya]]) and Tony Sutcliffe (then affiliated with the [[Royal Archaeological Institute]]).&lt;ref name="Education" /&gt;{{rp|139–40}}&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Peter "The Author who Stands out from the Crowd." ''The Observer,'' 1970. pp. 55-7. Print.: "His first book about the evolution of man, 'African Genesis', took five years of travel and research, during which he earned nothing. Hollywood financed it. He finds that a nice thought."&lt;/ref&gt;

Ardrey eventually came to be a vocal proponent of this thesis, introducing it, in modified form, to a broad audience with ''African Genesis''. He added to it his own ideas about the role of territory in human behavior, about hierarchy in social animals, and about the instinctual status of the urge to dominate ones fellows.&lt;ref name="KillerApes" /&gt;

==Legacy==
''African Genesis'' met with massive popular success and widespread recognition. It became an international bestseller and was translated into dozens of languages.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard. ''Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist.'' 2014. New York: Ecco. Print&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 it was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]] in nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;Via the National Book Award [https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1962 website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named ''African Genesis'' the most notable nonfiction book of the '60s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941837,00.html ''Time" Friday, Dec. 26, 1969. List accessible online]&lt;/ref&gt; The book has continued to bear on the popular imagination of human nature.

Ardrey's theories flew in the face of prevailing theories of human origins. At the time of the publication of ''African Genesis'' it was generally agreed that human beings evolved from Asian ancestors. Furthermore, it was taken for granted that these ancestors were herbivorous. The idea of an African Genesis of humanity was met with fervent resistance in the scientific community.&lt;ref name="NatureOfMan"&gt;{{cite AV media

On a grander scale, Ardrey challenged the reigning methodological assumption of the social sciences, that human behavior was fundamentally distinct from animal behavior. As he put it in his next book, ''The Territorial Imperative'', "The dog barking at you from behind his master’s fence acts for a motive indistinguishable from that of his master when the fence was built."&lt;ref name="TI"&gt;Ardrey, Robert. "The Territorial Imperative: A Personal Inquiry into the Animal Origins of Property and Nations." New York: Atheneum. 1966. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of ''African Genesis'' Ardrey's theories became mired in controversy because of his notions about innate human violence and inherited instinctual aggression. (For more details, see ''[[The Territorial Imperative]]''.) Later commentators, however, have come to emphasize the broader implications of Ardrey's theories; it is now commonly accepted that the controversy obscured the core of his thinking. William Wright, for example, writing in 2013, writes "Not only was Ardrey, with his three-million-year-old unsolved murders, claiming that evolution has saddled us with a battery of behavioral traits, but he was also reckless enough to emphasize the most repugnant, the killer impulse. This inflammatory claim certainly won Ardrey attention, but the angry controversy it provoked almost obscured the main point: that human behavior is as much a product of evolution as the human body."&lt;ref name="BornWright"&gt;Wright, William. ''Born That Way: Genes, Behavior, Personality.'' New York: Routledge. 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}}

While Ardrey's theses on aggression were controversial, he was also challenged on his conviction that the study of animal behavior is necessarily relevant to the study of human behavior. This precept has gained widespread acceptance and, due in large part to Ardrey's work, passed into the scientific commonsense. Following the 1961 publication of ''African Genesis'' the science of [[ethology]], which is based on the methodological assumption of the cross-relevance of [[anthropology]] and [[zoology]], underwent a massive flourishing. 1966 saw [[Konrad Lorenz|Lorenz]]'s ''[[On Aggression]]'' published, followed by [[Desmond Morris]]'s ''[[The Naked Ape]]'' in 1967, [[Lionel Tiger]]'s ''Men in Groups'' in 1969, and Tiger and [[Robin Fox|Fox]]'s ''The Imperial Animal'' in 1971. Along with ethology's ascendence came a renaissance of its central premise—then much derided in scientific communities by blank-state theorists—that the study of animal behavior could tell us much about human behavior.&lt;ref name="BornWright" /&gt;{{rp|178}}

''African Genesis'' led Ardrey into a long career of work in anthropology and ethology. Regarding his later-in-life return to science, Ardrey wrote "while peasant and poet may apprehend a truth, it is the obligation of science to define it, to prove it, to assimilate its substance into the body of scientific thought, and to make its conclusions both available and understandable to the society of which science is a part."&lt;ref name="AG" /&gt;

His writings on paleoanthropology, ethnology, and anthropology, along with the massive popular success of ''African Genesis,'' are widely credited with initiating public interest in these fields and sparking widespread popular debate about human nature as it is connected to human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see Carmel Shrire's entry on Ardrey in the Encyclopedia ''History of Physical Anthropology'': "Ardrey's ... writings opened the fields of paleoanthropology, ethnology, and anthropology to a wide readership." Schrire, Carmel "Ardrey, Robert (1908-1980)" in Spencer, Frank (ed.) ''History of Physical Anthropology, Volume 1.'' Taylor &amp; Francis. Jan 1 1997. p. 100. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also e.g. the editor's note attached to his fifth appearance in ''Time'' magazine: "Both of these books enjoyed, along with the scientific uproar they created, a wide general readership, and Ardrey ... today can claim major credit for having introduced the public to the new field of ethology, the study of animal behavior and its relationship to man." Graves, Ralph. "A 'Scientific Amateur' Expands his Territory." ''Time'' 11 September 1970: 1. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also e.g. Potts, Rick, quoted in Clark, Mary E. ''In Search of Human Nature.'' New York: Routledge. 2005. 103. Print: "In ''African Genesis'' (1960), Robert Ardrey introduced to the world at large the hypothesis that hunting and a murderous life-style played the leading role in the origin of human nature."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Kimberlin Brain|C.K. Brain]], for example, writes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''African Genesis'' has, in all probability, been read by more people throughout the world than any other book on human evolution and the nature of man. Its influence has been very great indeed as it fermented an intense debate about these topics, and catalysed a new set of concepts in paleoanthropology.&lt;ref name="Brain" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several scientists credit Ardrey's work, and ''African Genesis'' in particular, with launching them into their studies. Famed [[paleoanthropologist]] [[Rick Potts]], who has been the director of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History's]] [[National Museum of Natural History#Hall of Human Origins|Human Origins Program]] since 1985 points to ''African Genesis'' as one of the two most formative books of his early years.&lt;ref name="Anthronotes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anthropology.si.edu/outreach/anthnote/Summer99/anthnote.html |title=Human Origins: One Man's Search for the Causes in Time |last=Selig | first=Ruth Osterweis |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |date=Spring–Summer 1999 |website=Anthronotes |access-date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015 PBS film documentary ''[[Dawn of Humanity]],'' Potts recites the beginning of the book from memory.&lt;ref name="DawnOfMan"&gt;''[[Dawn of Humanity]]'' - 2015 PBS documentary film {{rp|43:45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, defending his film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' from [[Fred M. Hechinger]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] cited Ardrey. In particular, he quoted ''African Genesis'' (along with ''The Social Contract'').&lt;ref name=Kubrick&gt;Kubrick, Stanley. Letter from Stanley Kubrick to The New York Times. "Now Kubrick Fights Back." ''The New York Times,'' 27 February 1972, section 2, pp. 1 &amp; 11. Print. Retrievable [http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/Q47.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrick was a notable fan of Ardrey's work, and also cited him as an inspiration for his 1968 film, ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name="KubrickClarkeErlichMiamiU"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.users.muohio.edu/erlichrd/350/odyssey.php |title= Strange Odyssey: From Dart to Ardrey to Kubrick and Clarke |author= Richard D.

'''Arthur Good''' (16&lt;ref name="Geneanet"/&gt; or 26&lt;ref name="BNF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalogue Général|url=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb12058496c|website=BnF (nouvelle fenêtre)|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; August 1853 – 30 March 1928) was a French engineer,&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt; science educator, author and caricaturist who used the pen name '''Tom Tit'''.  He wrote a series of weekly articles, ''La Science Amusante'', or ''Amusing Science'', that were collected in book form and have been translated and republished in more than 130 editions in several languages.  The illustrations for his do-it-yourself scientific apparatuses have been described as [[surrealist]] [[collages]], and were an inspiration for surrealist artists such as [[Max Ernst]] and [[Joseph Cornell]].

== Personal life ==
Arthur Good was born in [[Montivilliers]], [[Seine-Maritime]], [[France]] on 16&lt;ref name="Geneanet"/&gt; or 26&lt;ref name="BNF"/&gt; August 1853. He was the son of Protestant pastor Gustave Frédéric Good (1823–1896) and Louise Stéphanie Monod (1827–1909).&lt;ref name="Geneanet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Good|url=http://gw.geneanet.org/bourelly?lang=fr&amp;p=arthur&amp;n=good|website=Geneanet|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good graduated from the [[École Centrale Paris|École centrale des arts et manufacture]] in [[Paris]], where he studied engineering.&lt;ref name="Chemineau" /&gt;

He married Jeanne Valon (1857–1910) in Paris on 6 April 1881. They had four children.&lt;ref name="Geneanet" /&gt;

Under the pen name Tom Tit, Arthur Good wrote a series of weekly articles, ''La Science Amusante'', or ''Amusing Science'', for the French magazine ''L’Illustration''.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; Good presented a range of physical experiments, from "simple games meant to amuse the family" to experiments "of a truly scientific character". They introduce a range of physical and scientific principles&lt;ref name="Lachapelle"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lachapelle|first1=Sofie|title=Conjuring Science: A History of Scientific Entertainment and Stage Magic in Modern France|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-137-49768-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HB7eCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[magnetism]] and [[surface tension]].&lt;ref name="Elder"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elder|first1=R.

He dedicated ''La Science Amusante'' to one of his children, saying "In dedicating this volume today, I would like it to be a souvenir for you of the happy moments we have spent together trying the experiments and constructing the apparatuses".&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt;

Good created improvised scientific apparatuses like his ''Soap-bubble Chandelier'' using common items such as bottles, eggs, corks, candles, and soap.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt;  His constructions have an imaginative charm that has led to them being compared to surrealistic collages.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt;  Nonetheless, his drawings were seriously and carefully rendered by scientific engraver [[Louis Poyet]] (1846–1913) and his assistants.&lt;ref name="Edelman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edelman|first1=Eric|title=The Collaged World of Tom Tit|url=http://blog.retrocollage.com/collaged-world-tom-tit/|website=RetroCollage|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poyet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le graveur du dimanche * Louis Poyet|url=http://gonefishing.over-blog.com/article-le-graveur-du-dimanche-louis-poyet-48802161.html|website=Gone Fishing|date=18 April 2010|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original columns from ''La Science Amusante'' were collected and published in a three-volume series in France. Each volume contained 100 amusements. Beginning in 1889,&lt;ref name="Lachapelle" /&gt; they have been reprinted in over 130 editions.&lt;ref name="Elder" /&gt; Collections of amusements were translated and published in English, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;ref name="Edelman" /&gt; In the United States they appeared as ''Magical Experiments, or Science in Play'', and in England as ''Scientific Amusements''. A selection has also been republished as ''100 Amazing Magic Tricks''.&lt;ref name="Elder" /&gt;  Good's books are considered to have laid the foundations for  modern approaches to science education in their introduction of "kitchen science" and hands-on experiments for children.&lt;ref name="Buxton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buxton |first1=Cory A. |last2=Provenzo, Jr. |first2=Eugene F. |title=Teaching Science in Elementary and Middle School: A Cognitive and Cultural Approach |publisher=Sage |year=2007 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aqDhzUdLS4C&amp;pg=PA44 |oclc=72353389 |isbn=978-1-4129-2497-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''astronaut''' or '''cosmonaut''' is a person trained by a [[List of human spaceflight programs|human spaceflight program]] to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a [[spacecraft]]. Although generally reserved for professional space travelers, the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists.&lt;ref name="fact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/astro.pdf|title=Astronaut Fact Book|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=2006|author=[[NASA]]|format=PDF| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926023336/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/astro.pdf| archivedate= September 26, 2007 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="utah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utahstatesman.com/campus_news/1.563784 |title=Former astronaut visits USU |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=The Utah Statesman |year=2005 |author=Marie MacKay |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926175913/http://www.utahstatesman.com/campus_news/1.563784 |archivedate=September 26, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military or by civilian space agencies. With the suborbital flight of the privately funded [[SpaceShipOne]] in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the [[commercial astronaut]].

The criteria for what constitutes [[human spaceflight]] vary. The [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) Sporting Code for astronautics recognizes only flights that exceed an [[Kármán line|altitude of {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}}]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fai.org/sites/default/files/documents/sporting_code_section_8_edition_2009.pdf FAI Sporting Code, Section 8, Paragraph 2.18.1]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, professional, military, and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of {{convert|50|mi|km}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/NewsReleases/2005/05-57.html|title=X-15 Space Pioneers Now Honored as Astronauts|first=Mary|last=Whelan|date=June 5, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are awarded [[Astronaut Badge|astronaut wings]].

{{As of|2016|November|17}}, a total of 552 people from [[Timeline of space travel by nationality|36 countries]] have reached {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} or more in altitude, of which 549 reached [[low Earth orbit]] or beyond.&lt;ref name="stats1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldspaceflight.com/bios/stats.php|title=Astronaut/Cosmonaut Statistics|accessdate=November 17, 2016|publisher=www.worldspaceflight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
{{See also|Astronaut ranks and positions}}

In 1959, when both the United States and [[Soviet Union]] were planning, but had yet to launch humans into space, [[NASA]] Administrator [[T. Keith Glennan]] and his Deputy Administrator, Dr. [[Hugh Latimer Dryden|Hugh Dryden]], discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called ''astronauts'' or ''cosmonauts''. Dryden preferred "cosmonaut", on the grounds that flights would occur in the ''cosmos'' (near space), while the "astro" prefix suggested flight to the stars. Most NASA [[Space Task Group]] members preferred "astronaut", which survived by common usage as the preferred American term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dethloff | first=Henry C. | title=Suddenly Tomorrow Came... A History of the Johnson Space Center| publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration | year=1993 | authorlink= Henry C. Dethloff | pages=23–24| chapter=Chapter 2: The Commitment to Space| isbn=978-1502753588 | url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/suddenly_tomorrow/suddenly.htm | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Soviet Union launched the first man into space, [[Yuri Gagarin]] in 1961, they chose a term which [[Anglicization|anglicizes]] to "cosmonaut".

===English===
In English-speaking nations, a professional space traveler is called an ''astronaut''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacerace.com/glossary/index.php?term=54|title=TheSpaceRace.com - Glossary of Space Exploration Terminology|publisher=|access-date=December 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105031754/http://www.thespacerace.com/glossary/index.php?term=54#|archive-date=January 5, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from the Greek words ''ástron'' (ἄστρον), meaning "star", and ''nautes'' (ναύτης), meaning "sailor". The first known use of the term "astronaut" in the modern sense was by [[Neil R. Jones]] in his 1930 short story "The Death's Head Meteor". The word itself had been known earlier; for example, in [[Percy Greg]]'s 1880 book ''Across the Zodiac'', "astronaut" referred to a spacecraft. In ''Les Navigateurs de l'Infini'' (1925) by [[J.-H. Rosny aîné]], the word ''astronautique'' (astronautic) was used. The word may have been inspired by "aeronaut", an older term for an air traveler first applied in 1784 to [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]ists. An early use of "astronaut" in a non-fiction publication is [[Eric Frank Russell]]'s poem "The Astronaut", appearing in the November 1934 ''Bulletin of the [[British Interplanetary Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, John L.: ''Into Your Tent'', Plantech (2010): page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known formal use of the term [[astronautics]] in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual [[International Astronautical Congress]] in 1950, and the subsequent founding of the [[International Astronautical Federation]] the following year.&lt;ref name="IAFpage"&gt;{{cite web|title=IAF History |publisher=[[International Astronautical Federation]] |author=IAF |date=August 16, 2010 |url=http://www.iafastro.org/index.html?title=History |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719102624/https://www.iafastro.org/index.html?title=History |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NASA]] applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard NASA spacecraft bound for Earth orbit or beyond. NASA also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its [[NASA Astronaut Corps|Astronaut Corps]].&lt;ref name="biopage"&gt;{{cite web | last = Dismukes |first = Kim – NASA Biography Page Curator | title = Astronaut Biographies | publisher = [[Johnson Space Center]], NASA |date = December 15, 2005|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/| accessdate = March 6, 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307132816/http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/| archivedate= March 7, 2007 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Space Agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its [[European Astronaut Corps|Astronaut Corps]].&lt;ref name="ESApage"&gt;{{cite web | title = The European Astronaut Corps | publisher = [[ESA]] |author=ESA |date = April 10, 2008|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA75G0VMOC_astronauts_0.html| accessdate = December 28, 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220054618/http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESA75G0VMOC_astronauts_0.html| archivedate= December 20, 2008 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By convention, an astronaut employed by the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (or its [[Soviet space program|Soviet]] predecessor) is called a ''cosmonaut'' in English texts.&lt;ref name="biopage"/&gt; The word is an anglicisation of the Russian word ''kosmonavt'' ({{lang-ru|космонавт}}, {{IPA-ru|kəsmɐˈnaft}}), one who works in space outside the Earth's atmosphere, a space traveler,&lt;ref name = "space traveller"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Kotlyakov| first1 = Vladimir| last2 = Komarova| first2 = Anna| title = Elsevier's Dictionary of Geography: in English, Russian, French, Spanish and German|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6DhWw_cYLicC| year = 2006| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-08-048878-3 | page = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; which derives from the Greek words ''kosmos'' (κόσμος), meaning "universe", and ''nautes'' (ναύτης), meaning "sailor". Other countries of the former [[Eastern Bloc]] use variations of the Russian word ''kosmonavt'', such as the [[Poland|Polish]] ''kosmonauta''.

Coinage of the term ''kosmonavt'' has been credited to Soviet aeronautics pioneer [[Mikhail Tikhonravov]] (1900–1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brzezinski |first=Matthew |authorlink=Matthew Brzezinski |year=2007 |title=Red Moon Rising: Sputnik and the Hidden Rivalries That Ignited the Space Age |url= |location=New York |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co. |page=108 |isbn=978-0-8050-8147-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gruntman |first=Mike |authorlink= |year=2004 |title=Blazing the Trail: The Early History of Spacecraft and Rocketry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2XY9KXxF8OEC&amp;pg=PA326 |location=Reston, VA |publisher=[[AIAA]] |page=326 |isbn=9781563477058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first cosmonaut was [[Soviet Air Force]] pilot [[Yuri Gagarin]], also the first person in space. [[Valentina Tereshkova]], a Russian factory worker, was the first woman in space, as well as the first civilian among the Soviet cosmonaut or NASA astronaut corps to make a spaceflight. On March 14, 1995, [[Norman Thagard]] became the first American to ride to space on board a Russian launch vehicle, and thus became the first "American cosmonaut".

===Other terms===
With the rise of [[space tourism]], [[NASA]] and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] agreed to use the term "[[spaceflight participant]]" to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies.

While no nation other than the Russian Federation (and previously the former Soviet Union), the United States, and China have launched a manned spacecraft, several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries. Inspired partly by these missions, other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional English usage. For example, the term ''spationaut'' (French spelling: ''spationaute'') is sometimes used to describe French space travelers, from the [[Latin]] word ''spatium'' for "space", the [[Malay language|Malay]] term ''angkasawan'' was used to describe participants in the [[Angkasawan program]], and the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] hope to launch a [[ISRO Orbital Vehicle|spacecraft]] in 2022 that would carry ''[[Indian human spaceflight programme#Terminology|vyomanauts]]'', coined from the [[Sanskrit]] word for space. In [[Finland]], the NASA astronaut [[Timothy Kopra]], a [[Finnish Americans|Finnish American]], has sometimes been referred to as ''sisunautti'', from the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] word ''[[sisu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = "Sisunautti" haaveilee uudesta Suomen-matkasta | publisher = [[MTV3]] |author=MTV Uutiset |date = November 1, 2009|url = https://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/ulkomaat/artikkeli/sisunautti-haaveilee-uudesta-suomen-matkasta/2174370#gs.XWGxvao| accessdate = April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first human in space was Soviet [[Yuri Gagarin]], who was launched on April 12, 1961, aboard [[Vostok 1]] and orbited around the Earth for 108 minutes. The first woman in space was Soviet [[Valentina Tereshkova]], who launched on June 16, 1963, aboard [[Vostok 6]] and orbited Earth for almost three days.

[[Alan Shepard]] became the first American and second person in space on May 5, 1961, on a 15-minute sub-orbital flight. The first American to orbit the Earth was [[John Glenn]], aboard [[Friendship 7]] on February 20, 1962. The first American woman in space was [[Sally Ride]], during [[Space Shuttle Challenger]]'s mission [[STS-7]], on June 18, 1983.&lt;ref name="ride1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/ride-sk.html|title=Sally K.

Cosmonaut [[Alexei Leonov]] was the first person to conduct an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), (commonly called a "spacewalk"), on March 18, 1965, on the Soviet Union's Voskhod 2 mission.  This was followed two and a half months later by astronaut [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] who made the first American EVA on NASA's Gemini 4 mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/k-4/features/F_Going_Out.html|title=Educator Features: Going Out for a Walk|work=NASA|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first manned mission to orbit the Moon, ''[[Apollo 8]]'', included American [[William Anders]] who was born in Hong Kong, making him the first Asian-born astronaut in 1968.

The Soviet Union, through its [[Intercosmos]] program, allowed people from other "[[socialism|socialist]]" (i.e. [[Warsaw Pact]] and other Soviet-allied) countries to fly on its missions, with the notable exception of [[France]] participating in [[Soyuz TM-7]]. An example is [[Czechoslovak]] [[Vladimír Remek]], the first cosmonaut from a country other than the [[Soviet space program|Soviet Union]] or the [[NASA|United States]], who flew to space in 1978 on a [[Soyuz-U]] rocket.&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/remek.htm|title=Vladimir Remek Czech Pilot Cosmonaut|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|year=2007|author=Encyclopedia Astronautica| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013100622/http://astronautix.com/astros/remek.htm| archivedate= October 13, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duration and distance milestones===
438 days is the longest time spent in space, by Russian [[Valeri Polyakov]].&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;
As of 2006, the most spaceflights by an individual astronaut is seven, a record held by both [[Jerry L. Ross]] and [[Franklin Chang-Diaz]]. The farthest distance from Earth an astronaut has traveled was {{convert|401056|km|0|abbr=on}}, when [[Jim Lovell]], [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] went around the Moon during the [[Apollo 13]] emergency.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

===Civilian and non-government milestones===
The first civilian in space was [[Valentina Tereshkova]]&lt;ref name="Valentina Vladimirovna TERESHKOVA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adm.yar.ru/english/section.aspx?section_id=74 |title=Valentina Vladimirovna TERESHKOVA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423074712/http://www.adm.yar.ru/english/section.aspx?section_id=74 |archivedate=April 23, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; aboard [[Vostok 6]] (she also became the first woman in space on that mission).
Tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the USSR's Air Force, which did not accept female pilots at that time. A month later, [[Joseph Albert Walker]] became the first American civilian in space when his [[X-15 Flight 90]] crossed the {{convert|100|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}} line, qualifying him by the international definition of spaceflight.&lt;ref name="Civilians in Space"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/archives/2006-08/000736.html|title=Civilians in Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Space.com Joseph A Walker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/adastra/adastra_joewalker_061127.html|title=Space.com Joseph A Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walker had joined the US Army Air Force but was not a member during his flight. 
The first people in space who had never been a member of any country's armed forces were both [[Konstantin Feoktistov]] and [[Boris Yegorov]] aboard [[Voskhod 1]].

Selection was initially limited to military pilots.&lt;ref name="training"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/astronauts/training.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970215192726/http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/astronauts/training.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 15, 1997 |title=Selection and Training of Astronauts |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=NASA |year=1995 |author=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nolen"&gt;{{cite book| last = Nolen| first = Stephanie| title = Promised The Moon: The Untold Story of the First Women in the Space Race| year = 2002| publisher = Penguin Canada| location = Toronto| isbn = 0-14-301347-5| page = 235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest astronauts for both America and the USSR tended to be [[fighter aircraft|jet fighter]] pilots, and were often test pilots.

Once selected, NASA astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas, including training for [[extravehicular activity]] in a facility such as NASA's [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="training"/&gt; Astronauts-in-training (astronaut candidates) may also experience short periods of [[weightlessness]] ([[Micro-g environment|microgravity]]) in an aircraft called the "[[Vomit Comet]]," the nickname given to a pair of modified [[KC-135]]s (retired in 2000 and 2004, respectively, and replaced in 2005 with a [[McDonnell Douglas C-9|C-9]]) which perform [[Parabola|parabolic]] flights.&lt;ref name="comet"/&gt; Astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high-performance jet aircraft. This is mostly done in [[T-38 Talon|T-38 jet aircraft]] out of [[Ellington Field]], due to its proximity to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]].  Ellington Field is also where the [[Shuttle Training Aircraft]] is maintained and developed, although most flights of the aircraft are conducted from [[Edwards Air Force Base]].

Astronauts is training must learn how to control and fly the Space Shuttle and, it is vital that they are familiar with the International Space Station so they know what they must do when they get there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/F_Astronauts_in_Training.html|title=NASA - Astronauts in Training|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Denise Miller: MSFC|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last decade, flight surgeons and scientists at NASA have seen a pattern of vision problems in astronauts on long-duration space missions. The syndrome, known as visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP), has been reported in nearly two-thirds of space explorers after long periods spent aboard the International Space Station (ISS).

On November 2, 2017, scientists reported that significant changes in the position and structure of the [[brain]] have been found in astronauts who have taken [[Human spaceflight|trips in space]], based on [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI studies]].

Researchers in 2018 reported, after detecting the presence on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) of five ''[[Enterobacter|Enterobacter bugandensis]]'' bacterial strains, none [[Pathogen|pathogenic]] to humans, that [[microorganism]]s on ISS should be carefully monitored to continue assuring a medically healthy environment for astronauts.&lt;ref name="EA-20181122"&gt;{{cite web |author=BioMed Central |title=ISS microbes should be monitored to avoid threat to astronaut health |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-11/bc-ims112018.php |date=22 November 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=25 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BMC-20181123"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Singh, Nitin K. et al. |title=Multi-drug resistant Enterobacter bugandensis species isolated from the International Space Station and comparative genomic analyses with human pathogenic strains |url=https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-018-1325-2 |date=23 November 2018 |journal=[[BMC Microbiology]] |volume=18 |page=175 |doi=10.1186/s12866-018-1325-2 |accessdate=25 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food and drink==

{{main|Space food}}

An astronaut on the International Space Station requires about 0.83 kilograms (1.83 pounds) weight of food inclusive of food packaging per meal each day. (The packaging for each meal weighs around 0.12 kilograms - 0.27 pounds)  Longer-duration missions require more food.

Shuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appeal to their individual tastes. Five months before flight, menus are selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician. Foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity environment.  Caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy expenditure (BEE) formula.
On Earth, the average American uses about 35 gallons (132 liters) of water every day.  On board the ISS astronauts limit water use to only about three gallons (11 liters) per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Needs: Sustaining Life During Exploration|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/everydaylife/jamestown-needs-fs.html|website=www.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insignia==
In Russia, cosmonauts are awarded [[Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation]] upon completion of their missions, often accompanied with the award of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]].  This follows the practice established in the USSR where cosmonauts were usually awarded the title [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].

At NASA, those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver [[Astronaut Badge#NASA Astronaut Pins|lapel pin]]. Once they have flown in space, they receive a gold pin. U.S. astronauts who also have active-duty military status receive a special qualification badge, known as the [[Astronaut Badge]], after participation on a spaceflight. The [[United States Air Force]] also presents an Astronaut Badge to its pilots who exceed {{convert|50|mi|km}} in altitude.

==Deaths==
{{Main|List of spaceflight-related accidents and incidents#Astronaut fatalities}}

Eighteen astronauts (fourteen men and four women) have lost their lives during four space flights. By nationality, thirteen were American (including one born in India), four were Russian ([[Soviet Union]]), and one was Israeli.

Eleven people (all men) have lost their lives training for spaceflight: eight Americans and three Russians. Six of these were in crashes of training jet aircraft, one drowned during water recovery training, and four were due to fires in pure oxygen environments.

The [[Space Mirror Memorial]], which stands on the grounds of the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] Visitor Complex, commemorates the lives of the men and women who have died during spaceflight and during training in the space programs of the United States. In addition to twenty NASA career astronauts, the memorial includes the names of a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[X-15]] test pilot, a U.S. Air Force officer who died while training for a then-classified military space program, and a civilian [[spaceflight participant]].

'''Brain Electrical Oscillation Signature Profiling''' (BEOSP or '''BEOS''') is a technique by which a suspect's participation in a [[crime]] is detected by eliciting [[electrophysiological]] impulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rissman|first=Jesse|last2=Greely|first2=Henry T.|last3=Wagner|first3=Anthony D.|date=2010-05-25|year=|title=Detecting individual memories through the neural decoding of memory states and past experience|pmc=2906873|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=107|issue=21|pages=9849–9854|doi=10.1073/pnas.1001028107|issn=0027-8424|pmid=20457911|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a non-invasive, scientific technique with a great degree of sensitivity and a [[Neuropsychological|neuro-psychological]] method of interrogation which is sometimes also referred to as ‘[[brain fingerprinting]]’.

== History ==
The methodology was developed by Champadi Raman Mukundan (C. R. Mukundan), a [[Neuroscientist]], former Professor &amp; Head of [[Clinical psychology|Clinical Psychology]] at the [[National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences]] ([[Bangalore, India]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/48486571/Rose_The_Mind_Transparent_No_Endnote_FINAL_for_publication_in_Body_Society.pdf|title=The Mind Transparent? Reading the human brain.|last=|first=|date=|website=King's College London|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he worked as a Research Consultant to TIFAC-DFS Project on ‘Normative Data for Brain Electrical Activation Profiling’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.axxonet.com/pdfs/BEOS_Profile_of_Experiential_Knowledge.pdf|title=Brain Electrical Oscillations Signature Profile Brain Electrical Oscillations Signature Profile of Experiential Knowledge|last=|first=|date=|website=Axxonet - A Research Center recognised by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, India.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works are based on research that was also formerly pursued by other scientists at American universities including J. Peter Rosenfeld, [[Lawrence Farwell]] &amp; Emanuel Donchin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/world/asia/15iht-15brainscan.16148673.html|title=India's use of brain scans in courts dismays critics|last=Giridharadas|first=Anand|date=2008-09-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-12|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==
The human brain receives millions of arrays of signals in different modalities, all through the waking periods. These signals are classified and stored in terms of their relationship perceived as function of experience and available knowledge base of an individual, as well as new relationship produced through sequential processing. The process of encoding is primarily when the individual is directly participating in an activity or experiencing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cubist.cs.washington.edu/Security/2008/11/19/security-review-brain-electrical-oscillation-signature-profiling-in-criminal-trials/|title=UW Computer Security Research and Course Blog » Security Review: Brain Electrical Oscillation Signature Profiling in Criminal Trials|website=cubist.cs.washington.edu|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered secondary, when the information is obtained from a secondary source viz. books, conversations, [[hearsay]] etc. in which there is no primary experiential component and the brain deals mainly with conceptual aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dfsl.maharashtra.gov.in/1121/Psychology|title=Directorate of Forensic Science Laboratories|last=|first=|date=|website=Government of Maharashtra|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary encoding is deep seated and has specific source memory in terms of time and space of occurrence of experience, as individual himself/herself has shared or participated in the experience/act/event at certain time in his/her life at a certain place.

It is found that when the brain of an individual is activated by a piece of information of an event in which he/she has taken part, the brain of the individual will respond differently from that of a person who has received the same information from secondary sources (non-experiential).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forensic-centre.com/2013/07/26/brainwave-signature-profiling/|title=Brainwave Signature Profiling|last=Ashcroft|first=Keith|date=2013-07-26|website=Centre for Forensic Neuroscience|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BEOSP is based on this principle, thereby intending to demonstrate that the suspect who have primary encoded information of those who have participated in the suspected events&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/This-brain-test-maps-the-truth/articleshow/3257032.cms|title=This brain test maps the truth - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; will show responses indicating firsthand (personally acquired) knowledge of the event.

== Procedure ==
# Pretest interview with the suspecT IN BEOS

# The suspect is acquainted with BEOSP test procedure
# Informed consent is obtained
Ideally, no questions are to be asked while conducting the test; rather, the subject is simply provided with the probable events/scenarios in the aftermath of which, the results are analyzed to verify if the brain produces any experiential knowledge, which is essentially the recognition of events disclosed. This way, all fundamental rights are protected, as neither there are no questions that are being asked or any answers reciprocated.

== Applications ==
[[University of Pennsylvania]] conducted a research along with the [[Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital]] ([[Boston Massachusetts|Boston, Massachusetts]]), Children's Hospital Boston &amp; the University Hospital of Freiburg, [[Germany]] which determined that [[Gamma oscillations|Gamma Oscillations]] in the brain could help distinguish [[false memories]] from the real ones. Their analysis concluded that in the retrieval of truthful memories, as compared to false, human brain creates an extremely distinct pattern of gamma oscillations, indicating a recognition of context based information associated with a prior experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sederberg|first=Per B.|last2=Schulze-Bonhage|first2=Andreas|last3=Madsen|first3=Joseph R.|last4=Bromfield|first4=Edward B.|last5=Litt|first5=Brian|last6=Brandt|first6=Armin|last7=Kahana|first7=Michael J.|date=2007-11-01|year=|title=Gamma Oscillations Distinguish True From False Memories|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02003.x|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=18|issue=11|pages=927–932|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02003.x|issn=0956-7976|pmc=|pmid=17958703|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Candida hypersensitivity''' is a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] disease promoted by William G. Crook, M.D.&lt;ref name="Crook"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yeast Connection: A Medical Breakthrough|year=1986|first=William G.|last=Crook|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0933478062}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is spuriously claimed that chronic yeast infections are responsible for many common disorders and [[Symptom#Non-specific symptoms|non-specific symptoms]] including [[fatigue]], [[weight gain]], [[constipation]], [[dizziness]], muscle and joint [[pain]], [[asthma]], and others.&lt;ref name="SBM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Candida and Fake Illnesses|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/|website=Science-Based Medicine|date=25 September 2013|access-date=4 July 2018|first=Steven|last=Novella}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida albicans]]'' is a [[fungus]] that colonizes a large majority of the population (meaning it is present in the body but not causing an infection or any problems). Under certain conditions, however, it can cause an [[Candidiasis|infection]]. The most common manifestations are thrush (a superficial ''Candida'' infection in the mouth) and [[vaginitis]], also commonly referred to as a yeast infection. ''Candida'' can also cause serious [[systemic infection]], but this is almost always restricted to those with [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]], such as patients undergoing [[chemotherapy]] or with advanced [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name="SBM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Candida and Fake Illnesses|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/|website=Science-Based Medicine|date=25 September 2013|access-date=4 July 2018|first=Steven|last=Novella}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
After reading publications by C. Orian Truss, M.D.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Truss|first=CO|title=The Missing Diagnosis|location=Birmingham, AL|publisher=The Missing Diagnosis, Inc.|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Crook proposed the idea that a condition he termed systemic candidiasis, or '''Candida hypersensitivity''', was responsible for a long list of common conditions and [[Symptom#Non-specific symptoms|non-specific symptoms]] including [[fatigue]], [[asthma]], [[psoriasis]], [[sexual dysfunction]], and many others.&lt;ref name="SBM"/&gt; The list of symptoms is similar to that of [[multiple chemical sensitivity]].&lt;ref name="Barrett2005"/&gt; Many patients presenting with symptoms of environmental sensitivity claim to suffer from multiple "fashionable" syndromes.&lt;ref name="Stewart1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=Donna E.|title=The Changing Faces of Somatization|journal=Psychosomatics|volume=31|issue=2|year=1990|pages=153–158|issn=00333182|doi=10.1016/S0033-3182(90)72188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The [[American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology]] strongly criticized the concept of "candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome" and the diagnostic and treatment approaches its proponents use. AAAAI's position statement concludes: (1) the concept of candidiasis hypersensitivity is speculative and unproven; (2) its basic elements would apply to almost all sick patients at some time because its supposed symptoms are essentially universal; (3) overuse of oral antifungal agents could lead to the development of resistant germs that could menace others; (4) adverse effects of oral antifungal agents are rare, but some inevitably will occur; and (5) neither patients nor doctors can determine effectiveness (as opposed to coincidence) without controlled trials. Because allergic symptoms can be influenced by many factors, including emotions, experiments must be designed to separate the effects of the procedure being tested from the effects of other factors.&lt;ref name="Barrett2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndersonChai1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=J|last2=Chai|first2=H|last3=Claman|first3=H|last4=Ellis|first4=E|last5=Fink|first5=J|last6=Kaplan|first6=A|last7=Lieberman|first7=P|last8=Pierson|first8=W|last9=Salvaggio|first9=J|last10=Sheffer|first10=A|title=Candidiasis hypersensitivity syndromeApproved by the executive committee of the American academy of allergy and immunology|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=78|issue=2|year=1986|pages=271–273|issn=00916749|doi=10.1016/S0091-6749(86)80073-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005, scientists were taking note of "a large [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] cult"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odds|first1=FC|title=Candida infections: an overview.|journal=Critical Reviews in Microbiology|date=1987|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–5|pmid=3319417|doi=10.3109/10408418709104444}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had developed around the topic of [[Candidiasis|yeast infections]], with claims that up to one in three people were affected by yeast-related illnesses including Candida hypersensitivity.&lt;ref name="Barrett2005"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Stephen Barrett, M.D.|title=Dubious "Yeast Allergies"|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candida.html|date=October 8, 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513203124/http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candida.html|archivedate=May 13, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legal action==
Some practitioners of alternative medicine have promoted dietary supplements as supposed cures for this non-existent illness, rendering themselves liable to prosecution.&lt;ref name="Barrett2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCAHF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncahf.org/articles/c-d/candida.html |title=Candidiasis Hypersensitivity |accessdate=18 January 2014 |publisher=[[National Council Against Health Fraud]] |author=Jarvis WT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, alternative health vendor [[Nature's Way]] signed a [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] consent agreement not to misrepresent in advertising any self-diagnostic test concerning yeast conditions or to make any unsubstantiated representation concerning any food or supplement's ability to control yeast conditions, with a fine of US$30,000 payable to the [[National Institutes of Health]] for research in genuine candidiasis.&lt;ref name="NCAHF" /&gt;

}}"Denialism is the employment of rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of argument or legitimate debate, when in actuality there is none. These false arguments are used when one has few or no facts to support one's viewpoint against a scientific consensus or against overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

"Climate change skepticism" and "climate change denial" refer to denial, dismissal or unwarranted doubt of the scientific consensus on the rate and extent of global warming, its significance, or its connection to human behavior, in whole or in part.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "'Climate scepticism' and 'climate denial' are readily used concepts, referring to a discourse that has become important in public debate since climate change was first put firmly on the policy agenda in 1988. This discourse challenges the views of mainstream climate scientists and environmental policy advocates, contending that parts, or all, of the scientific treatment and political interpretation of climate change are unreliable."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCSE 2012 why" /&gt; Though there is a distinction between [[skepticism]] which indicates doubting the truth of an assertion and outright [[denial]] of the truth of an assertion, in the public debate phrases such as "climate scepticism" have frequently been used with the same meaning as climate denialism or [[contrarian]]ism.&lt;ref name="Nerlich 2010"&gt;{{harvnb |Nerlich |2010 |pp= 419, 437}}: "Climate scepticism in the sense of climate denialism or contrarianism is not a new phenomenon, but it has recently been very much in the media spotlight. …. Such disagreements are not new but the emails provided climate sceptics, in the sense of deniers or contrarians, with a golden opportunity to mount a sustained effort aimed at demonstrating the legitimacy of their views. This allowed them to question climate science and climate policies based on it and to promote political inaction and inertia. …. footnote 1. I shall use "climate sceptics" here in the sense of "climate deniers", although there are obvious differences between scepticism and denial (see Shermer, 2010; Kemp, et al., 2010). However, "climate sceptic" and "climate scepticism" were commonly used during the "climategate" debate as meaning "climate denier"."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Within the community of scientists and others concerned about anthropogenic climate change, those whom Inhofe calls skeptics are more commonly termed contrarians, naysayers and denialists."&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminology emerged in the 1990s. Even though all scientists adhere to [[scientific skepticism]] as an inherent part of the process, by mid November 1995 the word "skeptic" was being used specifically for the minority who publicised views contrary to the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]]. This small group of scientists presented their views in public statements and the media, rather than to the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1996|pp=9, 11}} "Indeed, the 'skeptic' scientists&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; were perceived to be all the more credible precisely ''because'' their views were contrary to the consensus of peer-reviewed science.&lt;br /&gt;14. All scientists are skeptics because the scientific process demands continuing questioning. In this report, however, the scientists we refer to as 'skeptics' are those who have taken a highly visible public role in criticizing the scientific consensus on ozone depletion and climate change through publications and statements addressed more to the media and the public than to the scientific community."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Gelbspan | 1998 |pp=69–70, 246}} At 16 November 1995 [[United States House Science Subcommittee on Energy]] hearing, [[Pat Michaels]] testified of "a small minority" opposing the IPCC assessment, and said "that the so-called skeptics were right".&lt;/ref&gt; This usage continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Antilla | 2005 | p=footnote 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his December 1995 article ''The Heat is On: The warming of the world's climate sparks a blaze of denial '', [[Ross Gelbspan]] said industry had engaged "a small band of skeptics" to confuse public opinion in a "persistent and well-funded campaign of denial".&lt;ref name="Gelbspan"&gt;{{harvnb|Gelbspan|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1997 book ''The Heat is On'' may have been the first to concentrate specifically on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "The term 'climate scepticism' emerged in around 1995, the year journalist Ross Gelbspan authored perhaps the first book focusing directly on what would retrospectively be understood as climate scepticism."&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Gelbspan discussed a "pervasive denial of global warming" in a "persistent campaign of denial and suppression" involving "undisclosed funding of these 'greenhouse skeptics'&amp;nbsp;" with "the climate skeptics" confusing the public and influencing decision makers.&lt;ref name="Gelbspan 1998"&gt;{{harvnb| Gelbspan | 1998 }} p. 3 "But some individuals do not want the public to know about the immediacy and extent of the climate threat. They have been waging a persistent campaign of denial and suppression that has been lamentably effective."&lt;br /&gt;pp. 33–34 "The campaign to keep the climate change off the public agenda involves more than the undisclosed funding of these 'greenhouse skeptics.' In their efforts to challenge the consensus scientific view….."&lt;br /&gt;p. 35 "If the climate skeptics have succeeded in confusing the general public, their influence on decision makers has been, if anything, even more effective"&lt;br /&gt; p. 173 "pervasive denial of global warming"&lt;/ref&gt;

A November 2006 [[CBC Television]] documentary on the campaign was titled "The Denial Machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CBC News: the fifth estate | 2007}}: "''The Denial Machine'' investigates the roots of the campaign to negate the science and the threat of global warming. It tracks the activities of a group of scientists, some of whom previously consulted for Big Tobacco, and who are now receiving donations from major coal and oil companies. … The documentary shows how fossil fuel corporations have kept the global warming debate alive long after most scientists believed that global warming was real and had potentially catastrophic consequences. … ''The Denial Machine'' also explores how the arguments supported by oil companies were adopted by policy makers in both Canada and the U.S. and helped form government policy."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orlóci Denial Machine"&gt;{{harvnb | Orlóci | 2008 | pp=86, 97}}: "The ideological justification for this came from the sceptics (e.g., Lomborg 2001a,b) and from the industrial 'denial machine'. … CBC Television Fifth Estate, 15 November 2006, The Climate Denial Machine, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 journalist [[Sharon Begley]] reported on the "denial machine",&lt;ref name="Begley machine" /&gt; a phrase subsequently used by academics.&lt;ref name="denial machine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Orlóci Denial Machine" /&gt;

In addition to ''explicit denial'', social groups have shown ''implicit denial'' by accepting the scientific consensus, but failing to come to terms with its implications or take action to reduce the problem.&lt;ref name="NCSE implicit"&gt;{{harvnb|National Center for Science Education|2012}}: "Climate change denial is most conspicuous when it is explicit, as it is in controversies over climate education. The idea of implicit (or "implicatory") denial, however, is increasingly discussed among those who study the controversies over climate change. Implicit denial occurs when people who accept the scientific community's consensus on the answers to the central questions of climate change on the intellectual level fail to come to terms with it or to translate their acceptance into action. Such people are in denial, so to speak, about climate change."&lt;/ref&gt; This was exemplified in [[Kari Norgaard]]'s study of a village in [[Norway]] affected by climate change, where residents diverted their attention to other issues.&lt;ref name="Norgaard 2011"&gt;{{cite book|title=Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life|last=Norgaard|first=Kari|publisher=MIT Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-262-01544-8|location=Cambridge, Mass|pages=1–4|authorlink=Kari Norgaard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminology is debated: most of those actively rejecting the scientific consensus use the terms ''skeptic'' and ''climate change skepticism'', and only a few have expressed preference for being described as deniers,&lt;ref name="NCSE 2012 why"&gt;{{harvnb|National Center for Science Education|2012}}: "There is debate…about how to refer to the positions that reject, and to the people who doubt or deny, the scientific community's consensus on…climate change. Many such people prefer to call themselves skeptics and describe their position as climate change skepticism. Their opponents, however, often prefer to call such people climate change deniers and to describe their position as climate change denial… "Denial" is the term preferred even by many deniers."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington p2"&gt;{{harvnb|Washington|2013|p=2}}: "Many climate change deniers call themselves climate 'skeptics'…However, refusing to accept the overwhelming 'preponderance of evidence' is not skepticism, it is ''denial'' and should be called by its true name… The use of the term 'climate skeptic' is a distortion of reality…Skepticism is healthy in both science and society; denial is not."&lt;/ref&gt; but the word "skepticism" is incorrectly used, as [[scientific skepticism]] is an intrinsic part of scientific methodology.&lt;ref name="O'Neill Boykoff 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Michael E. |title=The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines |isbn=978-0-231-52638-8 |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2013 |quote=Skepticism plays an essential role in the progress of science… Yet…in the context of the climate change denial movement… the term ''skeptic'' has often been co-opted to describe those who simply deny, rather than appraise critically.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|2015|p=229}}: "many who deny the consensus on climate change are not really skeptics but rather contrarians who practice "a kind of one-sided skepticism that entails simply rejecting evidence that challenges one's preconceptions" (Mann 2012:26)"&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''contrarian'' is more specific, but used less frequently. In academic literature and journalism, the terms ''climate change denial'' and ''climate change deniers'' have well established usage as descriptive terms without any pejorative intent. Both the [[National Center for Science Education]] and historian [[Spencer R. Weart]] recognise that either option is problematic, but have decided to use "climate change denial" rather than "skepticism".&lt;ref name="NCSEpreference"&gt;{{harvnb|National Center for Science Education|2012}}: "Recognizing that no terminological choice is entirely unproblematic, NCSE — in common with a number of scholarly and journalistic observers of the social controversies surrounding climate change — opts to use the terms "climate changer deniers" and "climate change denial""&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}} [http://www.aip.org/history/climate/public2.htm#N_136a_ footnote 136a]: "I do not mean to use the term "denier" pejoratively—it has been accepted by some of the group as a self-description—but simply to designate those who deny any likelihood of future danger from anthropogenic global warming."&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, an open letter from the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] called on the media to stop using the term "skepticism" when referring to climate change denial.

{{Further|History of climate change science}}
Research on the effect of [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] on the climate began in 1824, when [[Joseph Fourier]] inferred the existence the atmospheric "[[greenhouse effect]]". In 1860, [[John Tyndall]] quantified the effects of greenhouse gases on absorption of infrared radiation. [[Svante Arrhenius]] in 1896 showed that coal burning could cause global warming, and in 1938 [[Guy Stewart Callendar]] found it already happening to some extent.&lt;ref name="conwayoreskes170"&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|Oreskes|2010|p=170}}: "The doubts and confusion of the American people are particularly peculiar when put into historical perspective"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="powell36"&gt;{{harvnb|Powell|2012|pp=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research advanced rapidly after 1940; from 1957, [[Roger Revelle]] alerted the public to risks that fossil fuel burning was "a grandiose scientific experiment" on climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015a}}: "From the late 1940s into the 1960s, many of the papers cited in these essays carried a thought-provoking footnote: "This work was supported by the '[[Office of Naval Research]].'&amp;nbsp;"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] took on research, the 1979 [[Jule Gregory Charney|Charney Report]] concluded that substantial warming was already on the way, and "A wait-and-see policy may mean waiting until it is too late."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015a}}: quote p. viii in the Foreword by Climate Research Board chair [[Verner E.

In 1959 a scientist working for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] suggested in a [[New Scientist]] article, that carbon cycles are too vast to upset Nature's balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/us-firms-knew-about-global-warming-in-1968-what-about-australia-57878|work=The Conversation|year=2016|title=US firms knew about global warming in 1968 – what about Australia?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to increasing public awareness of the greenhouse effect in the 1970s, conservative reaction built up, denying environmental concerns which could lead to government regulation. With the 1981 [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan]], global warming became a political issue, with immediate plans to cut spending on environmental research, particularly climate related, and stop funding for {{co2}} monitoring. Reagan appointed as [[United States Secretary of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] [[James B. Edwards]], who said that there was no real global warming problem. Congressman [[Al Gore]] had studied under Revelle and was aware of the developing science: he joined others in arranging congressional hearings from 1981 onwards, with testimony by scientists including Revelle, [[Stephen Schneider]] and [[Wallace Smith Broecker]]. The hearings gained enough public attention to reduce the cuts in atmospheric research.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015a}}: [https://www.aip.org/history/climate/Govt.htm#S7 Global Warming Becomes a Political Issue (1980–1983)]; "In 1981, Ronald Reagan took the presidency with an administration that openly scorned their concerns. He brought with him a backlash that had been building against the environmental movement. Many conservatives denied nearly every environmental worry, global warming included. They lumped all such concerns together as the rants of business-hating liberals, a Trojan Horse for government regulation." For details, see [https://www.aip.org/history/climate/Kfunds.htm#M_29_ Money for Keeling: Monitoring CO2]&lt;/ref&gt; A polarized party-political debate developed. In 1982 [[Sherwood B. Idso]] published his book ''Carbon Dioxide: Friend or Foe?'' which said increases in {{co2}} would not warm the planet, but would fertilize crops and were "something to be encouraged and not suppressed", while complaining that his theories had been rejected by the "scientific establishment". An [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) report in 1983 said global warming was "not a theoretical problem but a threat whose effects will be felt within a few years", with potentially "catastrophic" consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Discovery of Global Warming|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qX8yCpETS-IC&amp;pg=PA141|publisher = Harvard University Press|date = 30 June 2009|isbn = 978-0-674-04497-5|first = Spencer R.|last = Weart}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reagan administration reacted by calling the report "alarmist", and the dispute got wide news coverage. Public attention turned to other issues, then the 1985 finding of a polar [[Ozone depletion|ozone hole]] brought a swift international response. To the public, [[ozone depletion and climate change|this was related to climate change]] and the possibility of effective action, but news interest faded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: [https://www.aip.org/history/climate/public2.htm#L_0400 Breaking into Politics (1980–1988)], "Sherwood Idso, who published arguments that greenhouse gas emissions would not warm the Earth or bring any other harm to climate. Better still, by fertilizing crops, the increase of CO2 would bring tremendous benefits."&lt;/ref&gt;

Public attention was renewed amidst summer droughts and heat waves when [[James Hansen]] testified to a Congressional hearing on 23 June 1988,&lt;ref name="Hansen testimony"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hansen|first1=James|title=Statement of Dr. James Hansen, director, NASA Goddard Institute for space studies|year=1988|url=http://climatechange.procon.org/sourcefiles/1988_Hansen_Senate_Testimony.pdf|website=Climate Change ProCon.org|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating with high confidence that long term warming was under way with severe warming likely within the next 50 years, and warning of likely storms and floods. There was increasing media attention: the scientific community had reached a broad consensus that the climate was warming, human activity was very likely the primary cause, and there would be significant consequences if the warming trend was not curbed.&lt;ref name="earlyconsensus"&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}} [https://www.aip.org/history/climate/public2.htm#S1988 The Summer of 1988]: "A new breed of interdisciplinary studies was showing that even a few degrees of warming might have harsh consequences, both for fragile natural ecosystems and for certain agricultural systems and other human endeavours …. The timing was right, and the media leaped on the story. Hansen's statements, especially that severe warming was likely within the next 50 years, got on the front pages of newspapers and were featured in television news and radio talk shows…. The story grew as the summer of 1988 wore on. Reporters descended unexpectedly upon an international conference of scientists held in Toronto at the end of June. Their stories prominently reported how the world's leading climate scientists declared that atmospheric changes were already causing harm, and might cause much more; the scientists called for vigorous government action to restrict greenhouse gases."&lt;/ref&gt; These facts encouraged discussion about new laws concerning environmental regulation, which was opposed by the fossil fuel industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "Environmentalist organizations continued… lobbying and advertising efforts to argue for restrictions on emissions. The environmentalists were opposed, and greatly outspent, by industries that produced or relied on fossil fuels. Industry groups not only mounted a sustained and professional public relations effort, but also channeled considerable sums of money to individual scientists and small conservative organizations and publications that denied any need to act against global warming."&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1989 onwards industry funded organisations including the [[Global Climate Coalition]] and the [[George C. Marshall Institute]] sought to spread doubt among the public, in a strategy already developed by the tobacco industry.&lt;ref name="tobacco-approach" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "The technical criticism most widely noted in the press came in several brief "reports"—not scientific papers in the usual sense—published between 1989 and 1992 by the conservative George C. Marshall Institute. The anonymously authored pamphlets … [claimed] that proposed government regulation would be "extraordinarily costly to the U.S. economy," they insisted it would be unwise to act on the basis of the existing global warming theories … In 1989 some of the biggest corporations in the petroleum, automotive, and other industries created a Global Climate Coalition, whose mission was to disparage every call for action against global warming."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tobacco-docs"&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|Oreskes|2010}}: "Millions of pages of documents released during tobacco litigation … show the crucial role that scientists played in sowing doubt about the links between smoking and health risks. These documents … also show that the same strategy was applied not only to global warming, but to a laundry list of environmental and health concerns, including asbestos, secondhand smoke, acid rain, and the ozone hole."&lt;/ref&gt; A small group of scientists opposed to the consensus on global warming became politically involved, and with support from conservative political interests, began publishing in books and the press rather than in scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "Scientists noticed something that the public largely overlooked: the most outspoken scientific critiques of global warming predictions did not appear in the standard peer-reviewed scientific publications. The critiques tended to appear in venues funded by industrial groups, or in conservative media like the Wall Street Journal."&lt;/ref&gt; This small group of scientists included some of the same people that were part of the strategy already tried by the tobacco industry.&lt;ref name="merchants of doubt"/&gt; [[Spencer Weart]] identifies this period as the point where legitimate skepticism about basic aspects of climate science was no longer justified, and those spreading mistrust about these issues became deniers.&lt;ref name="Weart p46"&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2011|p=46}}: "Scientists continually test their beliefs, seeking out all possible contrary arguments and evidence, and finally publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals, where further attempts at refutation are encouraged. But the small group of scientists who opposed the consensus on warming proceeded in the manner of lawyers, considering nothing that would not bolster their case, and publishing mostly in pamphlets, books, and newspapers supported by conservative interests. At some point they were no longer skeptics—people who would try to see every side of a case—but deniers, that is, people whose only interest was in casting doubt upon what other scientists agreed was true."&lt;/ref&gt; As their arguments were increasingly refuted by the scientific community and new data, deniers turned to political arguments, making personal attacks on the reputation of scientists, and promoting ideas of a [[Global warming conspiracy theory|global warming conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2011|pp=47}}: "As the deniers found ever less scientific ground to stand on, they turned to political arguments. Some of these policy arguments were straightforward, raising serious questions about the efficacy and expense of proposed carbon taxes and emission-regulation schemes. But leading deniers also resorted toad hominem tactics… On each side, some people were coming to believe that they faced a dishonest conspiracy, driven by ideological bias and naked self-interest"&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Revolutions of 1989|1989 fall of communism]] and the [[environmental movement]]'s international reach at the [[Earth Summit|1992 Rio Earth Summit]], the attention of [[Conservatism in the United States#Think tanks and foundations|U.S. conservative think tanks]], which had been organised in the 1970s as an intellectual counter-movement to socialism, turned from the "red scare" to the "green scare" which they saw as a threat to their aims of private property, free trade market economies and global capitalism. As a counter-movement, they used [[environmental skepticism]] to promote denial of the reality of problems such as loss of [[biodiversity]] and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|Dunlap|Freeman|2008|pp=349–385}}: "Environmental scepticism encompasses several themes, but denial of the authenticity of environmental problems, particularly problems such as [[biodiversity loss]] or climate change that threaten ecological sustainability, is its defining feature"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, an EPA report linked [[Passive smoking|second-hand smoke]] with lung cancer. The tobacco industry engaged the [[APCO Worldwide]] public relations company, which set out a strategy of [[astroturfing]] campaigns to cast doubt on the science by linking smoking anxieties with other issues, including global warming, in order to turn public opinion against calls for government intervention. The campaign depicted public concerns as "unfounded fears" supposedly based only on "junk science" in contrast to their "sound science", and operated through [[front organization|front groups]], primarily the [[Advancement of Sound Science Center]] (TASSC) and its Junk Science website, run by [[Steven Milloy]]. A tobacco company memo commented "Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy." During the 1990s, the tobacco campaign died away, and TASSC began taking funding from oil companies including Exxon. Its website became central in distributing "almost every kind of climate-change denial that has found its way into the popular press."&lt;ref name="requiem"&gt;{{harv|Hamilton|2011|pp=104–106}}: "the tactics, personnel and organisations mobilised to serve the interests of the tobacco lobby in the 1980s were seamlessly transferred to serve the interests of the fossil-fuel lobby in the 1990s. [[Frederick Seitz]] … the task of the climate sceptics in the think tanks and PR companies hired by fossil fuel companies was to engage in 'consciousness lowering activities', to 'de-problematise' global warming by describing it as a form of politically driven panicmongering." For the tobacco company memo, see {{cite web|url= http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/wjh13f00|title= Original "Doubt is our product…" memo|date= 21 August 1969|publisher= University of California, San Francisco|accessdate= 19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the Marshall Institute began campaigning against increased regulations on environmental issues such as [[acid rain]], [[ozone depletion]], second-hand smoke, and the dangers of [[DDT]].&lt;ref name="marshall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="requiem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="merchants of doubt"&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|Oreskes|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case their argument was that the science was too uncertain to justify any government intervention, a strategy it borrowed from earlier efforts to downplay the health effects of tobacco in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="tobacco-approach" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tobacco-docs" /&gt; This campaign would continue for the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|Oreskes|2010|p=105}}: "As recently as 2007, the George Marshall Institute continued to insist that the damages associated with acid rain were always "largely hypothetical," and that "further scientific investigation revealed that most of them were not in fact occurring." The Institute cited no studies to support this extraordinary claim."&lt;/ref&gt;

These efforts succeeded in influencing public perception of climate science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "Public support for environmental concerns in general seems to have waned after 1988."&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1988 and the 1990s, public discourse shifted from the science and data of climate change to discussion of politics and surrounding controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weart|2015}}: "A study of American media found that in 1987 most items that mentioned the greenhouse effect had been feature stories about the science, whereas in 1988 the majority of the stories addressed the politics of the controversy. It was not that the number of science stories declined, but rather that as media coverage doubled and redoubled, the additional stories moved into social and political areas … Before 1988, the journalists had drawn chiefly on scientists for their information, but afterward they relied chiefly on sources who were identified with political positions or special interest groups."&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign to spread doubt continued into the 1990s, including an advertising campaign funded by [[coal industry]] advocates intended to "reposition global warming as theory rather than fact,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wald|first=Matthew L.|title=Pro-Coal Ad Campaign Disputes Warming Idea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/08/business/pro-coal-ad-campaign-disputes-warming-idea.html|accessdate=1 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Begley|2007}}: "Individual companies and industry associations—representing petroleum, steel, autos and utilities, for instance—formed lobbying groups … [the Information Council on the Environment's] game plan called for enlisting greenhouse doubters to "reposition global warming as theory rather than fact," and to sow doubt about climate research just as cigarette makers had about smoking research … The coal industry's Western Fuels Association paid Michaels to produce a newsletter called World Climate Report, which has regularly trashed mainstream climate science."&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1998 proposal written by the [[American Petroleum Institute]] intending to recruit scientists to convince politicians, the media and the public that climate science was too uncertain to warrant environmental regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cox |first=Robert |year=2009 |title=Environmental Communication and the Public Sphere |publisher=Sage |pages=311–312 |quote=to recruit a cadre of scientists who share the industry's views of climate science and to train them in public relations so they can help convince journalists, politicians and the public that the risk of global warming is too uncertain to justify controls on greenhouse gases}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal included a [[US$]]&amp;nbsp;5,000,000 multi-point strategy to "maximize the impact of scientific views consistent with ours on [[U.S. Congress|Congress]], the media and other key audiences", with a goal of "raising questions about and undercutting the 'prevailing scientific wisdom'".&lt;ref&gt;Cushman, John, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/26/us/industrial-group-plans-to-battle-climate-treaty.html?scp=2&amp;sq=climate%20science%20and%20to%20train%20them%20&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=print "Industrial Group Plans to Battle Climate Treaty"], ''The New York Times'', 25 April 1998.

In 1998, Gelbspan noted that his fellow journalists accepted that global warming was occurring, but said they were in "'stage-two' denial of the climate crisis", unable to accept the feasibility of answers to the problem.{{sfn | Gelbspan | 1998 | pp=3, 35, 46, 197}} A subsequent book by Milburn and Conrad on ''The Politics of Denial'' described "economic and psychological forces" producing denial of the consensus on global warming issues.&lt;ref name="MilburnConrad1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael A.

These efforts by climate change denial groups were recognized as an organized campaign beginning in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "Academics took note of the discourse when they began to analyse media representations of climate change knowledge and its effect on public perceptions and policy-making, but in the 1990s, they did not yet focus on it as a coherent and defined phenomenon. This changed in the 2000s, when McCright and Dunlap played an important role in deepening the concept of climate scepticism."&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologists [[Riley Dunlap]] and [[Aaron McCright]] played a significant role in this shift when they published an article in 2000 exploring the connection between conservative think tanks and climate change denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "McCright and Dunlap played an important role in deepening the concept of climate scepticism. Examining what they termed a 'conservative countermovement' to undermine climate change policy…McCright and Dunlap went beyond the study of media representations of climate change knowledge to give a coherent picture of the movement behind climate scepticism in the US."&lt;/ref&gt; Later work would continue the argument specific groups were marshalling skepticism against climate change - A study in 2008 from the University of Central Florida analyzed the sources of "environmentally skeptical" literature published in the United States.

Since the late 1980s, this well-coordinated, well-funded campaign by contrarian scientists, free-market think tanks and industry has created a paralyzing fog of doubt around climate change. Through advertisements, op-eds, lobbying and media attention, greenhouse doubters (they hate being called deniers) argued first that the world is not warming; measurements indicating otherwise are flawed, they said. Then they claimed that any warming is natural, not caused by human activities. Now they contend that the looming warming will be minuscule and harmless. 'They patterned what they did after the tobacco industry,' says former senator Tim Wirth"&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of these climate sceptics is greater in the US than in any other country. Although the peer-reviewed scientific literature agrees with the IPCC, within the media—wherefrom the majority of adults in the US are informed about science—claims that are dismissive of anthropogenic climate change are prominently featured."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the media, the contrarian movement has also been sustained by the growth of the internet, having gained some of its support from internet bloggers, talk radio hosts and newspaper columnists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|2015|p=243}}: "the community of climate change contrarians also includes a host of amateurs, from talk radio hosts to newspaper columnists to bloggers.

== Denial networks ==
===United States===
{{further|Climate change policy of the United States}}
A poll conducted by the New York Times Magazine in 2006 found that only 56% of Americans believe that average global temperatures have risen even though scientists think that they have. A majority of Americans also believe that scientists are still divided on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;DiMento, J. and Doughman, P. (2017). Climate Change: What it Means for Us, Our Children, and Our Grandchildren. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, pp. 25-29. &lt;/ref&gt;

A study was conducted to determine whether or not conservative [[white Americans]] were more likely to deny climate change.  Researchers from [[Lyman Briggs College]] took samples of conservative white males of different understandings of global warming and categorized them separately.  Categorized into three groups:  conservative white males who claim to understand global warming, conservative white males who claim not to understand global warming, and other individuals.  It was concluded that many of these conservative white males who self-report understanding global warming believe that the mass media has over exaggerated the effects of global warming and climate change and that the effects of it have never happened.  48.4% of conservative white males who report understanding global warming very well in the study said that the effects of global warming will never happen compared to 19% who do not understand it very well and 7.4% of all other adults. Many people appear to be confused by [[climate science]] however, the study showed that the people who self reported understanding global warming were most prone to denying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCright|first=Aaron M.|last2=Dunlap|first2=Riley E.|date=1 October 2011|title=Cool dudes: The denial of climate change among conservative white males in the United States|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937801100104X|journal=Global Environmental Change|volume=21|issue=4|pages=1163–1172|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study by [[Utah State University]] discusses geographic variation on climate change opinions at state and local scales in the United States. It was noted that prior research was found that public climate change policy support and behavior are significantly influenced by public beliefs, attitudes and risk perceptions. In addition, to complement previous stated factors, they're also influenced by knowledge, emotion, ideology, demographics, and personal experience. Where people live can account for some significance, since some people live in weather extreme areas, they could be desensitized to the overall change in climates as well.  Surveys were conducted and showed that 63% of Americans believe that global warming is happening, 47% believe that it is human caused and 42% believe that most scientists think it is happening. In the study, a model was constructed to determine the public opinion of climate change across the nation. Representative telephone based surveys were used to investigate opinions in four states: California, Texas, Ohio and Colorado in addition to the Columbus and San Francisco metropolitan areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howe|first=Peter D.|last2=Mildenberger|first2=Matto|last3=Marlon|first3=Jennifer R.|last4=Leiserowitz|first4=Anthony|date=1 January 2015|title=Geographic variation in opinions on climate change at state and local scales in the USA|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2bz0416w|journal=Nature Climate Change|language=en|volume=5|issue=6|pages=596–603|doi=10.1038/nclimate2583|issn=1758-678X|bibcode=2015NatCC...5..596H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it had been the case as of 2010 that more than two-thirds of television weathercasters had denied that warming was real and largely caused by human activity, as of March 2018 the rate of acceptance among TV forecasters that the climate is changing has increased to ninety-five percent. The number of local television stories about global warming has also increased, by fifteen-fold. [[Climate Central]] has received some of the credit for this because they provide classes for meteorologists and graphics for television stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morrison |first1=David |authorlink1=David Morrison (astrophysicist) |title=Some Good News on Climate: A Big Shift among TV Weathercasters |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |year=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clexit Coalition claims to be: "A new international organisation (which) aims to prevent ratification of the costly and dangerous Paris global warming treaty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clexit.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/clexit.pdf|title=After Brexit, Clexit|date=1 August 2016|website=Clexit|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has members in 26 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clexit.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/clexit-members.pdf|title=Clexit now comprises 190 members from 26 countries|year=2016|website=Clexit|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to The Guardian newspaper: "Clexit leaders are heavily involved in tobacco and fossil fuel-funded organizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/aug/08/rejection-of-experts-spreads-from-brexit-to-climate-change-with-clexit|title=Rejection of experts spreads from Brexit to climate change with 'Clexit' - Dana Nuccitelli|first=Dana|last=Nuccitelli|date=8 August 2016|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments and positions on global warming ==
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Karl 15 Temps before and after corrxnx.png|thumb|320px|Temperature anomalies in an updated NOAA dataset show a continuing upward trend, with no evidence that global warming has recently stopped, as has been alleged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/science/noaa-research-presents-evidence-against-a-global-warming-hiatus.html Global Warming 'Hiatus' Challenged by NOAA Research], ''The New York Times'', 4 June 2015.    Quote:  Russell S. Vose, chief of the climate science division at NOAA's Asheville center, pointed out in an interview that while the corrections do eliminate the recent warming slowdown, the overall effect of the agency's adjustments has long been to raise the reported global temperatures in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by a substantial margin. That makes the temperature increase of the past century appear less severe than it does in the raw data. If you just wanted to release to the American public our uncorrected data set, it would say that the world has warmed up about 2.071 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880," Dr. Vose said. "Our corrected data set says things have warmed up about 1.65 degrees Fahrenheit. Our corrections lower the rate of warming on a global scale."&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

Some climate change denial groups say that because {{CO2}} is only a trace gas in the atmosphere (roughly 400ppm, or 0.04%) it can only have a minor effect on the climate. Scientists have known for over a century that even this small proportion has a significant warming effect, and doubling the proportion leads to a large temperature increase.&lt;ref name="trace"&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 1: Anthropogenic CO2 can't be changing climate, because CO2 is only a trace gas in the atmosphere and the amount produced by humans is dwarfed by the amount from volcanoes and other natural sources. Water vapor is by far the most important greenhouse gas, so changes in CO2 are irrelevant."&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific consensus, as summarized by the IPCC's fourth assessment report, the U.S. Geological Survey, and other reports, is that human activity is the leading cause of climate change. The burning of fossil fuels accounts for around 30 billion tons of {{CO2}} each year, which is 130 times the amount produced by volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: " According to the U.S. Geological Survey, anthropogenic CO2 amounts to about 30 billion tons annually—more than 130 times as much as volcanoes produce."&lt;/ref&gt; Some groups allege that water vapor is a more significant greenhouse gas, and is left out of many climate models.&lt;ref name="trace" /&gt; While water vapor is a [[greenhouse gas]], the very short atmospheric lifetime of water vapor (about 10 days) compared that of {{CO2}} (hundreds of years) means that  {{CO2}} is the primary driver of increasing temperatures; water vapour acts as a feedback, not a forcing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite blog|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/04/water-vapour-feedback-or-forcing/|title=Water vapour: feedback or forcing?|date=6 April 2005|website=RealClimate|first=David|last=Archer|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Water vapor has been incorporated into climate models since their inception in the late 1800s. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "from Arrhenius on, climatologists have incorporated water vapor into their models. In fact, water vapor is why rising CO2 has such a big effect on climate… Nevertheless, within this dynamic, the CO2 remains the main driver… of the greenhouse effect."&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate denial groups may also argue that global warming stopped recently, a [[global warming hiatus]], or that global temperatures are actually decreasing, leading to [[global cooling]]. These arguments are based on short term fluctuations, and ignore the long term pattern of warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 3: Global warming stopped a decade ago; Earth has been cooling since then."&lt;/ref&gt;

These groups often point to natural variability, such as sunspots and cosmic rays, to explain the warming trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 4: The sun or cosmic rays are much more likely to be the real causes of global warming. After all, Mars is warming up, too."&lt;/ref&gt; According to these groups, there is natural variability that will abate over time, and human influences have little to do with it. These factors are already taken into account when developing climate models, and the scientific consensus is that they cannot explain the observed warming trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "But in defiance of the naysayers who want to chalk the recent warming up to natural cycles, there is insufficient evidence that enough extra solar energy is reaching our planet to account for the observed rise in global temperatures."&lt;/ref&gt;

At a May 2018 meeting of the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology]], Alabama's Representative [[Mo Brooks]] claimed that sea level rise is caused not by melting glaciers but rather by coastal erosion and silt that flows from rivers into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waldman|first1=Scott|title=Republican lawmaker: Rocks tumbling into ocean causing sea level rise|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/republican-lawmaker-rocks-tumbling-ocean-causing-sea-level-rise|accessdate=17 May 2018|publisher=Science|date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change denial literature often features the suggestion that we should wait for better technologies before addressing climate change, when they will be more affordable and effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 7: Technological fixes, such as inventing energy sources that don't produce CO2 or geoengineering the climate, would be more affordable, prudent ways to address climate change than reducing our carbon footprint."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conspiracy theories ===
Global warming conspiracy theories have been posited which allege that the scientific consensus is illusory, or that climatologists are acting on their own financial interests by causing undue alarm about a changing climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rennie|2009}}: "Claim 5: Climatologists conspire to hide the truth about global warming by locking away their data. Their so-called "consensus" on global warming is scientifically irrelevant because science isn't settled by popularity.... Claim 6: Climatologists have a vested interest in raising the alarm because it brings them money and prestige."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plot"&gt;{{cite book |title=Climate Change from a Criminological Perspective |last=White |first=Rob |isbn=978-1-4614-3640-9 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgzIl7LvUVIC&amp;pg=PA48 |page=49 |quote=many Americans, including many American politicians and decision-makers, are increasingly viewing climate change as a "left-wing plot"–part of the "one-world socialist agenda" or a "conspiracy to impose world government and a sweeping redistribution of wealth."

In 2012, research by [[Stephan Lewandowsky]] (then of the [[University of Western Australia]]) concluded that belief in other conspiracy theories, such as that the FBI was responsible for the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination#Allegations of conspiracy|assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]], was associated with being more likely to endorse climate change denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lewandowsky | first1 = Stephan | last2 = Oberauer | first2 = Klaus | year = 2013 | title = NASA Faked the Moon Landing—Therefore, (Climate) Science Is a Hoax | journal = [[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]] | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 622–633 | jstor =  | doi = 10.1177/0956797612457686 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = | pmid=23531484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxonomy of climate change denial ===
[[File:5 Characteristics of Science Denial-en.png|thumb|Characteristics of science denial (including climate science denial)]]
In 2004 [[Stefan Rahmstorf]] described how the media give the misleading impression that climate change was still disputed within the scientific community, attributing this impression to PR efforts of climate change skeptics. He identified different positions argued by climate skeptics, which he used as a [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of climate change skepticism:&lt;ref name="Rahmstorf 2004"&gt;Rahmstorf, S., 2004, [http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/Other/rahmstorf_climate_sceptics_2004.pdf The climate sceptics: Weather Catastrophes and Climate Change—Is There Still Hope For Us?] (Munich: PG Verlag) pp 76–83 [note: numbering not shown in original]&lt;/ref&gt; Later the model was also applied on denial.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

{{quotation|
# Trend sceptics/deniers (who deny there is global warming), [and] argue that no significant climate warming is taking place at all, claiming that the warming trend measured by weather stations is an artefact due to urbanisation around those stations ("[[urban heat island]] effect").
# Attribution sceptics/deniers (who accept the global warming trend but see natural causes for this), [and] doubt that human activities are responsible for the observed trends. A few of them even deny that the rise in the atmospheric {{CO2}} content is anthropogenic [while others argue that] additional {{CO2}} does not lead to discernible warming [and] that there must be other—natural—causes for warming.
# Impact sceptics/deniers (who think global warming is harmless or even beneficial). |&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rahmstorf 2004" /&gt; }}
This taxonomy has been used in [[social science]] for analysis of publications, and to categorize climate change skepticism and climate change denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "We focused on the marked differences in what climate sceptics are sceptical about … (1) trend sceptics (who deny the global warming trend), (2) attribution sceptics (who accept the trend, but either question the anthropogenic contribution saying it is overstated, negligent or non-existent compared to other factors like natural variation, or say it is not known with sufficient certainty what the main causes are) and (3) impact sceptics (who accept human causation, but claim impacts may be benign or beneficial, or that the models are not robust enough) and/or question the need for strong regulatory policies or interventions. "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunlap Jacques 2013 p. 702"&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlap|Jacques|2013|p=702}}: "These books reject evidence that global warming is occurring, that human actions are the predominant cause of global warming, and/or that global warming will have negative impacts on human and natural systems. These arguments have been labelled trend, attribution, and impact denial (Rahmstorf, 2004). … We located 108 books espousing one or more of these versions of climate change denial published through 2010"&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, a fourth category called "consensus denial" is added, which describes people who question the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The National Center for Science Education describes climate change denial as disputing differing points in the scientific consensus, a sequential range of arguments from denying the occurrence of climate change, accepting that but denying any significant human contribution, accepting these but denying scientific findings on how this would affect nature and human society, to accepting all these but denying that humans can mitigate or reduce the problems.&lt;ref name="ncse-pillars"&gt;{{harvnb|National Center for Science Education|2010}}: "The first pillar of climate change denial—that climate change is bad science—attacks various aspects of the scientific consensus about climate change … there are climate change deniers:
* who deny that significant climate change is occurring
* who … deny that human activity is significantly responsible
* who … deny the scientific evidence about its significant effects on the world and our society …
* who … deny that humans can take significant actions to reduce or mitigate its impact.
Of these varieties of climate change denial, the most visible are the first and the second."&lt;/ref&gt; [[James L. Powell]] provides a more extended list,&lt;ref name="Powell2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Powell|2012|pp=170–173}}: "Anatomy of Denial—Global warming deniers…. throw up a succession of claims, and fall back from one line of defense to the next as scientists refute each one in turn. Then they start over:&lt;br /&gt;'The earth is not warming.'&lt;br /&gt;'All right, it is warming but the Sun is the cause.'&lt;br /&gt;'Well then, humans are the cause, but it doesn't matter, because it warming will do no harm. More carbon dioxide will actually be beneficial. More crops will grow.'&lt;br /&gt;'Admittedly, global warming could turn out to be harmful, but we can do nothing about it.'&lt;br /&gt;'Sure, we could do something about global warming, but the cost would be too great. We have more pressing problems here and now, like AIDS and poverty.'&lt;br /&gt;'We might be able to afford to do something to address global warming some-day, but we need to wait for sound science, new technologies, and geoengineering.'&lt;br /&gt;'The earth is not warming. Global warming ended in 1998; it was never a crisis.'&lt;/ref&gt; as does climatologist [[Michael E. Mann]] in "six stages of denial", a ladder in which deniers have over time conceded acceptance of points, while retreating to a position which still rejects the mainstream consensus:&lt;ref name="Mann2013p23"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael E. Mann|title=The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HK0CN6FVtfgC&amp;pg=PA23|date=13 August 2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-52638-8|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denialism]] in this context has been defined by [[Chris Hoofnagle|Chris and]] [[Mark Hoofnagle]] as the use of [[rhetorical device]]s "to give the appearance of legitimate debate where there is none, an approach that has the ultimate goal of rejecting a proposition on which a scientific consensus exists." This process characteristically uses one or more of the following tactics:&lt;ref name="Deithelm McKie"&gt;{{harvnb|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;{{cite journal | last=Liu | first=D.

#Allegations that scientific consensus involves conspiring to fake data or suppress the truth: a global warming conspiracy theory.
#Fake experts, or individuals with views at odds with established knowledge, at the same time marginalising or denigrating published topic experts.

In 2015, environmentalist [[Bill McKibben]] accused [[President Obama]] (widely regarded as strongly in favour of action on climate change&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Denial of climate change, AI puts American economy on 'path to ruin,' Obama says |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/13/denial-of-climate-change-ai-puts-american-economy-on-path-to-ruin-obama-says.html |first=Anita |last=Balakrishnan |date=13 Oct 2016 |publisher=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of "Catastrophic Climate-Change Denial", for his approval of oil-drilling permits in offshore Alaska. According to McKibben, the President has also "opened huge swaths of the [[Powder River basin]] to new coal mining." McKibben calls this "climate denial of the status quo sort", where the President denies "the meaning of the science, which is that we must keep carbon in the ground." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/opinion/obamas-catastrophic-climate-change-denial.html "Obama's Catastrophic Climate-Change Denial"] by [[Bill McKibben]], NY Times op-ed, 12 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pseudoscience ==
Various groups, including the National Center for Science Education, have described climate change denial as a form of [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="NCSE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/climate-change-101/ncse-tackles-climate-change-denial |website=[[National Center for Science Education]] |date=13 January 2012 |title=NCSE Tackles Climate Change Denial |accessdate=5 July 2015 |quote=Science education is under attack… by climate change deniers, who ignore a mountain of evidence gathered over the last fifty years that the planet is warming and that humans are largely responsible.

The former has traditionally emphasized the generation of new knowledge as a measure of productivity. That is, the collection of original data, construction of new mathematical techniques, and generation and validation of testable hypotheses have been the hallmarks of the traditional scientific community… On the other hand, the emerging culture profiled in these hearings emphasizes the generation of new perspectives. Productivity is measured on the ability to alter public opinion – through opinion pieces aimed not at their fellow scientists but at policymakers, the media, and the general public – and funding flows accordingly."&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the book ''The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe'' by Michael D. Gordin, David Morrison wrote:

{{quote|In his final chapter, Gordin turns to the new phase of pseudoscience, practiced by a few rogue scientists themselves. Climate change denialism is the prime example, where a handful of scientists, allied with an effective PR machine, are publicly challenging the scientific consensus that global warming is real and is due primarily to human consumption of fossil fuels. Scientists have watched in disbelief that as the evidence for global warming has become ever more solid, the deniers have been increasingly successful in the public and political arena. … Today pseudoscience is still with us, and is as dangerous a challenge to science as it ever was in the past.&lt;ref name="Morrison"&gt;Morrison, David.

== Public opinion ==
{{Main|Public opinion on climate change}}
Public opinion on climate change is significantly impacted by [[media coverage of climate change]], and the effects of climate change denial campaigns. Campaigns to undermine public confidence in climate science have decreased public belief in climate change, which in turn have impacted legislative efforts to curb {{CO2}} emissions.&lt;ref name="disinformation" /&gt;

The popular media in the U.S. gives greater attention to climate change skeptics than the scientific community as a whole, and the level of agreement within the scientific community has not been accurately communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = M.| first2 = J.| title = Balance as bias: global warming and the US prestige press| last1 = Boykoff| journal = Global Environmental Change Part A| volume = 14| issue = 2| pages = 125–136| date = July 2004| doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001| last2 = Boykoff| url = http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/publications/downloads/boykoff04-gec.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151106081048/http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/publications/downloads/boykoff04-gec.pdf| archivedate = 6 November 2015| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antilla|2005}}: "One problematic trend of the US media has been the suggestion that substantive disagreement exists within the international scientific community as to the reality of anthropogenic climate change; however, this concept is false…Although the science of climate change does not appear to be a prime news topic for most of the 255 newspapers included in this study…articles that framed climate change in terms of debate, controversy, or uncertainty were plentiful."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "Media analysis of climate change reporting was always of interest to academics but from the mid-2000s, it became one of the key areas of research interest, highlighting a tendency to give undue weight to voices questioning the science of climate change."&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, news outlets have allowed climate change skeptics to explain the science of climate change instead of experts in climatology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antilla|2005}}: "Not only were there many examples of journalistic balance that led to bias, but some of the news outlets repeatedly used climate sceptics—with known fossil fuel industry ties—as primary definers"&lt;/ref&gt; US and [[UK]] media coverage differ from that presented in other countries, where reporting is more consistent with the scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Media's social construction of environmental issues: focus on global warming – a comparative study |issn=0144-333X |journal=[[International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy]] |volume=23 |issue=10 |last1=Dispensa |first1=Jaclyn Marisa |last2=Brulle |first2=Robert J. |authorlink2=Robert Brulle |doi=10.1108/01443330310790327 |pages=74–105|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "news coverage of scepticism is mostly limited to the USA and the UK…the type of sceptics who question whether global temperatures are warming are almost exclusively found in the US and UK newspapers.

The efforts of [[Al Gore]] and other environmental campaigns have focused on the effects of global warming and have managed to increase awareness and concern, but despite these efforts, the number of Americans believing humans are the cause of global warming was holding steady at 61% in 2007, and those believing the popular media was understating the issue remained about 35%.&lt;ref name="Saad2007HollywoodHeathUpConcern"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/26932/Did-Hollywoods-Glare-Heat-Public-Concern-About-Global-Warming.aspx|title=Did Hollywood's Glare Heat Up Public Concern About Global Warming?|first=Lydia|last=Saad|date=21 March 2007|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent poll from 2015 suggests that while Americans are growing more aware of the dangers and implications of climate change for future generations, the majority are not worried about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Poll: Americans Don't Think Climate Change Will Affect Them Personally|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/04/06/new_climate_change_poll_shows_americans_believe_in_global_warming.html|newspaper = Slate|date = 6 April 2015|access-date = 15 November 2015|issn = 1091-2339|language = en-US|first = Eric|last = Holthaus}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a survey conducted in 2004, it was found that more than 30% of news presented in the previous decade showed equal attention to both human and non human contributions to global warming.&lt;ref&gt; Boykoff, M.T.; Boykoff, J.M.

A study assessed the public perception and actions to climate change, on grounds of belief systems, and identified seven psychological barriers affecting the behavior that otherwise would facilitate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental stewardship. The author found the following barriers: cognition, ideological world views, comparisons to key people, costs and momentum, discredence toward experts and authorities, perceived risks of change, and inadequate behavioral changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The dragons of inaction: psychological barriers that limit climate change mitigation and adaptation|year=2011|author=Gifford R.|journal=Am Psychol|doi=10.1037/a0023566|pmid=21553954|volume=66|issue=4|pages=290–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nationalism ==
It has been suggested that climate change can conflict with a [[nationalism|nationalistic]] view because it is "unsolvable" at the national level and requires collective action between nations or between local communities, and that therefore populist nationalism tends to reject the science of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate denial and the populist right|url=https://www.iied.org/climate-denial-populist-right|website=International Institute for Environment and Development|accessdate=4 March 2017|date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I don't think anybody is really thinking of abolishing that. But in order to confront climate change, we need additional loyalties and commitments to a level beyond the nation.}}

On the other hand, it has been argued that effective climate action is polycentric rather than international, and national interest in multilateral groups can be furthered by overcoming climate change denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Robert J.

== Lobbying{{anchor|Tobacco lobby}} ==
Efforts to lobby against environmental regulation have included campaigns to manufacture doubt about the science behind climate change, and to obscure the scientific consensus and data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|Dunlap|Freeman|2008|p=352}}: "While these CTTs sometimes joined corporate America in directly lobbying against environmental policies, their primary tactic in combating environmentalism has been to challenge the need for protective environmental policy by questioning the seriousness of environmental problems and the validity of environmental science."&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts have undermined public confidence in climate science, and impacted climate change lobbying.&lt;ref name="freeman351"&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|Dunlap|Freeman|2008|p=351}}: "Conservative think tanks…and their backers launched a full-scale counter-movement… We suggest that this counter-movement has been central to the reversal of US support for environmental protection, both domestically and internationally. Its major tactic has been disputing the seriousness of environmental problems and undermining environmental science by promoting what we term 'environmental scepticism.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="disinformation"&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlap|2013}}: "From the outset, there has been an organized "disinformation" campaign… to "manufacture uncertainty" over AGW, especially by attacking climate science and scientists. This appears an effective strategy given that confidence in climate science and trust in climate scientists are key factors influencing the public's views of AGW."&lt;/ref&gt;

The political advocacy organizations [[FreedomWorks]] and [[Americans for Prosperity]], funded by [[Political activities of the Koch brothers|brothers David and Charles Koch]] of [[Koch Industries]], were important in supporting the [[Tea Party movement]] and in encouraging the movement to focus on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dryzek |first1=John S. |authorlink1=John Dryzek |first2=Richard B. |last2=Norgaard |authorlink2=Richard Norgaard |first3=David |last3=Schlosberg |title=The Oxford Handbook of Climate Change and Society |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19-968342-0 |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other conservative organizations such as the [[Heritage Foundation]], Marshall Institute, [[Cato Institute]] and the [[American Enterprise Institute]] were significant participants in these lobbying attempts, seeking to halt or eliminate environmental regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=

This approach to downplay the significance of climate change was copied from [[tobacco lobbyists]]; in the face of scientific evidence linking tobacco to [[lung cancer]], to prevent or delay the introduction of regulation. Lobbyists attempted to [[Discrediting tactic|discredit]] the scientific research by creating doubt and manipulating debate. They worked to discredit the scientists involved, to dispute their findings, and to create and maintain an apparent controversy by promoting claims that contradicted scientific research. ""Doubt is our product," boasted a now infamous 1969 industry memo. Doubt would shield the tobacco industry from litigation and regulation for decades to come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Manjit|first=Kumar|title=Merchants of Doubt, By Naomi Oreskes &amp; Erik M Conway|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/merchants-of-doubt-by-naomi-oreskes-amp-erik-m-conway-2109256.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=17 February 2013|location=London|date=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[George Monbiot]] wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' about similarities between the methods of groups funded by [[Exxon]], and those of the tobacco giant [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]], including direct attacks on [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] science, and attempts to [[Manufactured controversy|create public controversy]] and doubt.&lt;ref name="denial_ind_guardian" /&gt;

Former [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] president [[Frederick Seitz]], who, according to an article by Mark Hertsgaard in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', earned about [[US$]]585,000 in the 1970s and 1980s as a consultant to [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]],&lt;ref name="HertsgaardSlept"&gt;{{cite news | title=While Washington Slept | url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/05/warming200605 | first=Mark | last=Hertsgaard | publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=May 2006 | accessdate=2 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; went on to chair groups such as the [[Science and Environmental Policy Project]] and the George C. Marshall Institute alleged to have made efforts to "downplay" global warming. Seitz stated in the 1980s that "Global warming is far more a matter of politics than of climate." Seitz authored the [[Oregon Petition]], a document published jointly by the Marshall Institute and [[Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine]] in opposition to the [[Kyoto protocol]]. The petition and accompanying "Research Review of Global Warming Evidence" claimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the advance of science and technology, and damage the health and welfare of mankind. There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. … We are living in an increasingly lush environment of plants and animals as a result of the carbon dioxide increase. Our children will enjoy an Earth with far more plant and animal life than that with which we now are blessed. This is a wonderful and unexpected gift from the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="denial_ind_guardian" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

George Monbiot wrote in ''The Guardian'' that this petition, which he criticizes as misleading and tied to industry funding, "has been cited by almost every journalist who claims that climate change is a myth." Efforts by climate change denial groups played a significant role in the eventual rejection of the Kyoto protocol in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Painter|Ashe|2012}}: "The work by McCright and Dunlap has highlighted the effectiveness of organized climate sceptic groups in influencing US policy making in the 1990s and early 2000s, including their central role in the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol by the US Congress"&lt;/ref&gt;

Monbiot has written about another group founded by the tobacco lobby, [[The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition]] (TASSC), that now campaigns against measures to combat global warming. In again trying to [[Astroturfing|manufacture the appearance of a grass-roots movement]] against "unfounded fear" and "over-regulation," Monbiot states that TASSC "has done more damage to the campaign to halt [climate change] than any other body."&lt;ref name="denial_ind_guardian" /&gt;

[[Drexel University]] [[environmental sociology|environmental sociologist]] [[Robert Brulle]] analysed the funding of 91 organizations opposed to restrictions on carbon emissions, which he termed the "climate change counter-movement." Between 2003 and 2013, the [[donor-advised fund]]s [[Donors Trust]] and [[Donors Capital Fund]], combined, were the largest funders, accounting for about one quarter of the total funds, and the [[American Enterprise Institute]] was the largest recipient, 16% of the total funds.

Between 1989 and 2002 the [[Global Climate Coalition]], a group of mainly United States businesses, used aggressive lobbying and public relations tactics to oppose action to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and fight the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

[[Manufactured controversy|Manufactured uncertainty]] over climate change, the fundamental strategy of climate change denial, has been very effective, particularly in the US.

Public concern over global warming and support for climate policy-making in the US is low relative to other nations (see Chapter 10, this volume), contributing to inaction by the US government.&lt;/ref&gt; An Angus Reid poll released in 2010 indicates that global warming skepticism in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom has been rising.&lt;ref name="CorcoranCoolDown"&gt;{{cite news |last=Corcoran |first=Terence |date=6 January 2010 |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/columnists/story.html |title=The cool down in climate polls |website=[[Financial Post]] |quote=Angus Reid surveyed people…before and after [the] [[COP15|Copenhagen [summit]]].

In contrast, majorities in Europe and Japan recognize a broad consensus among climate experts"&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 ''Newsweek'' poll found these numbers were declining, although majorities of Americans still believed that scientists were uncertain about climate change and its causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Begley|2007}}: "A new NEWSWEEK Poll finds that the influence of the denial machine remains strong. Although the figure is less than in earlier polls, 39 percent of those asked say there is "a lot of disagreement among climate scientists" on the basic question of whether the planet is warming; 42 percent say there is a lot of disagreement that human activities are a major cause of global warming. Only 46 percent say the greenhouse effect is being felt today."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rush D. Holt, Jr.|Rush Holt]] wrote a piece for ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', which appeared in ''Newsweek'':

{{quote|… for more than two decades scientists have been issuing warnings that the release of greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}), is probably altering Earth's climate in ways that will be expensive and even deadly. The American public yawned and bought bigger cars. Statements by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], [[American Geophysical Union]], [[American Meteorological Society]], [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], and others underscored the warnings and called for new government policies to deal with climate change. Politicians, presented with noisy statistics, shrugged, said there is too much doubt among scientists, and did nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holt, Rush |title=Trying to Get Us to Change Course" (film review.) |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5835 |pages=198–9 |date=13 July 2007 |doi=10.1126/science.1142810 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/317/5835/198}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Deliberate attempts by the [[Western Fuels Association]] "to confuse the public" have succeeded in their objectives. This has been "exacerbated by media treatment of the climate issue". According to a Pew poll in 2012, 57% of the US public are unaware of, or outright reject, the scientific consensus on climate change.&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cook, John |title=Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature |journal=Environmental Research Letters |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages= 024024|date=15 May 2013 |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024 |display-authors=etal |quote=there is a significant gap between public perception and reality, with 57% of the US public either disagreeing or unaware that scientists overwhelmingly agree that the earth is warming due to human activity (Pew 2012). Contributing to this "consensus gap" are campaigns designed to confuse the public about the level of agreement among climate scientists....The narrative presented by some dissenters is that the scientific consensus is "… on the point of collapse" while "… the number of scientific 'heretics' is growing with each passing year" A systematic, comprehensive review of the literature provides quantitative evidence countering this assertion. The number of papers rejecting AGW is a minuscule proportion of the published research, with the percentage slightly decreasing over time. Among papers expressing a position on AGW, an overwhelming percentage (97.2% based on self-ratings, 97.1% based on abstract ratings) endorses the scientific consensus on AGW.|bibcode = 2013ERL.....8b4024C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations promoting climate change denial have asserted that scientists are increasingly rejecting climate change, but this notion is contradicted by [[Surveys of scientists' views on climate change#John Cook et al., 2013|research showing that 97%]] of published papers endorse the scientific consensus, and that percentage is increasing with time.&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt;

Social psychologist Craig Foster compares climate change denialists to flat-earth believers and the reaction to the latter by the scientific community. Foster states, "the potential and kinetic energy devoted to counter the flat-earth movement is wasteful and misguided... I don't understand why anybody would worry about the flat-earth gnat while facing the climate change mammoth... Climate change denial does not require belief. It only requires neglect."&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Craig|title=Flat-Earth Anxieties Reflect Misplaced Priorities|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|year=2018|volume=42|issue=3|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Aaron McCright argued that [[anti-environmentalism]]—and climate change denial specifically—has expanded to a point in the US where it has now become "a central tenet of the current [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/jan/07/era-of-climate-science-denial-is-not-over-study-finds |title=Era of climate science denial is not over, study finds |author=Graham Redfearn |date=7 January 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, global oil companies have begun to acknowledge the existence of climate change and its risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oil Company Positions on the Reality and Risk of Climate Change|url=http://www.uwosh.edu/es/climate-change/oil-company-positions-on-the-reality-and-risk-of-climate-change|website=Environmental Studies|publisher=University of Oshkosh—Wisconsin|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufactured climate change denial is also influencing how scientific knowledge is communicated to the public.  According to climate scientist [[Michael E. Mann]], "...universities and scientific societies and organizations, publishers, etc.—are too often risk averse when it comes to defending and communicating science that is perceived as threatening by powerful interests..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/an_interview_with_csicon_speaker_michael_mann|title=An Interview with CSICon Speaker Michael Mann |author=Mark Boslough |author-link=Mark Boslough|date=20 October 2017 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11240">'''Codes for electromagnetic scattering by spheres'''  - this article list codes for electromagnetic scattering by a homogeneous sphere, layered sphere, and cluster of spheres. 

==Solution techniques==
Majority of existing codes for calculation of electromagnetic scattering by a single sphere is based on [[Mie theory]] which is an analytical solution of Maxwell's equations in terms of infinite series. Other approximations to scattering by a single sphere include: [[Debye series]], [[ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]] ([[geometrical optics]]), ray tracing including the effects of interference between rays, [[Airy theory]], [[Rayleigh scattering]], diffraction approximation. There are many phenomena related to light scattering by spherical particles such as resonances, surface waves, plasmons, near-field scattering. Even though Mie theory offers convenient and fast way of solving light scattering problem by homogeneous spherical particles, there are other techniques, such as [[discrete dipole approximation]], FDTD, T-matrix, which can also be used for such tasks.

| MiePlot offers the following mathematical models for the scattering of light by a sphere: Mie solutions, Debye series, ray tracing (based on geometrical optics), ray tracing including the effects of interference between rays, Airy theory, Rayleigh scattering, diffraction, surface waves.  In addition to single-wavelength calculations, MiePlot can also perform calculations for a number of wavelengths, thus approximating a continuous spectrum (such as sunlight) to produce simulations of atmospheric optical effects such as rainbows, coronas and glories.

| The Sub-Department of Atmospheric Oceanic and Planetary Physics in the University of Oxford maintains an archive of Mie scattering routines for both single spheres and populations of particles in which sizes follow a [[log-normal]] distribution. Code is also available for calculating the analytical derivatives of Mie scattering (i.e. the derivative of the extinction and scattering coefficients, and the intensity functions with respect to size parameter and complex refractive index). The routines are written in [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]], but a Fortran-based DLM version (which substantially reduces runtime) of the single-sphere code is also available.

In [[physics]], a '''conservation law''' states that a particular measurable property of an isolated [[physical system]] does not change as the system evolves over time. Exact conservation laws include [[conservation of energy]], [[conservation of linear momentum]], [[conservation of angular momentum]], and [[conservation of electric charge]]. There are also many approximate conservation laws, which apply to such quantities as [[conservation of mass|mass]], [[Parity (physics)|parity]], [[lepton number]], [[baryon number]], [[strangeness]], [[hypercharge]], etc.  These quantities are conserved in certain classes of physics processes, but not in all.

A local conservation law is usually expressed mathematically as a [[continuity equation]], a [[partial differential equation]] which gives a relation between the amount of the quantity and the "transport" of that quantity.    It states that the amount of the conserved quantity at a point or within a volume can only change by the amount of the quantity which flows in or out of the volume.

From [[Noether's theorem]], each conservation law is associated with a [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] in the underlying physics.

==Conservation laws as fundamental laws of nature==

Conservation laws are fundamental to our understanding of the physical world, in that they describe which processes can or cannot occur in nature.  For example, the conservation law of energy states that the total quantity of energy in an isolated system does not change, though it may change form.  In general, the total quantity of the property governed by that law remains unchanged during physical processes.  With respect to classical physics, conservation laws include conservation of energy, mass (or matter), linear momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge.  With respect to particle physics, particles cannot be created or destroyed except in pairs, where one is ordinary and the other is an antiparticle.  With respect to symmetries and invariance principles, three special conservation laws have been described, associated with inversion or reversal of space, time, and charge.

Conservation laws are considered to be fundamental laws of nature, with broad application in physics, as well as in other fields such as chemistry, biology, geology, and engineering.

Most conservation laws are exact, or absolute, in the sense that they apply to all possible processes.  Some conservation laws are partial, in that they hold for some processes but not for others.

One particularly important result concerning conservation laws is [[Noether's theorem]], which states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between each one of them and a differentiable [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] of nature.  For example, the conservation of energy follows from the time-invariance of physical systems, and the conservation of angular momentum arises from the fact that physical systems behave the same regardless of how they are oriented in space.

==Approximate laws==

There are also '''approximate''' conservation laws.  These are approximately true in particular situations, such as low speeds, short time scales, or certain interactions.

* [[Conservation of mass|Conservation of rest mass]]
* Conservation of [[baryon number]] (See [[chiral anomaly]] and [[sphaleron]])
* Conservation of [[lepton number]] (In the [[Standard Model]])
* Conservation of [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] (violated by the [[weak interaction]])
* Conservation of [[parity (physics)|parity]]
* Invariance under [[charge conjugation]]
* Invariance under [[T-symmetry|time reversal]]
* [[CP symmetry]], the combination of charge and parity conjugation (equivalent to time reversal if CPT holds)

==Global and local conservation laws==
The total amount of some conserved quantity in the universe could remain unchanged if an equal amount were to appear at one point ''A'' and simultaneously disappear from another separate point ''B''.  For example, an amount of energy could appear on Earth without changing the total amount in the Universe if the same amount of energy were to disappear from a remote region of the Universe.  This weak form of "global" conservation is really not a conservation law because it is not [[Lorentz invariant]], so phenomena like the above do not occur in nature.&lt;ref name="Aitchison"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to [[Special Relativity]], if the appearance of the energy at ''A'' and disappearance of the energy at ''B'' are simultaneous in one [[inertial reference frame]], they will not be simultaneous in other inertial reference frames moving with respect to the first.  In a moving frame one will occur before the other; either the energy at ''A'' will appear ''before'' or ''after'' the energy at ''B'' disappears.  In both cases, during the interval energy will not be conserved.  

A stronger form of conservation law requires that, for the amount of a conserved quantity at a point to change, there must be a flow, or ''flux'' of the quantity into or out of the point.  For example, the amount of [[electric charge]] in a volume is never found to change without an [[electric current]] into or out of the volume that carries the difference in charge.  Since it only involves continuous ''[[principle of locality|local]]'' changes, this stronger type of conservation law is [[Lorentz invariant]]; a quantity conserved in one reference frame is conserved in all moving reference frames.&lt;ref name="Aitchison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;  This is called a ''local conservation'' law.&lt;ref name="Aitchison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;  Local conservation also implies global conservation; that the total amount of the conserved quantity in the Universe remains constant.  All of the conservation laws listed above are local conservation laws. A local conservation law is expressed mathematically by a ''[[continuity equation]]'', which states that the change in the quantity in a volume is equal to the total net  "flux" of the quantity through the surface of the volume.  The following sections discuss continuity equations in general.

==Differential forms==
{{see also|conservation form|continuity equation}}
In continuum mechanics, the most general form of an exact conservation law is given by a [[continuity equation]]. For example, conservation of electric charge ''q'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{j} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ∇⋅ is the [[divergence]] operator, ''ρ'' is the density of ''q'' (amount per unit volume), '''j''' is the flux of ''q'' (amount crossing a unit area in unit time), and ''t'' is time.

If we assume that the motion '''u''' of the charge is a continuous function of position and time, then
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{j} = \rho \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In one space dimension this can be put into the form of a homogeneous first-order [[nonlinear partial differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]]:&lt;ref name="To24"&gt;see Toro, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + A(y) y_x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the dependent variable ''y'' is called the ''density'' of a ''conserved quantity'', and ''A(y)'' is called the ''[[current jacobian]]'', and the [[Notation for differentiation#Partial derivatives|subscript notation for partial derivatives]] has been employed. The more general inhomogeneous case:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + A(y) y_x = s &lt;/math&gt;

is not a conservation equation but the general kind of [[balance equation]] describing a [[dissipative system]]. The dependent variable ''y'' is called a ''nonconserved quantity'', and the inhomogeneous term ''s(y,x,t)'' is the-''[[Divergence|source]]'', or [[dissipation]]. For example, balance equations of this kind are the momentum and energy [[Navier-Stokes equations]], or the [[entropy#Entropy balance equation for open systems|entropy balance]] for a general [[isolated system]].

In the '''one-dimensional space''' a conservation equation is a first-order [[nonlinear partial differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]] that can be put into the ''advection'' form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + a(y) y_x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the dependent variable ''y(x,t)'' is called the density of the ''conserved'' (scalar) quantity (c.q.(d.) = conserved quantity (density)), and ''a(y)'' is called the '''current coefficient''', usually corresponding to the [[partial derivative]] in the conserved quantity of a [[current density]] (c.d.) of the conserved quantity ''j(y)'':&lt;ref name="To24" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a(y) = j_y (y)&lt;/math&gt;

In this case since the [[chain rule]] applies:

:&lt;math&gt; j_x= j_y (y) y_x = a(y) y_x &lt;/math&gt;

the conservation equation can be put into the current density form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + j_x (y)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In a '''space with more than one dimension''' the former definition can be extended to an equation that can be put into the form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + \mathbf a(y) \cdot \nabla y = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''conserved quantity'' is ''y('''r''',t)'', ''&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes the [[scalar product]], ''&amp;nabla;'' is the [[nabla symbol|nabla]] operator, here indicating a [[gradient]], and ''a(y)'' is a vector of current coefficients, analogously corresponding to the [[divergence]] of a vector c.d. associated to the c.q. '''j'''(y):

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + \nabla \cdot \mathbf  j(y) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

This is the case for the [[continuity equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_t + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Here the conserved quantity is the [[mass]], with [[density]] ''&amp;rho;''('''r''',t) and current density  ''&amp;rho;'''''u''', identical to the [[momentum conservation|momentum density]], while '''u'''('''r''',t) is the [[flow velocity]].

In the '''general case''' a conservation equation can be also a system of this kind of equations (a [[vector equation]]) in the form:&lt;ref name="To24" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \mathbf A(\mathbf y) \cdot \nabla \mathbf y = \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''y''' is called the ''conserved'' ('''vector''') quantity, &amp;nabla; y is its [[gradient]], '''0''' is the [[zero vector]], and '''A(y)''' is called the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of the current density. In fact as in the former scalar case, also in the vector case '''A(y)''' usually corresponding to the Jacobian of a [[current density matrix]] '''J(y)''':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf A( \mathbf y) = \mathbf J_{\mathbf y} (\mathbf y)&lt;/math&gt;

and the conservation equation can be put into the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \nabla \cdot \mathbf J (\mathbf y)= \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

For example, this the case for Euler equations (fluid dynamics). In the simple incompressible case they are:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla\cdot \mathbf u=0\\[1.2ex]
{\partial \mathbf u \over\partial t}+ \mathbf u \cdot
\nabla \mathbf u + \nabla s =\mathbf{0},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*'''''u''''' is the [[flow velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], with components in a N-dimensional space ''u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''u&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ... ''u&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'',
*''s'' is the specific [[pressure]] (pressure per unit [[density]]) giving the [[Linear differential equation|source term]],

{{see also|Euler equations (fluid dynamics)}}

It can be shown that the conserved (vector) quantity and the c.d. matrix for these equations are respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}1 \\  \mathbf u \end{pmatrix}; \qquad
{\mathbf J}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf u\\ \mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u + s \mathbf I\end{pmatrix};\qquad
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes the [[outer product]].

==Integral and weak forms==
Conservation equations can be also expressed in integral form: the advantage of the latter is substantially that it requires less smoothness of the solution, which paves the way to [[weak formulation|weak form]], extending the class of admissible solutions to include discontinuous solutions.&lt;ref name="ToroInt"&gt;see Toro, p.62-63&lt;/ref&gt; By integrating in any space-time domain the current density form in 1-D space:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + j_x (y)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and by using [[Green's theorem]], the integral form is:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{- \infty}^\infty y \, dx + \int_0^\infty j (y) \, dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In a similar fashion, for the scalar multidimensional space, the integral form is:

:&lt;math&gt; \oint [y \, d^N r + j (y) \, dt] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the line integration is performed along the boundary of the domain, in an anticlock-wise manner.&lt;ref name="ToroInt" /&gt;

Moreover, by defining a [[test function]] ''&amp;phi;''('''r''',''t'') continuously differentiable both in time and space with compact support, the [[weak formulation|weak form]] can be obtained pivoting on the [[initial condition]]. In 1-D space it is:

: &lt;math&gt; \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi_t y + \phi_x j(y) \,dx \,dt = - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi(x,0) y(x,0) \, dx &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the weak form all the partial derivatives of the density and current density have been passed on to the test function, which with the former hypothesis is sufficiently smooth to admit these derivatives.&lt;ref name="ToroInt" /&gt;

'''[[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|Constructivism]]''' has been considered as a dominant paradigm, or research programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Imre |last=Lakatos |chapter=Falsification and the methodology of scientific research programmes |editor1-first=Imre |editor1-last=Lakatos |editor2-first=Alan |editor2-last=Musgrave |title=Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |volume=4 |series=Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, London, 1965 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vutfm5n6LKYC&amp;pg=PA91 |date=2 September 1970 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-09623-2 |pages=91–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the field of '''[[science education]]'''. The term constructivism is widely used in many fields, and not always with quite the same intention. This entry offers an account of how constructivism is most commonly understood in science education.

==Description==
Science Education is now an established field within Education, and worldwide has its own journals, conferences, university departments and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter J. |last=Fensham |title=The Evolution of Science Education as a Field of Research: Defining an Identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZE9WVALhQTAC |year=2004 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-1468-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a diverse field, a major influence on its development was research considered to be undertaken from a constructivist perspective on learning, and supporting approaches to teaching that themselves became labelled constructivist. Thus, this constructivism was largely of a psychological flavour, often drawing on the work of [[Jean Piaget]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean |last=Piaget |title=The Child's Conception Of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWZIOL0NDLwC |year=2007 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-5951-6 |edition=2nd |origyear=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean |last=Piaget |title=The Principles of Genetic Epistemology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rr-avb4T8ksC |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-16890-8 |origyear=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ausubel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ausubel, D.P. |title=Educational Psychology: A cognitive view |publisher=Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston |location=New York |year=1968 |isbn=978-0030696404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert M. Gagné]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gagné, R.M. |title=The Conditions of Learning |publisher=Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston |year=1970 |isbn=978-0039100698 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jerome Bruner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jerome S. |last=Bruner |title=The Process of Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iaq5R8vPujAC |year=1977 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-71001-6 |edition=2nd |origyear=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; One influential group of science education researchers were also heavily influenced by [[George Kelly (psychologist)]]'s [[Personal Construct Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Kelly |title=A Theory of Personality: The Psychology of Personality Constructs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sp5iH1deNNEC |year=1963 |publisher=W.W. Norton |isbn=978-0-393-00152-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Lev Vygotsky]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. Lev Semenovich |last=Vygotskiĭ |title=Thought and Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bkz7stcdbKgC |year=1986 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-72010-6 |origyear=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. Lev Semenovich |last=Vygotskiĭ |title=Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxjjUefze_oC |year=1978 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-57629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (since being championed in the West by [[Jerome Bruner]]) has also been increasingly influential.

These workers from psychology informed the first generation of science education researchers. Active research groups developed in centres like the [[University of Waikato]] (Aotearoa/New Zealand), [[University of Leeds]] (UK) and [[University of Surrey]] (UK), with a strong interest in students' ideas in science (formed before, or during instruction) as these were recognised as being highly influential on future learning, and so whether canonical scientific would be learnt. This work, sometimes labelled the 'alternative conceptions movement' was motivated by a series of influential publications on children's ideas in science and their implications for learning (and so for how teaching should be planned to take them into account). Whilst a range of influential papers could be cited it has been suggested that a number of seminar contributions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Easley, J. |title=Pupils and paradigms: a review of literature related to concept development in adolescent science students |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=5 |pages=61–84 |year=1978 |doi=10.1080/03057267808559857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Erickson, G. |title=Theories-in-action: some theoretical and empirical issues in the study of students' conceptual frameworks in science |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=37–60 |year=1983 |doi=10.1080/03057268308559904 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilbert, J.K. |author2=Watts, D.M. |title=Concepts, misconceptions and alternative conceptions: changing perspectives in science education |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=61–98 |year=1983 |doi=10.1080/03057268308559905 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilbert, J.K. |author2=Osborne, R.J. |author3=Fensham, P.J. |title=Children's science and its consequences for teaching |journal=Science Education |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=623–633 |year=1982 |doi=10.1002/sce.3730660412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osborne, R.J. |author2=Wittrock, M.C. |title=Learning Science: a generative process |journal=Science Education |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=489–508 |year=1983 |doi=10.1002/sce.3730670406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in effect set out the commitments, or 'hard core' of a constructivist research programme into the learning and teaching of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taber, K.S. |title=Beyond Constructivism: the Progressive Research Programme into Learning Science |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=125–184 |year=2006 |doi=10.1080/03057260608560222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taber09&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith S. |last=Taber |title=Progressing Science Education: Constructing the Scientific Research Programme Into the Contingent Nature of Learning Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96tslSL3UfwC |year=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-2431-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective was also the focus of a number of books aimed at the science education community - researchers and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Driver, R. |title=The Pupil as Scientist? |publisher=Open University Press |location=Milton Keynes |year=1983 |isbn=978-0335101788 |oclc=10585522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Guesne, E. |author3=Tiberghien, A. |title=Children's Ideas in Science |publisher=Open University Press |location=Milton Keynes |year=1985 |isbn=978-0335150403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Paul J. |last1=Black |first2=Arthur M. |last2=Lucas |title=Children's Informal Ideas in Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlxS0fBb5woC |year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-00539-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These papers presented learning as process of personal sense making, and an iterative matter such that what is learnt was channelled by existing knowledge and understanding (whether canonical or alternative), and teaching as needing to take learners' existing ideas into account in teaching. The research programme soon amounted to thousands of studies on aspects of students' (of different ages and educational levels, from different countries) thinking and learning in science topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Duit, R. |title=Bibliography—STCSE (Students' and Teachers' Conceptions and Science Education) |year=2009 |publisher=Kiel:IPN—Leibniz Institute for Science Education |url=http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/aktuell/stcse/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
There have been a wide range of criticisms of constructivist work in science, including strong criticism from philosophical perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matthews, M.R. |title=Discontent With Constructivism |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=24 |pages=165–172 |year=1994 |doi=10.1080/03057269408560045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scerri, E.R. |title=Philosophical confusion in chemical education research |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=468–474 |year=2003 |doi=10.1021/ed080p468 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticisms have done little to stem the influence of the perspective, perhaps because they tend not to refer to the core tenets of constructivism as an approach based on learning theory and research from cognitive science.&lt;ref name=Taber09/&gt;

==Alternative conceptions and conceptual frameworks in science education==
Learners' ideas in science have been variously labelled as [https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Alternative%20conception.html alternative conceptions], alternative conceptual frameworks, preconceptions, [[scientific misconceptions]], naive theories etc. Although some scholars have attempted to distinguish between these terms, there is no consensual usage and often these terms are in effect synonymous.&lt;ref name=Taber09/&gt; It has been found that some alternative conceptions are very common, although others appear quite idiosyncratic. Some seem to be readily overcome in teaching, but others have proved to be tenacious and to offer a challenge to effective instruction. Sometimes it is considered important to distinguish fully developed conceptions (i.e., explicit ways of understanding aspects of the natural work that are readily verbalised) from more 'primitive' features of cognition acting at a tacit level, such as the so-called phenomenology primitives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=diSessa, A.A. |title=Towards an epistemology of physics |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=10 |issue=2–3 |pages=105–225 |year=1993 |doi=10.1080/07370008.1985.9649008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'knowledge-in-pieces' perspective suggests the latter act as resources for new learning which have potential to support the development of either alternative or canonical knowledge according to how teachers proceed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith, J.P. |author2=diSessa, A.A. |author3=Roschelle, J. |title=Misconceptions reconceived: a constructivist analysis of knowledge in transition |journal=The Journal of the Learning Sciences |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=115–163 |year=1993 |doi=10.1207/s15327809jls0302_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas alternative conceptions (or misconceptions) tend to be seen as learning impediments to be overcome. What research has shown is the prevalence among learners at all levels of alternative ways to thinking about just about all [https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Science%20Topics.html science topics], and a key feature of guidance to teachers is to elicit students' ideas as part of the teaching process. The success of constructivism is that this is now largely taken-for-granted in science teaching and has become part of standard teaching guidance in many contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Key Stage 3 National Strategy. (2002). Framework for teaching science: years 7, 8 and 9. London: Department for Education and Skills.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously there was a strong focus on the abstract nature of concepts to be learnt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shayer, M. |author2=Adey, P. |title=Towards a Science of Science Teaching: Cognitive development and curriculum demand |publisher=Heinemann Educational Books |location=Oxford |year=1981 |isbn=978-0435578251 |oclc=7759952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but little awareness that often the teacher was not seeking to replace ignorance with knowledge, but rather to modify and develop learners existing thinking which was often at odds with the target knowledge set out in the curriculum.

===Constructivist science teaching===
Constructivism is seen as an educational theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Taber, K.S. |chapter=Constructivism as educational theory: Contingency in learning, and optimally guided instruction |chapterurl=https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Constructivism.html |editor=J. Hassaskhah |title=Educational Theory |publisher=Nova |year=2011 |isbn=9781613245804 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and a key perspective to inform pedagogy. There are many books informing teachers and others about constructivist research findings and ideas, and giving guidance on how to teach science form a constructivist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Peter J. |last1=Fensham |first2=Richard T. |last2=White |first3= |title=The Content of Science: A Constructivist Approach to Its Teaching and Learning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cg6dlitxLm0C |year=1994 |publisher=Falmer Press |isbn=978-0-7507-0221-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Joel J. |editor1-last=Mintzes |editor2-first=James H. |editor2-last=Wandersee |editor3-first=Joseph D. |editor3-last=Novak |title=Teaching Science for Understanding: A Human Constructivist View |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zXcrHWhnDwC |year=2005 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-087924-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth G. |last=Tobin |title=The Practice of Constructivism in Science Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47LuS0m9heEC |date=12 November 2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-48974-7 |origyear=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=K.S. |last=Taber |title=Chemical Misconceptions: Prevention, Diagnosis, and Cure : Classroom Resources |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_P0V8vIBhUC |year=2002 |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |isbn=978-0-85404-381-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an increasing awareness of the need for quality research management (information) systems:

*for researchers: easy access to relevant information and associated software, processor power, storage systems and - where necessary - detectors to collect more data to overcome incomplete or inconsistent information
*for research managers and administrators: easy measurement and analysis of research activity and easy access to comparative information
*for research councils: optimisation of the funding process
*for entrepreneurs and technology transfer organizations: easy retrieval of novel ideas and technology in a knowledge-assisted environment and easy identification of competitors and previously done similar research
*for the media and public: easy access to information, software and computer power to allow easily  assimilated presentation of research results in appropriate contexts.

A standard for current research information system is the [[CERIF]] (Common European Research Information Format) standard, proposed by the EU and developed and maintained by [[euroCRIS]].&lt;ref name=joint /&gt;&lt;ref name="ORCID"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orcid.org/blog/2014/12/11/fuelling-your-cris-orcid-ids-tool-research-intelligence|title=Fuelling your CRIS - ORCID iDs as a tool for research intelligence |publisher=[[ORCID]]|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9606">'''Daffy's Elixir''' (also sometimes known as '''Daffey's Elixir''' or '''Daffye's Elixir''') is a name that has been used by several [[patent medicines]] over the years. It was originally designed for diseases of the stomach, but was later marketed as a universal cure. It remained a popular remedy in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and later the [[United States of America]] throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

[[Image:Three early medicine bottles.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Three empty bottle medicine bottles, the centre on embossed with the words 'Dicey and Co. True Daffy's Elixir|An empty bottle of True Daffy's Elixir (centre) Dicey and Co.]]

== Origins ==

Daffy's Elixir was one of the most popular and frequently advertised [[patent medicines]] in Britain during the 18th century. It is reputed to have been invented by clergyman [[Thomas Daffy]] rector of [[Redmile]], [[Leicestershire]], in 1647. He named it '''elixir salutis''' (lit. ''elixir of health'') and promoted as a generic [[cure-all]].

[[Image:Daffy's elixir.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=A recipe for Daffey's Elixir|A home recipe for the True Daffy's Elixir, from William Augustus Henderson ''Modern domestic cookery and useful receipt book'', New York, 1829.]]

== Ingredients ==

An early recipe for "True Daffy" from 1700 lists the following ingredients: [[aniseed]], [[brandy]], [[cochineal]], [[elecampane]], [[fennel seed]], [[jalap]], [[manna]], [[parsley seed]], [[raisin]], [[rhubarb]], [[saffron]], [[Senna (plant)|senna]] and [[spanish liquorice]]. Chemical analysis has shown this to be a [[laxative]] made mostly from alcohol. Other recipes include [[Guaiacum|Guiuacum]] wood chips, [[caraway]], [[Potassium carbonate|Salt of Tartar]], and [[scammony]].

== Uses ==

According to an early nineteenth century advertisement it was used for the following ailments: The Stone in Babies and Children; [[Convulsion]] [[Seizure|fits]]; [[Tuberculosis|Consumption]] and Bad [[Digestion|Digestives]]; [[Fever|Agues]]; [[Hemorrhoid|Piles]]; Surfeits; Fits of the Mother and [[Vapours (disease)|Vapours]] from the [[Spleen]]; [[Chlorosis (medicine)|Green Sickness]]; Children's Distempers, whether the [[Cestoda|Worms]], [[Rickets]], [[Urolithiasis|Stones]], Convulsions, [[Baby colic|Gripes]], [[Scrofula|King's Evil]], Joint Evil or any other disorder proceeding from [[Flatulence|Wind]] or Crudities; [[Gout]] and [[Rheumatism]]; [[Kidney stone|Stone or Gravel]] in the Kidnies; [[Colic|Cholic and Griping of the Bowels]]; the [[Tuberculosis|Phthisic]] (both as cure and preventative provided always that the patient be moderate in drinking, have a care to prevent taking cold and keep a good diet; [[Edema|Dropsy]] and [[Scurvy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Fleming | first = Lindsay | title = Daffy's Elixir | journal = Notes and Queries  | volume =  | issue =  | pages = 238–9 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = | date = June 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequent use of the medicine to treat Colic, gripes or fret in [[horse]]s was deplored in early [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] manuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = White | first = James |title = Treatise on veterinary medicine | publisher = Longman | year = 1820 | location = London | page = 121 | volume=2 | url = | oclc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent history ==

After Daffy's death in 1680 the recipe was left to his daughter Catherine, and his kinsmen Anthony and Daniel who were [[apothecary|apothecaries]] in [[Nottingham]]. Anthony Daffy moved to London in the 1690s and began to exploit the product issuing pamphlets such as ''Directions for taking elixir salutis or, the famous purging cordial, known by the name of Daffy's elixir salutis'' [London], [1690?]. His widow Elleanor Daffy continued from about 1693 and (their daughter?) Katharine from about 1707. During the early 18th century the product was advertised widely in the emerging national and local [[newspaper]]s. The success attracted several counterfeit copies, using inferior alcohol rather than brandy.

The medicine was later produced by William and Cluer Dicey &amp; Co. of Bow Church yard c.1775 who claimed the sole rights of manufacture of the True Daffy's Elixir, although the recipe was not subject to any patent. Proprietorship was also then claimed by Peter Swinton of Salisbury Court and his son Anthony Daffy Swinton who may have been descended from the inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, (1953), p.238.&lt;/ref&gt; Dicey and Co. and their successors marketed it in the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Coxe | first = John Redman | title = The American dispensatory | publisher = Carey and Lea | year = 1831 | location = Philadelphia  | page = 780  | url =  | doi =  | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It then passed to Dicey and Sutton, and later to Messrs W. Sutton &amp; Co. of [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] [[Middlesex]] who continuing to market it throughout the nineteenth century. The use of Daffy's elixir is referred to in [[Anthony Trollope]]'s novel [[Barchester Towers]], 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Trollope | first = Anthony | title = Barchester Towers | publisher = Folio Society | year = 1977 | location = London | page = 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daffy's elixir is also mentioned on several occasions in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel [[Mason &amp; Dixon]], particularly by [[Jeremiah Dixon]], who attempts to procure large quantities before beginning his surveying trip with [[Charles Mason]].  Dixon is warned by [[Benjamin Franklin]], however, that imported Daffy's Elixir is extremely expensive, and he would be better off ordering a customized version from the [[apothecary]].  During the same visit, Dixon also orders [[laudanum]], a well-known constipating agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Pynchon | first = Thomas | title = Mason &amp; Dixon | publisher = Penguin | year = 1997 | location = New York | page = 267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daffy's elixir is also mentioned in the [[Charles Dickens]] book, [[Oliver Twist]], Ch. II, where it is referred to as Daffy, in the sentence: 'Why, it's what I'm obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put into the blessed infants' Daffy, when they ain't well, Mr. Bumble,(the Parish [[Beadle]])' replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle and glass. 'It's gin. I'll not deceive you, Mr. B. It's gin.'

Daffy’s Elixir is also mentioned in the [[Works of William Makepeace Thackeray]] book, [[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]], Chapter XXXVIII A Family In a Small Way, where it is referenced in the sentence ‘..and there found Mrs. Sedley  in the act of surreptitiously administering Daffy’s Elixir to the infant.’

== Early advertisements ==

''Daffy’s original elixir salutis, vindicated against all counterfeits, &amp;c. or, An advertisement by mee, Anthony Daffy, of London, citizen and student in physick, By way of vindication of my famous and generally approved cordial drink, (called elixir salutis) from the notoriously false suggestions of one Tho. Witherden of Bear-steed in the county of Kent, Gent. (as pretended;) Jane White, Robert Brooke, apothecary, and Edward Willet; all new upstatrt counterfitors of my elixir, and Ape-like imitators of my long since printed Books and Directions, (some of them, nigh verbatim, or word for word) and that to the jeopardy of many good, (but mis-in-formed) Peoples Healths, and Lives too; as also, from the false pretentions of other more sneaking Cub-Quacks, not yet lickt into form, but remaining Moon-blind brats, (still in swadling-clouts) I mean the numerous crew of libellous pamphleteeirs, which are (if possible) more dangerous counterfeiters of my Elixer'' . . . Advertisement by mee, Anthony Daffy  s.n., 1690?].

''Daffy’s original and famous elixir salutis: the choice drink of health: or, health-bringing drink. Being a famous cordial drink, found out by the providence of the Almighty, and (for above twenty years) experienced by himself, and divers persons (whose names are at most of their desires here inserted) a most excellent preservative of man-kind. A secret far beyond any medicament yet known, and is found so agreeable to nature, that it effects all its operations, as nature would have it, and as a virtual expedient proposed by her, for reducing all her extreams unto an equal temper; the same being fitted unto all ages, sexes, complexions, and constitutions, and highly fortifying nature against any noxious humour, invading or offending the noble parts. Never published by any but by Anthony Daffy, student in physick, and since continued by his widow Elleanor Daffy'', London : printed with allowance, for the author, by Tho. Milbourn dwelling in Jewen-Street, 1693.

'''''Does God Play Dice: The New Mathematics of Chaos''''' is a non-fiction book about [[chaos theory]] written by British [[mathematician]] [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]]. The book was initially published by [[Blackwell Publishing]] in 1989.

==Summary==
In this book, Stewart explains [[chaos theory]] to an audience presumably unfamiliar with it. As the book progresses the writing changes from simple explanations of chaos theory to in-depth, rigorous mathematical study. Stewart covers mathematical concepts such as [[differential equations]], [[resonance]], [[nonlinear dynamics]], and [[probability]]. The book is illustrated with diagrams and graphs of mathematical concepts and equations when applicable.

The back of the book, and a summary of its content, reads, "The science of chaos is forcing scientists to rethink Einstein's fundamental assumptions regarding the way the universe behaves. Chaos theory has already shown that simple systems, obeying precise laws, can nevertheless act in a random manner. Perhaps God plays dice within a cosmic game of complete law and order. Does God Play Dice? reveals a strange universe in which nothing may be as it seems. Familiar geometric shapes such as circles and ellipses give way to infinitely complex structures known as fractals, the fluttering of a butterfly's wings can change the weather, and the gravitational attraction of a creature in a distant galaxy can change the fate of the solar system."

The title of the book is a reference to a famous quote by [[Albert Einstein]].

{{Unreferenced|date=August 2008}}

Some [[North America]]n [[university|universities]] are home to [[academic degree|degree]] programs titled '''Ecology and Evolutionary Biology''', offering integrated studies in the [[academic discipline|disciplines]] of [[ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. The wording is intended as representing the alternative approach from the frequently used pairing of '''Cell and Molecular Biology''', while being more inclusive than the terminology of [[Botany]] or [[Zoology]].  Recently, due to advances in the fields of [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]], research and education in ecology and evolutionary biology has integrated many molecular techniques.

A program that focuses on the relationships and interactions that range across levels of biological organization based on a scientific study is Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.  The origins and history of ecosystems, species, genes and genomes, and organisms, and how these have changed over time is all part of the studies of how biodiversity has evolved and how it takes place.  Ecology and Evolutionary biology in North America is based on research impact determined by the top 10% of ecology programs.  The interactive web of organisms and environment are all part of what the field of Ecology explores.  There have been studies in evolution that have worked to prove that "modern organisms have developed from ancestral ones." The reason that evolutionary biology is so interesting to learn about is because of the evolutionary processes that is the reason we have such a diversity of life on Earth.There are many processes that make up evolutionary biology that give great insight to how we came to be, some of which include natural selection, speciation, and common descent.

Several of Evans' central claims were later shown to be mathematically incorrect{{sfn|Trovon De Carvalho|Rodrigues|2001}}{{sfn|Rodrigues|Souza|2005}}{{sfn|Bruhn|2008}}{{sfn|Bruhn|Hehl|Jadczyk|2008}} and, in 2008, the new editor of ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'', [[Nobel laureate]] [[Gerard 't Hooft]], published an editorial note effectively retracting the journal's support for the hypothesis.{{sfn|'t Hooft|2008}}

==Scope==
Earlier versions of the theory were called "[[O(3)]] [[electrodynamics]]". Evans claims that he is able to derive a generally covariant field equation for electromagnetism and gravity, similar to that derived by [[Mendel Sachs]].{{sfn|Evans|2003a}}

Evans argues that Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] does not take into account [[Torsion tensor|torsion]], which is included in the [[Einstein–Cartan theory]].{{sfn|Evans|2004a}}

In 1998 Evans founded the Alpha Institute for Advanced Studies (AIAS) to keep developing his theory. Its website collects papers on the theory and recent developments.&lt;ref name=AIAS/&gt;

The theory has been used to justify the [[motionless electromagnetic generator]], a [[perpetual motion machine]].{{sfn|Anastasovski et al.|2001}} In July 2017, Evans claimed (on his blog): "There is immediate international interest in [papers] UFT382 and UFT383, describing the new energy from spacetime (ES) circuits. There is also great interest in UFT364, the paper that describes the circuit [...] These circuits should be [...] developed into power stations." In November 2017, Evans expanded on this point, as follows (again on his blog): "There is no reasonable doubt that the vacuum (or aether or spacetime) contains a source of inexhaustible, safe and clean energy. This source can be used in patented and replicated circuits such as those of [Evans' self-published papers] UFT311, UFT364, UFT382, and UFT383."

==Reception==
Evans' claims are not accepted by the mainstream physics community. In an editorial note in ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'' the [[Nobel laureate]] [[Gerard 't Hooft]] discussed the "revolutionary paradigm switch in theoretical physics" promised by ECE theory. He concluded that activities in the subject "have remained limited to personal web pages and are absent from the standard electronic archives, while no reference to ECE theory can be spotted in any of the peer reviewed scientific journals".{{sfn|'t Hooft|2008}}

Several of the published contributions in this theory have been shown to be mathematically incorrect.{{sfn|Trovon De Carvalho|Rodrigues|2001}}{{sfn|Rodrigues|Souza|2005}}{{sfn|Bruhn|2008}}{{sfn|Bruhn|Hehl|Jadczyk|2008}} In response to these demonstrations, 't Hooft's editorial note concludes, "Taking into account the findings of Bruhn, Hehl and Obukhhov, the discussion of ECE theory in the journal ''Foundations of Physics'' will be concluded herewith unless very good arguments are presented to resume the matter."{{sfn|'t Hooft|2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4164">The acronyms '''ELSI''' (in the United States) and '''ELSA''' (in Europe) refer to research activities that anticipate and address '''''ethical, legal and social implications''''' (ELSI) or '''''aspects''''' (ELSA) of emerging life sciences, notably [[genomics]] and [[nanotechnology]]. ELSI was conceived in 1988 when [[James Watson]], at the press conference announcing his appointment as director of the [[Human Genome Project]] (HGP), suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly declared that the ethical and social implications of genomics warranted a special effort and should be directly funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook-Deegan, R. 1994/1995. The gene wars: science, politics and the human genome. New York/London: Norton&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spread ==

Various ELSI or ELSA programs have been developed, in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genomecanada.ca/en/ge3ls/&lt;/ref&gt; Europe&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/research/life/elsa/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshizawa G. et al (2014) ELSI practices in genomic research in East Asia: implications for research collaboration and public participation. Genome Medicine 2014, 6:39  doi:10.1186/gm556&lt;/ref&gt; Overview:&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick R and Zwart H (2013) Editorial: From ELSA to responsible research and Promisomics. Life Sciences, Society and Policy 2013, 9:3&lt;/ref&gt;

# U.S.A.: Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) (funding agency: NIH, 1990)
# Canada: Genomics-related Ethical, Environmental, Economic, Legal and Social Aspects (GE3LS) (funding agency: [[Genome Canada]], 2000)
# South-Korea: Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) (funding: Government of South-Korea, 2001)
# United Kingdom: ESRC Genomics Network (EGN), including: Cesagen, Innogen, Egenis, Genomics Forum (funding agency: ESRC 2002)

# Norway: ELSA Program (funding agency: Research Council of Norway, 2002)
# Germany, Austria, Finland: ELSAGEN Transnational Research Programme (funding agencies: GEN-AU, FFG, DFG, Academy of Finland, 2008)

== Features ==

At least four features seem typical for an ELSA approach,&lt;ref&gt;Zwart H., Nelis A. (2009) What is ELSA genomics? Science and Society Series on convergence research. EMBO Reports 10 (6), 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; namely: 
# proximity (closeness to or embedding in large-scale scientific programs); 
# early anticipation (of societal issues and potential controversies); 
# interactivity (encouraging stakeholders and publics to assume an active role in co-designing research agendas); 
# interdisciplinarity (bridging boundaries between research communities such as for instance [[bioethics]] and STS).

== Reception ==

The ELSA approach has been widely endorsed by academics studying the societal impact of science and technology, but also criticized. Michael Yesley, responsible for the US Department of Energy (DOE) part of the ELSI programme, claims that the ELSI Program was in fact a discourse of justification, selecting topics of ethics research that will facilitate rather than challenge the advance of genetic technology.&lt;ref&gt;Yesley M.S. (2005) What’s ELSI got to do with it? Bioethics and the human genome project. New Genetics and Society 27: 1–6, p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ELSA genomics as the handmaiden of genomics research. In Europe, in the context of the [[Horizon 2020]] program, ELSA-style research is now usually framed as [[Responsible Research and Innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;Zwart H., Landeweerd L., Van Rooij A. (2014). Adapt or perish? Assessing the recent shift in the European research funding arena from ‘ELSA’ to ‘RRI’. Life Sciences, Society and Policy. 10:11 (14 May 2014). doi:10.1186/s40504-014-0011-x.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Examples of academic journals open to publishing ELSA research results are ''New Genetics and Society'' (Taylor and Francis) and ''[[Life Sciences, Society and Policy]]'' (SpringerOpen).

The '''Greek cancer cure''' was a putative cancer cure invented and promoted by [[microbiologist]] Hariton-Tzannis Alivizatos (died 1991). It consisted of intravenous injections of a fluid for which Aliviatos would not reveal the formula.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/greek.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical claims and criticism==
In 1983, Dr. Alivizatos announced that he had developed a serum that had a 60 percent success rate in arresting most types of cancer, with the exception of extremely advanced cases.  He claimed that the serum could attack a protein-like substance that surrounds cancer cells and weaken the body's ability to keep the disease from spreading.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/10/us/cancer-victims-seek-cure-on-trips-to-athens.html|title=CANCER VICTIMS SEEK CURE ON TRIPS TO ATHENS|last=Times|first=Robert Lindsey and Special To the New York|date=|work=|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Greek health officials ridiculed Dr. Alivizatos's assertions, while the [[American Cancer Society]] warned his current patients that there was no evidence that the diagnostic procedures and treatment for cancer proposed had resulted in any benefits for the treatment of cancer in human beings.  They concluded that, "there is no evidence that any aspect of the diagnostic test nor the treatment... are effective in the treatment of cancer."  In addition they state "Nor is there any evidence that.. the intravenous injections are safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unproven methods of cancer management: Greek cancer cure|journal=[[CA (journal)|CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians]]|date=1990|volume=40|issue=6|pages=368–371|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.40.6.368/pdf|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Greenwave''' is a mass [[science]] [[experiment]] involving primary schools across [[Ireland]]. It examines and records how spring arrives in [[Ireland]]. This is an educational and science initiative of the [[Irish Government]]’s [[Discover Science &amp; Engineering]] (DSE) awareness programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2008/0202/1201821933083.html Article in The Irish Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish students observe and record when certain plants and animals react to the longer days and warmer temperatures, in order to find out whether the "green wave" of spring moves from south to north across [[Ireland]] or inland from the coast to the centre of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sligoweekender.ie/news/story/?trs=mhgbauauid Article in the Sligo Weekender]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nenaghguardian.ie/news/tipp-schools-take-part-in-experiment-on-spring-season-1288914.html Article in The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forfas.ie/publications/forfas_annrpt06/developing/dis.html Forfás Annual Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking part in Greenwave is a practical way to support the teaching of Social Environmental and Scientific Education (SESE) part of the Irish Primary School Curriculum. The students develop their skills in:
*Observing
*Classifying
*Recognising patterns
*Estimating and measuring
*Recording and communicating

Schools registered in the [[Discover Primary Science]] programme, another initiative of DSE, can also earn credit towards their Award of Science Excellence by taking part in Greenwave.

DSE runs numerous other initiatives, including [[Science Week Ireland]], [[Discover Primary Science]] and [[Science.ie]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8139">'''Holotomography''' (HT) is a laser technique to measure three-dimensional [[refractive index]] (RI) tomogram of a microscopic sample such as biological cells and tissues. Because the RI can serve as an intrinsic imaging contrast for transparent or phase objects, measurements of RI tomograms can provide label-free quantitative imaging of microscopic phase objects. In order to measure 3-D RI tomogram of samples, HT employs the principle of holographic imaging and inverse scattering. Typically, multiple 2D holographic images of a sample are measured at various illumination angles, employing the principle of interferometric imaging. Then, a 3D RI tomogram of the sample is reconstructed from these multiple 2D holographic images by inversely solving light scattering in the sample.

The principle of HT is very similar to X-ray computed tomography (CT) or [[CT scan]]. CT scan measures multiple 2-D X-ray images of a human body at various illumination angles, and a 3-D tomogram (X-ray absorptivity) is then retrieved via the inverse scattering theory. Both the X-ray CT and laser HT shares the same governing equation – [[Helmholtz equation]],  [[Wave equation|the wave equatio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n for a monochromatic wavelength. HT is also known as optical diffraction tomography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauer|first=V|date=2002|title=New approach to optical diffraction tomography yielding a vector equation of diffraction tomography and a novel tomographic microscope|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.0022-2720.2001.00980.x/full|journal=Journal of Microscopy|volume=205|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

[[File:3D RI image of a live cell.gif|thumb|3D RI tomogram of a live cell (macrophage)]]

=== Cell biology ===
HT provides 3D dynamic images of live cells and thin tissues without using exogenous labeling agents such as fluorescence proteins or dyes. HT enables quantitative live cell imaging, and also provides quantitative information such as cell volume, surface area, protein concentration. HT provides following advantages over conventional 3D microscopic techniques.  
# Label-free: Cellular membrane and subcellular organelles can clearly be imaged without using exogenous labeling agents. Thus, there are no issues of phototoxicity, photobleaching, and photodamaging.
# Quantitative imaging capability: HT directly measures cell’s 3D RI maps, which is intrinsic optical properties of materials. Because the measured RI can be translated into the mass density of a cell and using this information, mass of a cell can also be retrieved.
# Precise and fast measurements: HT provides the spatial resolution down to approximately 100&amp;nbsp;nm and the temporal resolution of a few to a hundred frames per second, depending on the numerical apertures of used objective lenses and the speed of an image sensor.
However, 3D RI tomography does not provide molecular specificity. Generally, the measured RI information cannot be directly related to information about molecules or proteins, except for notable cases such as gold nanoparties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last=Kim|first=Doyeon|date=2016|title=Label-free high-resolution 3-D imaging of gold nanoparticles inside live cells using optical diffraction tomography|biorxiv=097113}}&lt;/ref&gt; or lipid droplets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Kyoohyun|date=2016|title=Three-dimensional label-free imaging and quantification of lipid droplets in live hepatocytes|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36815|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that exhibit distinctly high RI values compared to cell cytoplams.

HT provide various quantitative imaging capability, providing morphological, biochemical, and mechanical properties of individuals cells. 3D RI tomography directly provides morphological properties including volume, surface area, and [[sphericity]] (roundness) of a cell. Local RI value can be translated into biochemical information or cytoplasmic protein concentration, because the RI of a solution is linearly proportional to its concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baber|first=R.|date=1952|title=Interference microscopy and mass determination|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v169/n4296/abs/169366b0.html|journal=Nature|volume=169|pages=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, for the case of [[red blood cell]]s, RI value can be converted into hemoglobin concentration. Measurements of dynamic cell membrane fluctuatino, which can also be obtained with a HT instrument, provides information about cellular deformability. Furthermore, these various quantitative parameters can be obtained at the single cell level, allowing correlative analysis between various cellular parameters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15690">'''Hylozoism''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] point of view that [[matter]] is in some sense alive. The concept dates back at least as far as the [[Milesian school]] of [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers. The term was introduced to [[English language|English]] by [[Ralph Cudworth]] in 1678.

==Distinction from similar theories==
Although there is a distinction between possessing a mind ([[panpsychism|hylopsychism]]) and possessing life (hylozoism); in practice this division is difficult to maintain, because the ancient hylozoists not only regarded the spirits of the [[matter|material]] universe and plant world as alive, but also as more or less [[Consciousness|conscious]]. Whereas [[animism]] tends to view life as taking the form of discrete [[soul|spirits]], and panpsychism tends to refer to strictly philosophical views like that of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], hylozoism refers largely to views such as those of the earliest Greek philosophers (6th and 5th centuries BC), who treated the magnet as alive because of its attractive powers ([[Thales]]), or air as divine ([[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]), perhaps because of its apparently spontaneous power of movement, or because of its essentiality for life in animals. Later this primitive hylozoism reappeared in modified forms.  Some scholars {{who|date=June 2015}} have since claimed that the term ''hylozoism'' should properly be used only where body and soul are explicitly distinguished, the distinction then being rejected as invalid.  Nevertheless, hylozoism remains logically distinct both from early forms of animism, which personify nature, and from panpsychism, which attributes some form of consciousness or sensation to all matter.

== Ancient hylozoism ==
Some of the ancient [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers taught a version of hylozoism, as they, however vaguely, conceived the elemental matter as being in some sense animate if not actually conscious and {{not a typo|[[conative]]}} (a directed effort, a striving or tendency; a ''[[wikt:nisus|nisus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=(CD-ROM ver. 3.0) 2nd |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |quote=1. An effort, endeavour, striving. 2. ''transf''. A force, impulse, or tendency simulating human effort; a nisus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thales]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], and [[Heraclitus]] all taught that there is a form of life in all material objects,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnet (classicist)|J.Burnet]], [http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/burnet/egp.htm?chapter=introduction#8 ''Early Greek Philosophy'', Introduction, VIII, note 29]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed that a ''[[Anima mundi|world soul]]'' was the vital force of the universe. Note that these philosophies did not necessarily hold that material objects had ''separate life'' or ''identity'', only that they had life, either as part of an overriding entity or as living but insensible entities.

== In Renaissance and early Modernity ==
In the [[Renaissance]], [[Bernardino Telesio]], [[Paracelsus]], [[Cardanus]],  and [[Giordano Bruno]] revived the doctrine of hylozoism.  The latter, for example, held a form of [[Christian]] [[pantheism]], wherein [[God]] is the source, cause, medium, and end of all things, and therefore all things are participatory in the ongoing Godhead.  Bruno's ideas were so radical that he was entirely rejected by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as well as excommunicated from a few Protestant groups, and he was eventually burned at the stake for various heresies. Telesio, on the other hand, began from an [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] basis and, through radical [[empiricism]], came to believe that a living force was what informed all matter.  Instead of the intellectual universals of Aristotle, he believed that life generated form.

In [[England]], some of the [[Cambridge Platonists]] approached hylozoism as well. Both [[Henry More]] and [[Ralph Cudworth]] (''the Younger'', 1617–1688), through their reconciliation of Platonic [[idealism]] with Christian doctrines of deific generation, came to see the divine lifeforce as the informing principle in the world. Thus, like Bruno, but not nearly to the extreme, they saw God's generative impulse as giving life to all things that exist. Accordingly, Cudworth, the most systematic metaphysician of the Cambridge Platonist tradition, fought hylozoism. His work is primarily a critique of what he took to be the two principal forms of atheism—materialism and hylozoism.

Cudworth singled out Hobbes not only as a defender of the hylozoic atheism "which attributes life to matter", but also as one going beyond it and defending "hylopathian atheism, which attributes all to matter." Cudworth attempted to show that Hobbes had revived the doctrines of [[Protagoras]] and was therefore subject to the criticisms which [[Plato]] had deployed against Protagoras in the [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|''Theaetetus'']]. On the side of hylozoism, [[Strato of Lampsacus]] was the official target. However, Cudworth's Dutch friends had reported to him the views which [[Spinoza]] was circulating in manuscript. Cudworth remarks in his ''Preface'' that he would have ignored hylozoism had he not been aware that a new version of it would shortly be published.&lt;ref&gt;''The True Intellectual System of the Universe: The First part; wherein, All the Reason and Philosophy of Atheism is Confuted; and Its Impossibility Demonstrated''. By Ralph Cudworth, D.D. London, Printed for Richard Royston, 1678&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's idealism also tends toward hylozoism.  In order to hold a balance even between matter and mind, Spinoza combined materialistic with pantheistic hylozoism, by demoting both to mere attributes of the one infinite substance.  Although specifically rejecting identity in inorganic matter, he, like the Cambridge Platonists, sees a life force within, as well as beyond, all matter.

== Contemporary hylozoism ==
[[Immanuel Kant]] presented arguments against hylozoism in the third chapter of his ''Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaften'' ("First Metaphysical Principles of Natural Science," 1786) and also in his famous ''Kritik der reinen Vernunft'' ("Critique of Pure Reason," 1783).  Yet, in our times, scientific hylozoism – whether modified, or keeping the trend to make all beings conform to some uniform pattern, to which the concept was adhered in [[modernity]] by [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Hermann Lotze]], and [[Ernst Heinrich Haeckel|Ernst Haeckel]] – was often called upon as a protest against a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] worldview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.rz.hu-berlin.de/phil/kantkongress/14/look.html Hylozoism and Dogmatism in Kant, Leibniz, and Newton]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Haeckel developed a [[materialism|materialist]] form of hylozoism, specially against [[Rudolf Virchow]]'s and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s mechanical views of humans and nature.  In his ''Die Welträtsel'' of 1899 (''The Riddle of the Universe'' 1901), Haeckel upheld a unity of organic and inorganic nature and derived all actions of both types of matter from natural causes and laws.  Thus, his form of hylozoism reverses the usual course by maintaining that living and nonliving things are essentially the same, and by erasing the distinction between the two and stipulating that they behave by a single set of laws.

In contrast, the Argentine-German [[Neuroscience|neurobiological]] tradition terms ''hylozoic hiatus'' all of the parts of nature which can only behave lawfully or nomically and, upon such a feature, are described as lying outside of minds and amid them – i.e. extramentally.  Thereby the hylozoic hiatus becomes contraposed to minds deemed able of behaving semoviently, i.e. able of inaugurating new causal series ([[semovience]]).  Hylozoism in this contemporary neurobiological tradition is thus restricted to the portions of nature behaving nomically inside the minds, namely the minds' sensory reactions ([[Christfried Jakob]]'s "sensory intonations") whereby minds react to the stimuli coming from the hylozoic hiatus or extramental realm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electroneubio.secyt.gov.ar/commentl.htm Comment l’ hylozoïsme scientifique contemporain aborde-t-il la sélection naturelle du parenchyme neurocognitif?] (French)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cogprints.org/4662|title=On Minds' Localization|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Buber]] too takes an approach that is quasi-hylozoic.  By maintaining that the essence of things is identifiable and separate, although not pre-existing, he can see a soul within each thing.

The French Pythagorean and Rosicrucian alchemist, Francois Jollivet-Castelot (1874-1937), established a hylozoic esoteric school which combined the insight of spagyrics, chemistry, physics, transmutations and metaphysics. He published many books, one of which was called "L’Hylozoïsme, l’alchimie, les chimistes unitaires" (1896). In his view there was no difference between spirit and matter except for the degree of frequency and other vibrational conditions.

The [[Mormon theology|Mormon theologian]] [[Orson Pratt]] taught a form of hylozoism.

[[Alice A. Bailey]] wrote a book called ''The Consciousness of the Atom''.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Consciousness of the Atom''—1922&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by Alice A. Bailey, [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], and their predecessor [[Madame Blavatsky]], [[Henry T. Laurency]] produced voluminous writings describing a hylozoic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction to the Works of Henry T. Laurency". ''The Official Website of the Henry T. Laurency Publishing Foundation''. Henry T. Laurency Publishing Foundation. 12 July 2009 &lt;http://www.laurency.com/introduc.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[George Ivanovich Gurdjieff]], the English philosopher and mathematician [[John Godolphin Bennett]], in his four-volume work ''The Dramatic Universe'' and his book ''Energies'', developed a six-dimensional framework in which matter-energy takes on 12 levels of hylozoic quality.

[[Ken Wilber]] embraces hylozoism to explain  [[subjective experience]] and provides terms describing the ladder of subjective experience experienced by entities from [[atom]]s up to [[Human being]]s in the ''upper left quadrant'' of his [[Integral (philosophy)|Integral philosophy]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;Wilber Ken ''A Brief History of Everything'', 1st ed. 1996, 2nd ed. 2001: {{ISBN|1-57062-740-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist Thomas Brophy, in The Mechanism Demands a Mysticism, embraces hylozoism as the basis of a framework for re-integrating modern physical science with perennial spiritual philosophy.  Brophy coins two additional words to stand with hylozoism as the three possible ontological stances consistent with modern physics.  Thus: hylostatism (universe is deterministic, thus “static” in a four-dimensional sense); hylostochastism (universe contains a fundamentally random or stochastic component); hylozoism (universe contains a fundamentally alive aspect).

Architect [[Christopher Alexander]] has put forth a theory of the living universe, where life is viewed as a pervasive patterning that extends to what is normally considered non-living things, notably buildings.  He wrote a four-volume work called ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' which explicates this theory in detail.

Philosopher and ecologist [[David Abram]] articulates and elaborates a form of hylozoism grounded in the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of sensory experience. In his books ''Becoming Animal'' and ''The Spell of the Sensuous,'' Abram suggests that matter is never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that material things actively "solicit our attention" or "call our focus," coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science as well as the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it calls us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain,  enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us.&lt;ref&gt;Abram, David ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World'', Pantheon, 1996; Vintage 1997: {{ISBN|978-0-679-77639-0}} and Abram, David: ''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology'' Pantheon, 2010; Vintage 2011: {{ISBN|978-0-375-71369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruno Latour]]'s [[actor-network theory]], in the sociology of science, treats non-living things as active agents and thus bears some metaphorical resemblance to hylozoism.&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno ''Pandora's Hope: Essays on the reality of Science Studies'', 1999: {{ISBN|0-674-65335-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irlen Spectral Filters''' or '''Irlen Lenses''', are coloured overlay filters or tinted lenses crafted specifically for the wearer and worn as glasses or [[contact lenses]]. They are intended to help people with the supposed perceptual processing difficulty known as Irlen Syndrome, also known as [[Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome]] or visual stress. For individuals who suffer from Irlen Syndrome, the brain is sensitive to specific [[visible spectrum|wavelengths of light]], resulting in difficulties with print clarity and stability and discomfort when performing visually intensive activities such as [[reading (process)|reading]]. Irlen Syndrome affects approximately 50 percent of individuals with reading difficulties and [[dyslexia]], 33 percent of those with attention difficulties such as [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]], 33 percent with [[autism]], up to 50 percent of those who have suffered a [[traumatic brain injury]], whiplash or [[concussion]], and approximately 12-14 percent of the general population.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Standardised diagnostic procedures have been developed to individualise the colour selection.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Experts call the syndrome and the treatment controversial, because it is based on insufficient research.&lt;ref name="csl.georgetown"/&gt; However, current research on the topic includes placebo controls, longitudinal studies, and cutting-edge [[brain mapping]] technology, all of which support the use of colour to alleviate the symptoms associated with Irlen Syndrome.&lt;ref name="Chouinard 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chouinard BD, Zhou CI, Hrybouski S, Kim ES, Cummine J |title=A functional neuroimaging case study of Meares-Irlen syndrome/visual stress (MISViS) |journal=Brain Topogr |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=293–307 |date=July 2012 |pmid=22124535 |doi=10.1007/s10548-011-0212-z |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang J, Zong X, Wilkins A, Jenkins B, Bozoki A, Cao Y |title=fMRI evidence that precision ophthalmic tints reduce cortical hyperactivation in migraine |journal=Cephalalgia |volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=925–36 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21622479 |pmc=3132147 |doi=10.1177/0333102411409076 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noble 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noble|first1=Jeanne| last2=Orton |first2=Michelle|last3=Irlen|first3=Sandra|last4=Robinson|first4=Greg|title=A controlled field study of the use of coloured overlays on reading achievement|journal=Australian Journal of Learning Disabilities|volume=9 |issue=2|year=2004| pages=14–22|issn=1324-8928| doi=10.1080/19404150409546760}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robinson GL, Foreman PJ |title=Scotopic sensitivity/Irlen syndrome and the use of coloured filters: a long-term placebo controlled and masked study of reading achievement and perception of ability |journal=Percept Mot Skills |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=83–113 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10544403 |doi=10.2466/pms.1999.89.1.83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Whiting, P., Robinson, G.L., &amp; Parrot, C.F. | title = Irlen coloured filters for reading: a six year follow up| journal = Australian Journal of Remedial Education |volume=26 |pages=13–19| year =1994 | url= http://www.dyslexiaservices.com.au/Six-Year_Follow-Up.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkins2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkins|first1=Arnold|title=Coloured overlays and their effects on reading speed: a review|journal=Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics|volume=22| issue=5|year=2002| pages=448–454| issn=0275-5408|doi=10.1046/j.1475-1313.2002.00079.x | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1475-1313.2002.00079.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkins 1994"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wilkins AJ, Evans BJ, Brown JA, etal |title=Double-masked placebo-controlled trial of precision spectral filters in children who use coloured overlays |journal=Ophthalmic Physiol Opt |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=365–70 |date=October 1994 |pmid=7845693 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-1313.1994.tb00126.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotopic sensitivity syndrome==

[[Scotopic sensitivity syndrome]], also known as Irlen Syndrome, is said to be a visual-perceptual defect related to difficulties with light source, glare, luminance, wavelength and black/white contrast. According to Irlen, these difficulties lead to reading problems, eye-strain, headaches, migraines, and other physical difficulties that can be alleviated by the use of person specific tinted lenses, known as Irlen Spectral Filters, worn as glasses or contact lenses.

The syndrome has six characteristics:

#[[photophobia]]
#[[Asthenopia|eye strain]] 
#poor visual resolution
#a reduced span of focus
#impaired [[depth perception]]
#poor sustained focus

Scotopic sensitivity syndrome is diagnosed by interviewing the client and by observing responses to certain visual tasks such as interpreting geometric figures and reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://irlen.com/index.php?id=5 |title=Testing &amp; Treatment |publisher= Irlen Institute |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and research==

The idea of page based distortion was initially suggested in 1980 by Olive Meares,&lt;ref&gt;Meares, O. (1980).  Figure/ground, brightness contrast and reading disabilities.  Visible Lang. 14, 13-29&lt;/ref&gt; to improve the reading ability of people with a learning disability, specifically a certain type of dyslexia. Later this was taken further by psychologist Helen Irlen.  The proposition by Irlen was made at the Annual Meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]] in 1983. At that time, there was little research made on the effect of tinted lenses. Irlen gained notable publicity demonstrating the efficacy of her method on television. Tinted lenses became a commercial success, and testing and prescribing centers were opened throughout USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Silver | first = Larry B.| title = Theme editor's note

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis of Irlen Syndrome and treatment with Irlen Spectral Filters has been reviewed by the USA Medical Board,{{which|date=April 2013}} and has been determined as not the practice of medicine; it has also been reviewed by various USA Boards of Optometry{{which|date=April 2013}} and has been found not to be the practice of [[optometry]]. [[Binocular vision|Binocular]] and accommodative anomalies may occur in conjunction with the syndrome, but are not considered to be the underlying physiological basis of the condition.&lt;ref name="Evans 1999"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Evans BJ, Patel R, Wilkins AJ, etal |title=A review of the management of 323 consecutive patients seen in a specific learning difficulties clinic |journal=Ophthalmic Physiol Opt |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=454–66 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10768028 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-1313.1999.00465.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McWhinnie 2002"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Scott L, McWhinnie H, Taylor L, etal |title=Coloured overlays in schools: orthoptic and optometric findings |journal=Ophthalmic Physiol Opt |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=156–65 |date=March 2002 |pmid=12014489 |doi=10.1046/j.1475-1313.2002.00009.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial claims of utility==

According to Irlen, the lenses can be used to treat a wide variety of problems that are associated with light sensitivity, discomfort and distortions, including head injury, [[concussion]], whiplash, perceptual problems, neurologic impairment, memory loss, [[language deficits]], headaches and [[migraine]], [[autoimmune disease]], [[fibromyalgia]], [[macular degeneration]], [[cataracts]], [[retinitis pigmentosa]], complications from an eye operation, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], chronic anxiety and others.&lt;ref name="csl.georgetown"/&gt; She has also claimed that a treatment for scotopic sensitivity syndrome could help a number of incarcerated individuals and delinquent children.&lt;ref name="csl.georgetown"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Helveston | first = Eugene M.| title = Tinted Lenses
| journal = IDA Information Packet| pages = 12–13| year = 2004| url = http://csl.georgetown.edu/publications/ControversialTherapies.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The Irlen method has been criticised for being put to the market prior to serious research.&lt;ref name="csl.georgetown" /&gt; According to Helveston, the scotopic sensitivity syndrome and its treatment has, as a phenomenon, resulted in classic [[group behaviour]] and has the characteristics of a fad with a charismatic personality as a leader and the supporting evidence being mostly anecdotal.&lt;ref name="csl.georgetown" /&gt; A 2004 study by Professor Arnold Wilkins at [[Essex University]], though, shows that this may not be the case.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}   It is suspicious that the treatment quickly came to be applied to a wide variety of maladies, suggesting that this treatment is an example of classic group behavior.&lt;ref name="csl.georgetown"/&gt; The syndrome is, however, associated with a growing array of possibly diverse conditions, as well as worldwide franchise according to critics.&lt;ref name="csl.georgetown" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12671">The '''Jadad scale''', sometimes known as '''Jadad scoring''' or the '''Oxford quality scoring system''', is a procedure to independently assess the methodological quality of a [[clinical trial]]. It is named after [[Colombia]]n physician [[Alex Jadad]] who in 1996 described a system for allocating the trial a score of between zero (very poor) and five (rigorous). It is the most widely used such assessment in the world, and as of 2017, its seminal paper has been cited in over 13000 scientific works.

==Description==
The Jadad scale independently assesses the methodological quality of a [[clinical trial]] judging the effectiveness of [[Blind experiment|blinding]]. [[Alex Jadad|Alejandro "Alex" Jadad Bechara]], a Colombian physician who worked as a Research Fellow at the Oxford Pain Relief Unit, Nuffield Department of Anaesthetics, at the [[University of Oxford]] described the allocating trials a score of between zero (very poor) and five (rigorous) scale in  an appendix to a 1996 paper.&lt;ref name="jadad"&gt;{{cite journal| last= Jadad | first= A.R. | authorlink=Alejandro R. Jadad Bechara |author2=Moore R.A. |author3=Carroll D. |author4=Jenkinson C. |author5=Reynolds D.J.M. |author6=Gavaghan D.J. |author7=McQuay H.J.  | title= Assessing the quality of reports of randomized clinical trials: Is blinding necessary? |journal= Controlled Clinical Trials|volume=17 |issue=1 |pages= 1–12| doi= 10.1016/0197-2456(95)00134-4| year= 1996 | pmid=8721797}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 2007 book Jadad described the randomised controlled trial as "one of the simplest, most powerful and revolutionary forms of research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jadad|first=Alejandro R.|author2=Enkin, Murray |title=Randomized Controlled Trials: Questions, Answers and Musings| publisher=Blackwell| year=2007| edition=2nd| isbn=978-1-4051-3266-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Randomised controlled trial}}
Clinical trials are conducted for the purpose of collecting data on the efficacy of medical treatments.&lt;ref name=chow&gt;{{cite book|last=Chow|first=Shein-Chung|author2=Liu, Jen-pei|title=Design and Analysis of Clinical Trials|publisher=Wiley|year=2004|page=2|isbn=978-0-471-24985-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXMUEjZ4vyAC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment might be, for example, a new [[drug]], a [[medical device]], a [[surgical procedure]], or a preventative regime.&lt;ref name=chow/&gt; [[Clinical trial protocol]]s vary considerably depending on the nature of the treatment under investigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brian |first=Everitt|author2=Pickles, Andrew|title=Statistical Aspects of the Design and Analysis of Clinical Trials|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2004|page=5|isbn=978-1-86094-441-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMiH5y6SDuQC&amp;printsec=PPA5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but typically in a controlled trial researchers gather a group of volunteers and subject some to the test treatment, while giving the others either no treatment (known as a [[placebo]]), or an established treatment for comparison. After a defined time period, the patients in the test group are assessed for health improvements in comparison with the [[control group]].

However, trials can vary greatly in quality. Methodological errors such as poor [[Blind experiment|blinding]] or poor [[randomisation]] allow factors such as the [[placebo effect]] or [[selection bias]] to adversely affect the results of a trial.&lt;ref name="Colditz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Colditz|first=G.A.|author2=Miller J.N. |author3=Mosteller F. |year=1989|title=How study design affects outcomes in comparisons of therapy|journal=Statistics in Medicine | volume=8|issue=4|pages=441–454|doi=10.1002/sim.4780080408 | pmid = 2727468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Randomisation===
Randomisation is a process to remove potential distortion of statistical results arising from the manner in which the
trial is conducted, in particular in the selection of subjects. Studies have indicated, for example, that nonrandomised trials are more likely to show a positive result for a new treatment than for an established conventional one.&lt;ref name="Colditz"/&gt;

===Blinding===
The importance of [[scientific control]]s to limit factors under test is well established. However, it is also important that none of those involved in a clinical trial, whether the researcher, the subject patient or any other involved parties, should allow their own prior expectations to affect reporting of results.&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Day|first=Simon J |author2=Altman,  Douglas G |title=Blinding in clinical trials and other studies|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=321|issue=7259|page=504|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/321/7259/504|pmid=10948038|year=2000|pmc=1118396|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7259.504}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[placebo effect]] is known to be a confounding factor in trials; affecting the ability of both patients and doctors to report accurately on the clinical outcome. [[Blind experiment|Experimental blinding]] is a process to prevent [[bias]], both conscious and subconscious, skewing results.&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt;

Blinding frequently takes the form of a [[placebo]], an inactive dummy that is indistinguishable from the real treatment. Blinding can however be difficult to achieve in some trials,&lt;ref name="Day" /&gt; for example, [[surgery]] or [[physical therapy]]. Poor blinding can exaggerate the perceived effects of treatment, particularly if any such effects are small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The revised CONSORT statement for reporting randomized trials: explanation and elaboration | journal=Annals of Internal Medicine | date=2001-04-17 | first=DG | last=Altman | first2=KF|last2=Schulz|first3=D|last3=Moher|first4=M|last4=Egger|first5=F|last5=Davidoff|first6=D|last6=Elbourne|first7=PC|last7=Gøtzsche|first8=T|last8=Lang|last9=CONSORT GROUP (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) | volume=134 | issue=8 |pages=663–694 | pmid=11304107 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-134-8-200104170-00012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blinding should be appropriate to the study, and is ideally [[Double-blind#Double-blind trials|double blind]], wherein neither the patient nor doctor is aware of whether they are in the control or test group, eliminating any such psychological effects from the study.

===Withdrawals and dropouts===
Withdrawals and [[dropping out|dropouts]] are those patients who fail to complete a course of treatment, or fail to report back on its outcome to the researchers. The reasons for doing so might be varied: the individuals may have moved away, abandoned the course of treatment, or died. Whatever the reason, the attrition rate can skew results of a study, particularly for those subjects who ceased treatment due to perceived inefficacy. In [[smoking cessation]] studies, for example, it is routine to consider all dropouts as failures.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jadad questionnaire==
A three-point questionnaire forms the basis for a Jadad score.&lt;ref name="jadad"/&gt; Each question was to be answered with either a ''yes'' or a ''no''. Each ''yes'' would score a single point, each ''no'' zero points; there were to be no fractional points. The Jadad team stated that they expected it should take no longer than ten minutes to score any individual paper. The questions were as follows: ''Was the study described as randomized?'',  ''Was the study described as double blind?'' and ''Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts?''&lt;ref name="jadad"/&gt;

To receive the corresponding point, an article should describe the number of withdrawals and dropouts, in each of the study groups, and the underlying reasons. Additional points were given if: ''The method of randomisation was described in the paper, and that method was appropriate.'' or ''The method of blinding was described, and it was appropriate.''&lt;ref name="jadad"/&gt;

Points would be ''deducted'' if: ''The method of randomisation was described, but was inappropriate.'' or ''The method of blinding was described, but was inappropriate.''&lt;ref name="jadad"/&gt;

A clinical trial could therefore receive a Jadad score of between zero and five. The Jadad scale is sometimes described as a five-point scale, though there are only three questions.

==Uses==
The Jadad score may be used in a number of ways:

# To evaluate the general quality of medical research in a particular field.&lt;ref name="Acupuncture"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Adrian|author2=Ernst, Edzard|title=Acupuncture: A Scientific Appraisal|publisher=Elsevier |year=1999|page=109|isbn=978-0-7506-4163-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2KkvlQI7sYC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Gang|title=The quality of reporting of randomized controlled trials of traditional Chinese medicine|journal=Clinical Therapeutics|volume=29|issue=7|pages=1456–1467|doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2007.07.023|year=2007|pmid=17825697|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Welk|first=B.|author2=Afshar, K. |author3=MacNeily, A.E. |title=Randomized controlled trials in pediatric urology: room for improvement|journal=J Urol|volume=176|issue=1|pages=306–310|doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(06)00560-X|year=2006|pmid=16753430}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# To set a minimum standard for the paper's results to be included in a [[meta analysis]]. A researcher conducting a [[systematic review]] for example might elect to exclude all papers on the topic with a Jadad score of 3 or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simon|first=Stephen D. |title=Statistical Evidence in Medical Trials: What Do the Data Really Tell Us?|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=122|isbn=978-0-19-856761-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zaq99M2p_sEC&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# For critical analysis of an individual paper.

{{as of| 2008}}, the Jadad score was the most widely used such assessment in the world,&lt;ref name="Clinical Epidemiology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayes|first1=R.B.|last2=Sackett|first2=D.L.|last3=Guyatt|first3=G.H.|last4=Tugwell|first4=P.|title=Clinical Epidemiology|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2005|page=31|isbn=978-0-7817-4524-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cuvY6TItIwgC&amp;pg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scales"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olivo |first=SA|author2=Macedo LG |author3=Gadotti IC |author4=Fuentes J |author5=Stanton T |author6=Magee DJ |year=2008|title=Scales to Assess the Quality of Randomized Controlled Trials : A Systematic Review|journal=Physical therapy|volume=88|issue=2|issn=0031-9023 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb237/is_2_88/ai_n29412210/pg_1|doi=10.2522/ptj.20070147|pages=156–75|pmid=18073267}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its seminal paper has been cited in over 3000 scientific works.

==Criticism==
Critics have charged that the Jadad scale is flawed, being over-simplistic and placing too much emphasis on blinding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=V. W.|title=Is the Jadad Score the Proper Evaluation of Trials?|journal=[[J.

'''Langa Education Assistance Program (LEAP)''', also known as '''LEAP Science and Maths Schools''', is a collection of six non-fee payment secondary education schools located in three provinces in [[South Africa]]. The first LEAP school opened in 2004 in rented premises in Observatory, [[Cape Town]] and served mainly, learners from the [[township]] of [[Langa, Cape Town|Langa]].&lt;ref name="History of LEAP"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://leapschool.org.za/history-of-leap/|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20141110010101/http://leapschool.org.za/history%2Dof%2Dleap/|title = History of LEAP|accessdate = 10 November 2014|archivedate=10 November 2014|dead-url = yes|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an independent school, LEAP is mainly founded by South African Corporates with limited subsidies from the [[South African Department of Education|Department of Basic Education]].

==History==

===Langa Education Assistance Program (or LEAP) ===

John Gilmour was a teacher at [[Pinelands High School]]&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; in Cape Town in 1987 when he decided to respond to a call from individuals within the South African business community, to contribute to the redress of the devastation of the [[Bantu Education Act]],&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; a segregation law imposed in the education sector by the [[Apartheid]] system in 1953.

“Africa Week” was then introduced by a team led by John Gilmour to bring black learners under the “Bantu Education” system to spend a week at Pinelands High School, which was then a white’s only school. The program became the precursor for the Langa Education Assistance Program (or LEAP) which aimed at providing one hundred black students from the Langa township, with support tuition from Pinelands High teachers in [[English language|English]], [[Maths]] and [[Science]], three afternoons a week.

The prohibitive transport cost of bringing learners from the township schools to Pinelands High School forced the model to be revised. In 1996, it was then decided that instead of learners being bussed in to Pinelands High, teachers will be transported to meet learners in township schools.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

Community members in Langa perceived the new model of LEAP as an attempt of white teachers to “save” black children. Teachers from the community felt that they were as able as other teachers to provide extra lessons that would address the inadequacies in the students' educational foundations.  The uneasiness within the community obliged the leadership of LEAP to change the model and include community teachers in the program.

When John Gilmour realised that despite best efforts of LEAP and similar programs in the country there was no increase in the proportion of black learners entering university, especially science-based disciplines, he sought for an alternative model. LEAP Science and Maths school was the alternative model.

===LEAP Science and Maths School===

LEAP Science and Maths school was a deliberate decision of John Gilmour seeking to increase the number of black learners who take science and maths-based modules at high school in order to increase the chance of being accepted at University, particular in disciplines where these modules are a prerequisite.&lt;ref name="A Leap in the dark"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Terblanche|first1=Barry|title=A leap in the dark|publisher=Mail and Guardian|date=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John resigned as Headmaster of Abbot’s College in 2004, where he has been since he left Pinelands in 1997, to focus on LEAP Science and Maths School.  In January 2004, the first LEAP Science and Maths School opened its doors in the suburb of Observatory, Cape Town, with seventy-two learners, seven teachers and one administrative staff member.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

===Expansion of the LEAP model===

====LEAP 1====

The LEAP Science and Maths school, which started in Observatory later moved to Pinelands and become known as LEAP 1. It serves learners from community of Langa Township. It is the first and oldest of the LEAP Science and Maths schools.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; The school is headed by its Operation Leader Oscar Dlodlo.

====LEAP 2====

LEAP 2 opened in 2007 also in Pinelands. It serves learners from the townships of Gugulethu and Crossroads. In 2013, the school opened satellite classes to serve grade 9 and 10 learners from the township of Delft. Learners of the school are taught in English and [[isiXhosa]]. The head of the school is Mr. Babele Emedi, who also assumes the role of Operations Leader.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

====LEAP 3====

The school opened its doors in 2008 to serve learners from the township of Alexandra in [[Johannesburg]].  Learners are taught in [[English language|English]], [[isiZulu]], [[Sepedi]] and [[Sesotho]] under the leadership of the Operations leader, Mr. Mark Fletcher.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

====LEAP 4====

This school is situated in the township of [[Diepsloot]] just outside Johannesburg. The school opened in 2011 through a partnership with the South Africa corporate Aveng Group.&lt;ref name="Aveng Group Projects"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aveng Group Projects|url=http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|website=http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|publisher=Aveng Group|accessdate=10 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003105051/http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|archivedate=3 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; LEAP 4 teaches learners in isiZulu and [[Sepedi]] as home languages, along with English.  Paul Mumba, is the Operations Leader and head of LEAP 4.

====LEAP 5====

In 2012, LEAP 5 opened its doors in Jane Furse, [[Sekhukhune District Municipality|Sekhukhune]] in [[Limpopo]] province. The school is under the leadership of its Operation Leader, Raphael Mukachi.

====LEAP 6====

LEAP 6 is situated in [[Ga-Rankuwa]] near [[Pretoria]]. The school opened in 2012 to respond to the request of the Anglican Diocese of Pretoria, concerned with the community’s poor educational results and high unemployment rate, particularly among young people. The school is led by its Operation Leader, Lawrence Manyesa.

==Vision==

“We strive for the positive transformation of communities through the meaningful education of children from those communities”&lt;ref name="About LEAP"&gt;{{cite web|title=About LEAP|url=http://leapschool.org.za/aboutleap/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/aboutleap/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

“LEAP schools provide student-centered, math’s and science-focused education to economically disadvantaged students from grades 8 to 12. We focus on enabling the self-awareness necessary for each student’s growth to healthy adulthood, and to ensuring optimal academic results which will allow for choices for lifelong learning and a fulfilling future.”&lt;ref name= "About LEAP" /&gt;

== Values and focus==

Although LEAP schools focus on Maths and Sciences; it puts a lot of emphasis on the emotional [[child development|development]] of learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dugger|first1=Celia W|title=New Schools in South Africa Serve the Underserved|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/world/africa/09safrica.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=3&amp;|accessdate=10 November 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=8 September 2010|ref=New Schools in South Africa Serve the Underserved}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Gilmour acknowledged the importance of the emotional development in a country where “eight million children come from single-parent households and a further 4.3 million reside with neither biological parent”.  In his article “A tale of two systems”, he speaks of LEAP’s response to this problem “has been to recognise that social transformation starts with personal transformation:  one person at a time, one room at a time, one school at a time and one community at a time.”&lt;ref name="A tale of two systems"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilmour|first1=John|title=A tale of two systems|url=http://leapschool.org.za/2012/02/12/a-tail-of-two-systems/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school cherishes the following values:
*Being kind, honest and healthy
*Being punctual and looking good
*Working hard and never giving up
*Admitting and learning from mistakes
*Confronting issues and being open to change
*Working together and sharing

== Success stories==

===Statistics===

In a report that analyses the performance of the school between 2005 and 2013, LEAP reported that:

*Its grade 12 learners have achieved a 93% pass rate within the reporting period.
*600 learners passed the National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations commonly known as “matric”
*77% qualified for study at academic and technical universities with a bachelor or diploma pass.&lt;ref name=Success&gt;{{cite web|title=Success|url=http://leapschool.org.za/success/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/success/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school claims to outperform national statistics when it compares itself with national averages of learners who write maths and science in 2013. All LEAP learners wrote these modules compared to only 43% who took maths and 33% who took physical science nationally.&lt;ref name="LEAP Annual Report 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=LEAP Annual Report 2013|url=http://leapschool.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LEAP_AnnualReport2013.pdf|website=http://leapschool.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LEAP_AnnualReport2013.pdf|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduates===

He graduated with a bachelor in [[Bachelor of Commerce]] in Finance from the [[University of the Western Cape]]. In its 2012 annual report, the school reported to have over 30 university graduates ranging from physiotherapist, engineer to accountants.

===Celebratory adverts===

In 2014, LEAP launched a series of celebratory adverts to showcase its work and celebrate the achievements of its past students. Qondisa Nxganga, a Master’s graduate from the prestigious [[African Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] (AIMS), is featured in these adverts alongside a number of other LEAP alumni.&lt;ref name="Celebrating LEAP Alumni"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating LEAP Alumni|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPYGiXxlQCo|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=LEAP Science &amp; Maths School|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===

LEAP’s model is based on strong engagement with the broader community and building beneficial partnerships and collaboration with other organizations, particular schools. It is a three-way collaboration approach where each LEAP school partners with a more privileged school as well as a less privileged school (a township school) in the community where it operates to promote a culture of shared resources and cultural exchange&lt;ref name=Schools&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools|url=http://leapschool.org.za/schools/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/schools/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LEAP has also been successful in building strong partnerships with both commercial and non-profit organizations. Most of its funding comes from South African corporates, trusts and Foundations.

LEAP, is Teach with Africa’s partner on the continent and together they have established the Teacher Institute which seeks to develop teachers and supports individuals wanting to enter the teaching profession&lt;ref name="Teach for Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Teach for Africa|url=http://www.teachwithafrica.org/what-we-do/our-in-country-partners/|website=http://www.teachwithafrica.org/what-we-do/our-in-country-partners/|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24374">There are many proposed diseases and [[Medical_diagnosis|diagnoses]] that are rejected by orthodox medicine consensus and are associated with pseudoscience.

==Definition==

[[Pseudoscience]] rejects [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] methodology.&lt;ref name="Coker"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Coker |first1=Rory |title=Distinguishing Science from Pseudoscience |url=https://web2.ph.utexas.edu/~coker2/index.files/distinguish.htm |website=utexas.edu |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudoscientific diseases are not defined using objective criteria. They cannot achieve, and perhaps do not seek, medical recognition.

Other conditions may be rejected or contested by orthodox medicine, but are not necessarily associated with pseudoscience. Diagnostic criteria for some of these conditions may be vague, over-inclusive, or otherwise ill-defined. Although the evidence for the disease may be contested or lacking, however, the justification for these diagnoses is nevertheless empirical and therefore amenable to scientific investigation, at least in theory.

Examples of conditions that are not necessarily pseudoscientific include:
* Conditions determined to be [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatic]] in nature, including [[mass psychogenic illness]]es. 
* [[Medicalization|Medicalized]] conditions that are not pathogenic in nature, such as [[aging]], [[childbirth]], [[pregnancy]], [[sexual addiction]],  [[baldness]], [[jet lag]], and [[halitosis]].&lt;ref name="Smith2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=R.|title=In search of "non-disease"|journal=BMJ|volume=324|issue=7342|year=2002|pages=883–885|issn=09598138|doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7342.883}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conditions that are not widely recognized, about which there is an ongoing debate within the scientific and medical literature. 
* [[Functional disorder]]s are a set of conditions that cannot be explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities.&lt;ref name="BergerGieteling2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=M Y|last2=Gieteling|first2=M J|last3=Benninga|first3=M A|title=Chronic abdominal pain in children|journal=BMJ|volume=334|issue=7601|year=2007|pages=997–1002|issn=0959-8138|doi=10.1136/bmj.39189.465718.BE}}&lt;/ref&gt; These raise challenges around diagnosis and treatment, with debate around whether they are psychogenic. They often present with [[Symptom#Non-specific symptoms|non-specific symptoms]] that are consistent with multiple causes. Examples include [[fibromyalgia]], [[myalgic encephalomyelitis]], and [[Gulf War syndrome]].
* Conditions that are recognized by the [[scientific consensus]], but are frequently [[Self-diagnosis|self-diagnosed]] or otherwise misapplied. Examples include various kinds of [[allergy]], including [[non-celiac gluten sensitivity]].

== Examples ==

* '''[[Adrenal fatigue]]''' or '''hypoadrenia''' is a pseudoscientific diagnosis described as a state in which the [[adrenal gland]]s are exhausted and unable to produce adequate quantities of [[hormone]]s, primarily the [[glucocorticoid]] [[cortisol]], due to chronic stress or infections.&lt;ref name=2012Rev&gt;{{cite journal |author = Shah R, Greenberger PA |year = 2012 |title = Unproved and controversial methods and theories in allergy-immunology |journal = Allergy Asthma Proc. |volume = 33 Suppl 1 |issue = 3 |pages = S100-2 |doi = 10.2500/aap.2012.33.3562 |pmid = 22794702 }} Quote: "There is no scientific basis for the existence of this disorder and no conclusive method for diagnosis."&lt;/ref&gt; Adrenal fatigue should not be confused with a number of actual forms of adrenal dysfunction such as [[adrenal insufficiency]] or [[Addison's disease]].&lt;ref name="webmd" /&gt; The term "adrenal fatigue", which was invented in 1998 by James Wilson, a [[chiropractic|chiropractor]],&lt;ref name="sbm"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/fatigued-by-a-fake-disease/ |title = Fatigued by a Fake Disease |work = [[Science-Based Medicine]] |date = October 28, 2010 |accessdate = March 12, 2015 |author = Gavura, Scott }}&lt;/ref&gt; may be applied to a collection of mostly [[Symptom#Types|nonspecific symptoms]].&lt;ref name=2012Rev/&gt;  There is no [[scientific evidence]] supporting the concept of adrenal fatigue and it is not recognized as a diagnosis by any scientific or medical community.&lt;ref name=2012Rev/&gt;&lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/adrenal-fatigue-is-it-real |title = Adrenal Fatigue: Is It Real? |work = WebMD |publisher = Metcalf, Eric |accessdate = 2014-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A systematic review found no evidence for the term adrenal fatigue, confirming the consensus among endocrinological societies that it is a myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Cadegiani |first1 = Flavio A. |last2 = Kater |first2 = Claudio E. |title = Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review |journal = BMC Endocrine Disorders |date = 24 August 2016 |volume = 16 |issue = 1 |pages = 48 |doi = 10.1186/s12902-016-0128-4 |issn = 1472-6823 |pmid = 27557747 |pmc = 4997656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11615">The '''soil composition of vineyards''' is one of the most important [[viticulture|viticultural]] considerations when planting grape vines. The [[soil]] supports the [[root]] structure of the vine and influences the drainage levels and amount of [[mineral]]s and nutrients that the vine is exposed to. The ideal soil condition for a vine is a layer of thin [[topsoil]] and [[subsoil]] that sufficiently retains water but also has good drainage so that the roots do not become overly saturated. The ability of the soil to retain heat and/or reflect it back up to the vine is also an important consideration that affects the ripening of the grapes.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 16"&gt;T. Stevenson ''"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia"'' pg 16 Dorling Kindersley 2005 {{ISBN|0-7566-1324-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several minerals that are vital to the health of vines that all good vineyard soils have. These include [[calcium]] which helps to neutralize the [[Soil pH]] levels, [[iron]] which is essential for [[photosynthesis]], [[magnesium]] which is an important component of [[chlorophyll]], [[nitrogen]] which is assimilated in the form of [[nitrates]], [[phosphates]] which encourages root development, and [[potassium]] which improves the vine metabolisms and increases its health for next year's crop.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 16"/&gt;

==List of soil terms==
''Unless otherwise noted the primary reference for this list is Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia 2005''

===A-C===
*Albariza - Formed by [[diatomaceous]] deposits. Found in southern [[Spain]]
*[[Alluvium]] - Highly fertile soil that has been transported by a river. Often contains [[gravel]], [[sand]] and [[silt]].
*[[Basalt]] - [[Volcanic rock]] that is high in calcium, iron, and magnesium. Variable potassium and little or no quartz.
*Boulbènes - Fine [[siliceous]] soil that is easily compressed and common in the [[Entre-Deux-Mers]] region of [[Bordeaux]].
*[[Brickearth]] - ''See under'' [[Loess]].
*[[Calcareous|Calcareous soil]] - [[Alkaline soil]] with high levels of [[Calcium carbonate|calcium]] and [[Magnesium carbonate]]. Typically cool in temperature soil that provides good water retention and drainage. '''Calcareous clay''' soils have high [[limestone]] content that neutralizes natural acidity of the soil. However the cool temperatures of the soil normally delay ripening in the grape which tends to produce more acidic wines.
*Carbonaceous soil - Soil produced through the [[anaerobic decomposition]] of rotting vegetation. This type of soil includes [[anthracite]], [[coal]], [[lignite]] and [[peat]].
*[[Chalk]] - Very [[porous]] soft limestone soil that vine roots can easily penetrate. It provides good drainage and works best for grapes with high acidity levels.
*[[Clay]] - [[Sedimentary rock]] based soil that has good water retention ability but poor drainage. The soil is often very cool and high in acidity. The Right Bank of [[Bordeaux]] is dominated by clay based soils.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;E. S. Brown ''"[http://winegeeks.com/articles/139 The World's Top 10 Wine Soils] Wine Geeks 7/5/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===D-H===
*[[Dolomite]] - Calcium-magnesium carbonate soil.
*[[Flint]] - Siliceous stone that reflects and retains heat well. The [[Pouilly-Fumé]] wine of the [[Loire Valley]] is generally produced from flint-based soil and is said to have "gun-flint" smell in the wine.
*Galestro - [[Schist]] based soil found in the [[Tuscany]] region of [[Italy]].
*[[Granite]] - Composed of 40-60% quartz, 30-40% [[Orthoclase]] and various amounts of [[hornblende]], [[mica]], and other minerals. This soil warms quickly and retains heat well. The soil's high level of acidity works to minimize the acid levels in the grapes which works well with acidic grapes like [[Gamay]]. It is the main soil type of the Brand region of [[Alsace]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Gravel]] - Loose siliceous pebble soil that has good drainage but poor fertility. Vines planted in this type of soil must penetrate deeply to try to and find nutrients in the subsoil. Wine made from vines produces on clay gravel beds have less acidity than those planted on limestone gravel beds. The [[Graves (wine region)|Graves]] and [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]] regions of Bordeaux consist predominantly of gravel-based soil.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Greywacke]] - Sedimentary soil formed by rivers depositing quartz, [[mudstone]] and [[feldspar]]. It is found in vineyards of [[Germany]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]].
*[[Gypsum]] - [[Calcium sulfate]] based soil that is formed through the [[evaporation]] of [[seawater]]. It is a high absorbent soil that has average drainage ability.
*[[Hardpan]] - A dense layer of clay or other material that is impermeable to water. In some areas of [[Bordeaux]], a [[sand]]y iron-rich layer is located deep enough below the surface to act as a [[water table]] for the vine.

===I-Q===
*[[Keuper]] - Soil type consisting of [[marl]] and [[limestone]] common in [[Alsace]], dating to the [[Upper Triassic]] period.
*Kimmeridgian soil - A gray colored limestone based soil originally identified in [[Kimmeridge, England]]. '''Kimmeridgian clay''' is calcareous clay containing Kimmeridgian limestone. This is the principal soil type of the [[Loire Valley]], [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] regions.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Lignite]] - Soil type used as fertilizer in [[Germany]] and [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne]]. It is a brown colored carbonaceous soil that is intermediate between [[peat]] and [[coal]].
*[[Limestone]] - Sedimentary based soil consisting of [[carbonates]]. The most common colored limestone found in wine producing area is buff-gray in color (with the exception of white [[chalk]]). The water retention abilities vary from composition but limestone is consistently [[alkaline]] and is generally planted with grapes of high acidity levels. This is the main soil type in the [[Zinnkoepflé]] region of Alsace.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*Llicorella - A soil type found in the [[Priorat (DOQ)|Priorat]] appellation of Spain. The soil is a mix of slate and quartz that dates to the [[Paleozoic]] era. The soil is very porous and drains well. [[Syrah]], [[Grenache]] and [[Carignan]] have done well in this soil type.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Loam]] - Warm, soft, fertile soil composed of roughly equal amounts of [[silt]], [[sand]] and [[clay]]. It is typically too fertile for high quality wines that need to limit yields in order to concentrate flavors.
*[[Loess]] - A very fine, predominantly silty soil composed of [[wind-borne sand|wind-borne sediment]] that is typically angular and decalcified. Commonly known as [[brickearth]] in the UK, the soil is very fertile and has good water retention and warming properties, but drains poorly.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;Bell, F. G. &amp; Culshaw, M. G. (2001). 'Problem soils - a review from a British perspective', in Jefferson, I., Murray, E. J., Faragher, E. and Fleming, P. R. (eds). ''Problematic soils'', 11-17, Thomas Telford. {{ISBN|0-7277-3043-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Marl]] - Calcareous clay-based soil that adds acidity to the wine. Vines planted in this type of soil normally ripen later than in other soil types. Marl soil is typically deep and lacking in stone fragments; it is the main soil type in the [[Piedmont wine]] region of Italy. '''Marlstone''' is the indurated (well-cemented) metamorphic form of Marl.
*[[Mica]] - [[Silicate]] based soil composed of fine, decomposed rock formations.
*[[Muschelkalk]] -Soil type consisting of various compositions of [[sandstone]], marl, [[dolomite]], and [[slate|shingle]] common in Alsace dating back from the [[Middle Triassic]] period.
*[[Perlite]] - A [[volcanic]] soil type that is light, powdery and lustrous with properties similar to [[diatomaceous earth]].
*[[Quartz]] - Common material found in most vineyard soils - especially sand and silt based soils. The high [[Soil pH]] of quartz can reduce the acidity of the resulting wines but its heat retaining property that stores and reflects heat can increase ripening of the grape which can result in wine of higher alcohol content.

===S-Z===
*[[Sand]] - Warm, airy soil that is composed of tiny particles of weathered rocks. One of the few soils that the [[phylloxera]] louse does not thrive in, the soil drains well but does not have good water retention. '''Sandstone''' is a [[sedimentary soil]] composed of sand particles that has been pressured bound by various [[iron]] based minerals. This is the main soil type of [[Kitterlé]] in Alsace.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Schist]] - Laminated, [[crystalline]] rock based soil that retains heat well and is rich in [[magnesium]] and [[potassium]] but is poor in organic nutrients and [[nitrogens]].
*[[Shale]] - Fine grain sedimentary based soil that can turn into [[slate]] when under pressure. The soil is moderately fertile and retains heat well.
*Siliceous soil - Soil composed of [[acid]] rock that are crystalline in nature. The soil has good heat retention but needs the added composition of [[silt]], [[clay]] and other sedimentary soils to have any kind of water retention. The range of this soil can include organic materials like [[Kieselguhr]] and [[flint]] or inorganic materials like [[quartz]]. This soil type covers half of the [[Bordeaux wine regions|wine regions]] of [[Bordeaux]].
*[[Silt]] - Soil type consisting of fine grain deposits that offer good water retention but poor drainage. It is more fertile than sand.
*[[Silex]] - A flint and sand based soil type found primarily in the [[Loire Valley]] that is a formed from a mixture of clay, limestone and [[silica]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Slate]] - Soil type that is the most common found in the [[Mosel wine|Mosel]] region. Slate is a metamorphic, plate-like rock formed when shale, clay, or [[siltstone]] is subjected to pressure deep within the earth. The soil retains heat well and warms up relatively quickly.
*Steige - A schist based soil found in the [[Andlau]] region of [[Alsace]]. In the [[Alsace Grand Cru AOC]] of Kastelberg, the soil has [[metamorphosed]] with [[granite]] sand to form a hard, dark slate like stone.
*[[Terra Rossa]] - A sedimentary soil, known as "Red Earth", that is formed after [[carbonates]] have been leached out of limestone. The breakdown leaves behind iron deposits which [[oxidizes]] and turns the soil a rustic red color. This soil type is found in some areas along the [[Mediterranean]] and in [[Coonawarra wine region|Coonawarra]]. The soil drains well and is relatively high in nutrients. Australian winemakers have found some success with [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] plantings.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;
*[[Tufa]] - A highly-friable calcareous bedrock that breaks down into a fine crumb structure.
*[[Ultisol]] - a highly weathered, largely infertile, clay-based soil - usually brilliant red in color - found in the [[American South]].
*[[Volcanic soil]] - Soil that is derived from one of two volcanic activities. 1.) ''Vent-based soil'' is formed from rock material (including [[pumice]] and [[tuff]]) that has been ejected into the air and cooled before settling to the earth. 2.) ''Lava-based soil'' is the product of [[lava]] flows from the volcano. Ninety percent of lava-based soil is composed of [[basalt]] with the other ten percent composed of [[andesite]], [[pitchstone]], [[rhyolite]], and [[trachyte]].

'''Magnetic water treatment''' (also known as '''anti-scale magnetic treatment''' or '''AMT''') is a method of supposedly reducing the effects of [[hard water]] by passing it through a [[magnetic field]] as a non-chemical alternative to [[water softening]].  Magnetic water treatment is regarded as unproven and unscientific.

There is a lack of peer-reviewed laboratory data, mechanistic explanations, and documented field studies to support its effectiveness.  Erroneous conclusions about their efficacy are based on applications with uncontrolled variables. There are, however, some studies which have claimed significant effects and proposed possible mechanisms for the observed decrease in water scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szkatula |first1=A |last2=Balanda |first2=M |last3=Kopeć |first3=M |year=2002 |title=Magnetic treatment of industrial water.

==Effectiveness==
Vendors of magnetic water treatment devices frequently use pictures and [[Anecdotal evidence|testimonials]] to support their claims, but omit quantitative detail and well-controlled studies.&lt;ref name="Keister2004" /&gt; Advertisements and promotions generally omit system variables, such as corrosion or system mass balance analyticals, as well as measurements of post-treatment water such as concentration of hardness ions or the distribution, structure, and morphology of suspended particles.&lt;ref name="Keister2004"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simon Parsons of the School of Water Sciences at [[Cranfield University]] proposed that the magnetic field reduces the surface charge on small particles, increasing the tendency to coagulate as large particles that stay with the flow rather than depositing as scale. However, an internal study in 1996 at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] found no difference in preferred crystal structure of scale deposited in magnetic water treatment systems.&lt;ref name="Krauter1996"&gt;

&lt;!-- Note: The 1996 Entrepreneur article mentioned Paul Coetzee, who (based on experiments and observations) "believes that there is no effect directly related to any magnetic (or electric) field."  Coetzee's later study, published in Water SA in 2003, concluded that "It was found that the permanent magnet was effective in suppressing the mass precipitation of scale in all six [of] these experiments", reflecting different results from an experiment conducted under different conditions. --&gt;

The '''''Nature of Man Series''''' is a four-volume series of works in [[paleoanthropology]] by the prolific playwright, screenwriter, and science writer [[Robert Ardrey]]. The books in the series were published between 1961 and 1976.

The series majorly undermined standing assumptions in social sciences, leading to an abandonment of the "[[tabula rasa|blank slate]]" hypothesis; incited a renaissance in the science of [[ethology]]; and led to widespread popular interest in [[human evolution]] and [[Anthropogeny|human origins]].

The first work, ''[[African Genesis]]'' (1961), particularly helped revive interest in ethology, and was a direct precursor to the [[Konrad Lorenz]]'s ''[[On Aggression]]'' (1966), [[Desmond Morris]]'s ''[[The Naked Ape]]'' (1967), [[Lionel Tiger]]'s ''Men in Groups'' (1969), and Tiger and [[Robin Fox]]'s ''The Imperial Animal'' (1971). The director of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History#Hall of Human Origins|Human Origins Program]] [[Rick Potts]], cited Ardrey's work as inspiring him to go anthropology.&lt;ref name="Anthronotes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anthropology.si.edu/outreach/anthnote/Summer99/anthnote.html |title=Human Origins: One Man's Search for the Causes in Time |last=Selig | first=Ruth Osterweis |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |date=Spring–Summer 1999 |website=Anthronotes |access-date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works were wildly popular and influenced the public imagination. Stanley Kubrick cited them as major influences in developing his films [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']] (1968) and [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|''A Clockwork Orange'']] (1971).&lt;ref name=Kubrick&gt;Kubrick, Stanley.

==Robert Ardrey==
{{main article|Robert Ardrey}}
Robert Ardrey was a prolific [[playwright]], [[screenwriter]], and [[science writing|science writer]]. By the time he returned to the sciences in the 1950s, he had already had a decorated [[Hollywood]] and [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] career, including the award of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]&lt;ref name="About"&gt;The Robert Ardrey Estate Website. [http://www.robertardrey.com/about/ "About"]&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Academy Award]] nomination for best screenplay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{IMDb title | 0060588 | ''Khartoum''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Ardrey travelled to [[Africa]], where he wrote a series of articles for [[The Reporter (magazine)|''The Reporter'']].&lt;ref name="Education"&gt;Ardrey, Robert; Ardrey, Daniel (ed.). "The Education of Robert Ardrey: An Autobiography" (unpublished manuscript ca. 1980, available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}} At the same time he renewed an acquaintance with prominent geologist [[Richard Foster Flint]] and investigated claims made by [[Raymond Dart]] about a specimen of ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''.&lt;ref name="Education" /&gt;{{rp|119}} This trip would initiate the decades of work Ardrey completed in the field of human evolution.

==African Genesis (1961)==
{{main article|African Genesis}}
The central thesis of ''African Genesis: A Personal Investigation into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man'' was that early man evolved from carnivorous African predecessors, and not, as was then the scientific consensus, from Asian herbivores.&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;Ardrey, Robert. ''African Genesis: A Personal Investigation into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man.'' New York: Atheneum. 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AGkindle"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/African-Genesis-Personal-Investigation-Origins/dp/0988604302 Kindle Edition Description via Amazon Website]&lt;/ref&gt; It drew particularly on the scientific work of [[Raymond Dart]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]]. This thesis has been proven and is now scientific doctrine.{{Citation needed|date = July 2015}}

''African Genesis'' also challenged a key methodological assumption of the social sciences, namely that human behavior was distinct from animal behavior. Ardrey instead asserted that evolutionarily inherited traits were a major factor in determining human behavior. This was a hugely controversial hypothesis, though it has gained widespread acceptance today. It was a major theme that would extend throughout the ''Nature of Man'' books and continue to surround them with controversy.

==The Territorial Imperative (1966)==
{{main article|The Territorial Imperative}}
''The Territorial Imperative: A Personal Inquiry Into the Animal Origins of Property and Nations'' extends Ardrey's work in examining the effects of inherited evolutionary traits on human social behavior with an emphasis on the hold that territory has on man. In particular it demonstrates the influence of the drive to possess territory on such phenomena as property ownership and nation-building.&lt;ref name=ditext&gt;{{cite web| title=The Territorial Imperative| publisher=Digital Text International| accessdate=2012-03-24| url=http://www.ditext.com/ardrey/imperative/imperative.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Territorial Imperative'' further developed the nascent science of [[ethology]] and increased public interest in human origins.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;Hunt, George P. "Provocateur in Anthropology." ''Time'' 26 August 1966: 2. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeSept70Q"&gt;Graves, Ralph. "A 'Scientific Amateur' Expands his Territory." ''Time'' 11 September 1970: 1. Print: "Both of these books enjoyed, along with the scientific uproar they created, a wide general readership, and Ardrey, who describes himself as a 'scientific amateur,' today can claim major credit for having introduced the public to the new field of ethology, the study of animal behavior and its relationship to man."&lt;/ref&gt;

Like ''African Genesis'' it was also an international bestseller and saw translation into dozens of languages.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, Richard 2014"/&gt; It influenced several notable figures. [[Stanley Kubrick]] cited Ardrey as an inspiration for his films ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.&lt;ref name="KubrickClarkeErlichMiamiU"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.users.muohio.edu/erlichrd/350/odyssey.php |title= Strange Odyssey: From Dart to Ardrey to Kubrick and Clarke |author= Richard D.

==The Social Contract (1970)==
{{main article|The Social Contract (1970 book)}}
''The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder'' is the most controversial book of the ''Nature of Man'' series.&lt;ref name=Sci2&gt;Davis, Steve.

In particular it examined inherited characteristics' effects in determining hierarchy and inequality.&lt;ref name=SC&gt;Ardrey, Robert.

"Humans Act, Animals Behave: The Social Contract." ''The New York Times,'' 22 November 1970.

He also argued that the presence of inequality does not justify the domination of the weak by the strong.&lt;ref name=Sci2 /&gt; "Ardrey showed that in all societies at any level of the animal world, structures exist to protect the vulnerable, and that this is an evolutionary advantage as it protects diversity, diversity being essential for creativity."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Steve.

''The Social Contract'' continued Ardrey's refutation of cultural determinists through interwoven analyses of animal and human behavior. It also emphasized the importance of a reasoned respect for nature, foreshadowing the environmental concerns of ''The Hunting Hypothesis.''&lt;ref&gt;"The philosophy of the impossible has been the dominant motive in human affairs for the past two centuries. We have pursued the mastery of nature as if we ourselves were not a portion of that nature. We have boasted of our command over our physical environment while we ourselves have done our urgent best to destroy it." Ardrey, Robert (2014-05-15).

==The Hunting Hypothesis (1976)==
{{main article|The Hunting Hypothesis}}
''The Hunting Hypothesis: A Personal Conclusion Concerning the Evolutionary Nature of Man'' continued Ardrey's examination of the importance of inherited evolutionary traits. In particular it demonstrated the determinant force of traits that co-evolved in early man with hunting behavior.

At the time of publication, it was not even commonly accepted that early man were hunters, much less that hunting behavior influenced their evolution.&lt;ref&gt;"In Search of Human Origins Part Two." ''NOVA.'' Public Broadcasting Corporation. 10 June 1997. Transcript available [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2107hum2.html here].&lt;/ref&gt; Following publication of Ardrey's work this thesis gained support and eventually widespread acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;"Becoming Human Part 2." ''NOVA.'' Public Broadcasting Corporation. 31, August, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;"For decades researchers have been locked in debate over how and when hunting began and how big a role it played in human evolution. Recent analyses of human anatomy, stone tools and animal bones are helping to fill in the details of this game-changing shift in subsistence strategy. This evidence indicates that hunting evolved far earlier than some scholars had envisioned – and profoundly impacted subsequent human evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Kate. "[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-hunting-made-us-human/ How Hunting Made Us Human]". ''Scientific American,'' Volume 310, Issue 4. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hunting Hypothesis'' was also one of the first books to warn about [[climate change]] as a possible existential threat to mankind.&lt;ref name=Turnbull&gt;Turnbull, Colin M. "Just out of the Jungle: Hunting Hypothesis." ''The New York Times,'' 23 May 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hunting Hypothesis,'' with some exceptions, was remarkably well reviewed. The famed biologist and naturalist [[E. O. Wilson]], the noted anthropologist [[Colin Turnbull]], the acclaimed journalist [[Max Lerner]], and the noteworthy social scientist [[Roger Masters]], among others, all wrote effusive reviews.&lt;ref name=Turnbull&gt;Turnbull, Colin M.

Certain scholarly funding agencies make a distinction between [[research|investigators]] and '''new investigators'''. New investigators would be evaluated in a different way when competing for funding with more seasoned researchers, or they would be able to access funding resources specific to them. The rationale behind is to avoid the current trend that for certain [[grant (money)|grants]] the average age of the researchers receiving it for the first time keeps increasing over the years (See graph).&lt;ref&gt;[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/new_investigators/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

The formal definition of a new investigator varies with the funding agency. For example, for the [[NIH]], a new investigator is one that does not have a story of previous funding. Other organizations, such as the [[Alzheimer's Association]], consider a new investigator someone that is less than 10 years past their [[PhD]] degree. The [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] require a maximum of 60 months holding a full-time research appointment, and the [[Leukemia Research Foundation]] consider them to be within seven years of their first independent position. The [[Medical Research Council (UK)]] simply considers postdoctoral researchers in their first academic post.

The equivalent term '''Early Researcher''' (or Early Career Researcher) is also used in different ways, where for example, for the [[Australian Research Council]] it means someone that received a PhD or equivalent research doctorate within five years, or for the Ontario [[Ministry of Research and Innovation (Ontario)|Ministry of Research and Innovation]] must be an independent researcher within the first five years of the start of their independent academic research career.

Many journals have recognized the essential contributions and achievements of early researchers and highlited their profiles in different fomats. For instance the Nature research group journal [https://www.nature.com/commsbio/ Communications Biology] has lanuched a series for early career scientists, reporting some of the rising stars in all fields of biology throughout the year [https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0061-3].

'''''Ontogeny and Phylogeny''''' is a 1977 book on evolution by [[Stephen Jay Gould]], in which the author explores the relationship between embryonic development ([[ontogeny]]) and [[Evolution|biological evolution]] ([[phylogeny]]). Unlike his many popular books of essays, it was a technical book, and over the following decades it was influential in stimulating research into [[heterochrony]], changes in the timing of embryonic development, which had been neglected since [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s theory that [[Recapitulation theory|ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]] had been largely discredited.

==Context==

''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'' is [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s first technical book. He wrote that [[Ernst Mayr]] had suggested in passing that he write a book on development. Gould stated he "only began it as a practice run to learn the style of lengthy exposition before embarking on my magnum opus about macroevolution."&lt;ref name="Gould1977"&gt;{{cite book | title= Ontogeny and Phylogeny | author= Gould, S.J.| year=1977 | publisher=Belknap Press| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-63940-9| pages=vii–viii}} Also {{ISBN|0-674-63941-3}} (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt;  This later work was published in 2002 as ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''.

==Contents==

The first half of the book explores [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[Recapitulation theory|biogenetic law]] (recapitulation)—the largely discredited idea that embryonic developmental stages replay the evolutionary transitions of adult forms of an organism's past descendants—and how this idea influenced thinking in [[biology]], [[theology]], and [[psychology]].

The second half of the book details how modern concepts such as [[heterochrony]] (changes in developmental timing) and [[neoteny]] (the retardation of developmental expression or growth rates) influence [[macroevolution]] (major evolutionary transitions).

==Reception==

===Contemporary===
[[File:Haeckel vs von Baer.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|[[Ernst Haeckel]] supposed that embryonic development [[recapitulation theory|recapitulated]] an animal's phylogeny, and introduced heterochrony as an exception for individual organs. Modern biology agrees instead with [[Karl Ernst von Baer]]'s view that development itself varies, such as by changing the timing of different processes, to cause a branching phylogeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=B. K. |title=Evo-Devo: evolutionary developmental mechanisms |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |date=2003 |volume=47 |issue=7–8 |pages=491–495 |pmid=14756324}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

&lt;!--1978--&gt;The herpetologist [[David B. Wake]], in ''[[Paleobiology]]'', wrote that the topic was "at once so obviously important and so intrinsically difficult" that few people would tackle it. The parallelism that Haeckel noted between ontogeny and phylogeny was, Wake observed, a strong argument for evolution, but hardly anyone dared to discuss it. He called the book very good, and &lt;!--correctly--&gt;predicted that it would set the stage for "endless research", but found it also in a way unsatisfying, using "undigested theory from ecology to ''explain'' what is, as yet, unexplainable. Summing up, Wake calls the book "erudite, important, provocative, and controversial", but noted that it could have been much shorter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/wake/1978_Paleobiology_ontphyl.pdf Shape, form, development, ecology, genetics, and evolution] – by [[David B. Wake]], ''[[Paleobiology]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--1978--&gt;The embryologist [[Søren Løvtrup]], in ''Systematic Zoology'', noted that the book had two objectives, unexceptionably to gain practice, and "more dubious[ly]", to show that "in spite of the collapse of Haeckel's biogenetic law, the subject of parallels between ontogenesis and phylogenesis is still of importance to biology".&lt;ref name=Løvtrup1978&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2412825.pdf Book review] – by [[Søren Løvtrup]], ''Systematic Zoology'', 1978, vol 27, issue 1, pp. 125–130&lt;/ref&gt; In Løvtrup's view, this was because Haeckel's law had been refuted except where evolution had by chance happened to add to the end of development. Gould had little new to report, as people knew half a century earlier that development could be modified at other stages; the book was "a great disappointment." Haeckel could "of course be of historical interest" but Gould had chosen not to research Haeckel's influence. Work on "wrong theories" represented, Løvtrup wrote, "a terrible waste of effort and time, and block[ed] further progress."&lt;ref name=Løvtrup1978/&gt;

[[File:Human development neoteny body and head proportions pedomorphy maturation aging growth.png|thumb|Gould's suggestion of [[neoteny]] in human development provoked a hostile response from some anthropologists.&lt;ref name=Brace1978/&gt;]]

&lt;!--1978--&gt;The anthropologist [[C. Loring Brace]], in ''American Anthropologist'', noted that 2 years earlier, [[E. O. Wilson]]'s ''[[Sociobiology (book)|Sociobiology]]'' had with "woeful ignorance" strayed into anthropology, and Wilson's "bright young colleague" Gould had now done the same thing, possibly making trouble for years to come. Gould was "a wonderful writer, literate, erudite, gracefully witty, and gifted with the ability to present difficult material in a straightforward and easily readable fashion."&lt;ref name=Brace1978&gt;[https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/aa.1978.80.4.02a00510 Book review] – by [[C. Loring Brace]], ''American Anthropologist'', December 1978. DOI 10.1525/aa.1978.80.4.02a00510&lt;/ref&gt; 
The bulk of the book was fine, though of no interest to anthropologists. But the tenth chapter, "Retardation and Neoteny in Human Evolution", would "mislead a great many people" who would be unable to make an informed judgement about its conclusions. Gould " tums out to be just as much of a teleologist and progressivist as the scholars of previous generations whom he appraises so effectively. He notes that we associate “cute” features with mammals of higher intelligence, features that show 'the common traits of babyhood: relatively large eyes, short face, smooth features, bulbous cranium. The presence of this complex in ad- vanced adult mammals argues for neoteny' (Gould p.&amp;nbsp;350)."&lt;ref name=Brace1978/&gt; In Brace's view, "Gould's main thesis founders between the [[Scylla]] of mosaic evolution and the [[Charybdis]] of Darwinian theory."&lt;ref name=Brace1978/&gt; Brace concluded that Gould had provided "nothing more useful than the vision that human form can be understood by regarding 'man' as an overgrown retarded child."&lt;ref name=Brace1978/&gt;

&lt;!--1977--&gt;James Gorman, in ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that the book was rich but not easy to read; it was primarily for biologists, with long and precise arguments in technical language; a simpler account of the same topic was to be found in Gould's essay "Ever Since Darwin". Gorman called the book scholarly, entertaining and informative, expressed "with clarity and wit".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/09/home/gould-darwin.html The History of a Theory] – by James Gorman, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 November 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--1978--&gt;The zoologist [[A. J. Cain]], in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', called it "a superb analysis of the use of ontogenetic analogy, the controversies over ontogeny and phylogeny, and the classification of the different processes observable in comparing different ontogenies."&lt;ref name="Cain1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cain |first1=A. J. |title=Ontogenetic analogy |journal=Nature |date=27 April 1978 |volume=272 |issue=5656 |pages=758–759 | doi = 10.1038/272758a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a "massive book", excellently illustrated with often surprising examples, covering both the history and a functional interpretation of heterochrony. Cain found it refreshing to find someone who had a good word for Ernst Haeckel, and who did not "treat [[Charles Bonnet]] as a stupid monomaniac" but who brought out the relationship "between acquired characters and recapitulation in the work of the American neo-Lamarckians".&lt;ref name="Cain1978"/&gt;

===Retrospective===
[[File:Heterochrony.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|The book stimulated research into [[heterochrony]], a change in the timing or rate of any process in embryonic development.&lt;ref name=Barnes2014/&gt;]]

The evolutionary biologists Kenneth McNamara and Michael McKinney stated in 2005 that of all the books that Gould wrote in his career, "the one with the most impact is probably ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'' ... to say that this work is a hallmark in this area of evolutionary theory would be an understatement. It proved to be the catalyst for much of the future work in the field, and to a large degree was the inspiration for the modern field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]]. Gould's hope was to show that the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny is fundamental to evolution, and at its heart is a simple premise—that variations in the timing and rate of development provide the raw material upon which natural selection can operate."&lt;ref name="McNamara&amp;McKinney"&gt;{{cite book | title=Macroevolution: Diversity, Disparity, Contingency. Essays in Honor of Stephen Jay Gould | journal=Paleobiology | volume=31 | issue=2 | author=McNamara, K. J., &amp; McKinney, M.

M. Elizabeth Barnes, in ''The Embryo Project Encyclopedia'', looking back at the book in 2014, writes that it became widely cited in evolutionary and developmental biology, encouraging research on acceleration and retardation of development (forms of [[heterochrony]]), and investigation of paedomorphosis in human evolution. Barnes notes that "along with other work by Gould, such as '[[The Spandrels of San Marco|The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm]]' [the book] is often credited for influencing the rise of a biological approach called evolutionary developmental biology or evo-devo, which worked to integrate evolutionary and developmental biology."&lt;ref name=Barnes2014&gt;[https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/ontogeny-and-phylogeny-1977-stephen-jay-gould Ontogeny and Phylogeny] – by M.

'''Open-notebook science''' is the practice of making the entire primary record of a [[research project]] publicly available online as it is recorded. This involves placing the personal, or laboratory, [[lab notebook|notebook]] of the researcher online along with all raw and processed data, and any associated material, as this material is generated. The approach may be summed up by the slogan 'no insider information'. It is the [[logical extreme]] of [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]] approaches to research and explicitly includes the making available of failed, less significant, and otherwise unpublished experiments; so called 'dark data'.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/15-10/st_essay Freeing the Dark Data of Failed Scientific Experiments], Goetz, T., Wired Magazine, Sept.25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of open notebook science, although not the norm in the [[Academia|academic]] community, has gained significant recent attention in the research&lt;ref name="Sanderson, K 2008 273"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sanderson, K |title=Data on display |journal=Nature |date=September 2008 |doi=10.1038/455273a |pmid=18800097 |last2=Neylon |first2=C |authorlink2=Cameron Neylon |volume=455 |issue=7211 |pages=273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Singh, S. |title=Data on display |journal=Cell |date=April 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.04.003 |pmid=18423188 |volume=133 |issue=2 |pages=201–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and general&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="live science"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = A. | title = Internet-based tools for communication and collaboration in chemistry | doi = 10.1016/j.drudis.2008.03.015 | journal = Drug Discovery Today | volume = 13 | issue = 11–12 | pages = 502–506 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18549976| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; media as part of a general trend towards more open approaches in research practice and publishing. Open notebook science can therefore be described as part of a wider open science movement that includes the advocacy and adoption of [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] publication, [[open data]], [[crowdsourcing]] data, and [[citizen science]]. It is inspired in part by the success of [[open-source software]]&lt;ref name="oss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/science/84/8430sci1.html|title=Chemical &amp; Engineering News - Serving the chemical, life sciences and laboratory worlds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and draws on many of its ideas.

== History ==

The term "open-notebook science"&lt;ref name="proceedings"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bradley | first1 = J. C. | doi = 10.1038/npre.2007.39.1 | title = Open Notebook Science Using Blogs and Wikis | journal = Nature Precedings | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; was first used in 2006 in a blog post by [[Jean-Claude Bradley]], an Associate Professor of Chemistry at [[Drexel University]] at the time. Bradley described open-notebook science as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drexel-coas-elearning.blogspot.com/2006/09/open-notebook-science.html |title=Open Notebook Science |work=Drexel CoAS E-Learning |first =Jean-Claude |last=Bradley |author-link=Jean-Claude Bradley |date=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|... there is a URL to a laboratory notebook that is freely available and indexed on common search engines.

==Benefits ==
A public laboratory notebook makes it convenient to cite the exact instances of experiments used to support arguments in articles.  For example, in a paper on the optimization of a [[Ugi reaction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bradley, Jean-Claude |author2=Mirza, Khalid |author3=Owens, Kevin |author4=Osborne, Tom |author5=Williams, Antony  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Optimization of the Ugi reaction using parallel synthesis and automated liquid handling |journal=Nature Precedings|date=August 2008 |hdl=10101/npre.2008.2237.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paper03"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/paper03|title=UsefulChem - paper03|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; three different batches of product are used in the characterization and each spectrum references the specific experiment where each batch was used: EXP099,&lt;ref name="EXP099"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/EXP099|title=UsefulChem - EXP099|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; EXP203&lt;ref name="EXP203"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/EXP203|title=UsefulChem - EXP203|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and EXP206.&lt;ref name="EXP206"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/EXP206|title=UsefulChem - EXP206|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was subsequently published in the [[Journal of Visualized Experiments]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bradley, Jean-Claude |author2=Mirza, Khalid |author3=Owens, Kevin |author4=Osborne, Tom |author5=Williams, Antony  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Optimization of the Ugi reaction using parallel synthesis and automated liquid handling |journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments|date=November 2008 |url=http://www.jove.com/index/details.stp?ID=942|doi=10.3791/942 |pmid=19066532 |issue=21 |pmc=2762777 |pages=942}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that the integrity data provenance can be maintained from lab notebook to final publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Without further qualifications, Open Notebook Science implies that the research is being reported on an ongoing basis without unreasonable delay or filter.  This enables others to understand exactly how research actually happens within a field or a specific research group. Such information could be of value to collaborators, prospective students or future employers.  Providing access to selective notebook pages or inserting an embargo period would be inconsistent with the meaning of the term "Open" in this context.  Unless error corrections, failed experiments and ambiguous results are reported, it will not be possible for an outside observer to understand exactly how science is being done.  Terms such as Pseudo&lt;ref name="pseudoONS"&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/pontiff/2008/06/pseudo_open_notebook_science.php Bacon, David Pseudo Open Notebook Science? from Quantum Pontiff June 26, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  or Partial&lt;ref name="partialONS"/&gt;  have been used as qualifiers for the sharing of laboratory notebook information in a selective way or with a significant delay.

==Drawbacks ==
The arguments against adopting Open Notebook Science fall mainly into three categories which have differing importance in different fields of science. The primary concern, expressed particularly by biological and medical scientists is that of '[[data theft]]' or 'being scooped'. While the degree to which research groups steal or adapt the results of others remains a subject of debate it is certainly the case that the fear of not being first to publish drives much behaviour, particularly in some fields. This is related to the focus in these fields on the published peer reviewed paper as being the main metric of career success.

The second argument advanced against Open Notebook Science is that it constitutes prior publication, thus making it impossible to [[patentability|patent]] and difficult to publish the results in the traditional [[peer review]]ed literature. With respect to patents, publication on the web is clearly [[Patent infringement|classified as disclosure]]. Therefore, while there may be arguments over the value of patents, and approaches that get around this problem, it is clear that Open Notebook Science is not appropriate for research for which patent protection is an expected and desired outcome. With respect to publication in the peer reviewed literature the case is less clear cut. Most publishers of scientific journals accept material that has previously been presented at a conference or in the form of a preprint. Those publishers that accept material that has been previously published in these forms have generally indicated informally that web publication of data, including Open Notebook Science, falls into this category. Open notebook projects have been successfully published in high [[impact factor]] peer reviewed journals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woelfle|first=Michael|last2=Seerden |first2=Jean-Paul |last3=de Gooijer |first3=Jesse |last4=Pouwer |first4=Kees |last5=Olliaro |first5=Piero |last6=Todd |first6=Matthew H.|title=Resolution of Praziquantel|journal=PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases|date=19 September 2011|volume=5|issue=9|pages=e1260|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001260|pmid=21949890|pmc=3176743|editor1-last=Geary|editor1-first=Timothy G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woelfle|first=Michael |author2=Olliaro, Piero |author3=Todd, Matthew H.|title=Open science is a research accelerator|journal=Nature Chemistry|date=22 September 2011|volume=3|issue=10|pages=745–748|doi=10.1038/nchem.1149|pmid=21941234|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this has not been tested with a wide range of publishers. It is to be expected that those publishers that explicitly exclude these forms of pre-publication will not accept material previously disclosed in an open notebook.

The final argument relates to the problem of the 'data deluge'. If the current volume of the peer reviewed literature is too large for any one person to manage, then how can anyone be expected to cope with the huge quantity of non peer reviewed material that could potentially be available, especially when some, perhaps most, would be of poor quality? A related argument is that 'my notebook is too specific' for it to be of interest to anyone else. The question of how to discover high quality and relevant material is a related issue. The issue of curation and validating data and methodological quality is a serious issue and one that arguably has relevance beyond Open Notebook Science but is a particular challenge here.

A '''preference test''' is an experiment in which animals are allowed free access to multiple environments which differ in one or more ways.  Various aspects of the animal's behaviour can be measured with respect to the alternative environments, such as latency and frequency of entry, duration of time spent, range of activities observed, or relative consumption of a goal object in the environment. These measures can be recorded either by the experimenter or by motion detecting software.&lt;ref name="Cunningham, (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cunningham | first1 = C. | last2 = Gremel | first2 = C. | last3 = Groblewski | first3 = P. | year = 2006 | title = Drug-induced conditioned place preference and aversion in mice | url = | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 1662–1670 | doi=10.1038/nprot.2006.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strength of preference can be inferred by the magnitude of the difference in the response, but see "Advantages and disadvantages" below. Statistical testing is used to determine whether observed differences in such measures support the conclusion that preference or aversion has occurred.   Prior to testing, the animals are usually given the opportunity to explore the environments to [[Habituation|habituate]] and reduce the effects of novelty.

Preference tests can be used to test for preferences of only one characteristic of an environment, e.g. cage colour, or multiple characteristics e.g. a choice between [[hamster wheel]], [[Habitrail]] tunnels or additional empty space for extended locomotion.&lt;ref name="Sherwin, (1998)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | year = 1998 | title = The use and perceived importance of three resources which provide caged laboratory mice the opportunity of extended locomotion | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 353–367 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(97)00049-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of test ==

=== Two choices ===
The simplest of preference tests offers a choice between two alternatives.  This can be done by putting different goal boxes at the ends of the arms of a [[T-maze|'T' shaped maze]], or having a chamber divided in into differing halves.  A famous example of this simple method is an investigation of the preferences of [[chickens]] for different types of wire floor in [[battery cages]].  Two types of metal mesh flooring were being used in the 1950s; one type was a large, open mesh using thick wire, the other was a smaller mesh size but the wire was considerably thinner.  A prestigious committee, the Brambell Committee, conducting an investigation into farm animal welfare&lt;ref name="Thorpe, (1965)"&gt;Thorpe, W.H., (1965).  The assessment of pain and distress in animals. Appendix III in report of the technical committee to enquire into the welfare of animals kept under intensive husbandry conditions, F.W.R.Brambell (chairman). H.M.S.O., London&lt;/ref&gt; concluded the thicker mesh should be used as this was likely to be more comfortable for the chickens.  However, preference tests showed that chickens preferred the thinner wire.  Photographs taken from under the cages showed that the thinner mesh offered more points of contact for the feet than the thick mesh, thereby spreading the load on the hens' feet and presumably feeling more comfortable to the birds.

=== Multiple choices ===
The number of choices that can be offered is theoretically limitless for some preference tests, e.g., light intensity, cage size, food types; however, the number is often limited by experimental practicalities, current practice (e.g., animal caging systems) or costs.  Furthermore, animals usually investigate all areas of the apparatus in a behaviour called "information gathering", even those with minor preference, so the more choices that are available may dilute the data on the dominant preference(s).

=== Choices with a cost ===
{{main article|Consumer demand tests (animals)}} 
Most preference tests involve no 'cost' for making a choice, so they do not indicate the strength of an animals motivation or need to obtain the outcome of the choice.  For example, if a laboratory mouse is offered three sizes of cage space it may prefer one of them, but this choice does not indicate whether the mouse 'needs' that particular space, or whether it has a relatively slight preference for it. To measure an animals motivation toward a choice one may perform a "consumer demand test." In this sort of test, the choice involves some "cost" to the animal, such as physical effort (e.g., lever pressing, weighted door).

== Uses ==

Preference tests have been used widely in the study of animal behaviour and motivation, e.g.:

=== Animal housing and husbandry ===
* Colour of cages for laboratory mice&lt;ref name="Sherwin and Glenn, (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Glen | first2 = E.F. | year = 2003 | title = Cage colour preferences and effects of home-cage colour on anxiety in laboratory mice | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 1085–1092 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2003.2286}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Desire to self-select [[anxiolytic|stress-reducing drugs]] in barren cages&lt;ref name="Sherwin and Olsson, (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Olsson | first2 = I.A.S. | year = 2004 | title = Housing conditions affect self-administration of anxiolytic by laboratory mice | url = | journal = Animal Welfare | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 33–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensory capacities ===
* Illumination preferences and sensory capacity of [[Domesticated turkey|turkeys]]&lt;ref name="Moinard and Sherwin, (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moinard | first1 = C. | last2 = Sherwin | first2 = C.M. | year = 1999 | title = Turkeys prefer fluorescent light with supplementary ultraviolet radiation | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 261–267 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(99)00043-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal welfare ===
* Cognitive bias studies&lt;ref name="Harding et al., (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harding | first1 = E.J. | last2 = Paul | first2 = E.S | last3 = Mendl | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Animal Behaviour: Cognitive bias and affective state | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = | page = 312 | doi =  10.1038/427312a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal communication ===
* Social learning&lt;ref name="Sherwin et al., (2002)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Heyes | first2 = C.M. | last3 = Nicol | first3 =  | year = 2002 | title = Social learning influences the preferences of domestic hens for novel food | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 933–942 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2002.2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human pharmacology ===
* The [[radial arm maze]] has been used to assess how drugs affect memory performance. It has also been shown to be responsive in distinguishing the cognitive affects of an array of toxicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2902540 |year=1988 |last1=Levin |first1=ED |title=Psychopharmacological effects in the radial-arm maze |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=169–75 |journal=[[Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews]] |doi=10.1016/S0149-7634(88)80008-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preferences of wild animals ===
* There have been relatively few studies on the preferences of wild animals.  A recent study has shown that [[feral pigeon]]s do not discriminate drinking water according to its content of metabolic wastes, such as [[uric acid]] or [[urea]] (mimicking faeces- or urine-pollution by birds or mammals respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Olah G, Rózsa L | title=Nitrogen metabolic wastes do not influence drinking water preference in feral pigeons| format=pdf| journal=[[Acta Zoologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae]]| year=2006| volume=52|issue=4|pages= 401–406| url=http://www.zoologia.hu/list/olah_rozsa.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

=== Advantages ===
* A major advantage of preference tests is that we can gain objective data about animal motivation from the animal's perspective (largely) without being influenced by [[Anthropomorphic|attributing human emotions]] or [[Anthropocentric|human senses]] to the animals.

=== Disadvantages and limitations ===
* Preference tests give an indication only of relative preferences for the offered variants, not the absolute need for any of the variants. This can be overcome by placing costs on gaining access to the variants&lt;ref name="Dawkins, (1983)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dawkins | first1 = M.S. | year = 1983 | title = Battery hens name their price: consumer demand theory and the measurement of ethological 'needs' | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 1195–1205 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(83)80026-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;(see above).
* Animals can only make a choice between the variants offered. These might be limited by our current understanding of the animals' motivations and senses.
* Some variants may offer substitutability of use.  For example, offering semi-aquatic [[mink]] a bath of water means the water can be used for swimming, drinking and washing, rather than just one activity ''per se''.&lt;ref name="Mason et al., (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mason | first1 = G. | last2 = Cooper | first2 = J. | last3 = Clarebrough | first3 = C. | year = 2001 | title = The welfare of fur-farmed mink | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 410 | issue = | pages = 35–36 | doi=10.1038/35065157 | pmid=11242031}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Preference tests sometimes allow access to the variants outside of the testing period ('open economy'), thereby allowing compensatory access outside of the period of observation.  More rigorous studies prevent this access ('closed economy').
* It can be difficult to account for minority preferences.  For example, consider the duration of human occupation of rooms in a house as an indication of preference.  We probably occupy the [[living room]] and [[bedroom]] for the greatest durations of time, indicating these are the most preferred rooms; however, although we probably spend least time in the [[bathroom]], making it the minority preference, this does not necessarily mean the bathroom is the least preferred room at all times of the day, i.e. minority preference can be important.
* Preferences can vary throughout the day.  Well designed studies can account for this complication.
* Animals sometimes behave for proximate considerations rather than ultimate [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. For example, a dog which has had a painful visit to the vet may prefer not to go to the vet subsequently even though it will ultimately benefit the dog's health.
* 'Inappropriate' responses.  This happens particularly when the animals have not evolved appropriate responses to the offered variants.  For example, rats will show a preference for [[saccharin]] solution compared to unadulterated water.&lt;ref name="Tordoff et al., (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tordoff | first1 = M.G. | last2 = Alarcon | first2 = L.K. | last3 = Lawler | first3 = M.P. | year = 2008 | title = Preferences of 14 rat strains for 17 taste compounds | url = | journal = Physiology and Behavior | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 308–332 | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.06.010 | pmc = 2642481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the saccharin has been designed to taste as if it contains nutrients (sugars) although it does not.

The '''privileged positions of business and science''' refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge and the ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

== Privileged position of business ==

Businesses have considerable power in decision-making processes in business-oriented societies. High level executives make discrete decisions about technological innovation without regard to consequences. Political scientist Edward Woodhouse states that businesses make key economic decisions that include creating jobs, choosing industrial plant and equipment, and deciding which new products to develop and market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, businesses hold a privileged position related to politics in the sense that they are capable of considerable influence over key public choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership role that business has in the economy gives executives of large corporations an unusual kind of degree of influence over governmental policy making.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government officials have incentives to carry out businesses' demands. They know that failure of businesses to maintain high employment will upset voters more quickly than anything else.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Our economy functions as a chain effect. Businesses that get what they want provide plentiful jobs and stimulate cash flow in the economy. As a result, citizens are happy, and this happiness translates to more trust and faith in the government party. Government officials thus have a higher chance of reelection.

It is clear that the businesses have the most influence in this chain effect. If a business fails, jobs are lost, citizens are unhappy, and the government party loses trust and their chance of reelection. One example of this was President Bush’s plummeting popularity and resulting defeat by Bill Clinton.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Therefore, it would make sense for government officials to reach out to these executives and provide valuable resources to benefit both parties. Power is shifted from government officials to business executives, because these executives have the ability to influence government officials to meet their demands. As a result, a large category of decisions is turned over to businessmen, and taken off the agenda of government. In a way, business managers become the public officials they represent.

This privilege of power is unique to corporations only. If workers want reform on unfair working conditions or pay, they must form a worker’s union. However, a worker’s union has considerably less influence than a corporation. As opposed to workers’ unions, businesses exercise more control on governmental policy making because workers are expendable – workers need money more urgently than society needs their services, so a business can operate for a lot longer than workers can afford to stay off the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privileged position of science ==

Without the knowledge of scientists and technologists, there would be no possibility of producing new technology and progress in a positive manner. Those who have these types of  knowledge and abilities are essentially the "seed" of technological innovation. They have the following three privileges:

*Knowledge
*Learning and teaching of new knowledge 
*Political implications of innovation

Based on previous scientific knowledge, one or several are able to use it and/or build on it to innovate. Kleinman and Vallas, point out that scientists control the modification, mediation and contest of emerging knowledge.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with this knowledge can also teach future generations the same to keep this process moving forward. Woodhouse that states that engineers are among the top professionals that promote the new innovations without consequences.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|1997|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the foundation of the privileged position of science, that only a select have scientific and/or technological knowledge and capable of substantial feats, good or bad. Engineers and scientists have the powerful position of being able to choose the path of innovation for emerging technology. Technologists and scientists hold a privileged position additionally in that their innovations often have political implications. Woodhouse makes the comparison of innovation to legislative acts, stating that they both establish a framework that will follow for many generations.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"/&gt;

== Relationships between privileged positions of business and science ==

Business and science are part of an important societal circle specifically relating to the production and implementation of technology. In simple terms, scientists and technologists design and create, while businesses provide the means to create, produce and implement. As Woodhouse claims, it would be a mistake to overlook business executives' and elected officials' dependence on the technologists because innovation is so highly regarded.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"/&gt;

Businesses that rely on scientists and technologists cannot function without them, but have authority over them. Woodhouse claims that the one reason green technology has not emerged faster and stronger is because the brown chemistry formula fulfilled many of the needs of scientists and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, since brown chemistry was innovated over less toxic and recyclable green technologies, it is shown that business has more authority over that of technologists and scientists. Woodhouse points out that there has been considerable delay on a promising area of green chemistry: supercritical fluids. The opinions range from targeting the culprit as the complexity of the equipment, to maintenance difficulties, to the equipment costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the interconnection of business and science, and how technology can be slowed by technology and/or business (and vice versa). Woodhouse also states that twentieth-century chemists, chemical engineers, and chemical industry executives made central decisions which considerably modeled society's experiences with chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical industry, which includes scientists, technologists, and businessmen, uniquely controls what happens or what can happen to large number of people who are exposed to chemicals.

Business and science are considered of utmost importance in current developed countries. However, one working without the other has the potential to cause major issues. Woodhouse points out what the vice president of Shaw Carpets explained at a congressional hearing: that the V.P. is the person whose job it is to tell the chemists and chemical engineers that it is possible to produce carpets using "green" processes, because the students had not learned this from their respective university curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be many positive outcomes of the unison operation of business and science, and it is vital that this does occur in order to prevent major problems and unintended consequences.

A '''probe tip''' in scanning microscopy literally is a very sharp piece of metal or non-metal, like a sewing needle with a point at one end with nano or sub-nanometer order of dimension. It can interact with up to one molecule or atom of a given surface of a sample that can reveal authentic properties of the surface such as morphology, topography, mapping and electrical properties of a single atom or molecule on the surface of the sample.

The proliferation of the thrust in probe-based tools began after the invention of [[Scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) and [[Atomic force microscopy]] (AFM) (collectively called [[Scanning probe microscopy]]-SPM) by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at the IBM Zurich research laboratory in 1982.&lt;ref name="Binnig et al 1982"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Binnig |first=G. |last2=Rohrer |first2=H. |last3=Gerber |first3=Ch. |last4=Weibel |first4=E. |date=1982-07-05 |title=Surface Studies by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=57–61 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid10033323&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.930 |pmid=10033323 |title=Atomic Force Microscope |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=56 |issue=9 |pages=930–933 |year=1986 |last1=Binnig |first1=G |last2=Quate |first2=C.

The utilization of sharp probe tips enabled us to see the inside the microscopic world from within the macroscopic world.

The significant number of applications for the topographic surface characterization of the materials and biological specimen in various fields of science made researchers and scientists that it is imperative for reproducible mass production of probe tip with sharp apex.

Probe tip size and shape in [[microscopy]] are important parameters providing direct connection between resolution and imaging quality. Resolution and imaging mechanism may depend on geometry (length, width, shape, aspect ratio, and tip apex radius) and composition (material properties) of tip and surface being probed.

Here, we describe fabrication, characterization and application of sharp tips. A wide range of tip fabrication techniques including cutting, grinding, pulling, beam deposition, ion milling, controlled crashing, field emission, field evaporation, fracture and electrochemical etching/polishing are discussed. Both limitations and advantages are also provided for various tip fabrication method. We also describe history and development, working principles, characterization and applications with recent advancement of sharp tips.

== History and development ==
The discovery of a sharp probe tip has always been of significant interest among the researchers considering its importance in the material, life and biological sciences for mapping the surface structure and material properties at molecular or atomic dimension. The history of tip can be tracked long back in nineteenth century during the invention of [[Phonautograph]] in 1859. Phonautograph is the predecessor of modern [[Phonograph|gramophone]]. It was invented by Scott and Koenig. It consisted of a parchment diaphragm with an attached stylus (sort of a pen-holder), along with a Hog’s hair, which was used to trace a wavy line on a lamp-blacked surface [Musical mirror by Bryceson, Richard, Jan. 1929-Dec.1930]. In the later development gramophone came out where along with other replacements, the Hog’s hair was replaced by a needle to reproduce sound [Musical mirror by Bryceson, Richard, Jan. 1929-Dec.1930]. In 1940, a pantograph was built utilizing a shielded probe and adjustable tip. A [[stylus]] was free to slide vertically to be in contact with the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.1769778 |title=A Scanning Device for Plotting Equipotential Lines |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |volume=12 |pages=37 |year=1941 |last1=Simpson |first1=John A }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, a tip was employed in probe circuit to measure peak voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1049/ji-1.1948.0064 |title=The measurement of peak voltage at a frequency of 600 Mc/s by means of a modified probe circuit |journal=Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers - Part I: General |volume=95 |issue=87 |pages=133–134 |year=1948 |last1=Bowdler |first1=G.W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fabrication of electrochemically etched sharp tungsten, copper, nickel and molybdenum tip was reported by Muller in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Müller |first=Erwin W. |date=1937-09-01 |title=Elektronenmikroskopische Beobachtungen von Feldkathoden |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik |language=de |volume=106 |issue=9–10 |pages=541–550 |doi=10.1007/BF01339895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution for sharp tips occurred in producing a good and various kind of tip with different shape, size, aspect ratio composed of tungsten wire, silicon, diamond, [[Carbon nanotube]] etc. occurred with Si-based circuit technologies. This allowed tips for numerous applications in the broad spectrum of nanotechnological fields. Following STM&lt;ref name="Binnig et al 1982"/&gt; invention came [[Atomic force microscopy]] (AFM)&lt;ref name=pmid10033323/&gt; by [[Gerd Binnig]], Calvin F. Quate, and Christoph Gerber in 1986. In their instrument they used diamond broken piece as tip sticking it to a hand-cut gold foil [[cantilever]]. Focused ion and electron beam technique for the fabrication of strong, stable, reproducible Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; pyramidal tip with 1.0 μm length and 0.1 μm diameter was reported by Russell in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1992-07-01 |title=Microfabrication of AFM tips using focused ion and electron beam techniques |journal=Ultramicroscopy |volume=42-44 |pages=1526–1532 |doi=10.1016/0304-3991(92)90477-2 |last1=Ximen |first1=Hongyu |last2=Russell |first2=Phillip E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground breaking advancement came through the introduction of microfabrication methods for the fabrication of precised conical or pyramidal silicon and silicon nitride tip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1116/1.576520 |title=Microfabrication of cantilever styli for the atomic force microscope |journal=Journal of Vacuum Science &amp; Technology A: Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=3386–3396 |year=1990 |last1=Albrecht |first1=T.

Multifunctional hydrogel nano-probe technique uncovered new scope initiating a completely new concept to the fabrication of tip and their extended ease of applicability to inorganic and biological samples in both air and liquid. The biggest advantage of this mechanical method is that the tip can be made in different shape e.g. hemispherical, embedded spherical, pyramidal, and distorted pyramidal etc. with diameter ranging from 10&amp;nbsp;nm – 1000&amp;nbsp;nm for applications including [[Topography]] or functional imaging, force spectroscopy on soft matter, biological, chemical and physical [[Sensor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lee |first=Jae Seol |last2=Song |first2=Jungki |last3=Kim |first3=Seong Oh |last4=Kim |first4=Seokbeom |last5=Lee |first5=Wooju |last6=Jackman |first6=Joshua A. |last7=Kim |first7=Dongchoul |last8=Cho |first8=Nam-Joon |last9=Lee |first9=Jungchul |date=2016-05-20 |title=Multifunctional hydrogel nano-probes for atomic force microscopy |journal=Nature Communications |volume=7 |page=11566 |doi=10.1038/ncomms11566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Table 1.

== Tunneling current and force measurement principle ==
The tip itself does not have any working principle for imaging, but depending on the instrumentation, mode of application, and the nature of the sample under investigation, the probe tip may follow different principle to image the surface of the sample. For example, when a tip is integrated with STM, it measures the tunneling current that arises from the interaction between the sample and the tip.&lt;ref name="Binnig et al 1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tersoff &amp; Hamann 1983"/&gt; In AFM, short-ranged force deflection during the raster scan by tip across the surface is measured.&lt;ref name=pmid10033323/&gt; A conductive tip is essential for the STM instrumentation whereas AFM can use conductive&lt;ref name=pmid18654521/&gt;&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.117179 |title=Imaging the local electrical properties of metal surfaces by atomic force microscopy with conducting probes |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=69 |issue=13 |pages=1975–1977 |year=1996 |last1=Houzé |first1=F |last2=Meyer |first2=R |last3=Schneegans |first3=O |last4=Boyer |first4=L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-conductive&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kaiser |first=Uwe |last2=Schwarz |first2=Alexander |last3=Wiesendanger |first3=Roland |date=2007-03 |title=Magnetic exchange force microscopy with atomic resolution |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue=7135 |pages=522–5 |doi=10.1038/nature05617 |pmid=17392782 }}&lt;/ref&gt; prob tip.

=== Conductive probe tip ===
Somewhat, the name implies STM utilizes tunneling charge transfer principle from tip to surface or vice versa thereby recording the current response. This concept originates from particle in a box concept, that is, if potential energy for a particle is small, electron may be found outside of potential well which is a classically forbidden region. This phenomenon is called tunneling.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199589494.003.0001 |chapter=Introduction |title=Principles of Electron Tunneling Spectroscopy ''Second'' Edition |pages=1–22 |year=2011 |last1=Wolf |first1=E. L |isbn=9780199589494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expression derived from Schrodinger equation for transmission charge transfer probability is as follow:

&lt;math&gt;T=16\epsilon(1-\epsilon)^{-2k}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \frac{E}{V} = \text{Kinetic energy/potential energy}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;k = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{h}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]]

=== Non-conductive probe tip ===
Non-conductive nano-scale tips are widely used for AFM measurements. For non-conducting tip, surface forces acting on the tip/cantilever, are responsible for deflection or attraction of tip.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0014-5793(96)00651-5 |title=In situ observation of streptavidin-biotin binding on an immunoassay well surface using an atomic force microscope |journal=FEBS Letters |volume=390 |issue=2 |pages=161–164 |year=1996 |last1=Allen |first1=S |last2=Davies |first2=J |last3=Dawkes |first3=A.C |last4=Davies |first4=M.C |last5=Edwards |first5=J.C |last6=Parker |first6=M.C |last7=Roberts |first7=C.J |last8=Sefton |first8=J |last9=Tendler |first9=S.J.B |last10=Williams |first10=P.M }}&lt;/ref&gt; These attractive or repulsive forces are used for surface topology, chemical specifications, magnetic and electronic properties.

Tip fabrication techniques fall generally in any two classifications: mechanical and physicochemical. In the early stage of development of probe tips, mechanical procedures were popular because of ease of fabrication. One of mechanical method for the fabrication of hydrogel tip will be discussed in detail.

Grinding a metal wire/rod into a sharp tip was also a method used.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; These mechanical procedures usually leave rugged surface with many tiny asperities protruding from the apex which lead to atomic resolution on flat surface. However, irregular shape and large macroscopic radius of curvature result in poor reproducibility and decreased stability especially for probing rough surfaces. Another main disadvantage of making probe by this method is it yields many mini tips which lead to many different signals yielding error in imaging.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Gobind |first=Basnet, |title=Fabrication of Tungsten Tips Suitable for Scanning Probe Microscopy by Electrochemical Etching Methods |date=2013 |publisher=University of Arkansas, Fayetteville |url=http://scholarworks.uark.edu/etd/865/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cutting, grinding and pulling procedures can only be adapted for metallic tips like W, Ag, Pt, Ir, Pt-Ir and gold. Non-metallic tips cannot be fabricated by these methods.

On other hand a sophisticated mechanical method for tip fabrication is based on hydro-gel method.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This method is based on bottom-up strategy to make probe tips by molecular self-assembly process. First, cantilever is formed in mold by curing pre-polymer solution then it is brought into contact with mold of tip which contains pre-polymer solution. The polymer is cured with ultraviolet light which helps firmly attachment of cantilever with probe. This fabrication method is shown in Fig. 2.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Physio-chemical procedures ===
Physiochemical procedures are fabrication methods of choice these days which yield extremely sharp and symmetric tips with more reproducibility compared to mechanical fabrication-based tips. Among physicochemical method, the electrochemical etching method&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; is one of the most popular method. Etching is two or more steps procedure. The “zone electropolishing” is the second step which further sharpens the tip in a very controlled manner. Other physicochemical methods include chemical vapor deposition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cheung |first=Chin Li |last2=Hafner |first2=Jason H. |last3=Lieber |first3=Charles M. |date=2000-04-11 |title=Carbon nanotube atomic force microscopy tips: Direct growth by chemical vapor deposition and application to high-resolution imaging |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=97 |issue=8 |pages=3809–13 |doi=10.1073/pnas.050498597 |pmid=10737761|pmc=18098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; electron beam deposition onto pre-existing tips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Martinez |first=J. |last2=Yuzvinsky |first2=T.

==== Fabrication through etching ====
Electrochemical etching is one of the easiest, inexpensive, most practical, reliable and most widely accepted metallic probe tip fabrication method with desired quality and reproducibility.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Three commonly used electrochemical etching for tungsten tip fabrication are: single lamella drop-off methods,&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; double lamella drop-off method&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and submerged method.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1116/1.589029 |title=Preparation of sharp polycrystalline tungsten tips for scanning tunneling microscopy imaging |journal=Journal of Vacuum Science &amp; Technology B: Microelectronics and Nanometer Structures |volume=14 |pages=1 |year=1996 |last1=Zhang |first1=R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various cone shape tips can be fabricated by this method by minor changes in the experimental setup. An DC potential between tip and metallic electrode (usually W wire) immersed in solution (Figure 3 a-c). Electrochemical reactions at cathode and anode in basic solutions (2M KOH or 2M NaOH) are usually used.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The overall etching process involved is written here:

Anode;

&lt;chem&gt;W (s) + 8OH- -&gt; WO4 + 4H2O + 6e- (E= 1.05V)&lt;/chem&gt;

Cathode:

&lt;chem&gt;6H2O + 6e- -&gt; 3H2 + 6OH- (E=-2.48V)&lt;/chem&gt;

Overall:

&lt;chem&gt;W (s) + 2OH- -&gt; WO4^2- + 2H2O (l) + 6e- + 3H2 (g) (E= -1.43V)&lt;/chem&gt;

Here, all the potentials are reported vs. SHE.

[[File:Etching drop.png|thumb|Fig. 3: Schematics of fabrication method of probe tip through electrochemical etching method.]]

Schematics of fabrication method of probe tip through electrochemical etching method is shown in Fig. 3.

Experimental setup for Electrochemical etching is shown in Fig. 3a.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lee |first=Chanwoo |last2=Kim |first2=Sung Tae |last3=Jeong |first3=Byeong Geun |last4=Yun |first4=Seok Joon |last5=Song |first5=Young Jae |last6=Lee |first6=Young Hee |last7=Park |first7=Doo Jae |last8=Jeong |first8=Mun Seok |date=2017-01-13 |title=Tip-Enhanced Raman Scattering Imaging of Two-Dimensional Tungsten Disulfide with Optimized Tip Fabrication Process |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |page=40810 |doi=10.1038/srep40810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different tips fabricated from etching method with different tip radius and angle is illustrated in Fig. 3(b-e).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

In electrochemical etching process, W is etched at liquid, solid and air interface (due to surface tension), as shown in Fig. 3. Etching is called static if W wire is kept stationary. Once the tip is etched, lower part falls due to the lower tensile strength than the weight of lower part of wire. The irregular shape is produced by the shifting of meniscus. However, slow etching rate can produce regular tips which controlling current slowly through electrochemical cell. The dynamic etching involves slowly pulling up the wire from solution or sometimes it is moved up and down (oscillating wire) producing smooth tips.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== Submerged method ====
In this method a metal wire is vertically etched reducing the diameter from 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm ~ 20&amp;nbsp;nm. Schematic diagram for probe tip fabrication with submerged electrochemical etching method is illustrated in Fig 4. These tips can be used for high quality STM images.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;
[[File:Submerged Method.png|thumb|Fig. 4: Schematic diagram for probe tip fabrication with submerged electrochemical etching method (W wire)]]

==== Lamella method ====
In double lamella method the lower part of metal is etched away, and upper part of tip was not etched further.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Further etching of the upper part of wire is prevented by covering it with a polymer coating. This method is usually limited to laboratory fabrication.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Double lamella method schematic is shown in Fig. 5.
[[File:Double-Lamella.png|thumb|Fig. 5: A typical double-lamella drop-off electrochemical etching set up]]

=== Single atom tip preparation ===
Transitions metals like Cu, Au and Ag adsorbs single molecules linearly on their surface due to weak van der Waals forces.&lt;ref name=pmid19713523/&gt; This linear projection of single molecule allows interaction of terminal atom of tip with atom of substrate resulting in Pauli repulsion for single molecule or atom mapping studies. Gases deposition on tip is carried out in an ultrahigh vacuum (5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; mbar) chamber at a low temperature (10K). Deposition of Xe, Kr, NO, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or CO &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.4934273 |title=CO tip functionalization in subatomic resolution atomic force microscopy |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=107 |issue=16 |pages=163109 |year=2015 |last1=Kim |first1=Minjung |last2=Chelikowsky |first2=James R }}&lt;/ref&gt; on tip have been successfully prepared and used for imaging studies. However, these tips preparation rely on attachment of single atom or molecule on tip and resulting atomic structure of tip is not known exactly.&lt;ref name=pmid22984067/&gt;&lt;ref name=":37"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Jun |last2=Chen |first2=Pengcheng |last3=Yuan |first3=Bingkai |last4=Ji |first4=Wei |last5=Cheng |first5=Zhihai |last6=Qiu |first6=Xiaohui |date=2013-11-01 |title=Real-Space Identification of Intermolecular Bonding with Atomic Force Microscopy |journal=Science |volume=342 |issue=6158 |pages=611–614 |doi=10.1126/science.1242603 |pmid=24072819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probability of attachment of simple molecule on metals surface is very tedious and required great skills. Therefore, this method is not ubiquitous and not many laws are able to perform these experiments.

=== Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) ===
Sharp tips used in SPM are fragile and prone to damage and wear and tear easily under high working load. Diamond is considered the best option to address this issue.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.118173 |title=Fabrication of small diamond tips for scanning probe microscopy application |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=435–437 |year=1997 |last1=Oesterschulze |first1=E |last2=Scholz |first2=W |last3=Mihalcea |first3=Ch |last4=Albert |first4=D |last5=Sobisch |first5=B |last6=Kulisch |first6=W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond tips for SPM application are fabricated by fracture of bulk diamond, grinding and polishing diamond.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; But, these methods result in considerable loss of diamond. Other strategy to prevent this loss is coating of Silicone tips with thin diamond film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.1143265 |title=Diamond force microscope tips fabricated by chemical vapor deposition |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |volume=63 |issue=9 |pages=4053–4055 |year=1992 |last1=Germann |first1=G. J |last2=McClelland |first2=G. M |last3=Mitsuda |first3=Y |last4=Buck |first4=M |last5=Seki |first5=H }}&lt;/ref&gt; These thin films are usually deposited by CVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pssa.2211540113 |title=On the Mechanisms of Bias Enhanced Nucleation of Diamond |journal=Physica Status Solidi A |volume=154 |pages=155–174 |year=1996 |last1=Kulisch |first1=W |last2=Ackermann |first2=L |last3=Sobisch |first3=B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In CVD, diamond is deposited directly on silicon or W cantilever. A schematic diagram for chemical vapor deposition set up is shown in Fig. 6. In this method, flow of methane and hydrogen gas is maintained in such a way that pressure inside chamber is maintained at 40Torr. CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are dissociated at elevated temperature of 2100&amp;nbsp;°C with the help of Ta filament. Nucleation sites are created on the tip of cantilever. Once CVD is complete, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; flow is stopped and chamber is cooled under flow of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Schematics of CVD set up for diamond tip fabrication for AFM application is in Fig. 6.

[[File:Chemical Vapor Deposition.png|thumb|Fig. 6: Schematics of CVD set up for diamond tip fabrication for AFM application]]

=== Reactive ion etching (RIE) fabrication ===
In RIE method, first a grove or structure is made on a substrate followed by deposition of a desired material in that template. Once tip is formed, templating structure is etched off leaving tip and cantilever. A schematic for diamond tip fabrication on silicon wafers through this method has been described in Fig. 7&lt;ref name=":39"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Calafiore |first=Giuseppe |last2=Koshelev |first2=Alexander |last3=Darlington |first3=Thomas P. |last4=Borys |first4=Nicholas J. |last5=Melli |first5=Mauro |last6=Polyakov |first6=Aleksandr |last7=Cantarella |first7=Giuseppe |last8=Allen |first8=Frances I. |last9=Lum |first9=Paul |date=2017-05-10 |title=Campanile Near-Field Probes Fabricated by Nanoimprint Lithography on the Facet of an Optical Fiber |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=1 |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-01871-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Focused ion beam milling ===
Focused ion beam milling milling is a sharpening method for probe tips in SPM. In this method, first a blunt tip is fabricated by other methods, for example, pyramid mold can be used to fabricate pyramidal tip, CVD method or any other etching method. Then, this tip is sharpened by FIB milling as shown in Fig. 8. The focused ion beam diameter is controlled through a programmable aperture which directly correlates with tip diameter.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 
[[File:Fig. 8 Schematics of FIB milling method for probe tip sharpening.png|thumb|Fig 8: Schematics of focused ion beam milling milling method for probe tip sharpening]]

=== Glue ===
This method is used to attach carbon nanotubes on cantilever or blunt tip. A strong adhesive (such as soft acrylic glue) is used to bind CNT with silicon cantilever. CNT are robust, stiff and increase durability of probe tip and can be used for both contact and tapping mode.&lt;ref name="Dai et al 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nguyen |first=Cattien V. |last2=Ye |first2=Qi |last3=Meyyappan |first3=M. |date=2005 |title=Carbon nanotube tips for scanning probe microscopy: fabrication and high aspect ratio nanometrology |journal=Measurement Science and Technology |volume=16 |issue=11 |page=2138 |doi=10.1088/0957-0233/16/11/003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cleaning procedures ==
Electrochemically etched tips are usually covered with contaminant on surface which cannot be removed simply by rinsing in water, acetone or ethanol. Some oxides layers on metallic tips, especially on tungsten, need to be removed by post fabrication treatment.

=== Annealing ===
To clean W sharp tips, it is highly desirable to remove contaminant and oxide layer. In this method a tip is heated in UHV chamber at elevated temperature which desorb contaminated layer. Reaction detail is shown below.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0039-6028(92)91036-B |title=Preparation of STM W tips and characterization by FEM, TEM and SEM |journal=Surface Science |volume=266 |pages=294–298 |year=1992 |last1=Méndez |first1=J |last2=Luna |first2=M |last3=Baró |first3=A.M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + W → 3WO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ↑

WO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → W (sublimation at &lt;math&gt;\backsim&lt;/math&gt;1075K)

As at elevated temperature, trioxides of W are converted to WO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which sublimates around 1075K and cleaned metallic W surface left behind. Additional advantage provided by annealing is healing of crystallographic defects produced by fabrication and it also smoothens the tip surface.

=== HF chemical cleaning ===
In HF cleaning method, freshly prepared tip is dipped in 15% concentrated hydrofluoric acid which dissolves oxides of W for 10~30 s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Method of cleaning probe tips of cards and apparatus for implementing the method |date=1996-04-03 |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US5814158A/en |accessdate=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ion milling ===
In this method, argon ions are directed to the tip surface to remove contaminant layer by sputtering. Tip is either rotated in a flux of argon ions at certain angle in a way that this beam hits on the apex. The bombardment of ions on the tip depletes the contaminants and also results in reduction of radius of tip.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Bombardment time needs to be finely tuned with respect to shape of tip. Sometimes, a short annealing is required after ion milling.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Self-sputtering ===
This method is very similar to ion milling but, in this procedure, UHV chamber is filled with neon at a pressure of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; mbar. When negative voltage is applied on the tip, strong electric field (produced by tip under negative potential) will ionize neon gas and these positively charged ions are accelerated back to tip and causing sputtering at the tip. The sputtering removes contaminants and some atoms from tip which, like ion milling reduces apex radius. By, changing the field strength, one can tune radius of tip to 20&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

== Coating ==
The surface of the Silicon based tips cannot be easily controlled because they usually carry silanol group. Si surface is hydrophilic and can be contaminated easily by environmental. Another disadvantage of Si tips is wear and tear of tip. It is important to coat Si tip to prevent tip deteriorations. The tip coating may also enhance image quality. Following types of coatings are employed for Si tips. First an adhesive layer is pasted (usually chromium layer on 5&amp;nbsp;nm thick titanium) and then gold is deposited by vapor deposition (40-100&amp;nbsp;nm or less). Sometimes, the coating layering reduces tunneling current detection capability of probe tips.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2006.07.070 |title=C-AFM-based thickness determination of thin and ultra-thin SiO 2 films by use of different conductive-coated probe tips |journal=Applied Surface Science |volume=253 |issue=7 |pages=3615–3626 |year=2007 |last1=Frammelsberger |first1=Werner |last2=Benstetter |first2=Guenther |last3=Kiely |first3=Janice |last4=Stamp |first4=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characterization ==
The most important aspect of a probe tip is imaging the surfaces efficiently at nanometer. Some concerns involving credibility of the imaging or measurement of sample arises when the shape of tip is not determined accurately. For example, when an unknown tip is used to measure linewidth pattern or other high aspect ratio feature of a surface. There may remain some confusion for the determination of the contribution of tip and the sample in the acquired image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.1651638 |title=Metrological large range scanning probe microscope |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=962–969 |year=2004 |last1=Dai |first1=Gaoliang |last2=Pohlenz |first2=Frank |last3=Danzebrink |first3=Hans-Ulrich |last4=Xu |first4=Min |last5=Hasche |first5=Klaus |last6=Wilkening |first6=Guenter }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it is important to fully and accurately characterize the tips. Probe tips can be characterized for their shape, size, sharpness, bluntness, aspect ratio, radius of curvature, geometry and composition using many advanced instrumental techniques.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1992-07-01 |title=Field emission current-voltage curves as a diagnostic for scanning tunneling microscope tips |journal=Ultramicroscopy |volume=42-44 |pages=1538–1541 |doi=10.1016/0304-3991(92)90479-4 |last1=Meyer |first1=J.A |last2=Stranick |first2=S.J |last3=Wang |first3=J.B |last4=Weiss |first4=P.S |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA251171&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.98070 |title=Ion milled tips for scanning tunneling microscopy |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=50 |issue=11 |pages=696–698 |year=1987 |last1=Biegelsen |first1=D.

In some cases, optical microscopy cannot provide exact measurements for small tips in nanoscale due to resolution limitation of the optical microscopy.

=== Electron field emission current measurement ===
In electron field emission current measurement method, a high voltage is applied between tip and another electrode followed by measuring field emission current employing Fowler-Nordheim curves &lt;math&gt;[\log_{10}(1/V^2) vs. (1/V)] &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.270.5239.1179 |title=A Carbon Nanotube Field-Emission Electron Source |journal=Science |volume=270 |issue=5239 |pages=1179–1180 |year=1995 |last1=De Heer |first1=W. A |last2=Ch Telain |first2=A |last3=Ugarte |first3=D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large fields-emission current measurements may indicate that the tip is sharp and low field-emission current indicates that the tip is blunt, molten or mechanically damaged. A minimum voltage is essential to facilitate the release of electrons from the surface of tip which in turn indirectly is used to obtain the tip curvature. The downside of this method to the several advantages is that the high electric field required for producing strong electric force that can melt the apex of the tip or might change crystallographic tip nature.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy ===
The size and shape of the tip can be obtained by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy measurements.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.1143970 |title=Calibration of atomic‐force microscope tips |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=1868–1873 |year=1993 |last1=Hutter |first1=Jeffrey L |last2=Bechhoefer |first2=John }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, TEM images are helpful to detect any layer of insulating materials on the surface of the tip as well as to estimate the size of the layer.

Tip grain down to 1-3&amp;nbsp;nm or thin polycrystalline oxides or carbon or graphite layers at the tip apex are routinely measured using TEM. The orientation of tip crystal i.e. the angle between the tip plane in the single-crystal and the tip normal can be estimated.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/0950-7671/44/12/428 |title=Preparation of contamination-free tungsten specimens for the field-ion microscope |journal=Journal of Scientific Instruments |volume=44 |issue=12 |pages=1044–1045 |year=1967 |last1=Fasth |first1=J E |last2=Loberg |first2=B |last3=Nordén |first3=H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optical microscopy ===
In the past, optical microscope has been only used to investigate if the tip is bent microscale imaging at many microscales. This is because the resolution limitation of an optical microscope is about 200&amp;nbsp;nm. Imaging software including ImageJ allows determination of the curvature, and aspect ratio of the tip. One drawback of this method is that it renders an image of tip which is a object due to the uncertainty in the nanoscale dimension. This problem can be resolved taking images of tip multiple times followed by putting them together into image by confocal microscope with some fluorescent material coating on the tip. Also, it is a time-consuming process considering the necessity of monitoring the wear or damage or degradation of tip by the collision with the surface during scanning the surface after each scan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.1144891 |title=Preparation and characterization of tungsten tips for scanning tunneling microscopy |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=1558–1560 |year=1994 |last1=Cricenti |first1=A |last2=Paparazzo |first2=E |last3=Scarselli |first3=M.

=== Scanning tunneling spectroscopy ===
The scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) is spectroscopic form of STM in which spectroscopic data based on curve is obtained to analyze the existence of any oxides or impurities on the tip by monitoring the linearity of the curve which represents metallic tunnel junction.&lt;ref name=Feenstra1994&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0039-6028(94)90710-2 |title=Scanning tunneling spectroscopy |journal=Surface Science |volume=299-300 |pages=965–979 |year=1994 |last1=Feenstra |first1=Randall M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, cure is non-linear and hence, the tip has a gap like shape around zero bias voltage for oxidized or impure tip whereas the opposite is observed for sharp pure un-oxidized tip.&lt;ref name="Feenstra et al 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0039-6028(87)90170-1 |title=Tunneling spectroscopy of the Si(111)2 × 1 surface |journal=Surface Science |volume=181 |pages=295–306 |year=1987 |last1=Feenstra |first1=R.M |last2=Stroscio |first2=Joseph A |last3=Fein |first3=A.P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auger electron spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ===
In Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), any oxides present on the tip surface is sputtered out during in-depth analysis with argon ion beam generated by differentially pumped ion pump followed by comparing the sputtering rate of the oxide with experimental sputtering yields.&lt;ref name=Chang1971&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0039-6028(71)90210-X |title=Auger electron spectroscopy |journal=Surface Science |volume=25 |pages=53–79 |year=1971 |last1=Chang |first1=Chuan C }}&lt;/ref&gt; These Auger measurements may estimate the nature of oxides because of the surface contamination and/or composition can be revealed and in some cases thickness of the oxide layer down to 1-3&amp;nbsp;nm can be estimated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy also performs similar characterization for the chemical and surface composition by providing information on the binding energy of the surface elements.&lt;ref name=Feenstra1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chang1971/&gt;

Overall, the aforementioned characterization methods of tips can be categorized in three major classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dongmo |first=Samuel |last2=Villarrubia |first2=John S. |last3=Jones |first3=Samuel N. |last4=Renegar |first4=Thomas B. |last5=Postek |first5=Michael T. |last6=Song |first6=Jun-Feng |date=1998-03-01 |title=Tip Characterization for Scanned Probe Microscope Width Metrology |url=https://www.nist.gov/publications/tip-characterization-scanned-probe-microscope-width-metrology |journal=NIST }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

== Applications ==
Probes tips have a wide variety of applications in different fields of science and technology. One of the major areas where probe tips are used is for application in SPM i.e., STM&lt;ref name="Tersoff &amp; Hamann 1983"/&gt; and AFM.&lt;ref name=pmid10649994&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yu |first=Min-Feng |last2=Lourie |first2=Oleg |last3=Dyer |first3=Mark J. |last4=Moloni |first4=Katerina |last5=Kelly |first5=Thomas F. |last6=Ruoff |first6=Rodney S. |date=2000-01-28 |title=Strength and Breaking Mechanism of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Under Tensile Load |journal=Science |volume=287 |issue=5453 |pages=637–640 |doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.637 |pmid=10649994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, carbon nanotube tips in conjunction with AFM provides an excellent tool for surface characterization in the nanometer realm. CNT tips are also used in tapping-mode Scanning Force Microscopy (SFM), which is a technique where a tip taps a surface by a cantilever driven near resonant frequency of the cantilever. The CNT probe tips fabricated using CVD technique can be used for imaging of biological macromolecules,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hafner |first=Jason H. |last2=Cheung |first2=Chin Li |last3=Lieber |first3=Charles M. |date=April 1999 |title=Growth of nanotubes for probe microscopy tips |journal=Nature |volume=398 |issue=6730 |pages=761–762 |doi=10.1038/19658 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2710478/chemistrycheung-17.pdf?sequence=1 |format=Full text }}&lt;/ref&gt; semiconductor&lt;ref name="Nguyen et al 2001"/&gt; and chemical structure.&lt;ref name=pmid19713523/&gt; For example, it is possible to obtain intermittent AFM contact image of IgM macromolecules with excellent resolution using single CNT tip.

'''Pseudoscience''' consists of statements, [[belief]]s, or practices that are claimed to be both scientific and factual, but are incompatible with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="Cover_Curd_1998"/&gt;{{refn|group=Note|Definition:
* "A pretended or spurious science; a collection of related beliefs about the world mistakenly regarded as being based on scientific method or as having the status that scientific truths now have," ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', second edition 1989.

The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), '[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones.'

The [[demarcation problem|demarcation]] between science and pseudoscience has [[philosophical]] and [[scientific]] implications.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; Differentiating science from pseudoscience has practical implications in the case of [[health care]], [[Expert witness|expert testimony]], [[Environmental policy|environmental policies]], and [[science education]].&lt;ref name="Stanford-Demarcations"/&gt; Distinguishing scientific facts and theories from pseudoscientific beliefs, such as those found in [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[alternative medicine]], [[occult]] beliefs, and [[creation science]], is part of science education and [[scientific literacy]].&lt;ref name="Stanford-Demarcations"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt;

Pseudoscience can cause negative consequences in the real world. [[Antivaccine]] activists present pseudoscientific studies that falsely call into question the safety of vaccines. [[Homeopathy|Homeopathic]] remedies with no active ingredients have been promoted as treatment for deadly diseases.

==Etymology==
The word ''pseudoscience'' is derived from the Greek root ''pseudo'' meaning false&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Free Dictionary |chapter=pseudo |publisher=Farlex, Inc. |year=2015 |chapter-url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pseudo |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Etymology Dictionary | url = https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=pseudo |year=2015 |publisher=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the English word ''science'', from the Latin word ''scientia'', meaning "knowledge". Although the term has been in use since at least the late 18th century (e.g. in 1796 by [[James Pettit Andrews]] in reference to alchemy&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|pseudoscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Andrews|Henry|1796|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the concept of pseudoscience as distinct from real or proper science seems to have become more widespread during the mid-19th century. Among the earliest uses of "pseudo-science" was in an 1844 article in the ''Northern Journal of Medicine'', issue 387:
{{quote|text=That opposite kind of innovation which pronounces what has been recognized as a branch of science, to have been a pseudo-science, composed merely of so-called facts, connected together by misapprehensions under the disguise of principles.}}

An earlier use of the term was in 1843 by the French physiologist [[François Magendie]].&lt;ref name="Magendie1843"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Magendie F  |year=1843 |title=An Elementary Treatise on Human Physiology |edition=5th |location=New York |publisher=Harper |page=150 |ref=harv |others=John Revere}} Magendie refers to phrenology as "''a pseudo-science of the present day''"&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, the word was used pejoratively to describe explanations of phenomena which were claimed to be scientific, but which were not in fact supported by reliable experimental evidence.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Still/&gt; --&gt; From time-to-time, though, the usage of the word occurred in a more formal, technical manner in response to a perceived threat to individual and institutional security in a social and cultural setting.&lt;ref name=Still&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Theory Soc Behav |year=2004 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=265–90 |title=The Social Psychology of "Pseudoscience": A Brief History | vauthors = Still A, Dryden W | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-8308.2004.00248.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
Philosophers classify types of [[knowledge]].  In English, the word ''[[science]]'' is used to indicate specifically the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] and related fields, which are called the [[Social science|social sciences]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/pseudo-science/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Hansson|first=Sven Ove|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different philosophers of science may disagree on the exact limits – for example, is mathematics a [[formal science]] that is closer to the empirical ones, or is pure mathematics closer to the philosophical study of [[logic]] and therefore not a science?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of Science: From Problem to Theory|author=Bunge, Mario Augusto|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7658-0413-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but all agree that all of the ideas that are not scientific are non-scientific.  The large category of [[non-science]] includes all matters outside the natural and social sciences, such as the study of [[history]], [[metaphysics]], [[religion]], [[art]], and the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dividing the category again, unscientific claims are a subset of the large category of non-scientific claims.  This category specifically includes all matters that are directly opposed to good science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Unscience|Un-science]] includes both [[Bad science (philosophy)|bad science]] (such as an error made in a good-faith attempt at learning something about the natural world) and pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Thus pseudoscience is a subset of un-science, and un-science, in turn, is subset of non-science.

==Relationship to science==
Pseudoscience is differentiated from science because – although it claims to be science – pseudoscience does not adhere to accepted scientific standards, such as the scientific method, falsifiability of claims, and Mertonian norms.

===Scientific method===
{{Main|Scientific method}}
[[File:The_Scientific_Method_(simple).png|thumb|The scientific method is a continuous cycle of hypothesis, prediction, testing and questioning.]]
[[File:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumb|A typical 19th-century [[phrenology]] chart: During the 1820s, phrenologists claimed the mind was located in areas of the brain, and were attacked for doubting that mind came from the nonmaterial soul. Their idea of reading "bumps" in the skull to predict personality traits was later discredited.&lt;ref name="bowler"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bowler J |authorlink=Peter J. Bowler | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evolution: The History of an Idea |edition=3rd |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-520-23693-6 |ref=harv |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phrenology was first termed a pseudoscience in 1843 and continues to be considered so.&lt;ref name="Magendie1843"/&gt;]]

A number of basic principles are accepted by scientists as standards for determining whether a body of knowledge, method, or practice is scientific. Experimental results should be [[reproducibility|reproducible]] and [[intersubjective verifiability|verified]] by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3–5 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; These principles are intended to ensure experiments can be reproduced measurably given the same conditions, allowing further investigation to determine whether a [[hypothesis]] or [[theory]] related to given [[phenomena]] is [[validity (statistics)|valid]] and reliable. Standards require the scientific method to be applied throughout, and [[bias]] to be controlled for or eliminated through [[Randomized experiment|randomization]], fair sampling procedures, [[double blind|blinding]] of studies, and other methods. All gathered data, including the experimental or environmental conditions, are expected to be documented for scrutiny and made available for [[peer review]], allowing further experiments or studies to be conducted to confirm or falsify results. Statistical quantification of [[statistical significance|significance]], [[confidence interval|confidence]], and [[margin of error|error]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=191 ''ff''}}, especially Chapter 6, "Probability", and Chapter 7, "inductive Logic and Statistics"&lt;/ref&gt; are also important tools for the scientific method.

===Falsifiability===
{{Main|Falsifiability}}
During the mid-20th century, the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] emphasized the criterion of [[falsifiability]] to distinguish [[science]] from nonscience.&lt;ref name="Popper"&gt;{{cite book |last= Popper |first= Karl | name-list-format = vanc |author-link= Karl Popper |date= 1959 |title= The Logic of Scientific Discovery |isbn= 978-0-415-27844-7 |publisher= Routledge |ref= harv|title-link= The Logic of Scientific Discovery }} The German version is currently in print by Mohr Siebeck ({{ISBN|3-16-148410-X}}).&lt;/ref&gt; [[proposition|Statements]], [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], or [[theory|theories]] have falsifiability or refutability if there is the inherent possibility that they can be proven [[False (logic)|false]]. That is, if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates them. Popper used astrology and [[psychoanalysis]] as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other, though he did not provide clear criteria for the differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Popper|1963|pp=43–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example which shows the distinct need for a claim to be falsifiable was stated in [[Carl Sagan|Carl Sagan's]] publication ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' when he discusses an invisible dragon that he has in his garage. The point is made that there is no physical test to refute the claim of the presence of this dragon. No matter what test you think you can devise, there is then a reason why this does not apply to the invisible dragon, so one can never prove that the initial claim is wrong. Sagan concludes; "Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?". He states that "your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sagan|1994|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; once again explaining that even if such a claim were true, it would be outside the realm of [[science|scientific inquiry]].

===Mertonian norms===
{{Main|Mertonian norms}}
During 1942, [[Robert K. Merton]] identified a set of five "norms" which he characterized as what makes a real science. If any of the norms were violated, Merton considered the enterprise to be nonscience. These are not broadly accepted by the scientific community. His norms were:
* Originality: The tests and research done must present something new to the scientific community.
* Detachment: The scientists' reasons for practicing this science must be simply for the expansion of their knowledge. The scientists should not have personal reasons to expect certain results.
* Universality: No person should be able to more easily obtain the information of a test than another person. Social class, religion, ethnicity, or any other personal factors should not be factors in someone's ability to receive or perform a type of science.
* Skepticism: Scientific facts must not be based on faith. One should always question every case and argument and constantly check for errors or invalid claims.
* Public accessibility: Any scientific knowledge one obtains should be made available to everyone. The results of any research should be published and shared with the scientific community.&lt;ref name="Paradigms Lost"&gt;{{cite book |last=Casti |first=John L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Paradigms lost: tackling the unanswered mysteries of modern science|year=1990 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-380-71165-9 |pages=51–52 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refusal to acknowledge problems===
During 1978, [[Paul Thagard]] proposed that pseudoscience is primarily distinguishable from science when it is less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and its proponents fail to acknowledge or address problems with the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=223 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1983, [[Mario Bunge]] has suggested the categories of "belief fields" and "research fields" to help distinguish between pseudoscience and science, where the former is primarily personal and subjective and the latter involves a certain systematic method.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bunge|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the term===
Philosophers of science such as [[Paul Feyerabend]] argued that a distinction between science and nonscience is neither possible nor desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors= Feyerabend P |date= 1975 |title= Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge |isbn= 978-0-86091-646-8 |chapter-url= http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/feyerabe.htm |chapter= Table of contents and final chapter |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071212002717/http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/feyerabe.htm |archivedate= 2007-12-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=Note|'A particularly radical reinterpretation of science comes from Paul Feyerabend, "the worst enemy of science"... Like Lakatos, Feyerabend was also a student under Popper. In an interview with Feyerabend in ''Science'', [he says] "Equal weight... should be given to competing avenues of knowledge such as astrology, acupunture, and witchcraft..."'&lt;ref name="Gauch2003"&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Among the issues which can make the distinction difficult is variable rates of evolution among the theories and methods of science in response to new data.{{refn|name=fredb|group=Note|"We can now propose the following principle of demarcation: A theory or discipline which purports to be scientific is pseudoscientific if and only if: it has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and faces many unsolved problems; but the community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and non confirmations."&lt;ref name="harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=227–228"&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Larry Laudan]] has suggested pseudoscience has no scientific meaning and is mostly used to describe our emotions: "If we would stand up and be counted on the side of reason, we ought to drop terms like 'pseudo-science' and 'unscientific' from our vocabulary; they are just hollow phrases which do only emotive work for us".&lt;ref name = "Laudan_1996"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Laudan L |date=1996 |chapter= The demise of the demarcation problem | veditors = Ruse M | title = But Is It Science?: The Philosophical Question in the Creation/Evolution Controversy |pages= 337–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Richard McNally]] states, "The term 'pseudoscience' has become little more than an inflammatory buzzword for quickly dismissing one's opponents in media sound-bites" and "When therapeutic entrepreneurs make claims on behalf of their interventions, we should not waste our time trying to determine whether their interventions qualify as pseudoscientific. Rather, we should ask them: How do you know that your intervention works? What is your evidence?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= McNally RJ |url= http://www.srmhp.org/0202/pseudoscience.html |title= Is the pseudoscience concept useful for clinical psychology? |journal= The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice |volume= 2 |issue= 2 |date= 2003 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100430162007/http://www.srmhp.org/0202/pseudoscience.html |archivedate= 2010-04-30 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative definition===
For philosophers [[Silvio Funtowicz]] and [[Jerome R. Ravetz]] "pseudo-science may be defined as one where the uncertainty of its inputs must be suppressed, lest they render its outputs totally indeterminate". The definition, in the book ''[[Uncertainty and quality in science for policy]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;54),&lt;ref name="PNS0"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Funtowicz S, Ravetz J | year = 1990 | title = Uncertainty and quality in science for policy | location = Dordrecht | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | title-link = Uncertainty and quality in science for policy }}&lt;/ref&gt; alludes to the loss of craft skills in handling quantitative information, and to the bad practice of achieving precision in prediction (inference) only at the expenses of ignoring uncertainty in the input which was used to formulate the prediction. This use of the term is common among practitioners of [[post-normal science]]. Understood in this way, pseudoscience can be fought using good practices to assesses uncertainty in quantitative information, such as [[NUSAP]] and – in the case of mathematical modelling – [[sensitivity auditing]].

==History==
{{main article|History of pseudoscience}}
The history of pseudoscience is the study of pseudoscientific theories over time. A pseudoscience is a set of ideas that presents itself as science, while it does not meet the criteria to be properly called such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote = Pseudoscientific – pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific |chapter = Pseudoscientific |chapter-url = |title = Oxford American Dictionary |publisher = [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url = http://skepdic.com/pseudosc.html |title = The Skeptic's Dictionary |chapter = Pseudoscience |ref = harv |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090201091026/http://www.skepdic.com/pseudosc.html |archivedate = 2009-02-01 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing between proper science and pseudoscience is sometimes difficult. One proposal for demarcation between the two is the falsification criterion, attributed most notably to the philosopher [[Karl Popper]]. In the [[history of science]] and the [[history of pseudoscience]] it can be especially difficult to separate the two, because some sciences developed from pseudosciences. An example of this transformation is the science [[chemistry]], which traces its origins to pseudoscientific or [[Prescientific|pre-scientific]] study of [[alchemy]].

The vast diversity in pseudosciences further complicates the history of science. Some modern pseudosciences, such as astrology and acupuncture, originated before the scientific era. Others developed as part of an ideology, such as [[Lysenkoism]], or as a response to perceived threats to an ideology. Examples of this ideological process are [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]], which were developed in response to the scientific theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greener M | title = Taking on creationism.

{{See also|List of topics characterized as pseudoscience}}
A topic, practice, or body of knowledge might reasonably be termed pseudoscientific when it is presented as consistent with the norms of scientific research, but it demonstrably fails to meet these norms.&lt;ref name="Cover_Curd_1998"&gt;{{citation | veditors = Cover JA, Curd M |date= 1998 |title= Philosophy of Science: The Central Issues |pages= 1–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Popper stated it is insufficient to distinguish science from pseudoscience, or from [[metaphysics]] (such as the philosophical question of what [[existence]] means), by the criterion of rigorous adherence to the [[Empiricism|empirical method]], which is essentially inductive, based on observation or experimentation.&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"&gt;{{cite book |last= Popper |first= Karl |name-list-format= vanc |author-link= Karl Popper |date= 1963 |title= Conjectures and Refutations |url= http://www.paul-rosenfels.org/Popper.pdf |ref= harv |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171013124349/http://www.paul-rosenfels.org/Popper.pdf |archivedate= 2017-10-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a method to distinguish between genuine empirical, nonempirical or even pseudoempirical methods. The latter case was exemplified by astrology, which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had astonishing [[empirical research|empirical evidence]] based on observation, on [[horoscopes]] and [[biographies]], it crucially failed to use acceptable scientific standards.&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; Popper proposed falsifiability as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.

To demonstrate this point, Popper&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; gave two cases of human behavior and typical explanations from [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler]]'s theories: "that of a man who pushes a child into the water with the intention of drowning it; and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an attempt to save the child."&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; From Freud's perspective, the first man would have suffered from [[psychological repression]], probably originating from an [[Oedipus complex]], whereas the second man had attained [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]. From Adler's perspective, the first and second man suffered from feelings of [[inferiority]] and had to prove himself, which drove him to commit the crime or, in the second case, drove him to rescue the child. Popper was not able to find any counterexamples of human behavior in which the behavior could not be explained in the terms of Adler's or Freud's theory. Popper argued&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; it was that the observation always fitted or confirmed the theory which, rather than being its strength, was actually its weakness.

In contrast, Popper&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; gave the example of Einstein's [[gravitational theory]], which predicted "light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the Sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted."&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; Following from this, stars closer to the Sun would appear to have moved a small distance away from the Sun, and away from each other. This prediction was particularly striking to Popper because it involved considerable risk. The brightness of the Sun prevented this effect from being observed under normal circumstances, so photographs had to be taken during an eclipse and compared to photographs taken at night. Popper states, "If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted."&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; Popper summed up his criterion for the scientific status of a theory as depending on its falsifiability, refutability, or [[testability]].

[[Paul R. Thagard]] used astrology as a case study to distinguish science from pseudoscience and proposed principles and criteria to delineate them.&lt;ref name="Thagard 1978 astrology"/&gt; First, astrology has not progressed in that it has not been updated nor added any explanatory power since [[Ptolemy]]. Second, it has ignored outstanding problems such as the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of equinoxes]] in astronomy. Third, alternative theories of [[Personality psychology|personality]] and behavior have grown progressively to encompass explanations of phenomena which astrology statically attributes to heavenly forces. Fourth, astrologers have remained uninterested in furthering the theory to deal with outstanding problems or in critically evaluating the theory in relation to other theories. Thagard intended this criterion to be extended to areas other than astrology. He believed it would delineate as pseudoscientific such practices as [[witchcraft]] and [[pyramidology]], while leaving [[physics]], chemistry and [[biology]] in the realm of science. [[Biorhythms]], which like astrology relied uncritically on birth dates, did not meet the criterion of pseudoscience at the time because there were no alternative explanations for the same observations. The use of this criterion has the consequence that a theory can be scientific at one time and pseudoscientific at a later time.&lt;ref name="Thagard 1978 astrology"&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science is also distinguishable from revelation, theology, or spirituality in that it offers insight into the physical world obtained by empirical research and testing.&lt;ref name=Gould&gt;{{Cite magazine |first = Stephen Jay |last = Gould | name-list-format = vanc |url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html |title = Nonoverlapping magisteria |magazine = Natural History |date = March 1997 |issue= 106 |pages= 16–22 |dead-url= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170104061453/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html |archive-date= January 4, 2017 |ref = harv

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems of belief that derive from divine or inspired knowledge are not considered pseudoscience if they do not claim either to be scientific or to overturn well-established science. Moreover, some specific religious claims, such as [[Studies on intercessory prayer|the power of intercessory prayer to heal the sick]], although they may be based on untestable beliefs, can be tested by the scientific method.

Some statements and common beliefs of popular science may not meet the criteria of science. "Pop" science may blur the divide between science and pseudoscience among the general public, and may also involve science fiction.&lt;ref name=Pendle&gt;{{cite web |first=George |last=Pendle | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://www.popularscience.co.uk/features/feat20.htm |title=Popular Science Feature – When Science Fiction is Science Fact |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214144307/http://www.popularscience.co.uk/features/feat20.htm |archive-date=2006-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, pop science is disseminated to, and can also easily emanate from, persons not accountable to scientific methodology and expert peer review.

If the claims of a given field can be tested experimentally and standards are upheld, it is not pseudoscience, however odd, astonishing, or counterintuitive the claims are. If claims made are inconsistent with existing experimental results or established theory, but the method is sound, caution should be used, since science consists of testing hypotheses which may turn out to be false. In such a case, the work may be better described as ideas that are "not yet generally accepted". ''[[Protoscience]]'' is a term sometimes used to describe a hypothesis that has not yet been tested adequately by the scientific method, but which is otherwise consistent with existing science or which, where inconsistent, offers reasonable account of the inconsistency. It may also describe the transition from a body of practical knowledge into a scientific field.&lt;ref name="Popper"/&gt;

===Indicators of the possible presence of pseudoscience===

====Use of vague, exaggerated or untestable claims====
* Assertion of scientific claims that are vague rather than precise, and that lack specific measurements&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=211 ''ff''}} (Probability, "Common Blunders")&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion of a claim with little or no explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt;
* Failure to make use of [[operational definition]]s (i.e. publicly accessible definitions of the variables, terms, or objects of interest so that persons other than the definer can measure or test them independently){{refn|group=Note|'Most terms in theoretical physics, for example, do not enjoy at least some distinct connections with observables, but not of the simple sort that would permit operational ''definitions'' in terms of these observables.

* Failure to make reasonable use of the principle of [[Occam's razor|parsimony]], i.e. failing to seek an explanation that requires the fewest possible additional assumptions when multiple viable explanations are possible (''see'': [[Occam's razor]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=269 ff}}, "Parsimony and Efficiency"&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lack of effective [[Scientific control|controls]], such as [[placebo]] and [[double-blind]], in experimental design.
* Lack of understanding of basic and established principles of physics and engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Donald E.

====Over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation====
* Assertions that do not allow the logical possibility that they can be shown to be false by observation or physical experiment (''see also'': [[Falsifiability]]).&lt;ref name="Popper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lakatos_1970"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lakatos I |date= 1970 |chapter= Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes | veditors = Lakatos I, Musgrave A |title= Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |pages= 91–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion of claims that a theory predicts something that it has not been shown to predict.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=178 ''ff''}} (Deductive Logic, "Fallacies"), and at 211 ''ff'' (Probability, "Common Blunders")&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific claims that do not confer any predictive power are considered at best "conjectures", or at worst "pseudoscience" (e.g. ''[[Ignoratio elenchi]]'')&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Vol 3, "Fallacies" 174 ''ff'', esp. section on "Ignoratio elenchi"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion that claims which have not been proven false must therefore be true, and vice versa (''see'': [[Argument from ignorance]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Vol 3, "Fallacies" 174 ''ff'' esp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;
* Over-reliance on testimonial, [[anecdotal evidence]], or [[personal experience]]: This evidence may be useful for the context of discovery (i.e. hypothesis generation), but should not be used in the context of [[Theory of justification|justification]] (e.g. [[Statistical hypothesis testing]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bunge|1983|p=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Presentation of data that seems to support claims while suppressing or refusing to consider data that conflict with those claims.&lt;ref name="harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=227–228"/&gt; This is an example of [[selection bias]], a distortion of evidence or data that arises from the way that the data are collected. It is sometimes referred to as the selection effect.
* Promulgating to the status of facts excessive or untested claims that have been previously published elsewhere; an accumulation of such uncritical secondary reports, which do not otherwise contribute their own empirical investigation, is called the [[Woozle effect]].&lt;ref name="Gambrill2012"&gt;
{{cite book|author=Eileen Gambrill|title=Critical Thinking in Clinical Practice: Improving the Quality of Judgments and Decisions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsuHtwciwQwC&amp;pg=PA109|date=1 May 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-90438-1|page=109|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Evidence of absence|Reversed burden of proof]]: science places the burden of proof on those making a claim, not on the critic. "Pseudoscientific" arguments may neglect this principle and demand that [[skeptic]]s demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that a claim (e.g. an assertion regarding the efficacy of a novel therapeutic technique) is false. It is essentially impossible to prove a universal negative, so this tactic incorrectly places the burden of proof on the skeptic rather than on the claimant.&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld"&gt;Lilienfeld SO (2004) ''Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology'' Guildford Press (2004) {{ISBN|1-59385-070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Appeals to [[holism]] as opposed to [[reductionism]]: proponents of pseudoscientific claims, especially in organic medicine, alternative medicine, naturopathy and mental health, often resort to the "mantra of holism" to dismiss negative findings.&lt;ref name="Ruscio"&gt;{{harvp|Ruscio|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lack of openness to testing by other experts====
* Evasion of peer review before publicizing results (termed "[[science by press conference]]"):&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gitanjali B | title = Peer review -- process, perspectives and the path ahead | journal = Journal of Postgraduate Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 210–4 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11832629 | url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/PDF/peerReview.pdf | ref = harv | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623193431/http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/PDF/PeerReview.pdf | df =  | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 2006-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=Note|For an opposing perspective, e.g. [http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/ss/ss5.html Chapter 5 of Suppression Stories by Brian Martin] (Wollongong: Fund for Intellectual Dissent, 1997), pp. 69–83.}} Some proponents of ideas that contradict accepted scientific theories avoid subjecting their ideas to peer review, sometimes on the grounds that peer review is biased towards established paradigms, and sometimes on the grounds that assertions cannot be evaluated adequately using standard scientific methods. By remaining insulated from the peer review process, these proponents forgo the opportunity of corrective feedback from informed colleagues.&lt;ref name="Ruscio"/&gt;
* Some agencies, institutions, and publications that fund scientific research require authors to [[Data sharing (Science)|share data]] so others can evaluate a paper independently. Failure to provide adequate information for other researchers to reproduce the claims contributes to a lack of openness.&lt;ref name="Gauch_2003"&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=124 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Appealing to the need for secrecy or proprietary knowledge when an [[independent review]] of data or methodology is requested&lt;ref name="Gauch_2003"/&gt;
* Substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all viewpoints is not encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sagan|1994|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Absence of progress====
* Failure to progress towards additional evidence of its claims.&lt;ref name="Lakatos_1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fredb group=Note/&gt; [[Terence Hines]] has identified astrology as a subject that has changed very little in the past two millennia.&lt;ref name="Hines1988"&gt;{{cite book |author-link= Terence Hines |last= Hines |first= Terence | name-list-format = vanc |title= Pseudoscience and the Paranormal: A Critical Examination of the Evidence |publisher= Prometheus Books |location= Buffalo, NY |date= 1988 |isbn= 978-0-87975-419-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=223 ''ff''}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also: [[Scientific progress]])
* Lack of self-correction: scientific research programmes make mistakes, but they tend to reduce these errors over time.&lt;ref name="Ruscio120"&gt;{{harvp|Ruscio|2001|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, ideas may be regarded as pseudoscientific because they have remained unaltered despite contradictory evidence. The work ''Scientists Confront Velikovsky'' (1976) Cornell University, also delves into these features in some detail, as does the work of [[Thomas Kuhn]], e.g. ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (1962) which also discusses some of the items on the list of characteristics of pseudoscience.
* Statistical significance of supporting experimental results does not improve over time and are usually close to the cutoff for statistical significance. Normally, experimental techniques improve or the experiments are repeated, and this gives ever stronger evidence. If statistical significance does not improve, this typically shows the experiments have just been repeated until a success occurs due to chance variations.

====Personalization of issues====
* Tight social groups and [[authoritarian personality]], [[suppression of dissent]] and [[groupthink]] can enhance the adoption of beliefs that have no rational basis. In attempting to confirm their beliefs, the group tends to identify their critics as enemies.&lt;ref name="Devilly_437"&gt;{{harvp|Devilly|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion of claims of a conspiracy on the part of the scientific community to suppress the results{{refn|group=Note|e.g. [http://archivefreedom.org/ archivefreedom.org], which claims that "The list of suppressed scientists even includes Nobel Laureates!"}}
* Attacking the motives or character of anyone who questions the claims (see [[ad hominem|Ad hominem fallacy]])&lt;ref name="Devilly_437"/&gt;{{refn|group=Note|e.g. [http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/person.html Philosophy 103: Introduction to Logic Argumentum Ad Hominem].}}

====Use of misleading language====
* Creating scientific-sounding terms to persuade nonexperts to believe statements that may be false or meaningless: For example, a long-standing hoax refers to water by the rarely used formal name "[[dihydrogen monoxide hoax|dihydrogen monoxide]]" and describes it as the main constituent in most [[poison]]ous solutions to show how easily the general public can be misled.
* Using established terms in idiosyncratic ways, thereby demonstrating unfamiliarity with mainstream work in the discipline

==Explanations==
In a report Singer and Benassi (1981) wrote that pseudoscientific beliefs have their origin from at least four sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first1= Barry |last1= Singer |first2= Victor A. |last2= Benassi | name-list-format = vanc |title= Occult beliefs: Media distortions, social uncertainty, and deficiencies of human reasoning seem to be at the basis of occult beliefs |magazine= American Scientist |volume= 69 |issue= 1 |date= January–February 1981 |pages= 49–55 |jstor= 27850247}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Common cognitive errors from personal experience.
* Erroneous sensationalistic mass media coverage.
* Sociocultural factors.
* Poor or erroneous science education.

Another American study (Eve and Dunn, 1990) supported the findings of Singer and Benassi and found pseudoscientific belief being promoted by high school life science and biology teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first1= Raymond A. |last1= Eve |first2= Dana |last2= Dunn |name-list-format= vanc |title= Psychic powers, astrology &amp; creationism in the classroom?

===Psychology===
The psychology of pseudoscience attempts to explore and analyze pseudoscientific thinking by means of thorough clarification on making the distinction of what is considered scientific vs. pseudoscientific. The human proclivity for seeking confirmation rather than refutation ([[confirmation bias]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Devilly|2005|p=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tendency to hold comforting beliefs, and the tendency to overgeneralize have been proposed as reasons for pseudoscientific thinking. According to Beyerstein (1991), humans are prone to associations based on resemblances only, and often prone to misattribution in cause-effect thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beyerstein B, Hadaway P | year = 1991 | title = On avoiding folly | url = | journal = Journal of Drug Issues | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 689–700 | doi=10.1177/002204269002000418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]]'s theory of belief-dependent realism is driven by the belief that the brain is essentially a "belief engine," which scans data perceived by the senses and looks for patterns and meaning. There is also the tendency for the brain to create [[cognitive bias]]es, as a result of inferences and assumptions made without logic and based on instinct — usually resulting in patterns in cognition. These tendencies of [[Apophenia|patternicity]] and agenticity are also driven "by a meta-bias called the [[bias blind spot]], or the tendency to recognize the power of cognitive biases in other people but to be blind to their influence on our own beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shermer |first=Michael |name-list-format=vanc |authorlink=Michael Shermer |date=July 2011 |title=Understanding the believing brain: Why science is the only way out of belief-dependent realism |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-believing-brain/ |journal=Scientific American |access-date=14 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830132644/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-believing-brain/ |archivedate=30 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lindeman states that social motives (i.e., "to comprehend self and the world, to have a sense of control over outcomes, to belong, to find the world benevolent and to maintain one's self-esteem") are often "more easily" fulfilled by pseudoscience than by scientific information.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lindeman/&gt; --&gt; Furthermore, pseudoscientific explanations are generally not analyzed rationally, but instead experientially.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lindeman/&gt; --&gt; Operating within a different set of rules compared to rational thinking, experiential thinking regards an explanation as valid if the explanation is "personally functional, satisfying and sufficient", offering a description of the world that may be more personal than can be provided by science and reducing the amount of potential work involved in understanding complex events and outcomes.&lt;ref name=Lindeman&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindeman M | title = Motivation, cognition and pseudoscience | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 257–65 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9883101 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9450.00085 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boundaries with science==
{{Main article|Demarcation problem}}

In the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]] and history of science, [[Imre Lakatos]] stresses the social and political importance of the demarcation problem, the normative methodological problem of distinguishing between science and pseudoscience. His distinctive historical analysis of scientific methodology based on research programmes suggests: "scientists regard the successful theoretical prediction of stunning novel facts&amp;nbsp;– such as the [[Halley's comet#Computation of orbit|return of Halley's comet]] or the [[Tests of general relativity#Deflection of light by the Sun|gravitational bending of light rays]]&amp;nbsp;– as what demarcates good scientific theories from pseudo-scientific and degenerate theories, and in spite of all scientific theories being forever confronted by 'an ocean of counterexamples'".&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; Lakatos offers a "novel [[fallibilist]] analysis of the development of Newton's celestial dynamics, [his] favourite historical example of his methodology" and argues in light of this historical turn, that his account answers for certain inadequacies in those of [[Karl Popper]] and Thomas Kuhn.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; "Nonetheless, Lakatos did recognize the force of Kuhn's historical criticism of Popper&amp;nbsp;– all important theories have been surrounded by an 'ocean of anomalies', which on a falsificationist view would require the rejection of the theory outright... Lakatos sought to reconcile the [[rationalism]] of Popperian falsificationism with what seemed to be its own refutation by history".&lt;ref name="Bird2008"&gt;{{cite book | first = Alexander | last = Bird | chapter = The Historical Turn in the Philosophy of Science | title = Routledge Companion to the Philosophy of Science | editor1-first = Stathis | editor1-last = Psillos | editor2-first = Martin | editor2-last = Curd | name-list-format = vanc | location = Abingdon | publisher = Routledge | year = 2008 | pages = 9, 14 | chapter-format = pdf | chapter-url = http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plajb/research/papers/The-Historical-Turn.pdf | ref = harv | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130601030150/http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plajb/research/papers/The-Historical-Turn.pdf | archivedate = 2013-06-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Many philosophers have tried to solve the problem of demarcation in the following terms: a statement constitutes knowledge if sufficiently many people believe it sufficiently strongly. But the history of thought shows us that many people were totally committed to absurd beliefs. If the strengths of beliefs were a hallmark of knowledge, we should have to rank some tales about demons, angels, devils, and of heaven and hell as knowledge. Scientists, on the other hand, are very sceptical even of their best theories. Newton's is the most powerful theory science has yet produced, but Newton himself never believed that bodies attract each other at a distance. So no degree of commitment to beliefs makes them knowledge. Indeed, the hallmark of scientific behaviour is a certain scepticism even towards one's most cherished theories. Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thus a statement may be pseudoscientific even if it is eminently 'plausible' and everybody believes in it, and it may be scientifically valuable even if it is unbelievable and nobody believes in it. A theory may even be of supreme scientific value even if no one understands it, let alone believes in it.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt;|Imre Lakatos|Science and Pseudoscience}}

The boundary between science and pseudoscience is disputed and difficult to determine analytically, even after more than a century of study by philosophers of science and [[scientist]]s, and despite some basic agreements on the fundamentals of the scientific method.&lt;ref name="Cover_Curd_1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gordin | first = Michael D. | name-list-format = vanc | article = That a clear line of demarcation has separated science from pseudoscience | editor-last1 = Numbers | editor-first1 = Ronald L. | editor-last2 = Kampourakis | editor-first2 = Kostas | title = Newton's Apple and Other Myths about Science | pages = 219–225 | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2015 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pWouCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=newton's+apple+and+other+myths+about+science#v=onepage&amp;q=newton's%20apple%20and%20other%20myths%20about%20science&amp;f=false | isbn = 9780674915473 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of pseudoscience rests on an understanding that the scientific method has been misrepresented or misapplied with respect to a given theory, but many philosophers of science maintain that different kinds of methods are held as appropriate across different fields and different eras of human history. According to Lakatos, the typical descriptive unit of great scientific achievements is not an isolated hypothesis but "a powerful problem-solving machinery, which, with the help of sophisticated mathematical techniques, digests anomalies and even turns them into positive evidence."&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt;

{{quote|To Popper, pseudoscience uses induction to generate theories, and only performs experiments to seek to verify them. To Popper, falsifiability is what determines the scientific status of a theory. Taking a historical approach, Kuhn observed that scientists did not follow Popper's rule, and might ignore falsifying data, unless overwhelming. To Kuhn, puzzle-solving within a paradigm is science. Lakatos attempted to resolve this debate, by suggesting history shows that science occurs in research programmes, competing according to how progressive they are. The leading idea of a programme could evolve, driven by its heuristic to make predictions that can be supported by evidence. Feyerabend claimed that Lakatos was selective in his examples, and the whole history of science shows there is no universal rule of scientific method, and imposing one on the scientific community impedes progress.&lt;ref name=Newbold&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Newbold D, Roberts J | title = An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory | journal = International Journal of Nursing Practice | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 324–30 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18021160 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-172X.2007.00646.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;|David Newbold and Julia Roberts|"An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory" in ''International Journal of Nursing Practice'', Vol. 13}} Laudan maintained that the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem, preferring to focus on the more general distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Laudan L |authorlink=Larry Laudan | veditors = Cohen RS, Laudan L |title=Physics, Philosophy and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Grünbaum|series=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science|volume=76|year=1983| publisher=D.

{{quote|[Feyerabend] regards Lakatos's view as being closet anarchism disguised as methodological rationalism. It should be noted that Feyerabend's claim was not that standard methodological rules should never be obeyed, but rather that sometimes progress is made by abandoning them. In the absence of a generally accepted rule, there is a need for alternative methods of persuasion. According to Feyerabend, Galileo employed stylistic and rhetorical techniques to convince his reader, while he also wrote in Italian rather than Latin and directed his arguments to those already temperamentally inclined to accept them.&lt;ref name="Bird2008"/&gt;|Alexander Bird|"The Historical Turn in the Philosophy of Science" in ''Routledge Companion to the Philosophy of Science''}}

==Politics, health, and education==

===Political implications===
The demarcation problem between science and pseudoscience brings up debate in the realms of science, [[philosophy]] and [[politics]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; --&gt; Imre Lakatos, for instance, points out that the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] at one point declared that [[Mendelian genetics]] was pseudoscientific and had its advocates, including well-established scientists such as [[Nikolai Vavilov]], sent to a [[Gulag]] and that the "liberal Establishment of the West" denies freedom of speech to topics it regards as pseudoscience, particularly where they run up against social mores.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos&gt;{{citation |first= Imre |last= Lakatos | name-list-format = vanc |url= http://www2.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/About/lakatos/scienceAndPseudoscience.aspx |dead-url= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725130745/http://richmedia.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/2002_LakatosScienceAndPseudoscience128.mp3 |archive-date= 25 July 2011 |format= mp3 |title= Science and Pseudoscience |page= [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728012423/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/about/lakatos/scienceAndPseudoscienceTranscript.aspx (archive of transcript)] |nopp= yes |publisher= The London School of Economics and Political Science, Dept of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method |date= 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It becomes pseudoscientific when science cannot be separated from [[ideology]], scientists misrepresent scientific findings to promote or draw attention for publicity, when politicians, journalists and a nation's intellectual elite [[politicization of science|distort the facts of science for short-term political gain]], or when powerful individuals of the public conflate causation and cofactors by clever wordplay.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Makgoba/&gt; --&gt; These ideas reduce the authority, value, integrity and independence of science in [[society]].&lt;ref name=Makgoba&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Makgoba MW | title = Politics, the media and science in HIV/AIDS: the peril of pseudoscience | journal = Vaccine | volume = 20 | issue = 15 | pages = 1899–904 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11983241 | doi = 10.1016/S0264-410X(02)00063-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and education implications===
Distinguishing science from pseudoscience has practical implications in the case of health care, expert testimony, environmental policies, and science education. Treatments with a patina of scientific authority which have not actually been subjected to actual scientific testing may be ineffective, expensive and dangerous to patients and confuse health providers, insurers, government decision makers and the public as to what treatments are appropriate. Claims advanced by pseudoscience may result in government officials and educators making bad decisions in selecting curricula.{{refn|group=Note|"From a practical point of view, the distinction is important for decision guidance in both private and public life. Since science is our most reliable source of knowledge in a wide variety of areas, we need to distinguish scientific knowledge from its look-alikes. Due to the high status of science in present-day society, attempts to exaggerate the scientific status of various claims, teachings, and products are common enough to make the demarcation issue serious.  For example, creation science may replace evolution in studies of biology."&lt;ref name="Stanford-Demarcations"&gt;{{harvp|Hansson|2008|loc= Section 1: The purpose of demarcations}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The extent to which students acquire a range of social and [[cognitive]] thinking skills related to the proper usage of science and technology determines whether they are scientifically literate.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; Education in the sciences encounters new dimensions with the changing landscape of [[Science, technology and society|science and technology]], a fast-changing culture and a knowledge-driven era.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; A reinvention of the school science curriculum is one that shapes students to contend with its changing influence on human welfare.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; Scientific literacy, which allows a person to distinguish science from pseudosciences such as astrology, is among the attributes that enable students to adapt to the changing world.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; Its characteristics are embedded in a curriculum where students are engaged in resolving problems, conducting investigations, or developing projects.&lt;ref name=Hurd&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Hurd PD |title=Scientific literacy: New minds for a changing world|journal=Science Education|volume=82|issue=3|pages=407–416|date=June 1998|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199806)82:3&lt;407::AID-SCE6&gt;3.0.CO;2-G}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedman mentions why most scientists avoid educating about pseudoscience, including that paying undue attention to pseudoscience could dignify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Efthimiou|2006|p=4}}&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;Efthimiou quoting Friedman: "We could dignify pseudoscience by mentioning it at all".&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Park emphasizes how pseudoscience can be a threat to society and considers that scientists have a responsibility to teach how to distinguish science from pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Efthimiou|2006|p=4}}&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;Efthimiou quoting Park: "The more serious threat is to the public, which is not often in a position to judge which claims are real and which are ''voodoo''. ... Those who are fortunate enough to have chosen science as a career have an obligation to ''inform the public about voodoo science''".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Thinker close.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Philosophical quietists want to release man from deep perplexity that philosophical contemplation often causes.]]

'''Quietism''' in [[philosophy]] is an approach to the subject that sees the role of philosophy as broadly [[therapeutic approach|therapeutic]] or remedial. Quietist philosophers believe that philosophy has no positive thesis to contribute, but rather that its value is in defusing confusions in the linguistic and conceptual frameworks of other subjects, including non-quietist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Virvidakis|first=Stelios|last2=Kindi|first2=Vasso|title=Quietism|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/id/obo-9780195396577-0184|journal=Oxford Bibliographies Online Datasets|doi=10.1093/obo/9780195396577-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt; By re-formulating supposed problems in a way that makes the misguided reasoning from which they arise apparent, the quietist hopes to put an end to humanity's confusion, and help return to a state of intellectual quietude.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Quietist philosophers==

By its very nature, quietism is not a [[List of schools of philosophy|philosophical school]] as understood in the traditional sense of a body of doctrines, but still it can be identified both by its [[methodology]], which focuses on [[language]] and the use of [[word]]s, and by its objective, which is to show that most philosophical problems are only [[pseudo-problem]]s.

[[Pyrrhonism]] represents perhaps the earliest example of an identifiably quietist position in the West. [[Sextus Empiricus]] regarded Pyrrhonism not as a nihilistic attack but rather as a form of philosophical therapy:

{{Quote|text=The causal principle of scepticism we say is the hope of becoming tranquil. Men of talent, troubled by the anomaly in things and puzzled as to which of them they should rather assent to, came to investigate what in things is true and what false, thinking that by deciding these issues they would become tranquil. The chief constitutive principle of scepticism is the claim that to every account an equal account is opposed; for it is from this, we think, that we come to hold no beliefs.|sign=[[Sextus Empiricus]]|source=''[[Outlines of Pyrrhonism|Outlines of Scepticism]]'', 12}}

Contemporary discussion of quietism can be traced back to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], whose work greatly influenced the [[Ordinary language philosophy|Ordinary Language philosophers]]. One of the early 'ordinary language' works, [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'', attempted to demonstrate that [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] arises from a failure to appreciate that mental vocabulary and physical vocabulary are simply different ways of describing one and the same thing, namely human behaviour. [[J. L. Austin]]'s ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Austin)|Sense and Sensibilia]]'' took a similar approach to the problems of [[skepticism]] and the reliability of [[Perception|sense perception]], arguing that they arise only by misconstruing ordinary language, not because there is anything genuinely wrong with [[empirical evidence]]. [[Norman Malcolm]], a friend of Wittgenstein's, took a quietist approach to skeptical problems in the [[philosophy of mind]]. More recently, the philosophers [[John McDowell]] and [[Richard Rorty]] have taken explicitly quietist positions.

'''''ReAction! Chemistry in the Movies''''' (2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-532692-5}}) is a nonfiction book about movies, chemistry, and chemistry in the movies by Chemistry Professor [[Mark Griep]] and Artist [[Marjorie Mikasen]] published by [[Oxford University Press]] USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Chemistry/?view=usa&amp;amp;ci=9780195326925 |title=Oxford University Press Site for Re''Action!'' Chemistry in the Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors were awarded an [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] grant in the area of Public Understanding of Science to research and write the book.

This book is about the chemistry when it is part of the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/restricted/2009/December/ChristmasReviews/FilmsForChemists.asp
 |title="Films for Chemists" 1 December 2009 Chemistry World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v2/n2/full/nchem.522.html |title="Lights, camera..."| volume=2|doi=10.1038/nchem.522|journal=Nature Chemistry|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the examples are contemporary popular feature films while some are documentaries, shorts, silents, and international films. The book uses the dualities personified by [[Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|the benevolent Dr. Jekyll on one hand and the evil Mr. Hyde on the other]] to describe how chemists and chemistry are portrayed in the movies.

There are 10 chapters, the first five of which have dark chemical themes and the second five of which have bright chemical themes. The chapter titles are:
*1. Dr. Jekyll's Mysterious Transformative Formula
*2. Invisibility Steals the Seen: Chemistry Creates Criminal Opportunities
*3. Isomorphs of Paranoia: Chemical Arsenals
*4. Bad Company: The Business of Toxicity
*5. A Master/Slave Narrative: Drug Addiction and Psychoactives
*6. Inventors and their Often Wacky Chemical Inventions
*7. Hard Science = Hard Evidence: Forensic Chemistry and Chemical Detectives
*8. Chem 101: Learning by Doing
*9. Good News: Research &amp; Medicinal Chemists Making a Difference
*10. First, Do No Harm (but Before that, Self-Experiment)

According to several reviews, the book's strength is when it explores what might be the real chemicals that inspired the [[List of fictional elements, materials, isotopes and atomic particles|fictional compounds]] found in certain movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/restricted/2009/December/ChristmasReviews/FilmsForChemists.asp

The '''Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Grant Award''' was a grant award originally announced in 2000.&lt;ref name="torygraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1350497/4m-set-aside-to-lure-Beckhams-of-science.html "£4m set aside to lure 'Beckhams of science'"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', July 27, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; which has now been superseded by the [[Royal Society Wolfson Fellowship]]s. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/wolfson-research-merit/|title=Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 26 November 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

It was administered by the [[Royal Society]] and jointly funded by the [[Wolfson Foundation]] and the UK [[Office of Science and Technology]], to give universities additional financial support to attract key researchers to this country or to retain those who might seek to gain higher salaries elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/6MdvAoJ6d&lt;/ref&gt; to tackle the [[brain drain]].&lt;ref name="braindrain"/&gt; They were given in four annual rounds, with up to seven awards per round.&lt;ref name="braindrain"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smaglik | first1 = P. | title = Battling the brain drain | doi = 10.1038/nj6871-03a | journal = Nature | volume = 415 | issue = 6871 | pages = 3–31 | year = 2002 | pmid =  11823808| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Science Theatre''' is an [[undergraduate student]]-run [[science outreach]] organization at [[Michigan State University]]'s [[East Lansing]] campus.  Science Theatre visits schools and events throughout [[Michigan]] performing interactive science demonstrations for [[K-12]] students on-stage or up-close.  Science Theatre performers are undergraduate and [[graduate student]] volunteers and all performances are made free of charge.

The group's performances consist of arrangements from its catalog of more than seventy demonstrations in biology, chemistry, and physics.  Additionally, Science Theatre performs comprehensive shows in [[Astronomy]], [[Environmental science]], [[Pressure]], the [[Periodic Table]], [[Quantum Mechanics]], and [[FRIB]]-related science.

Science Theatre was founded in April 1991 under a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] and received the 1993 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] Award for Public Understanding of Science and Technology.  Science Theatre is a four-time winner of the Outreach Award from the Michigan State University Department of Physics and Astronomy.

Many [[Newly industrialized country|newly industrialized countries]] have been trying to establish scientific institutions, but with limited success.

==The common thread==
A common thread can indeed be discerned in the state of science in many NICs. Thus although, most of the science establishments in the major NICs can be said to be doing fairly well, none of them have been as successful as the developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/may102004/1195.pdf|title=1195.pdf - may102004 - currsci - Indian Academy of Sciences|website=Ias.ac.in|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], a small technical elite arose in developing countries such as India, [[Pakistan]], [[Brazil]], and [[Iraq]] who had been educated as scientists in the industrialized world. They spearheaded the development of science in these countries, presuming that by pushing for [[Manhattan project]]-type enterprises in [[nuclear power]], [[electronics]], [[pharmaceuticals]], or [[space exploration]] they could leapfrog the dismally low level of development of science establishments in their countries. India, for example, started a nuclear energy program that mobilized thousands of technicians and cost hundreds of millions of dollars but had limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccnr.org/third_world_nukes.html|title=Nuclear Power in the Third World: An Analysis|website=Ccnr.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though China, North Korea, India and Pakistan have been successful in deploying [[nuclear weapons]] and some of them e.g. China and India have launched fairly successful space programs, (for example, [[Chandrayaan I]] (''[[Sanskrit]]'' चंद्रयान-1), which literally means "Moon Craft," is an unmanned lunar mission by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] and it hopes to land a motorised rover on the moon in 2010 or 2011 as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission; [[Chang'e I]], China's moon probing project is proceeding in full swing in a well-organized way), the fact remains that most of the scientists responsible for these deeds had received their terminal education from some institution or university in US or Europe. In addition there have been hardly any [[Nobel laureate]]s in science who have conducted the path-breaking research in a native science establishment.

==Science in Brazil==
{{main|Science and technology in Brazil}}
Brazilian science effectively began in the 19th century, until then, Brazil was a poor colony, without universities, printing presses, libraries, museums, etc. This was perhaps a deliberate policy of the Portuguese colonial power, because they feared that the appearance of educated Brazilian classes would boost nationalism and aspirations toward political independence.

The first attempts of having a Brazilian science establishment were made around 1783, with the expedition of Portuguese naturalist Alexandre Rodrigues, who was sent by Portugal's prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal, to explore and identify Brazilian fauna, flora and geology. His collections, however, were lost to the French, when [[Napoleon]] invaded, and were transported to Paris by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]. In 1772, the first learned society, the Sociedade Scientifica, was founded in [[Rio de Janeiro]], but lasted only until 1794. Also, in 1797, the first botanic institute was founded in [[Salvador, Bahia]]. In the second and third decades of the twentieth century, the main universities in Brazil were organised from a set of existing medical, engineering and law schools. The University of Brazil dates from 1927, the [[University of São Paulo]] - today the largest in the Country - dates from 1934.

Today, Brazil has a well-developed organization of science and technology. Basic research in science is largely carried out in public universities and research centers and institutes, and some in private institutions, particularly in non-profit non-governmental organizations. More than 90% of funding for basic research comes from governmental sources.

Applied research, technology and engineering is also largely carried out in the university and research centers system, contrary-wise to more developed countries such as the United States, [[South Korea]], [[Germany]], Japan, etc. A significant trend is emerging lately. Companies such as [[Motorola]], [[Samsung]], [[Nokia]] and IBM have established large R&amp;D&amp;I centers in Brazil. One of the incentive factors for this, besides the relatively lower cost and high sophistication and skills of Brazilian technical manpower, has been the so-called Informatics Law, which exempts from certain taxes up to 5% of the gross revenue of high technology manufacturing companies in the fields of telecommunications, computers, digital electronics, etc. The Law has attracted annually more than 1,5 billion dollars of investment in Brazilian R&amp;D&amp;I. Multinational companies have also discovered that some products and technologies designed and developed by Brazilians are significantly competitive and are appreciated by other countries, such as automobiles, aircraft, software, fiber optics, electric appliances, and so on.

The challenges Brazilian science faces today are: to expand the system with quality, supporting the installed competence; transfer knowledge from the research sector to industry; embark on government action in strategic areas; enhance the assessment of existing programmes and commence innovative projects in areas of relevance for the Country. Furthermore, scientific dissemination plays a fundamental role in transforming the perception of the public at large of the importance of science in modern life. The government has undertaken to meet these challenges using institutional base and the operation of existing qualified scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/ingles/economia/ctec/panhist/apresent.htm |title=Science in Brazil |author=José Galizia Tundisi |publisher=Government of Brazil |accessdate=2007-12-21 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AScience+in+Brazil&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215061136/http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/ingles/economia/ctec/panhist/apresent.htm |archivedate=December 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science in China==
{{Main|Science and technology in the People's Republic of China| Science in China}}

A question that has been intriguing many historians studying China is the fact that China did not develop a scientific revolution and Chinese technology fell behind that of Europe. Many hypotheses have been proposed ranging from the cultural to the political and economic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|author=Nathan Sivin
|url=http://hps.arts.unsw.edu.au/hps_content/new/sivin_new_sts.htm
|title=Think Ahead
|publisher=university of New South wales \accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that China indeed had a scientific revolution in the 17th century and that we are still far from understanding the scientific revolutions of the West and China in all their political, economic and social ramifications. Some like [[John K. Fairbank]] are of the opinion that the Chinese political system was hostile to scientific progress.

[[Needham Research Institute|Needham]] argued, and most scholars agreed, that cultural factors prevented these Chinese achievements from developing into what could be called "science". It was the religious and philosophical framework of the Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to believe in the ideas of laws of nature. More recent historians have questioned political and cultural explanations and have focused more on economic causes. Mark Elvin's [[high level equilibrium trap]] is one well-known example of this line of thought, as well as Kenneth Pomeranz' argument that resources from the New World made the crucial difference between European and Chinese development.

Thus, it was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The Taoists, indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naive for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it.  Similar grounds have been found for questioning much of the philosophy behind traditional Chinese medicine, which, derived mainly from [[Taoist]] philosophy, reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. Because its theory predates use of the scientific method, it has received various criticisms based on scientific thinking. Even though there are physically verifiable anatomical or histological bases for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians, for instance skin conductance measurements show increases at the predicted points.

Today, science and technology establishment in the People's Republic of China is growing rapidly. Even as many Chinese scientists debate what institutional arrangements will be best for Chinese science, reforms of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] continue. The average age of researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has dropped by nearly ten years between 1991 and 2003. However, many of them are educated in the United States and other foreign countries.

Chinese university undergraduate and graduate enrollments more than doubled from 1995 to 2005. The universities now have more cited PRC papers than CAS in the Science Citation Index. Some Chinese scientists say CAS is still ahead on overall quality of scientific work but that lead will only last five to ten years.

Several Chinese immigrants to the United States have also been awarded the Nobel Prize,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Other overseas ethnic [[Chinese people|Chinese]] that have achieved success in sciences include [[Fields Medal]] recipient [[Shing-Tung Yau]] and [[Terence Tao]], and [[Turing Award]] recipient Andrew Yao. [[Tsien Hsue-shen]] was a prominent scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, while [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] contributed to the Manhattan Project (some argue she never received the Nobel Prize unlike her colleagues [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and [[Chen Ning Yang]] due to sexism by the selection committee). Others include [[Charles K. Kao]], a pioneer in fiber optics technology, and [[Dr. David Ho]], one of the first scientists to propose that AIDS was caused by a virus, thus subsequently developing combination antiretroviral therapy to combat it. Dr. Ho was named [[TIME]] magazine's 1996 Man of the Year. In 2015, [[Tu Youyou]], a pharmaceutical chemist, became the first native Chinese scientist, born and educated and carried out research exclusively in the People's Republic of China, to receive the Nobel Prize in natural sciences.

==Science in India==

{{Main|Science and technology in India}}

The [[Science and technology in ancient India|earliest applications of science in India]] took place in the context of medicine, metallurgy, construction technology (such as ship building, manufacture of cement and paints) and in textile production and dyeing. But in the process of understanding chemical processes, led to some theories about physical processes and the forces of nature that are today studied as specific topics within the fields of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india_resource.tripod.com/physics.htm History of Indian Science and Technology: History of Physics and Chemistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mathematical concepts today were contributed by Indian mathematicians like [[Aryabhata]].

There was really no place for scientists in the Indian caste system. Thus while there were/are castes for the learned [[brahmins]], the warriors [[kshatriyas]], the traders [[vaishyas]] and the menial workers [[shudras]], maybe even the bureaucrats (the kayasths) there was/is hardly any formal place in the social hierarchy for a people who discover new knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul25/articles30.htm|title=articles30.htm - jul25 - currsci - Indian Academy of Sciences|website=Ias.ac.in|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or invent new devices based on the recently discovered knowledge, even though scientific temper has always been in India, in the form of logic, reasoning and method of acquiring knowledge. Its therefore no wonder that some Indians quickly learned to value science, especially those belonging to the privileged Brahmin caste during the British colonial rule that lasted over two centuries. Some Indians did succeed to achieve notable success and fame, examples include [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jagdish Chandra Bose]] and [[C. V. Raman]] even though they belonged to different castes. The science communication had begun with publication of a scientific journal, Asiatick Researches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1784as.html|title=1784 - Calcutta - Asiatic Society of Bengal - History of Scholarly Societies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1788. Thereafter, the science communication in India has evolved in many facets. Following this, there has been a continuing development in the formation of scientific institutions and publication of scientific literature. Subsequently, scientific publications also started appearing in Indian languages by the end of eighteenth century. The publication of ancient scientific literature and textbooks at mass scale started in the beginning of nineteenth century. The scientific and technical terms, however, had been a great difficulty for a long time for popular science writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

A '''science slam''' is a scientific talk where scientists present their own [[scientific research]] work in a given time frame - usually 10 minutes - in front of a non-expert audience. The focus lies on teaching current science to a diverse audience in an entertaining way. The presentation is judged by the audience.&lt;ref name="Science in the Pub"&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/wis/fut/bko/en6483164.htm Article on "Science in the Pub"]&lt;/ref&gt; A science slam is a form of [[science communication]].

'''Scientism''' is an [[ideology]] that promotes [[science]] as the purportedly [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] means by which society should determine [[normative]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] values. The term ''scientism'' is generally used critically, pointing to the cosmetic application of science in unwarranted situations not amenable to application of the [[scientific method]] or similar scientific standards.  

In [[philosophy of science]], the term ''scientism'' frequently implies a critique of the more extreme expressions of [[logical positivism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Rey | first= Abel | title = Review of ''La Philosophie Moderne'' | journal = The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods |volume = 6.2 |date = 1909 | pages = 51–3 | doi= 10.2307/2011609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Abraham | last = Maslow | quote = There are criticisms of orthodox, 19th Century scientism and I intend to continue with this enterprise | title = Toward a Psychology of Being | chapter = Preface | edition = 1st|year=1962}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used by social scientists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hayek | title = The Counter Revolution of Science: Studies on the Abuse of Reason | publisher = Liberty Fund | date = June 1, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; philosophers of science such as [[Karl Popper]],&lt;ref name = Popper-Hacohen&gt;{{cite book |last = Hacohen|first = Malachi Haim| title = Karl Popper: the formative years, 1902–1945: politics and philosophy in interwar Vienna | date = 2002| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-89055-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophers such as [[Hilary Putnam]]&lt;ref name= Putnam&gt;{{cite book| last= Putnam| first= Hilary | title = Renewing Philosophy |date= 1992|publisher= Harvard University Press|location= Cambridge, MA|pages=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tzvetan Todorov]]&lt;ref&gt; [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov, Tzvetan]]. ''The Imperfect Garden: the legacy of humanism''. Princeton University Press. 2001. Pg. 20. "Scientism does not eliminate the will but decides that since the results of science are valid for everyone, this will must be something shared, not individual. In practice, the individual must submit to the collectivity, which "knows" better than he does."&lt;/ref&gt; to describe (for example) the dogmatic endorsement of scientific methodology and the reduction of all knowledge to only that which is measured or confirmatory.&lt;ref name=Outhwaite22&gt;{{Citation | last = Outhwaite | first = William | origyear = 1988 | title = Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers | publisher = Polity Press | edition = 2nd | date = 2009 | page = 22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, scientism is often interpreted as science applied "in excess". The term ''scientism'' has two senses:

# The improper usage of [[science]] or scientific claims.{{Sfn | Peterson | 2003 | p = 753 | ps =: 'the best way to understand the charge of scientism is as a kind of logical fallacy involving improper usage of science or scientific claims'}}  This usage applies equally in contexts where science might not apply,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | place = Denver | url = http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~mryder/scientism_este.html | title = Scientism | first = Martin | last = Ryder | publisher = University of Colorado | accessdate = July 5, 2007|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630205732/http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~mryder/scientism_este.html|archivedate=2012-06-30|deadurl=yes|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as when the topic is perceived as beyond the scope of [[Scientific method|scientific inquiry]], and in contexts where there is insufficient [[empirical evidence]] to justify a scientific conclusion. It includes an excessive deference to the claims of scientists or an uncritical eagerness to accept any result described as scientific. This can be a [[counterargument]] to [[argument from authority|appeals to scientific authority]]. It can also address the attempt to apply "hard science" methodology and claims of certainty to the [[social science]]s, which Friedrich Hayek described in ''[[The Counter-Revolution of Science]]'' (1952) as being impossible, because that methodology involves attempting to eliminate the "human factor", while social sciences (including his own field of [[economics]]) center almost purely on [[praxeology|human action]].

It is also sometimes used to describe universal applicability of the scientific method and approach, and the view that [[empirical science]] constitutes the most authoritative [[worldview]] or the most valuable part of human learning—to the complete exclusion of other viewpoints, such as historical, philosophical, economic or cultural worldviews. It has been defined as "the view that the characteristic inductive methods of the natural sciences are the only source of genuine factual knowledge and, in particular, that they alone can yield true knowledge about man and society".&lt;ref&gt;Allan Bullock &amp; Stephen Trombley (Eds), ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought,'' London: Harper Collins, 1999, p.775&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''scientism'' is also used by historians, philosophers, and cultural critics to highlight the possible dangers of lapses towards excessive [[reductionism]] in all fields of human knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Collins | title = A Critical Analysis of Competency-based Systems in Adult Education | journal = Adult Education Quarterly | date = March 20, 1983 | volume = 33 | number = 3 | pages = 174–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Irwin | last = Chargaff | title = In Dispraise of Reductionism | journal = BioScience | volume = 47 | number = 11 |date= Dec 1997 | pages = 795–7 | doi= 10.2307/1313101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = R Keith | last = Sawyer | title = Connecting Culture, Psychology and Biology: Essay Review on Inghilleri's From Subjective Experience to Cultural Change | journal = Human Development | volume = 43 | date =  2000 | pages = 56–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New Republic"&gt;{{cite web|last= Wieseltier|first= Leon|title= Crimes Against Humanities|url= https://newrepublic.com/article/114548/leon-wieseltier-responds-steven-pinkers-scientism|accessdate= 21 December 2013|date=4 September 2013|quote= His essay, a defense of "scientism," is a long exercise in assimilating humanistic inquiries into scientific ones.

For [[social theorist]]s in the tradition of [[Max Weber]], such as [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Max Horkheimer]], the concept of scientism relates significantly to the philosophy of [[positivism]], but also to the cultural [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] for modern [[Western civilization]].&lt;ref name=Outhwaite22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brunkhorst|first= Hauke|title= On Max Horkheimer: New Perspectives|date= 1995|publisher= The MIT Press|isbn= 0262522071|pages= 74|editor= Seyla Benhabib|editor2= Wolfgang Bonss|editor3= John McCole|chapter= Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British novelist [[Sara Maitland]] has called scientism a "myth as pernicious as any sort of [[fundamentalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;

Reviewing the references to scientism in the works of contemporary scholars, Gregory R.

# It is used to criticize a totalizing view of science as if it were capable of describing ''all'' [[reality]] and [[knowledge]], or as if it were the ''only'' true way to acquire knowledge about reality and the nature of things;

An example of this second usage is to label as scientism any attempt to claim science as the only or primary source of human values (a traditional domain of [[ethics]]) or as the source of [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] and purpose (a traditional domain of [[religion]] and related [[worldviews]]).

The term ''scientism'' was popularized by the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]] winner [[F.A. Hayek]], who defined it as the "slavish imitation of the method and language of Science".&lt;ref name="Hayek1942"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hayek |first=F.

[[Mikael Stenmark]] proposes the expression ''scientific expansionism'' as a synonym of scientism.&lt;ref name="expansionism"&gt;{{Citation | first = Mikael | last = Stenmark | contribution = Scientism | editor-first = J Wentzel Vrede | editor-last = van Huyssteen | title = Encyclopedia of science and religion | edition = 2nd | publisher = Thomson Gale | date = 2003 | page = 783}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Encyclopedia of science and religion'', he writes that, while the [[doctrine]]s that are described as scientism have many possible forms and varying degrees of ambition, they share the idea that the boundaries of science (that is, typically the natural sciences) could and should be expanded so that something that has not been previously considered as a subject pertinent to science can now be understood as part of science (usually with science becoming the sole or the main arbiter regarding this area or dimension).&lt;ref name="expansionism" /&gt;

According to Stenmark, the strongest form of scientism states that science has no boundaries and that all human problems and all aspects of human endeavor, with due time, will be dealt with and solved by science alone.&lt;ref name ="expansionism"/&gt; This idea has also been called the [[Myth of Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = G | last1 = Monastra | first2 = MM | last2 = Zarandi | title = Science and the Myth of Progress | date = 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. F. Schumacher]], in his ''[[A Guide for the Perplexed]]'', criticized scientism as an impoverished world view confined solely to what can be counted, measured and weighed. "The architects of the modern worldview, notably [[Galileo]] and [[Descartes]], assumed that those things that could be weighed, measured, and counted were more true than those that could not be quantified. If it couldn't be counted, in other words, it didn't count."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.schumachersociety.org/publications/orr_92.html | first = David | last = Orr | contribution = Environmental Literacy: Education as if the Earth Mattered | title = Twelfth Annual EF Schumacher Lectures |date=October 1992 | place = Great Barrington, [[Massachusetts|MA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual historian [[T.J. Jackson Lears]] argues there has been a recent reemergence of "nineteenth-century positivist faith that a reified 'science' has discovered (or is about to discover) all the important truths about human life. Precise measurement and rigorous calculation, in this view, are the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies." Lears specifically identifies Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]]'s work as falling in this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lears|first=T.J.

Gray]] and [[Thomas Nagel]] have leveled similar criticisms against popular works by moral psychologist [[Jonathan Haidt]], neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], and writer [[Malcolm Gladwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=John|title=The Knowns and the Unknowns|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/102760/righteous-mind-haidt-morality-politics-scientism|publisher=The New Republic|date= 20 April 2012|accessdate=22 December 2013|quote=These theories show the continuing appeal of scientism—the modern belief that scientific inquiry can enable us to resolve conflicts and dilemmas in contexts where traditional sources of wisdom and practical knowledge seem to have failed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=John|title=Malcolm Gladwell Is America's Best-Paid Fairy-Tale Writer|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/115467/malcolm-gladwells-david-and-goliath-fairy-tales|publisher=The New Republic|date= 22 November 2013|accessdate=22 December 2013|quote=... the mix of moralism and scientism is an ever-winning formula, as Gladwell's career demonstrates.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagel|first=Thomas|title=The Facts Fetish|date= 20 October 2010|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/78546/the-facts-fetish-morality-science|publisher=The New Republic|accessdate=22 December 2013|quote=Harris urges that we use scientific knowledge about humans to discover what will maximize their well-being, and thereby to discover the right way to live.

Genetic biologist Austin L. Hughes wrote in conservative journal ''[[The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis]]'' that scientism has much in common with superstition: "the stubborn insistence that something...has powers which no evidence supports."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Austin| last = Hughes| title = The Folly of Scientism | journal = The New Atlantis | date = Fall 2012 | volume = 37 | pages = 32–50 | url = https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-folly-of-scientism | access-date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance to debates about science and religion==
Several scholars use the term to describe the work of vocal critics of religion-as-such. Individuals associated with [[New Atheism]] have garnered this label from both religious and non-religious scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Robinson | first = Marilynne | title = Hysterical Scientism: The Ecstasy of Richard Dawkins | newspaper = Harper's Magazine |date=Nov 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Stephen LeDrew on his 'The Evolution of Atheism' an Interview | url = http://positivists.org/blog/archives/5325 |date= 10 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian [[John Haught]] argues that [[Daniel Dennett]] and other new atheists subscribe to a belief system of [[scientific naturalism]], which holds the central dogma that "only nature, including humans and our creations, is real: that God does not exist; and that science alone can give us complete and reliable knowledge of reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haught|first=John|title=God and the New Atheism: A Critical Response to Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens|date=2008|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haught argues that this belief system is self-refuting since it requires its adherents to assent to beliefs that violate its own stated requirements for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haught|first=John|title=God and the New Atheism: A Critical Response to Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens|date=2008|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Philosopher Peter Williams argues that it is only by conflating science with scientism that new atheists feel qualified to "pontificate on metaphysical issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Peter S.|title=C.S. Lewis vs. the New Atheists|date=2013|publisher=Paternoster|page=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] responded to religious criticism of his book ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon]]'' by saying that accusations of scientism "[are] an all-purpose, wild-card smear... When someone puts forward a scientific theory that [religious critics] really don't like, they just try to discredit it as 'scientism'. But when it comes to [[facts]], and explanations of facts, science is the only game in town".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/200604100019 | first = Sholto | last = Byrnes | title = When it comes to facts, and explanations of facts, science is the only game in town | newspaper = New Statesman | date = 10 April 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111016131703/http://www.newstatesman.com/200604100019 | archive-date = 16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-religious scholars have also linked New Atheist thought with scientism. Atheist philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]] argues that neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] conflates all empirical knowledge with that of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagel|first=Thomas|title=The Facts Fetish|date= 20 October 2010|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/78546/the-facts-fetish-morality-science|publisher=The New Republic|accessdate=22 December 2013|quote=He says that the discovery of moral truth depends on science, but this turns out to be misleading, because he includes under "science" all empirical knowledge of what the world is like...Harris urges that we use scientific knowledge about humans to discover what will maximize their well-being, and thereby to discover the right way to live.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] argues that [[Christopher Hitchens]] possesses an "old-fashioned scientistic notion of what counts as evidence" that reduces knowledge to what can and cannot be proven by scientific procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eagleton|first=Terry|title=Reason, Faith, and Revolution: Reflections on the God Debate|date=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnostic philosopher [[Anthony Kenny]] has also criticized New Atheist philosopher [[Alexander Rosenberg]]'s ''The Atheist's Guide to Reality'' for resurrecting a self-refuting [[epistemology]] of [[logical positivism]] and reducing all knowledge of the universe to the discipline of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kenny|first=Anthony|title=True Believers|journal=Times Literary Supplement|date=June 2012|quote=The main tenets of this philosophy are bracingly summed up in a series of questions and answers: Is there a God? No. What is the nature of reality? What physics says it is.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]], founder of [[The Skeptics Society]], draws a parallel between scientism and traditional religious movements, pointing to the [[cult of personality]] that develops around some scientists in the public eye. He defines scientism as a worldview that encompasses natural explanations, eschews [[supernatural]] and [[paranormal]] speculations, and embraces empiricism and [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shermer | first = Michael | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000AA74F-FF5F-1CDB-B4A8809EC588EEDF | title = The Shamans of Scientism | journal = [[Scientific American]] |date=June 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iranian scholar [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] has stated that in the [[Western world]], many will accept the [[ideology]] of modern science, not as "simple ordinary science", but as a replacement for religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chittick | first = William | title = The Essential Seyyed Hossein Nasr | publisher = World Wisdom | location = Bloomington | date = 2007 | isbn = 1-933316-38-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory R. Peterson writes that "for many theologians and philosophers, scientism is among the greatest of intellectual sins".&lt;ref name="Peterson2003"/&gt;

==Philosophy of science==
{{main article|Philosophy of science}}
In his essay ''Against Method'', [[Paul Feyerabend]] characterizes science as "an essentially anarchic enterprise"{{Sfn | Feyerabend | 1993 | p = vii | ps =: '[[Imre Lakatos]] loved to embarrass serious opponents with jokes and irony and so I, too, occasionally wrote in a rather ironical vein. An example is the end of Chapter 1: 'anything goes' is not a 'principle' I hold... but the terrified exclamation of a rationalist who takes a closer look at history'}} and argues emphatically that science merits no exclusive monopoly over "dealing in knowledge" and that scientists have never operated within a distinct and narrowly self-defined tradition. He depicts the process of contemporary scientific education as a mild form of indoctrination, aimed at "making the history of science duller, simpler, more uniform, more 'objective' and more easily accessible to treatment by strict and unchanging rules."{{Sfn | Feyerabend | 1993 | pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=8y-FVtrKeSYC&amp;lpg=PP9&amp;pg=PA11  viii, 9, 11]}}

Science must be protected from ideologies; and societies, especially democratic societies, must be protected from science... In a democracy scientific institutions, research programmes, and suggestions must therefore be subjected to public control, there must be a separation of state and science just as there is a separation between state and religious institutions, and science should be taught as one view among many and not as the one and only road to truth and reality.|Feyerabend|''Against Method''|p. viii{{Sfn | Feyerabend | 1993 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=8y-FVtrKeSYC&amp;lpg=PP9&amp;pg=PA11  viii]}}}}

==Rhetoric of science==
{{main article|Rhetoric of science}}
Thomas M. Lessl argues that religious themes persist in what he calls scientism, the [[public rhetoric]] of science.&lt;ref name="Lessl1996"/&gt; There are two methodologies that illustrate this idea of scientism. One is the epistemological approach, the assumption that the scientific method trumps other ways of knowing and the ontological approach, that the rational mind reflects the world and both operate in knowable ways. According to Lessl, the ontological approach is an attempt to "resolve the conflict between rationalism and skepticism". Lessl also argues that without scientism, there would not be a scientific culture.&lt;ref name="Lessl1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lessl|first=Thomas M.|title=Naturalizing science: Two episodes in the evolution of a rhetoric of scientism|journal=Western Journal of Communication|date=Fall 1996|volume=60|issue=4|page=1|doi=10.1080/10570319609374555}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3/5/2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and philosophy==
Philosopher of religion [[Keith Ward]] has said scientism is philosophically inconsistent or even [[self-refuting]], as the truth of the statements "no statements are true unless they can be proven scientifically (or logically)" or "no statements are true unless they can be shown empirically to be true" cannot themselves be proven scientifically, logically, or empirically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Keith | last = Ward | author-link = Keith Ward | title = [[Is Religion Dangerous?]]|year=2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=William P |last=Alston |chapter=Religious language and verificationism |editor-first=Paul K |editor-last=Moser |editor2-first=Paul |editor2-last=Copan |title= The Rationality of Theism |location= New York |publisher= Routledge |date= 2003 |isbn= 0-415-26332-8 |pages= 26–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationalization and modernity==
{{Main article|Rationalization (sociology)}}
In the introduction to his collected oeuvre on the [[sociology of religion]], [[Max Weber]] asks why "the scientific, the artistic, the political, or the economic development [elsewhere]… did not enter upon that path of rationalization which is peculiar to the Occident?" According to the distinguished German social theorist, [[Jürgen Habermas]], "For Weber, the intrinsic (that is, not merely [[contingent]]) relationship between [[modernity]] and what he called 'Occidental rationalism' was still self-evident." Weber described a process of rationalisation, [[disenchantment]] and the "disintegration of religious world views"  that resulted in modern [[secularisation|secular]] societies and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="Habermas1990"&gt;Habermas, Jürgen (1990), ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'', Polity Press, {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|"Modernization" was introduced as a technical term only in the 1950s. It is the mark of a theoretical approach that takes up Weber's problem but elaborates it with the tools of social-scientific [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]]… The theory of modernization performs two abstractions on Weber's concept of "modernity". It dissociates "modernity" from its modern European origins and stylizes it into a spatio-temporally neutral model for processes of social development in general. Furthermore, it breaks the internal connections between modernity and the historical context of Western [[rationalism]], so that processes of modernization… [are] no longer burdened with the idea of a completion of modernity, that is to say, of a goal state after which "[[postmodern]]" developments would have to set in.  …Indeed it is precisely modernization research that has contributed to the currency of the expression "postmodern" even among social scientists.||author=[[Jürgen Habermas]]|title=''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]''}}

Habermas is critical of pure [[instrumental rationality]], arguing that the "Social Life–World" is better suited to literary expression, the former being "intersubjectively accessible experiences" that can be generalized in a [[formal language]], while the latter "must generate an intersubjectivity of mutual understanding in each concrete case":&lt;ref name="Olson2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=R. |last=Olson |date=2008 |title=Science and scientism in nineteenth-century Europe |publisher= University of Illinois Press |isbn= 978-0-252-07433-2 |lccn= 2007005146 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=h8C7fe50J0AC&amp;pg=PA1 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J |last = Habermas |first2=JJ |last2=Shapiro |date=1971 |title=Toward a rational society: student protest, science, and politics | format = paperback |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0-8070-4177-2 |lccn= 73121827 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cW7PmVj7kzQC&amp;pg=PA50 |pages= 50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation |The world with which literature deals is the world in which human beings are born and live and finally die; the world in which they love and hate, in which they experience triumph and humiliation, hope and despair; the world of sufferings and enjoyments, of madness and common sense, of silliness, cunning and wisdom; the world of social pressures and individual impulses, of reason against passion, of instincts and conventions, of shared language and unsharable feelings and sensations…||author=[[Aldous Huxley]]|title=''[[Literature and Science]]''}}

==Reception==
Critical response to the book was positive. [[Jane Brody|Jane E. Brody]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called it "a fast-moving, informative and thoroughly enjoyable chronicle, with amusing anecdotes, legends and interesting sidelights that reflect the personalities, lives and times of the men who shaped our nation scientifically." She noted that "the authors have kept their writing free of chauvinism," and that "[m]ost of the scientific concepts are well enough explained so that even the newcomer to science should be able to grasp at least the essence of them."&lt;ref&gt;"Science For Teen-Agers," ''New York Times'', November 5, 1967, p. BR216.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same issue the book was included among seventy-five recommended titles selected by the Children's Editor of the newspaper's Book Review, described as an "[i]nformative, thoroughly enjoyable chronicle of the development of science in our country."&lt;ref&gt;"Seventy-Five Recommended Titles," ''New York Times'', November 5, 1967, p. BR233.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly|Publishers' Weekly]]'' stated that "[t]o read the index ... is to read the names of the men and of their discoveries in science in America, from the earliest days ... to the space age. To read the book is to become familiar with the men and their contributions to science."&lt;ref&gt;"Other Science Topics," ''Publishers' Weekly'', November 13, 1967, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Basalia, writing for ''[[Library Journal]]'', called the book "a first-rate history of American science and technology for high-school students ... cover[ing] major American technical discoveries as well as our contributions to the purely theoretical aspects of science." He found "much to be praised ... the book is intelligently conceived, carefully organized, clearly written, and handsomely designed. Unfortunately, the illustrations do not do justice to [the] excellent text."&lt;ref&gt;"De CAMP, L. Sprague &amp; Catherine C. De Camp. ''The Story of Science in America''," ''Library Journal'', December 15, 1967, p. 4620.&lt;/ref&gt;

H. D. Allen in the ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'' wrote that the book's story "makes fascinating reading," and that "[w]hile the treatment of any one discipline may at first seem superficial and chatty, the total impact is most impressive, for the reader is left with an acquaintance with the leading figures of the age of science and some appreciation of how the contribution of each influenced a way of life." He concluded "The breadth of scientific knowledge which this book represents is remarkable, as is the skill with which it has been set down and the effortlessness with which it reads."&lt;ref&gt;"Books: Roster Of Science," ''Montreal Gazette'', January 27, 1968, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Booklist|The Booklist]]'' called it "[a] wide-ranging survey [that] reflects the authors' humanistic interests as well as their familiarity with several branches of science and their extensive background reading."&lt;ref&gt;"Books for young adults," ''The Booklist'', February 15, 1968, p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hal Clement|Harry C. Stubbs]] in ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'' included it among "half a dozen books dealing ... with the history of science [that] I can recommend [both] to nonscientists as guides toward the Light [and] to scientists and science teachers as reminders that what we know was long, slow, and hard in coming." He noted that it "give[s] us a series of fascinating biographical and anecdotal items strung loosely on the thread of developing scientific knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;"Views on Science Books," ''The Horn Book Magazine'', February 1968, pp. 81-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Morrison|Philip]] and Phylis Morrison in ''[[Scientific American]]'' felt it "manages to convey a sense of coherence, even though it deals at staccato length with so many men, trends and ideas ... The reason is partly in the expert writing--smooth, unusually candid, cheerful and sometimes a bit condescending (as in the two or three pages about Veblen)." They add that "[n]ot all the dicta of the authors seem reasonable, but to find any personal judgment at work is so rare in this kind of pedagogy that one is pleased by the De Camps even when one disagrees with them."&lt;ref&gt;"A Christmas selection of books on science for younger readers," ''Scientific American'', December 1968, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;
