[[File:Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) - The Last Supper (1495-1498).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], 1498, depicts the apostles sitting at a long table. This kind of table was unknown at the time and place of the [[Last Supper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artinsociety.com/on-the-trail-of-the-last-supper.html |first=Philip |last=McCouat |title=On the trail of the last supper |work=Journal of Art in Society |year=2014 |accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An '''anachronism''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνά}} {{lang|grc-Latn|ana}}, "against" and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}} {{lang|grc-Latn|khronos}}, "time") is a [[chronology|chronological]] inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of persons, events, objects, or customs from different periods of time. The most common type of anachronism is an object misplaced in time, but it may be a verbal expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a plant or animal, a custom, or anything else associated with a particular period in time that is placed outside its proper temporal domain.

An anachronism may be either intentional or unintentional. Intentional anachronisms may be introduced into a literary or artistic work to help a contemporary audience engage more readily with a historical period. Anachronism can also be used for purposes of rhetoric, comedy, or shock. Unintentional anachronisms may occur when a writer, artist, or performer is unaware of differences in technology, language, customs, attitudes, or fashions between different historical eras.

==Types== 
[[Image:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493) shows [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] in scholar's clothing of the book's time, 1,800 years too modern for Aristotle]]

=== Parachronism &lt;!-- 'Parachronism' redirects here--&gt;===
A '''parachronism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|παρά}}, "on the side", and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, "time") is anything that appears in a time period in which it is not normally found (though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible).

This may be an object, idiomatic expression, technology, philosophical idea, musical style, material, custom, or anything else so closely bound to a particular time period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era.  They may be objects or ideas that were once common but are now considered rare or inappropriate.  They can take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion.

Examples of parachronisms could include a suburban housewife in the United States around 1960 using a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]] for laundry (well after [[washing machine]]s had become the norm); or a teenager from that time period being an avid fan of [[ragtime]] music. Often, a parachronism is identified when a work based on a particular era's state of knowledge is read within the context of a later era—with a different state of knowledge.  Many scientific works that rely on theories that have later been discredited have become anachronistic with the removal of those underpinnings, and works of [[speculative fiction]] often find their speculations outstripped by real-world technological developments or scientific discoveries.

=== Prochronism &lt;!-- 'Prochronism' redirects here--&gt;===
A '''prochronism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πρό}}, "before", and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, "time") is an impossible anachronism which occurs when an object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place, and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time (e.g. ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] at the top of the article). A prochronism may be an object not yet developed, a verbal expression that had not yet been coined, a philosophy not yet formulated, a breed of animal not yet evolved (or perhaps engineered), or use of a technology that had not yet been created.

===Behavioral and cultural anachronism===
The intentional use of older, often obsolete cultural artifacts may be regarded as anachronistic. For example, it could be considered anachronistic for a modern-day person to wear a [[top hat]], write with a [[quill]], or carry on a conversation in Latin. Such choices may reflect an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] or an [[aesthetic]] preference.

[[Image:Constantin Lecca - Infratirea moldovenilor si muntenilor.jpg|thumb|''Moldavians and [[Muntenia]]ns Become Brothers'': 19th-century flags in 16th-century scene]]
== Politically motivated anachronism ==
Some writings and works of art promoting a political, nationalist or revolutionary cause use anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is. For example, the 19th-century Romanian painter [[Constantin Lecca]] depicts the peace agreement between [[Bogdan III cel Orb|Ioan Bogdan Voievod]] and [[Radu cel Mare|Radu Voievod]]—two leaders in Romania's 16th-century history—with the flags of [[Moldavia]] (blue-red) and of [[Wallachia]] (yellow-blue) seen in the background. These flags date only from the 1830s. Here anachronism promotes legitimacy for the unification of Moldavia and  Wallachia into the [[Kingdom of Romania]] at the time the painting was made.

== Art and literature ==
[[File:Lucas van Leyden - Lot and his Daughters - WGA12932.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucas van Leyden]]'s 1520 painting ''Lot and His Daughters'' shows Biblical [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] as a typical Dutch city of the painter's time.]]
Anachronism is used especially in works of imagination that rest on a historical basis. Anachronisms may be introduced in many ways: for example, in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods, or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history. They vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation. It is only since the close of the 18th century that this kind of deviation from historical reality has jarred on a general audience.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Sir [[Walter Scott]] justified the use of anachronism in historical literature: "It is necessary, for exciting interest of any kind, that the subject assumed should be, as it were, translated into the manners as well as the language of the age we live in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Scott |authorlink=Walter Scott |title=Ivanhoe; a Romance |place=Edinburgh |year=1820 |volume=1 |page=xvii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzQJAAAAQAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as fashions move on, such attempts to use anachronisms to engage an audience may have quite the reverse effect, as the details in question are increasingly recognized as belonging neither to the historical era being represented, nor to the present, but to the intervening period in which the artwork was created. "Nothing becomes obsolete like a period vision of an older period", writes [[Anthony Grafton]]; "Hearing a mother in a historical movie of the 1940s call out 'Ludwig! [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]! Come in and practice your piano now!' we are jerked from our suspension of disbelief by what was intended as a means of reinforcing it, and plunged directly into the American bourgeois world of the filmmaker."&lt;ref&gt;Grafton 1990, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anachronism can also be an aesthetic choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174817-for-infidelity-reconsidering-aesthetic-anachronism/|title=For Infidelity: Reconsidering Aesthetic Anachronism|last=Potthast|first=Jane|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2013-09-18|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anachronisms abound in the works of [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Raphael Santi: His Life and His Works|last=von Wolzogen|first=Alfred Freiherr|publisher=[[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]]|year=1866|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZhAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shakespeare and the Uses of Antiquity: An Introductory Essay|last=Martindale |first=Michelle |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2005 |isbn=9781134848508 |pages=121–125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDwrK5FNnN0C&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in those of less celebrated painters and playwrights of earlier times. Anachronisms can exist in ancient texts. [[Carol Meyers]] says that these anachronisms can be used to better understand the stories by asking what the anachronism represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/02/14/276782474/the-genesis-of-camels |title=Archaeology Find: Camels In 'Bible' Are Literary Anachronisms|last=Montagne|first=Renee |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=2014-02-14|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated anachronisms and historical errors can become an accepted part of popular culture, such as Roman legionaries that wear leather armor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-03-31/time-meddlers-anachronisms-in-print-and-on-film|title=Time meddlers: anachronisms in print and on film|last=Cole|first=Tom|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=2011-03-31|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumb|[[Dinosaurs]] co-existing with [[hominid]]s, as here in ''[[The Flintstones]]'', is a relatively common anachronistic depiction in comics and animated cartoons.]]
=== Comical anachronism ===
[[Comedy]] fiction set in the past may use anachronism for humorous effect. Comedic anachronism can be used to make serious points about both historical and modern society, such as drawing parallels to political or social conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174969-hollywood-history-and-the-art-of-the-big-anachronism/|title=Hollywood, History, and the Art of the Big Anachronism|last=van Riper|first=A. Bowdoin|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2013-09-26|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future anachronism === &lt;!-- Section is linked from the redirected [Future anachronism] article; use caution. --&gt;
{{see also|Retrofuturism}}
[[File:Amazing_stories_193107.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In the future envisioned on this 1931 cover of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', [[Propeller (aeronautics) |propeller airplanes]] would coexist with [[space technology]] advanced enough for a large-scale [[colonization of Mars]].]]

Even with careful research, [[science fiction]] writers risk anachronism as their works age because they cannot predict all political and technological change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Guide to Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction|last1=Athans|first1=Philip|authorlink1=Philip Athans|last2=Salvatore|first2=R. A.|authorlink2=R. A. Salvatore|publisher=[[Adams Media]]|year=2010|isbn=9781440507298|pages=167–170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9l5JO_FM6cC&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, many books and films nominally set in the mid-21st century or later refer to the [[Soviet Union]], to [[Saint Petersburg]] in Russia as [[Leningrad]], to [[Cold War|the continuing struggle between the Eastern and Western Blocs]] and to [[History of Germany (1945–90)|divided Germany and divided Berlin]]. ''[[Star Trek]]'' has suffered from future anachronisms; instead of "[[Retroactive continuity|retconning]]" these errors, the [[Star Trek (film)|2009 film]] retained them for consistency with older franchises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/living-the-star-trek-life/|title=Living the Star Trek life|last=Glaskowsky|first=Peter|work=[[CNET]]|date=2009-05-08|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Buildings or natural features, such as the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], can become out of place once they disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2002/12/06/AR2005033116653.html|title='Empire': Gangster Tale Sleeps With the Fishes|last=Hornaday|first=Ann|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2002-12-06|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language anachronism ===
[[Language]] anachronisms in novels and films are quite common, both intentional and unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/26/172955182/historical-vocab-when-we-get-it-wrong-does-it-matter|title=Historical Vocab: When We Get It Wrong, Does It Matter?|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|work=[[NPR]]|date=2013-02-26|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intentional anachronisms inform the audience more readily about a film set in the past. In this regard, language and pronunciation change so fast that most modern people (even many scholars) would find it difficult, or even impossible, to understand a film with dialogue in 15th-century English; thus, we [[Suspension of disbelief|willingly accept]] characters speaking an updated language, and modern [[slang]] and figures of speech are often used in these films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-3-26-00-on-language-anachronism.html|title=The Way We Live Now: 3-26-00: On Language; Anachronism |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2000-03-26|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subconscious anachronism==
[[File:RR5011-0017R.gif|thumbnail|right|A Russian commemorative coin depicting the meeting of Soviet and American troops at [[Torgau]] in 1945 shows the 50-star [[flag of the United States of America]], a flag not in use until 1960. The US flag used during the Second World War had 48 stars.]]

Unintentional anachronisms may occur even in what are intended as wholly objective and accurate records or representations of historic artifacts and artworks, because the recorder's perspective is conditioned by the assumptions and practices of his or her own times (a form of [[cultural bias]]). One example is the attribution of historically inaccurate beards to various [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Effigy|tomb effigies]] and figures in [[Medieval stained glass|stained glass]] in records made by English [[Antiquarian|antiquaries]] of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Working in an age in which beards were in fashion and widespread, the antiquaries seem to have subconsciously projected the fashion back into an era in which it was rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Oliver D. |title=Beards: true and false |journal=Church Monuments |volume=28 |year=2013 |pages=124–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time travel==
The extensive science fiction subgenre depicting [[Time travel in fiction| time travel]] in effect consists of deliberate, consciously created anachronisms, letting people of one time meet and interact with those of another time. Covers of time-travel books often depict deliberate anachronisms of this kind. For example, the cover of [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' (1992) features a portrait of Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] holding an [[AK-47]] rifle.

== In academia ==
In historical writing, the most common type of anachronism is the adoption of the political, social or cultural concerns and assumptions of one era to interpret or evaluate the events and actions of another. The anachronistic application of present-day perspectives to comment on the historical past is sometimes described as [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]]. [[Empiricism|Empiricist]] [[historian]]s, working in the traditions established by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in the 19th century, regard this as a great error, and a trap to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Davies |title=Empiricism and History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=Basingstoke |year=2003 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Marwick]] has argued that "a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that "anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |authorlink=Arthur Marwick |title=The New Nature of History: knowledge, evidence, language |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2001 |isbn=0-333-96447-0 |page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anachronism in academic writing is considered at best embarrassing, as in early-20th-century scholarship's use of [[Translatio imperii]], first formulated in the 12th century, to interpret 10th-century literature.

The use of anachronism in a rhetorical or hyperbolic sense is more complex. To refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as the First [[Reich]], for example, is technically inaccurate but may be a useful comparative exercise; the application of theory to works which predate [[Marxist]], [[Feminist]] or [[Freudian]] subjectivities is considered an essential part of theoretical practice. In most cases, however, the practitioner will acknowledge or justify the use or context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Detection of anachronism==

The ability to identify anachronisms may be employed as a critical and forensic tool to demonstrate the fraudulence of a document or artifact purporting to be from an earlier time. [[Anthony Grafton]] discusses, for example, the work of the 3rd-century philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], of [[Isaac Casaubon]] (1559–1614), and of [[Richard August Reitzenstein|Richard Reitzenstein]] (1861–1931), all of whom succeeded in exposing literary forgeries and plagiarisms, such as those included in the "[[Hermetica|Hermetic Corpus]]", through – among other techniques – the recognition of anachronisms.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton 1990, pp. 75–98.&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of anachronisms is an important element within the scholarly discipline of [[diplomatics]], the critical analysis of the forms of documents, developed by the [[Maurist]] scholar [[Jean Mabillon]] (1632–1707) and his successors [[René-Prosper Tassin]] (1697–1777) and [[Charles-François Toustain]] (1700–1754). The philosopher and reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote at the beginning of the 19th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The falsehood of a writing will often be detected, by its making direct mention of, or allusions more or less indirect to, some fact posterior to the date which it bears. ... ''The mention of posterior facts;'' – first indication of forgery.&lt;br&gt;

In a living language there are always variations in words, in the meaning of words, in the construction of phrases, in the manner of spelling, which may detect the age of a writing, and lead to legitimate suspicions of forgery. ... ''The use of words not used till after the date of the writing;'' – second indication of forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeremy |last=Bentham |authorlink=Jeremy Bentham |title=A Treatise on Judicial Evidence |editor-first=Étienne |editor-last=Dumont |editor-link=Pierre Étienne Louis Dumont |place=London |publisher=Baldwin, Cradock and Joy |year=1825 |page=140 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tMsDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exposure by [[Lorenzo Valla]] in 1440 of the so-called [[Donation of Constantine]], a decree purportedly issued by the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]] in either 315 or 317 AD, as a later forgery, depended to a considerable degree on the identification of anachronisms, such as references to the city of [[Constantinople]] (a name not in fact bestowed until 330 AD). A large number of apparent [[anachronisms in the Book of Mormon]] have served to convince critics that the book was written in the 19th century, and not, as its adherents claim, in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America. The use of 19th- and 20th-century [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] terminology demonstrates that the purported "[[Franklin Prophecy]]" (attributed to [[Benjamin Franklin]], who died in 1790) is a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/franklin_prophecy/print.asp |title=Anti-Semitic Myth: The Franklin "Prophecy" |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ""[[William Lynch speech]]", an address, supposedly delivered in 1712, on the control of slaves in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], is now considered to be a 20th-century forgery, partly on account of its use of anachronistic terms such as "program" and "refueling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/news/jimcrow/question/may04.htm |title=Is Willie Lynch's Letter Real? |last=Cobb |first=W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3489">'''Anthrobotics''' is the science of developing and studying [[robot]]s that are either entirely or in some way human-like.

The term ''anthrobotics'' was originally coined by Mark Rosheim in a paper entitled "Design of An Omnidirectional Arm" presented at the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] International Conference on Robotics and Automation, May 13–18, 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;2162–2167. Rosheim says he derived the term from "...[[Anthropomorphic]] and [[Robotics]] to distinguish the new generation of dexterous robots from its simple industrial robot forebears." The word gained wider recognition as a result of its use in the title of Rosheim's subsequent book ''Robot Evolution: The Development of Anthrobotics'', which focussed on facsimiles of human physical and psychological skills and attributes.

However, a wider definition of the term ''anthrobotics'' has been proposed, in which the meaning is derived from ''[[anthropology]]'' rather than ''anthropomorphic''. This usage includes robots that respond to input in a human-like fashion, rather than simply mimicking human actions, thus theoretically being able to respond more flexibly or to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. This expanded definition also encompasses robots that are situated in social environments with the ability to respond to those environments appropriately, such as [[insect]] robots, robotic [[pet]]s, and the like.

Anthrobotics is now taught at some [[university|universities]], encouraging students not only to design and build robots for environments beyond current industrial applications, but also to speculate on the future of robotics that are embedded in the world at large, as [[mobile phone]]s and [[computer]]s are today. In 2016 philosopher [[Luis de Miranda]] created the Anthrobotics Cluster at the [[University of Edinburgh]] "a platform of cross-disciplinary research that seeks to investigate some of the biggest questions that will need to be answered"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futurism.com/anthrobotics-where-the-human-ends-and-the-robot-begins/ |title=Anthrobotics: Where The Human Ends and the Robot Begins |publisher=Futurism |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the relationship between humans, robots and intelligent systems and "a think tank on the social spread of robotics, and also how automation is part of the definition of what humans have always been".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robohub.org/unity-between-human-and-social-machines-what-if-we-humans-were-anthrobots/ |title=Unity Between Human &amp; Social Machines: What If We Humans Were Anthrobots? |publisher=Robohub |date= |accessdate=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore the symbiotic relationship between humans and automated protocols.

'''Art valuation''', an art-specific subset of [[Valuation (finance)|financial valuation]], is the process of estimating either the [[market value]] of [[Work of art|works of art]]. As such, it is more of a financial rather than an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] concern, however, subjective views of cultural value play a part as well. Art valuation involves comparing data from multiple sources such as art [[auction|auction houses]], private and corporate collectors, [[curators]], art dealer activities, [[Art museum|gallerists]] (gallery owners), experienced consultants, and specialized market analysts to arrive at a value.&lt;ref name="Coslor"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|date=April 2016|title=Transparency in an opaque market: Evaluative frictions between "thick" valuation and "thin" price data in the art market|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300307|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=50|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8035.html|title=Talking Prices|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ertug|first=Gokhan|last2=Yogev|first2=Tamar|last3=Lee|first3=Yonghoon G.|last4=Hedström|first4=Peter|date=1 February 2016|title=The Art of Representation: How Audience-specific Reputations Affect Success in the Contemporary Art Field|url=http://amj.aom.org/content/59/1/113|journal=Academy of Management Journal|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=113–134|doi=10.5465/amj.2013.0621|issn=0001-4273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art valuation is accomplished not only for collection, investment, divestment, and financing purposes, but as part of [[Estate (law)|estate]] valuations, for charitable contributions, for [[tax planning]], insurance, and loan [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] purposes. This article deals with the valuation of works of [[fine art]], especially [[contemporary art]], at the top end of the international market, but similar principles apply to the valuation of less expensive art and [[antique]]s.

==Historic valuation and contemporary art==
The source of a work's artistic [[charisma]] has long been debated between artists who create and patrons who enable, but the charismatic power of artworks on those who would possess them is historically the initial driver of value.&lt;ref name="balfe"&gt;Balfe, Judith, Ed., Paying the piper: causes and consequences of art patronage, Univ. of Illinois Press, 1993, p.307. {{ISBN|978-0-252-06310-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jeffri"&gt;Jeffri, Joan, Philanthropy and the American artist: A historical overview, ''[[International Journal of Cultural Policy|The European Journal of Cultural Policy]]'', 3(2), 2009, pp. 207-233.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s that charismatic power started edging over to accommodate commercialized culture and a new industry of art, when aesthetic value fell from prominence to parity with [[Pop art]] and [[Andy Warhol]]'s idea of business art, a recognition that art has become a business and making money in business is an art.&lt;ref name="kuspit"&gt;Kuspit, Donald, [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/kuspit/kuspit3-6-07.asp Art Values or Money Values?], ARTnet.com, 6 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffri, Joan, ''Managing Uncertainty, The visual art market for contemporary art in the United States'', in Robertson, Iain, Understanding international art markets and management, Routledge, 2005, p. 127. {{ISBN|978-0-415-33956-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of many artists to follow Warhol is [[Jeff Koons]], a stockbroker turned artist who also borrowed imagery from popular culture and made millions.&lt;ref name="littlejohn"&gt;Littlejohn, David, Who is Jeff Koons and Why Are People Saying Such Terrible Things About Him? ''Artnews'', April 1993, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inflatable"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/14941205 Inflatable investments, The volatile art of Jeff Koons], ''[[The Economist]]'', 28 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

For collectors, the emotional connection felt toward a work or collection creates subjective personal value.&lt;ref name="htValue"&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/auctions/pages/common/help/howtovalueart.aspx How to Value Art], artnet.com, retrieved 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The weight assigned by such a collector to that subjective measure as a portion of a work's overall financial value may be greater than that by an art speculator not sharing the collector's emotional investment, however, non-economic value measures such as "Do I like it?" or "Does it speak to me?" still have economic effect because such measures can be deciding factors in a purchase.&lt;ref name="campbellRAJ"&gt;Campbell, R.A.J., [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID978467_code230208.pdf?abstractid=978467&amp;rulid=6936564&amp;mirid=1 Art as a Financial Investment], Erasmus Univ., Rotterdam, Maastricht Univ., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the Art Dealer's Association of America (ADAA) suggests that the key issues are authenticity, quality, rarity, condition, provenance and value. &lt;ref&gt;http://artdealers.org/sites/default/files/adaa_guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuing art==
[[File:Art Fair Enough Melbourne.jpg|380px|thumb|An art fair]]
Art valuation activity concerns itself with estimating market demand, estimating [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] capability of lots, works, and artists, the condition and [[provenance]] of works, and with valuation trends such as average sale price and mean estimates.&lt;ref name="artnetTrends"&gt;See artnet.com's [http://www.artnet.com/products/mt_faq.asp Market Trends FAQ].&lt;/ref&gt; As with other markets, the art market uses its own industry-specific [[Technical terminology|terms of art]] or vocabulary, for example, "bought-in", describing the disadvantageous situation occurring when a work or lot at auction is returned to its owner having been passed over, withdrawn or otherwise unsold.&lt;ref name="kendzulak"&gt;Kendzulak, Susan, definition of "[http://fineart.about.com/od/Glossary_B/g/Bought-In.htm Bought-In]", about.com. See also: [http://teachmefinance.com/Financial_Terms/Buying_in.html Buying in] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504231250/http://www.teachmefinance.com/Financial_Terms/Buying_in.html |date=2012-05-04 }}, teachmefinance.com. Accessed 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Valuing art is also necessary when a piece is to be used as collateral. The art-lending market has expanded to an estimated $15 billion to $19 billion of loans outstanding in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Art &amp; Finance Report 2016 |url=https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/art-finance/articles/art-finance-report.html |website=Deloitte |publisher=Deloitte &amp; ArtTactic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The shift in Asia towards investment in western art is a factor that has allowed art lending companies to launch offices in Asia as western works are often easier to use as collateral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/0b641fea-e17f-11e7-a8a4-0a1e63a52f9c |website=The Financial Times|title=London-based art fund targets $1bn lending in Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;



===Market demand===
As in the housing market, "[[comparables]]" are used to determine what level of demand similar items have in a current market. The freshness of the comparables is important because the art market is fluid and stale comparables will yield estimates that may have little relation to a work's current value.&lt;ref name="htValue" /&gt; Subject matter and the [[List of artistic media|medium]] of a work also affect market demand, as does rarity.

===Liquidity===
Liquidity in the art market means having artworks in very high demand and being able to sell those works without impediment. Art sales slow in downturns resulting in the market becoming more illiquid. There is a greater degree of liquidity risk facing the art investor than with other financial assets because there is a limited pool of potential buyers, and with artworks not reaching their reserve prices and not being sold, this has an effect on the auction prices.&lt;ref name="campbellRAJ" /&gt; In a divorce action between a couple who sought to divide a $102 million collection between them, the couple decided a sale would prove problematic because selling the entire collection and dividing the profit would saturate the market and drive down prices; in reporting on the case, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' described the case as a study on how people measure the value of art, and which counts for more — pragmatism or sentiment.&lt;ref name="seattle"&gt;Armstrong, Ken, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2018791206_larson29m.html The art of divorce: She gets the Monet, he gets the Renoir] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731233730/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2018791206_larson29m.html |date=31 July 2012 }}, Local News &amp;#124; ''The Seattle Times'', seattletimes.nwsource.com, 28 July 2012. Accessed 2012-7-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper reported that one of the two litigants had a more sentimental view of the value of the works, while the other had a more businesslike view, wanting balance and diversification.&lt;ref name="seattle"/&gt; The newspaper attempted to calculate the value of the many artworks at issue in the case by determining a per-square-inch price based on each piece's value divided by its dimension, to end up with a per-square-inch price to apply to the amount of wall space the businesslike litigant wanted to cover with the available art.&lt;ref name="seattle"/&gt; ''The Times'' ultimately concluded that using this formula as between the litigants, [[John Singer Sargent]]'s ''Dans les Oliviers à Capri'' was valued at $26,666.67 per square inch, that the sentimental litigant received $3,082 of appraised value per square inch while the businesslike litigant received $1,942 per square inch, but could cover more wall space.&lt;ref name="seattle"/&gt;

===Valuation trends===
Trends for values from the world's top auction houses are compared for study of market direction and how that direction affects given artists and works.&lt;ref name="higgs"&gt;Higgs, H. and Worthington, A., [http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=commpapers Financial Returns and Price Determinants in the Australian Art Market, 1973–2003], ''Economic Record'', 81:113–123, 2005-06. {{doi|10.1111/j.1475-4932.2005.00237.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worthington"&gt;Worthington, AC and Higgs, H, [http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&amp;context=commpapers A Note on Financial Risk, Return and Asset Pricing in Australian Modern and Contemporary Art], ''Journal of Cultural Economics'', 30(3), March 2006, 73-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Valuations for art sold at the market's top houses usually carry more weight than valuations from less established houses, as most of the top houses have hundreds of years of experience.&lt;ref name="worthington" /&gt;&lt;ref name="topHouses"&gt;Kendzulak, Susan, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140412120752/http://fineart.about.com/od/AuctionHouses/tp/Fine-Art-Auction-Houses-Established-Auction-Houses-For-The-Fine-Arts.htm Top 11 Fine Art Auction Houses], About.com lists the top houses (as of April 2014, and this list is volatile) as:
: 1 &amp; 2. Bonhams, and Bonhams &amp; Butterfields (London, New York, Los Angeles, Sydney, Hong Kong, Dubai, and San Francisco)
: 3. Christie's (London, Paris, Milan, New York, Hong Kong and Dubai)
: 4. Dorotheum (Vienna, Brussels, Düsseldorf, Munich, Milan and Rome)
: 5. Heritage Auctions (Dallas, Beverly Hills and New York)
: 6. Phillips de Pury &amp; Company (New York and London)
: 7. Sotheby's (London, Hong Kong, Geneva, Milan, Paris, Zürich, New York, Toronto, Doha)
: 8. Stockholms Auktionsverk (Stockholm)
: 9. Tajan (Paris and Monaco)
: 10. Villa Grisebach Auktionen (Berlin)
: 11. Waddington's (Toronto)&lt;/ref&gt;

Long term economic trends can have a great impact on the valuation of certain types of work. In recent decades the values of historic Russian and Chinese art have greatly benefited from increased wealth in those countries creating new and very rich collectors, as the values of [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] and [[Islamic art]] had earlier been boosted by oil wealth in the Arab world.

===Participant activity===
One of many factors in the primary market's price of a living artist's work is a dealer's contract with an artist: many dealers, as stakeholders in their artists' success, agree to buy their own stable of artists' work at auction in order to prevent price drops, to maintain price stability, or to increase perceived value, or all three, thus dealers bidding on their own artists at auction have a direct impact on the selling price for those artists' works and as a result, the valuation of those works.&lt;ref name="castles"&gt;[[Castlestone Management]], [http://i1.exhibit-e.com/collectionofmodernart/ce63a3fb.pdf Major Structural Themes Influencing the Art Market]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ThorntonOnHirst"&gt;Thornton, Sarah, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110615112418/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article6857843.ece The reinvention of artist Damien Hirst], ''The Sunday Times'', 2009-10-04, Retrieved 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research data===
Research data available from art auction houses such as Christie's, Sotheby's, [[Phillips (auctioneers)|Phillips]], [[Bonhams]], and [[Lyon &amp; Turnbull]] are those tracking [[market trend]]s such as yearly lot transactions, bought-in statistics, sales volume, price levels, and pre-auction estimates.&lt;ref name="MondianReport"&gt;For an example see artnet.com's sample report: [http://www.artnet.com/products/MT_sample.pdf Market Performance Report for Piet Mondian].&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also companies such as [[ArtTactic]] utilizing art auction data as providers of art market research analysis.&lt;ref name="arttactic"&gt;For example, arttactic's monthly [http://www.arttactic.com/newsletters.php Rawfacts newsletter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708175114/http://www.arttactic.com/newsletters.php |date=8 July 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Information available from internet-based art sale history databases generally does not include the condition of a work, a very important factor,&lt;ref name="htValue" /&gt; therefore the prices quoted in those databases reflect auction hammer price without other, crucial valuation factors. Additionally, the databases of auctioned work do not cover private sales of works, and thus their use for art valuation is but one source among many needed for determining value.&lt;ref name="campbellRAJ" /&gt;

===General valuation factors===
Valuation estimates by auction houses are typically given in ranges of prices to offset uncertainty. Generally, estimates are made by looking at what a comparable piece of art sold for recently, with estimates given in a range of prices rather than one fixed figure,&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;de Pury, Simon, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110715074548/http://www.phillipsartexpert.com/ask_simon/ FAQ #13].&lt;/ref&gt; and in the case of [[contemporary art]] especially, having few comparables or when an artist is not well known and has no auction history, the risks of incorrect valuation are greatest.

One potential factor in valuation are the seller's reasons for selling a particular work and/or the buyer's reasons for buying, neither of which may have anything to do with the other. For example, a seller may be motivated by financial need, boredom with a particular artwork, or the desire to raise funds for a different purchase.&lt;ref name="nprCornish"&gt;Cornish, Audie, [https://www.npr.org/2012/10/03/162246654/wealthy-use-art-collections-as-way-to-a-better-loan Wealthy Use Art Collections As Way To A Better Loan], [[NPR]], npr.org, 3 October 2012. Accessed 29 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Common motivations include the so-called three D's: death, debt and divorce. Buyers may be motivated by market excitement, may be acting in accord with a collection plan, or buying like buyers of stock: to drive value up or down either for themselves or for another person. 

One method for pricing pieces by new artists of uncertain value is to ignore aesthetics and consider, besides market trends, three semi-commoditized aspects: "scale" - size and level of detail, "intensity" - effort, and "medium" - quality of the materials.&lt;ref name="shark"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100630230248/http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=128084948 Why A Dead Shark Costs $12 Million], NPR, npr.org, 25 June 2010. Accessed 2010-07-27. Archived from the original at archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valuing artworks in such a specialized market, therefore, takes into account a wide variety of factors, some indeed in conflict with each other.

==Valuation for tax and other law-related purposes==
In the United States, art bought and sold by collectors is treated as a [[capital asset]] for tax purposes,&lt;ref&gt;Capital asset defined: 26 U.S.C. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1221 § 1221], Legal Information Institute, law.cornell.edu. Accessed 14 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and disputes relating to the valuation of art or the nature of [[Gain (finance)|gain]] on its sale are usually decided by the federal [[United States Tax Court|Tax Court]], and sometimes by other courts applying federal tax law to specific cases.

'''Articulatory gestures''' are the actions necessary to enunciate language.   Examples of articulatory gestures are the hand movements necessary to enunciate sign language and the mouth movements of speech.   In [[semiotic]] terms, they are the physical embodiment (signifiers) of speech signs, which are gestural by nature (see below).

The definition of ''[[gesture]]'' varies greatly, but here it will be taken in its widest sense, namely, any meaningful action.   An intentional action is meaningful if it is not strictly utilitarian: for example, sending flowers to a friend is a gesture, because this action is performed not only for the purpose of moving flowers from one place to another, but also to express some sentiment or even a conventional message in the [[language of flowers]].  Use of the broadest definition of gesture (not restricted to hand movements) allows [[Charles F. Hockett|Hockett]]’s  “rapid fading” [[design features of language | design feature of human language]] to be accommodated as a type of sign in semiotic theory.

But if an articulatory gesture is to be considered a true gesture in the above sense, it must be meaningful.   Therefore, an articulatory gesture must be at least as large as the smallest meaningful unit of language, the morpheme.  A morpheme corresponds roughly to a spoken word or a sign language gesture.   

This definition differs from the practice, common among linguists,  of referring to phonemes (meaningless mouth movements) as articulatory gestures (see [[articulatory phonology]]).   In [[semiotics]], meaningless components of spoken gestures (written as individual letters), or meaningless components of sign language gestures (such as location of hand contact) are known as [[figurae]], the constituents of signs.    

It also differs from the tradition of considering speech sounds to be the signifiers of speech signs.  But this practice confuses signals with symbols.  Sound and light are analogue signals, whereas mouth and hand gestures are discrete symbolic entities.  A sound or light signal is subject to random noise, whereas the image of the gesture is subject to regular [[image distortion | distortion]], as when a signer’s hand is viewed from different angles. In speech, the sound of the contact of the tongue in the letter T can be distorted by surrounding mouth movements, as in the phrase “perfect memory”.  When pronounced at conversational speed, the sound of the tongue contact is completely obscured by surrounding consonants even though this T movement is fully carried out.

Articulatory gestures, when seen as the physical embodiment of speech and sign language symbols, provide a link between these two language types, and show how speech resembles sign language more closely than is generally presumed.

The '''avunculate''', sometimes called '''avunculism''' or '''avuncularism''', is any social institution where a special relationship exists between an uncle and his [[Nephew and niece|sisters' children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=F0aOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT232&amp;lpg=PT232&amp;dq=Avunculate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rcsBD8kQCW&amp;sig=jRTzPmnrdU1bZGwGeqtQC_8gYDQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Avunculate&amp;f=false|title=The Routledge Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology|last=Barnard|first=Alan|last2=Spencer|first2=Jonathan|date=2009-12-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135236403|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship can be formal or informal, depending on the society. Early anthropological research focused on the association between the avunculate and [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] descent, while later research has expanded to consider the avunculate in general society.

==Definition==
The term ''avunculate'' comes from the Latin ''[[wikt:avunculus|avunculus]],'' the maternal uncle.

The 1989 ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines "avunculate" as follows:
:"Avunculate. The special relationship existing in some societies between a maternal uncle and his sister's son; maternal uncles regarded as a collective body.
::1920 R. H. LOWIE Prim. Soc. v. 81 Ethnologists describe under the heading of avunculate the customs regulating in an altogether special way the relations of a nephew to his maternal uncle. Ibid. vii. 171 The Omaha are patrilineal now, but their having the avunculate proves that they once traced descent through the mother, for on no other hypothesis can such a usage be explained. ... "&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''. Second Edition 1989. On-line version.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avunculocal societies==

An avunculocal society is one in which a married couple traditionally lives with the man's mother's eldest brother, which most often occurs in [[matrilineal]] societies. The [[Anthropology|anthropological]] term "avunculocal residence" refers to this convention, which has been identified in about 4% of the world's societies.&lt;ref&gt;Rosman, Abraham and Rubel, Paula G. ''The Tapestry of Culture: An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology''. Mcgraw-Hill College, 1995. ({{ISBN|0-07-053955-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;

This pattern generally occurs when a man obtains his status, his job role, or his privileges from their nearest elder matrilineal male relative. When a woman's son lives near her brother, he is able to more easily learn how he needs to behave in the matrilineal role he has inherited.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Cultures with a formal avunculate ==

According to the [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] common law, the avunculate nephews could take anything from the relatives of the mother up to three times. In the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] past a nephew, at a feast at his maternal uncle or grandfather, could take any horse from their herd or any delicacy.&lt;ref name="Zuev"&gt;Yu.Zuev, ''"Early Türks: Sketches of history and ideology"'', Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 30, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Southwest United States]], the [[Apache]] tribe practices a form of this, where the uncle is responsible for teaching the children social values and proper behavior while inheritance and ancestry is reckoned through the mother's family alone. Modern day influences have somewhat but not completely erased this tradition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The [[Chamorros]] of the [[Mariana Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Lawarence J. ''Ancient Chamorro Society''. Bess Press, 1992. ({{ISBN|1-880188-05-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] of [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, William F.  ''[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/caribarch/middle1999.htm Before Columbus: Caonabo’s Homeland]'', Middle Caicos Earthwatch Report, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; are examples of societies that have practiced avunculocal residence.

== Anthropology research ==

Research on the avunculate in the early 20th century focused on the association between the avunculate and patrilineal/matrilineal societies. [[Franz Boas]] categorized various avunculate arrangements based on the location of residence in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boas|first=Franz|date=1922-01-01|title=The Avunculate among the Vandau|jstor=660075|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=24|issue=1|pages=95–97|doi=10.1525/aa.1922.24.1.02a00150}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri-Alexandre Junod|Henri Alexandre Juno]] made the claim that the avunculate in the [[Tsonga people|Tsonga]] indicated that society had previously been matrilineal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryder|first=J. W.|last2=Blackman|first2=M.

He also expanded the concept to incorporate other family relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://radicalanthropologygroup.org/sites/default/files/pdf/class_text_055.pdf|title=Structure and Function in Primitive Society|last=Radcliffe-Brown|first=Alfred|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=|location=London|pages=15–31|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later research moved beyond the issue of matrilinealism. [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]   incorporating the avunculate into his "atom of kinship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=S_DnQ82WpaoC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=levi-strauss+avunculate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mEpT01_Hn3&amp;sig=S9ezPAzyRvO5S8SwZSQAmnD7B1w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=levi-strauss%20avunculate&amp;f=false|title=Teaching Lévi-Strauss|last=Penner|first=Hans H.|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Scholars Press|isbn=9780788504907|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan N. Bremmer]] argued based on a survey of the Indo-European peoples that the avunculate is explained by the principle of education outside the (extended) family, and does not indicate matrilinealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bremmer|first=Jan|date=1976-01-01|title=EPRINTS-BOOK-TITLE|url=http://www.rug.nl/research/portal/publications/avunculate-and-fosterage(062fe6fa-623a-4676-b367-0575eba0ad5b).html|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avunculate marriage==
{{Main|Avunculate marriage}}
In historical (not anthropological) terminology, an [[avunculate marriage]] is the marriage of a man with the daughter of his sister (not explicitly forbidden by the listings in [[Leviticus 18]]). In most cultures with avunculate customs in the sense used by anthropologists, such a marriage would violate incest taboos governing relations between members of the same [[matrilineality|matrilineal lineage]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10611">[[File:William Hogarth 016.jpg|thumb|300px|Painting based on ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', act 3, scene 2, [[William Hogarth]], c. 1728]]The '''ballad opera''' is a genre of [[England|English]] [[stage play|stage entertainment]] that originated in the early 18th century, and continued to develop over the following century and later.  Like the earlier ''[[comédie en vaudeville]]'' and the later ''[[Singspiel]]'', its distinguishing characteristic is the use of tunes in a popular style (either pre-existing or newly composed) with spoken dialogue. These English plays were '[[opera]]s' mainly insofar as they satirized the conventions of the imported ''[[opera seria]]''.   Music critic [[Peter Gammond]] describes the ballad opera as "an important step in the emancipation of both the musical stage and the popular song."&lt;ref name="gammond"&gt;{{cite book| first1= Peter| last1= Gammond| year= 1991| title= The Oxford Companion to Popular Music| publisher= Oxford University Press| location= Oxford| pages=35–36 | isbn= 0-19-311323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earliest ballad operas==
Ballad opera has been called an "eighteenth-century protest against the Italian conquest of the London operatic scene."&lt;ref name=Lubbock&gt;M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962), pp. 467–68&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of racy and often [[Satire|satirical]] spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short (mostly a single short stanza and refrain) to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story, which involves lower class, often criminal, characters, and typically shows a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period.

It is generally accepted that the first ballad opera, and the one that was to prove the most successful, was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' of 1728.&lt;ref&gt;J. Milling, P. Thomson, J. W. Donohue, eds, ''The Cambridge History of British Theatre: 1660 to 1895'' / edited by Joseph Donohue (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a libretto by [[John Gay]] and music arranged by [[Johann Christoph Pepusch]], both of whom probably experienced vaudeville theatre in [[Paris]], and may have been motivated to reproduce it in an English form.  They were also probably influenced by the burlesques and musical plays of [[Thomas D'Urfey]] (1653–1723) who had a reputation for [[parody music|fitting new words to existing songs]]; [[Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy|a popular anthology of these settings]] was published in 1700 and frequently re-issued.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "D'Urfey, Thomas".&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the tunes from this anthology were recycled in ''The Beggar's Opera''.

After the success of ''The Beggar's Opera'', many similar pieces were staged.  The actor [[Thomas Walker (actor)|Thomas Walker]], who played [[Macheath]] in the original production, wrote several ballad operas,&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt; and Gay produced further works in this style, including a much less successful sequel, ''Polly''.  [[Henry Fielding]], [[Colley Cibber]], [[Charles Coffey]], [[Thomas Arne]], [[Charles Dibdin]], Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity.&lt;ref name=Lubbock/&gt; By the middle of the century, however, the genre was already in decline.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WarwickWest1992&gt;J. Warwick and E. West, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they featured the lower reaches of society, the audiences for these works were typically the London bourgeois. As a reaction to serious opera (at this time almost invariably sung in Italian), the music, for these audiences, was as satirical in its way as the words of the play. The plays themselves contained references to contemporary politics—in ''The Beggar's Opera'' the character Peachum was a lampoon of Sir [[Robert Walpole]]. This satirical element meant that many of them risked censorship and banning—as was the case with Gay's successor to ''The Beggar's Opera'', ''Polly''.

The tunes of the original ballad operas were almost all pre-existing (somewhat in the manner of a modern "[[jukebox musical]]"): however they were taken from a wide variety of contemporary sources, including [[folk music|folk melodies]], popular airs by classical composers (such as [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]) and even children's [[nursery rhymes]]. A significant source from which the music was drawn was the fund of popular airs to which 18th century London [[broadside (music)|broadside ballad]]s are set. It is from this connection that the term "ballad opera" is drawn. This ragbag of [[Parody music|"pre-loved" music]] is a good test for distinguishing between the original type of ballad opera and its later forms.  Many ballad operas used the same tunes, such as "[[Lillibullero]]", and by about 1750 it had become clear that there was a need for new tunes to be written.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;  In 1762, Thomas Arne's ''[[Love in a Village]]'' presented a new form of ballad opera, with mainly new music and much less reliance on traditional tunes. It was followed in similar style by Charles Dibdin's ''Lionel and Clarissa'' in 1768.&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;

''[[The Disappointment]]'' (1762) represents an early American attempt at such a ballad opera.

==Singspiel connection==
In 1736 the [[Prussia]]n ambassador in England commissioned an arrangement in German of a popular ballad opera, ''The Devil to Pay'', by [[Charles Coffey]]. This was successfully performed in [[Hamburg]], [[Leipzig]] and elsewhere in Germany in the 1740s. A new version was produced by C. F. Weisse and [[Johann Adam Hiller]] in 1766. The success of this version was the first of many by these collaborators, who have been called (according to [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove]]) "the fathers of the German Singspiel". (The storyline of ''The Devil to Pay'' was also adapted for [[Gluck]] for his 1759 French opera ''[[Le diable à quatre (opera)|Le diable à quatre]]'').

==Pastoral ballad opera ==
A later development, also often referred to as ballad opera, was a more "pastoral" form. In subject matter, especially, these "ballad operas" were antithetical to the more satirical variety. In place of the rag-bag of pre-existing music found in (for example) ''The Beggar's Opera'', the scores of these works consisted in the main of original music, although they not infrequently quoted folk melodies, or imitated them. Thomas Arne and [[Isaac Bickerstaffe]]'s ''Love in a Village'', and [[William Shield]]'s ''Rosina'' (1781) are typical examples. Many of these works were introduced as after-pieces to performances of Italian operas.

Later in the century broader comedies such as [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''The Duenna'' and the innumerable works of [[Charles Dibdin]] moved the balance back towards the original style, but there was little remaining of the impetus of the satirical ballad opera.

==19th century==
English 19th century opera is very heavily drawn from the "pastoral" form of the ballad opera, and traces even of the satiric kind can be found in the work of "serious" practitioners such as [[John Barnett]]. Much of the satiric spirit (albeit in a greatly refined form) of the original ballad opera can be found in [[W. S. Gilbert|Gilbert's]] contribution to the [[Savoy opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], and the more pastoral form of ballad opera is satirised in one of Gilbert and Sullivan's early works, ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walbrook|first=H. M.|year=1922|title=Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera, A History and a Comment|url=http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/index.html|location=|accessdate=24 June 2009|publisher=F. V. White &amp; Co.

==20th century==
''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' of [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] (1928) is a reworking of ''The Beggar's Opera'', setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite. On the other hand, it uses just one tune from the original—all the other music being specially composed, and thus omits one of the most distinctive features of the original ballad opera.

In a completely different vein, ''[[Hugh the Drover]]'', an [[opera]] in two acts by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] first staged in 1924, is also sometimes referred to as a "ballad opera". It is plainly much closer to [[William Shield|Shield's]] ''Rosina'' than to ''The Beggar's Opera''.

In the twentieth century folk singers have produced musical plays with folk or folk-like songs called "ballad operas". [[Alan Lomax]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Burl Ives]], and others recorded ''The Martins and the Coys'' in 1944, and [[Peter Bellamy]] and others recorded ''The Transports'' in 1977. The first of these is in some ways connected to the "pastoral" form of the ballad opera, and the latter to the satiric ''Beggar's Opera'' type, but in all they represent yet further reinterpretations of the term.

Ironically, it is in the [[Musical theatre|musicals]] of [[Kander and Ebb]]—especially ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''—that the kind of satire embodied in ''The Beggar's Opera'' and its immediate successors is probably best preserved, although here, as in Weill's version, the music is specially composed, unlike the first ballad operas of the 18th century.

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

A '''big man''' is a highly influential individual in a [[tribe]], especially in [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]]. Such a person may not have formal tribal or other authority (through for instance material possessions, or inheritance of rights), but can maintain recognition through skilled persuasion and wisdom. The big man has a large group of followers, both from his [[clan]] and from other clans. He provides his followers with protection and economic assistance, in return receiving support which he uses to increase his status.

==Big man "system"==

The [[United States|American]] anthropologist [[Marshall Sahlins]] has studied the big man phenomenon. In his much-quoted&lt;ref&gt;
James Whitley ("Social Diversity in Dark Age Greece", ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'' '''86''' (1991:341-365) applied Sahlins' ethnographic model to instability in settlement patterns during the [[Greek Dark Age]], 10th-8th centuries BCE.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
1963 article  "Poor Man, Rich Man, Big Man, Chief: Political Types in [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]]", Sahlins uses analytically constructed ideal-types of hierarchy and equality to compare a larger-scale Polynesian-type hierarchical society of chiefs and sub-chiefs with a Melanesian-type big-man system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |URL=http://tapera.info/textos/sahlins,hrhp.pdf |author=Marshall Sahlins |title=Poor Man, Rich Man, Big Man, Chief; Political Types in Melanesia and Polynesia |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=5 |number=3 |pages=285-303 |date=April 1963 |archive-date=1 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101000000/http://tapera.info/textos/sahlins,hrhp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter consists of segmented lineage groups, locally held together by faction-leaders who compete for power in the social structure of horizontally arranged and principally equal groupings (factions). Here, leadership is not ascribed, but rather gained through action and competition "with other ambitious men".

==Position==
{{main|Moka exchange}}
A big man's position is never secured in an inherited position at the top of a hierarchy, but is always challenged by the different big-men who compete with one another in an ongoing process of [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and re-distribution of material and political resources. As such the big man is subject to a [[Transactional analysis|transactional]] order based on his ability to balance the simultaneously opposing pulls of securing his own renown through distributing resources to other big man groups (thereby spreading the word of his power and abilities) ''and'' redistributing resources to the people of his own faction (thereby keeping them content followers of his able leadership).

The big man concept is relatively fluid, and formal authority of such figures is very low to nonexistent. His position is not inherently heritable.

In the Island of Malaita in Solomon Islands the big man system is dying away as westernization is influencing the people,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} but the big man system can be seen at the political level. Every four years in [[Solomon Islands]]' National Elections the system can be clearly seen among the people, especially in the Melanesian Islands.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==System in Papua New Guinea==
The first use of the term may be found in the English-translation of Dreissig Jahre in der Sudsee (1907) by [[Richard Parkinson (explorer)|Richard Parkinson]]. The term may be often found in many historical works dealing with Papua New Guinea. Andrew J. Strathern&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, ''The Rope of Moka: big-men and ceremonial exchange in Mount Hagen, Papua New Guinea'' (Cambridge, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; applies the concept of big-men to a community in [[Mount Hagen]], Papua New Guinea.

Traditionally, among peoples of non-[[Austronesian]]-speaking communities, authority was obtained by a man (the so-called "big man") recognised as "performing most capably in social, political, economic and ceremonial activities".&lt;ref&gt;Waiko, John D. (1993). ''A Short History of Papua New Guinea'', Melbourne: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-553164-7}}, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; His function was not to command, but to influence his society through his example. He was expected to act as a negotiator with neighbouring groups, and to periodically redistribute food (generally produced by his wives). In this sense, he was seen as ensuring the well-being of his community.

Such a system is still found in many parts of [[Papua New Guinea]], and other parts of [[Melanesia]].

'''Biolinguistics''' is the study of the [[biology]] and [[evolution]] of [[language]].  It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including [[Linguistics|linguists]], [[biologist]]s, [[Neuroscience|neuroscientists]], [[psychologists]], [[Mathematician|mathematicians,]] and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework by which we can understand the fundamentals of the faculty of language.

==Origins==
The biolinguistic perspective began to take shape in the mid-twentieth century, among the linguists influenced by the developments in biology and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chomsky|first= Noam|year= 2004|title= Biolinguistics and the Human Capacity. Lecture delivered at MTA, Budapest, May 17, 2004|url= http://www.chomsky.info/talks/20040517.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Lenneberg|Eric Lenneberg’s]] ''Biological Foundations of Language'' remains a basic document of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Lenneberg, Eric. 1967. ''Biological Foundations of Language''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the first Biolinguistic conference was organized by [[Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini]], bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins, and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1= Cedric |first2= Massimo |last2=Piattelli-Palmarini |year=2005|title= Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science. Linguistic Review 22: 447–466 |url=http://www.dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~massimo/publications/PDF/BoeckxMPPLingReview2005.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==
Recent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] at [[MIT]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of the mind in general and language in particular is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations; next, the internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this is true, then the objective of biolinguists is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].

==Hypothesis==
It is possible that the core principles of the language faculty be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&amp;mdash;an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Soschen, Alona. 2006. Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in the Minimalist Program. DEAL. Linguistics in Potsdam 25. {{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. If this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.

==Critiques==
David Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of "inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization", arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5244">The '''Blytt-Sernander''' classification, or sequence, is a series of north [[Europe]]an climatic periods or phases based on the study of [[Denmark|Danish]] [[peat bog]]s by [[Axel Blytt]] (1876) and [[Rutger Sernander]] (1908). The classification was incorporated into a sequence of [[pollen zone]]s later defined by [[Lennart von Post]], one of the founders of [[palynology]].

==Description==
Layers in [[peat]] were first noticed by [[Heinrich Dau]] in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Dau, ''Allerunterthänigster Bericht an die Königliche Dänische Rentekammer über die Torfmoore Seelands nach einer im Herbste 1828 deshalb unternommenen Reise.'' (usually simply ''Über die Torfmoore Seelands'') Copenhagen and Leipzig, 1829.&lt;/ref&gt; A prize was offered by the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] to anyone who could explain them. Blytt hypothesized that the darker layers were deposited in drier times; the lighter, in moister times, applying his terms ''Atlantic'' (warm, moist) and ''Boreal'' (cool, dry). In 1926 [[C.A. Weber]]&lt;ref&gt;Weber, "Grenzhorizont und Klimaschwankungen" ''Abhandl. Naturwiss. Vereins, Bremen''  '''26''' (1926:98-106).&lt;/ref&gt; noticed the sharp boundary horizons, or ''Grenzhorizonte'', in [[Germany|German]] peat, which matched Blytt’s classification. Sernander defined subboreal and subatlantic periods, as well as the late glacial periods. Other scientists have since added other information.

The classification was devised before the development of more accurate dating methods, such as [[Radiocarbon dating|C-14 dating]] and [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]s. Currently geologists working in different regions are studying sea levels, peat bogs and [[ice core]] samples by a variety of methods, with a view toward further verifying and refining the Blytt-Sernander sequence. They find a general correspondence across [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]].

The fluctuations of climatic change are more complex than Blytt-Sernander periodizations can identify. For example, recent peat [[core sample]]s at [[Roskilde Fjord]] and also [[Lake Kornerup]] in [[Denmark]] identified 40 to 62 distinguishable layers of [[pollen]], respectively.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} However, no universally accepted replacement model has been proposed.

==Problems==

===Dating and calibration===
Today the Blytt-Sernander sequence has been substantiated by a wide variety of scientific dating methods, mainly [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] dates obtained from peat. Earlier radiocarbon dates were often left uncalibrated; that is, they were derived by assuming a constant concentration of atmospheric radiocarbon. In fact the atmospheric radiocarbon concentration has varied over time and thus radiocarbon dates need to be [[Radiocarbon dating|calibrated]].

===Cross-discipline correlation===
The Blytt-Sernander classification has been used as a temporal framework for the [[archaeology|archaeological cultures]] of [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]]. Some have gone so far as to identify stages of technology in north Europe with specific periods; however, this approach is an oversimplification not generally accepted. There is no reason, for example, why the north [[Europe]]ans should stop using [[bronze]] and start using [[iron]] abruptly at the lower boundary of the [[Subatlantic]] at 600 BC. In the warm [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic]] period, [[Denmark]] was occupied by [[Mesolithic]] cultures, rather than [[Neolithic]], notwithstanding the climatic evidence. Moreover, the technology stages vary widely globally.

==Sequence==
The [[Pleistocene]] phases and approximate calibrated dates (see above) are:
* [[Older Dryas]] stadial, 14,000–13,600 BP ([[Before Present]])
* [[Allerød Oscillation|Allerød]] interstadial, 13,600–12,900 BP
* [[Younger Dryas]] stadial, 12,900–11,640 BP

The [[Holocene]] phases are:
* [[Preboreal]]
* [[Boreal (period)|Boreal]], cool, dry, rising temperature, 11,500–8,900 BP
* [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic]], warm, moist, maximum temperature, 8900–5700 BP
* [[Subboreal]], 5700–2600 BP
* [[Subatlantic]], 2600–0 BP

==Marker species==
Some marker plant [[genus|genera]]/[[species]] studied in [[peat]] are
*''[[Sphagnum]]''
*''[[Carex limosa]]''
*''[[Scheuchzeria palustris]]'', Rannock rush
*''[[Eriophorum vaginatum]]'', cotton grass
*''[[Vaccinium oxycoccos]]'', bog cranberry
*''[[Andromeda polifolia]]'', bog rosemary
*''[[Erica tetralix]]'', cross-leaved heather
*''[[Calluna vulgaris]]'', heather
*''[[Pine|Pinus]]'', pine
*''[[Birch|Betula]]'', birch

More [[sphagnum]] appears in wet periods. Dry periods feature more tree stumps, of birch and pine.

== Slovakia ==

Slovakia's competition is Superstars, and the prize is a car, cash and recording contracts. Stars such as [[Zdenka Predna]] came to prominence this way.

== United Kingdom ==

Simon Cowell's "Popstars" is perhaps the most famous one of the lot, and other shows on a similar focus are ''[[Stars in Their Eyes]]'', and Andrew Lloyd Webber's ''[[How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?]]''.

== United States ==
Following directly on the UK template is the ''[[American Idol]]'' competition.

== Republic of Ireland ==

Ireland's version, called ''[[You're a Star]]'', had a unique twist: winners came into the Eurovision Song Contest as the prize.  However, after the disaster of the [[McCall Twins]] that format has been abandoned. The most famous winner and most successful in Eurovision (though he did not win) was [[Mickey Joe Harte]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2690">'''Cognized environment''' is a concept first introduced by the late anthropologist, [[Roy Rappaport]] (1968), in contrast to what he called the ''operational environment'' (see Rappaport 1979:97-144, 1984:337-352).  Rappaport was an ecological anthropologist, like [[Andrew P. Vayda]], and wished to contrast the actual reality and adaptations (the operational environment) within a people's ecological niche  – say, the existence of tsetse flies and their role in causing sleeping sickness among humans – with how the people’s culture understands nature (the cognized environment) – say, the belief that witches live in those areas that science knows is the habitat of the tsetse.  Rappaport’s principal concern was the role of ritual in mediating the cognized and operational environments.

Another group of anthropologists later took up the use of Rappaport’s concepts and applied them toward developing a school of [[neuroanthropology]] called [[Biogenetic Structuralism]] (see Laughlin and Brady 1978: 6, d'Aquili, Laughlin and McManus 1979: 12ff, Rubinstein, Laughlin and McManus 1984: 21ff, and Laughlin, McManus and d'Aquili 1990:82-90).  According to this group, all properties and qualities of experience are mediated by our body’s neuroendocrine systems.  These systems function individually and collectively to model reality.  The sum total of these models in the brain is the cognized environment.  The operational environment refers to the actual niche in which the human or other animal with a brain dwells and adapts.  The operational environment is the real world that is modelled by our cognized environment.

In [[Latin language|Latin]], it is called a ''membrum'' or ''membrum orationis''.

Sentences consisting of two cola are called ''dicola''; those with three are ''[[tricolon|tricola]]''. The corresponding adjectives are ''dicolic'' and ''tricolic''; ''colic'' is not used in this sense. In writing, these cola are often separated by [[colon (punctuation)|colons]].

An [[isocolon]] is a sentence composed of cola of equal syllabic length.

The [[Septuagint]] used this system in the poetic books such as the [[Psalms]]. 
When [[Jerome]] translated the books of the Prophets, he arranged the text colometrically.

The colometric system was used in bilingual codices of [[New Testament]], such as [[Codex Bezae]] and [[Codex Claromontanus]]. Some Greek and Latin manuscripts also used this system, including [[Codex Coislinianus]] and [[Codex Amiatinus]].

'''Deaccessioning''' is defined as the process by which a work of art or other object is permanently removed from a [[Collection (artwork)|museum’s collection]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Report from the AAMD Task Force on Deaccessioning. 2010. ''AAMD Policy on Deaccessioning''. The Association of American Museum Directors, June 9, 2010. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/AAMD%20Policy%20on%20Deaccessioning%20website.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803191723/https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/AAMD%20Policy%20on%20Deaccessioning%20website.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-03 |df= }} Accessed November 14th 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; Deaccessioning is a practical and constructive tool of collections care that, if practiced thoughtfully supports the long-term preservation of a collection and can help a [[museum]] refine the scope of its collection in order to better serve its mission and community.

==Deaccession policy==
The process undertaken by a museum to deaccession a work involves several steps that are usually laid out in a museum`s [[Collections policy|Collection Management Policy]]. The terms under which an object may be considered for removal, as well as the individuals with the authority to approve the process are outlined in the "Deaccession" section of this document.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, this section lays out the legal restrictions and ethic considerations associated with removal of the object and the types of disposal that are appropriate based on the reason for the deaccession.

==Decision process==
Each museum establishes its own method and workflow for the deaccession process according to its organizational structure. However all object deaccessioning involves the two processing steps of deaccession and disposal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last = Buck|first = Rebecca A.|last2 = Gilmore|first2 = Jean Allman|title = Museum Registration Methods|place = Washington, D.C.|publisher = The AAM Press, American Association of Museums|year = 2010|edition = 5|chapter = 3I: Deaccessioning|pages = 100–107|isbn = 978-0-8389-1122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Park Service - Museum Management Program|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/handbook.html|website = www.nps.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process begins with the [[curator]] creating a document called a "Statement of Justification," which outlines their decision criteria and reasoning for presenting the work as a possible deaccession. In order to determine if a work should be deaccessioned from a museum`s collection, a [[curator]] or [[Registrar (museum)|registrar]] completes and documents a series of justification steps and then present their findings to the museum director and governing board for final approval.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Deaccession criteria===
There are a number of reasons why deaccessioning might be considered. The following is a typical list of criteria for deaccession and disposal:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The work is no longer consistent with the mission or collecting goals of the museum. 
* The work is of poor quality and lacks value for exhibition or study purposes. 
* The physical condition of the work is so poor that restoration is not practicable or would compromise the work’s integrity or the artist’s intent. Works damaged beyond reasonable repair that are not of use for study or teaching purposes may be destroyed.  
* The museum is unable to care adequately for the work because of the work’s particular requirements for storage or display or its continuing need for special treatment for proper and long term conservation.  
* The work is being sold as part of the museum’s effort to refine and improve its collections, in keeping with the collecting goals reviewed and approved by the museum’s Board of Trustees or governing body.  
* The authenticity or attribution of the work is determined to be false or fraudulent and the object lacks sufficient aesthetic merit or art historical importance to warrant retention.  
* The work is a duplicate that has no value as part of a series.  
* The work may have been stolen or illegally imported in violation of applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which the museum is located or the work may be subject to other legal claims, including but not limited to repatriation under [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA (]]The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) and art found to have been plundered during WWII by the [[Nazi plunder|Nazis]].

===Deaccession justification steps===
The typical steps that need to be taken in order to justify the deaccession and disposal of the work include:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* Verification of Legal Status: Staff verifies that the museum possesses official legal title of the work and check their records in order to ascertain if there are any restrictions that exist in the original gift, bequest, or purchase which may hinder or limit disposal options, including transfer of copyright or trademark.
** The need to establish clear and unrestricted title is important because it ensures the museum can dispose of the work the via legal sale without risk of improper title transfer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Malaro, M. and I.P. DeAngelis (2012). A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections. Chp. 5: The Disposal of Objects. pp.248-272.  Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press.&lt;/ref&gt; See:[[Tangible personal property]]
** Donor restrictions are also uncovered at this stage of the process. Some donor restrictions determined at the gifting or bequest of the work or works may hinder the deaccession and/or the disposal process. 
*** For example, the museum is looking to deaccession one piece of a set that was gifted and the donor`s "Deed of Gift or Bequest" included a request that the set remain together. In this case, the museum might need to seek legal counsel and take the documents to a judge to gain release from the Deed of Gift or Bequest restrictions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
** In the process of determining clear title, [[provenance]] research should ideally be conducted, especially if the deaccession process was instigated by a claim of illicit title, such as in the case of a Nazi Looted work or stolen work of antiquity. 
*** See [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|UNESCO]] Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property and AAM Statement on the "Standards Regarding the Unlawful Appropriation of Objects During the Nazi Era"[http://www.aam-us.org/resources/ethics-standards-and-best-practices/collections-stewardship/objects-during-the-nazi-era]
*Physical Examination: A conservator conducts an assessment of the work to determine its current  condition, future maintenance needs, and viable disposal options, such as possible sale or destruction. 
*Object Evaluation: Acquiring through one or more appraisers reasonable evaluations of the work would be helpful especially if the work is to be disposed of via sale, auction, transfer or exchange for value in kind with another institution.
*Director and/ or Governing Board approval: Following an internal review by all relevant staff, all documentation is presented to the Governing Board and/or the CEO/ Museum Director for final approval. The workflow and final decision on deaccession is subject to the collection policies workflow and charters for each museum.   
*Notification of Donor and/or External Stakeholders: Once the Governing Board and/ or the CEO/ Museum Director approves the deaccession the last step before beginning disposal is the notification of donor and external stakeholders of the deaccession. Although the museum holds clear title of the work and is not obliged by law to contact the donor of intent to deaccession, many museums contact donors or relatives out of courtesy. Museums may also confer with local community advisory groups, such as museum members, local collectors, other local museums, and volunteers about the deaccession to inform and gain community perspective on the work and its value to the collection.

===Disposal===
Disposal is defined as the transfer of ownership by the museum after a work has been deaccessioned. Following approval of deaccession from the Governing Board and/or the CEO/Museum Director, the work is disposed of and the title of ownership is completely transferred away from the museum or terminated. The method chosen is determined by the physical condition of the work, the intrinsic value or cultural value of the work and extrinsic value or monetary value of the work. With all methods of disposal, museums are charged to maintain and retain all records of the object, its deaccession and disposal.

The process of disposal is completed through the following methods:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

*Donation of the object to another museum, library, or archive for educational purposes 
**This is the ideal disposal choice for museums as it assures that the object will remain accessible to the public. Museums seek out possible institutions where the object might a useful addition to the collection or is better equipped to maintain the object.[[File:Antonio Molinari - Adamo ed Eva.jpg|thumb|Antonio Molinari - Adamo ed Eva, An example of a Deaccessioned work: Deaccessioned in 1988 from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Purchased by Ball State University Museum of Art, Muncie, Indiana from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1989.]]
*Exchange of the object for another object with another museum or non-profit institution
**This is another viable method for assuring that the object remains accessible to the public in some way.  Exchanges are made in such a way that there is relatively equal value of the items involved, not just monetarily but historically.
***Museum should be able to justify the trade, including any exceptional circumstances that would favor one party over another. This is why obtaining an appraisal of the object from more than one appraiser is a mandatory step in the deaccession process. See &lt;u&gt;Object Evaluation&lt;/u&gt; above.   
*Educational and Research programs 
**Often works deaccession from the collection can be reallocated into educational programs, to be used for hands-on demonstrations, school outreach programs, or testing for conservation research. In this case it is understood that the work will be subject to physical destruction over time.  In this case, the work would be re-accessioned into a study or educational collection that is not as closely monitored as that of the main collection. See link for one example of an outreach school program that utilizes deaccessioned works [http://www.historyisfun.org/learn/virginia-outreach/].   
*Physical Destruction 
**Objects that may have deteriorated due to an [[Inherent vice (library and archival science)|inherent vice]], natural disaster, vandalism, accident, or other causes as well as works that made be considered hazardous, such as those containing drugs, chemicals, explosives, or asbestos should be disposed of via physical destruction. If dealing with hazardous materials, the proper authorities should be consulted in order to determine the best method of destruction.  The method of destruction will depend on the type of material and completed in such a ways as to be irreversible. This is also the best method for works that are found to be fakes or [[Forgery|forgeries]]. See &lt;u&gt;Physical Examination&lt;/u&gt; above.   
**Human remains or certain items of religious or cultural sensitivity might need to be handled in a prescribed way in order to meet legal requirements or cultural standards. See [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA]] from more information.    
*Repatriation. 
**Repatriation is the process of returning an object to their place of origin or proper owner.  This is method of disposal is used for objects found to be illicitly held by the museum, such as [[Nazi plunder|Nazi Looted Art]] and objects requested for return according to [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA]]. The illicit status of an object would be determined upon claim of repatriation via NAGPRA or claim by proper owner, in the case of Nazi Looted or other stolen works. In either case, clear title and provenance would be determined during the Verification of Legal Status step of deaccession. See &lt;u&gt;Verification of Legal Status&lt;/u&gt; above.    
*Return to Donor.
**Similar to the process of repatriation, if the work was donated to the museum and the donor or legal heir can be located at time of deaccession processing, the museum may elect to return the object to the donor. This is not the best option for museums for a few reasons. First, it removes the work from public accessibility and second, it can cause tax complications, as a deduction can be given for a portion of the work`s value upon donation and the return of the work to the donor may result in an audit or at least IRS claim on the deduction value previously received.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;[[File:Crosby Garrett Helmet on auction at Christies.jpg|thumb|An auction at [[Christie's]].]]
*Private Sale and Public Auction.
**Another method of disposal that is not the best option for museums. Museums hold collections in the public trust for public access. Though the best manner in which to generate funds from disposal for future accessions and care of current collection, disposal of works via sale or auction takes the work away from public access and places it into the hands of private citizens.

==Deaccession and museum ethics==
Several professional museum associations have drafted codes of ethics governing the practice of deaccession.nTwo majors areas of ethical concern that are common in these codes of ethics are the prohibition of sale or transfer of collection items to museum trustees, staff, board members, or their relatives and the need to restrict the use of proceeds from any works disposed of via sale or auction.&lt;ref&gt;Weil, Stephen E. ''A Deaccession Reader.'' Washington, DC: American Association of Museums, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these ethical concerns is rather straightforward. The second has become a point of contention in recent years since museums and cities, like Detroit, have been struggling with financial shortfalls.

According to the [https://www.aamd.org/ AAMD] (The Association of Art Museum Directors): "Funds received from the disposal of a deaccessioned work shall not be used for operations or capital expenses. Such funds, including any earnings and appreciation thereon, may be used only for the acquisition of works in a manner consistent with the museum’s policy on the use of restricted acquisition funds."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to the [http://www.aam-us.org/home AAM] (the American Association of Museums): "Proceeds from the sale of nonliving collections are to be used consistent with the established standards of the museum`s discipline, but in no event shall they be used for anything other than acquisition or direct care of collections."&lt;ref&gt;''Code of Ethics for Museums'', AAM. Washington DC. 1994, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Association for State and Local History|AASLH]] (the American Association for State and Local History): "Collections shall not be deaccessioned or disposed of in order to provide financial support for institutional operations, facilities maintenance, or any reason other than the preservation or acquisition of collections."&lt;ref&gt;A Statement of Professional Ethics, American Association for State and Local History, Nashville, Tennessee, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [http://icom.museum/ ICOM] (the International Council of Museums): Proceeds should be applied solely to the purchase of additions to museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/ICOM_News/2003-1/ENG/p3_2003-1.pdf|title = Deaccessioning and ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums|date = Jan 2003|accessdate = |website = ICOM News|publisher = ICOM News|last = Lewis|first = Geoffrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These associations have each determined to their own degree that all proceeds from sale or auction should be restricted to the future acquisition of collection objects and/ or to the ongoing maintenance of current collection holdings. Their decision and perspective on the practice of deaccession reflects a long-term view of museum collections as items held in public trust and preserved for access, appreciation, education, and enjoyment of not only today`s public but the future public.

A '''deathtrap''' is a [[literary]] and [[drama]]tic [[plot device]] in which a [[villain]] who has captured the [[hero]] or another sympathetic character attempts to use an elaborate, improbable, and usually sadistic method of [[murder]]ing them.

It is often used as a means to create dramatic tension in the story and to have the villain reveal important information to the hero, confident that the hero will shortly not be able to use it. It may also be a means to show the hero's resourcefulness in escaping, or the writer's ingenuity at devising a last-minute rescue or [[deus ex machina]].

== History ==
This plot device is generally believed to have been popularized by [[Serial film|movie serials]] and 19th-century theatrical [[melodrama]]s. A well-known example is the [[cliché]] of the moustache-twirling villain leaving the heroine tied to railroad tracks. Its use in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film series and [[superhero]] stories is well known.

== Narrative use ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}It is a common criticism that it is unbelievable in story plots to have villains try to kill the heroes in such elaborate ways when they could use simple methods like shooting them. Through the decades, [[comic book]] writers have responded to these complaints by devising ways in which the deathtraps have served other purposes.

For instance, one ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' story by [[Jim Shooter]] had a team of Legionnaires put into a variety of deathtraps and the villains ''wanted'' the heroes to successfully escape. This was because the real purpose of the deathtraps was to have the Legionnaires use a great deal of energy doing so, which the villains then harnessed for their own benefit. Other stories have had villains use deathtraps as a means of testing the heroes or to distract them while the villain attends to other matters. On some occasions, the deathtrap is a machine that "absorbs" the energy from the hero/heroes.

Another rationalization for a deathtrap is when a particular villain simply enjoys leaving his victims some small chance of survival, just for the sake of sport. Such "sporting" villains include [[Riddler|the Riddler]], who has an uncontrollable compulsion to create intellectual challenges for his enemies. Also included in this list is the [[Jigsaw Killer]], who places his victims in life-or-death situations to prove that they appreciate life. [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] and [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] are other villains who simply enjoy the challenge.

On occasion, the villain may employ a slow deathtrap because they enjoy their victim's suffering prior to death, either due to sadistic tendencies or a desire for painful vengeance.

In a similar vein, the villain, often a [[megalomania]]c, may feel that, as a reflection of his own imagined greatness, it would be "beneath him" to murder his enemy like any common criminal, and that his enemy's death should be the worthy spectacle that a successful deathtrap would provide. In contrast, he may feel that his enemy, having provided him with a worthy challenge in their earlier encounters, himself "deserves" such a grandiose death, or that the enmity between the two is so "epic" that it merits no less than such a conclusion.

Conversely, the protagonists' act of falling into such a trap may itself be the reason they are written off and left unattended. The villain, disappointed in such a non-threatening opponent, loses interest, and intentionally leaves some chance of escape for the protagonists to "redeem" themselves. However, the disillusioned villain tends to assume that the chance is minuscule. Despite secretly hoping that the opponent survives and proves worthy of interest, the now-bored villain is invariably shocked when that actually occurs.

If fully serious, the villain may simply be too insane to recognize the impracticality of the situation, although this characterization is rarely seen outside of deliberately parodic characters such as [[Dr. Evil]].

A more recent reason is villains do it simply because it is considered 'tradition' or 'rule' of being a supervillain to place a hero in a deathtrap and then leave them to their fate. This even goes as far as heroes, or other villains, insulting a villain for attempting to avoid using a deathtrap or staying to watch. [[Batmen of All Nations#Club of Villains|El Sombrero]] is one villain who exemplifies this reason.

When a hero's sidekick or loved one is placed in a deathtrap, its purpose is often to distract the hero, occupying time and attention while the villain pursues their evil plan. Less frequently, the villain intends to instill grief and guilt as a means of defeating a hero that cannot be defeated physically. Multiple secondary characters may be placed in deathtraps to offer the hero an agonizing choice, ostensibly forcing the hero to save one victim and leave the other(s) to die.

== Famous examples ==
*''[[The Engineer's Thumb]]'' ([[Sherlock Holmes]] story): the  engineer Victor Hatherley is trapped inside a hydraulic press which would crush him to a pulp 
**Escape method: a woman working for the villains but not sharing their criminal ruthlessness opens a side panel at the last moment, allowing Hatherley to escape
*''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'': Sealing [[Indiana Jones]] and Marion in the Well of Souls
**Escape method: Seeing a possible tunnel entrance, Jones climbed a statue and toppled it towards the wall to create an entrance to a passageway that led to the outside.
*''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'': Doctor Kananga and a minion tie James Bond and Solitare to a platform to be lowered into a shark infested pool to be eaten alive.
**Escape method: Without the villains seeing, Bond activates his watch's [[rotary saw]] function to cut through his restraints to free himself and attack Kananga.
*''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'': James Bond is shackled spreadeagled to a table and a [[circular saw]] (a [[laser]] in the [[Goldfinger (film)|film]]) is approaching to cut him in half. Unlike many deathtrap scenarios, Bond remains under constant supervision, and he does not use (or have) a device or outside help to escape.
**Escape method: Bond bluffs Goldfinger, and persuades him that his replacement "008" also knows about Goldfinger's plans and that Bond's death will immediately summon him to investigate, so Goldfinger elects to not take the chance of another spy coming on the scene to interfere, which he can avoid by holding Bond captive.
*[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]": The unnamed character finds himself bound to a large slab, beneath a bladed pendulum that slowly lowers toward him as it swings, with the intention of slicing through his chest.
**Escape method: The character lures mice to the ropes with a piece of meat. They chew through the ropes, allowing him to escape before the pendulum can slice him open.
* In the ''Dudley Do-Right'' cartoon, villain Snidely Whiplash (a parody of the stereotypical "movie-serial" villain) tied up Nell Fenwick on a table-saw conveyor belt.  The narrator (Paul Frees) noted that, "Fortunately, the belt was in need of oiling, so the trip was a slow one."  In elapsed time, through the course of the story, this actually took several hours.
*The 1960s live action [[television program|television series]] ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' usually had two-part episodes use a bizarre deathtrap as a [[cliffhanger]].
**Example: [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] traps the Dynamic Duo without their utility belts in the bottom of an industrial smokestack and begins to gradually fill it with a deadly heavier-than-air gas.
***Escape method: The pair lock elbows and brace their backs against each other to walk up the smokestack to the top opening and slide down a support cable safely to the ground.
*''[[The Venture Brothers]]'': Doctor Venture in Escape to the House of Mummies Part 2. He described the trap he was in as "Slower than haunted house spiked walls, but not quite as slow as evil scientist spiked walls."
**Escape Method: Magic forcing the walls to stop. A secondary, previously unknown Boiling Oil trap failed when a henchman confused it for "Hot [[Voile]]", which was being warmed in a clothes dryer.
*''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]'' always involved improbable deathtraps, usually set by the [[Hooded Claw]].
*Disney's ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'': Ratigan ties up Basil and Dawson in an intricate mousetrap and tells them about his plot to kill the queen. He then leaves to see his scheme unfold, assuming that they will soon be dead.
**Escape method: Basil activates the mousetrap he and Dawson are trapped in early, catching the ball that was meant to crush them, and setting off a chain reaction that interferes with every other aspect of the trap.
*''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'': The plot of the series revolves around the Jigsaw Killer, a dying vigilante who kidnaps his victims and places them in deadly traps to test them, and give them an opportunity to repent from their former lifestyle in which they took their lives for granted, and where they were unappreciative of their life and the lives and well being of others.
*''[[The Snowman (Nesbø novel)|The Snowman]]'': Rakel, [[Harry Hole]]'s beloved, is forced to sit on a fast-melting snowman; when it had melted she would fall down and the razor-sharp wire around her neck would decapitate her.
**Escape Method: Harry arrives on the scene and extricates Rakel in nick of time, at the acceptable price of the wire cutting off one of his fingers.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)]]'': Jack Dawson is chained in a room deep down inside the ship, where he is meant to disappear and be conveniently drowned as the ship sinks, but is rescued by his lover Rose. The entire second half of the film can also be seen as an extended deathtrap situation, where the thousands of people on board find themselves faced with a painful and absurd death, due to their having bought tickets or enlisted as crew on the glamorous ship, the epitome of technical progress and luxury, and now have to either reach the lifeboats and escape or else accept their death. The villain here, in a sense, is the ship and its careless masters.
*''[[Final Destination (franchise)|Final Destination]]'': The plot of the series revolves around several people surviving a catastrophe because one of them had a premonition of it. In doing this the survivors have cheated Death, a malevolent and unseen force that sets up deathtraps to kill off the survivors in the order in which they had originally died.


A simpler variation on the deathtrap is the '''villain speech''', also known as ''[[Monologue#Monologuing|monologuing]]''. The villain, after having captured the hero or another victim, gives a long speech taunting and sneering at his victim, pontificating on how said victim will soon die, and reminiscing over how he tried for so long to get his kill and is now about to reap the reward. Villains may also give away details of their evil plots, on the rationale that the victim will die immediately and the villain often believes their victim deserves to know. This speech, given when the villain could have just killed the victim in a matter of seconds, is invariably used to give another character time to come in and save the victim, or for the victim to escape. In ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (which used the term "monologuing"), [[Mr. Incredible]] and [[Frozone]] attacked villains in the middle of their speeches (Mr. Incredible is seen attacking [[Syndrome (The Incredibles)|Syndrome]] and Frozone is mentioned to have attacked Baron von Ruthless off-camera). In a literary sense, the villain speech is also used as a form of [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]].

Even in relatively realistic stories, villains will often take a moment to say something pithy before finishing off the victim. The antagonist would often leave the victim to die whilst they commit their evil scheme. This is echoed in the film ''[[2001 - A Space Odyssey]]'' when Hal the supercomputer, confident that Dave will soon perish outside the ship, tells him that he is about to take control of the expedition and then sees Dave off with the flat remark: "This conversation can have no meaningful purpose anymore - goodbye!". Dave manages to make his way inside and kill Hal.

== Spoofs ==
The concept of the deathtrap/monologue is featured in many [[satire]]s.

* Deathtraps were spoofed heavily in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] movies, including a replication of [[James Bond]]'s Shark Infested Water deathtrap. It is first introduced as "an easily escapeable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death" with Austin placed on a platform over a pool (which [[Dr. Evil]] calls "the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism"). The trap is escaped by swinging on a grapple of dental floss. As the intended sharks with laserbeams  were unavailable due to the complexities of international law regarding endangered species (much to Dr. Evil's disappointment), ill-tempered [[mutant]] seabass are used instead. As part of the spoof, [[Scott Evil]], Dr. Evil's son, insists that the deathtrap is pointless and that they could simply shoot them with a pistol, which is nearby, and yells at his father for the further incompetence of leaving them alone. Dr Evil responds that not watching the killing but assuming it went well makes perfect sense.
* In the [[sitcom]] ''[[Blackadder]]'', [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|Prince Edmund]] is captured by his nemesis, the Hawk, who straps him into a chair which, in sixty seconds, will mutilate him in a variety of ways. Edmund's friends, [[Baldrick]] and [[Lord Percy Percy|Percy]], manage to poison the Hawk and his followers, but while celebrating this unlikely victory, the time runs out, and Edmund suffers a terrible fate. In another episode, Lord Flashheart is confronted by a villain who begins an evil villain speech. However, rather than waiting for him to finish, Flashheart merely shoots him without warning.
* ''[[Curse of Monkey Island]]'' makes fun of this cliché. The villain [[LeChuck]], after capturing [[Guybrush Threepwood]], ''insists'' on telling him his plans before executing him. By this dialogue, interesting background story that connect the games together are given to the player. Guybrush does him the favour to listen, but after a while he is so bored that he refuses to listen any more, even if LeChuck pleads to continue.
* The famous line from ''[[Watchmen]]'' wherein the character Ozymandias takes his time and explains in detail how he will set his plan irrevocably in motion and then, in a deliberate skewering of the monologuing tendencies of supervillains, explains that "[[Nite Owl|Dan]], I'm not a [[Republic Pictures|Republic serial]] villain. I did it thirty-five minutes ago."
* In ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[You Only Move Twice]]", which generally spoofs Bond villain clichés, supervillain/great boss [[Hank Scorpio]] has "Mr. Bont" strapped to a table with a laser à la Goldfinger. Bont manages to escape, only to be tackled by Homer. Scorpio's henchmen promptly shoot Bont.
*Some incarnations of the [[Evil Overlord List]] point out the impracticality of deathtraps. Some examples include making sure the deathtrap has a VERY small estimated time of death or such lines as "Shooting is NOT too good for my enemies."
* Season 5 Episode 8 of the animated classic series ''[[The Flintstones]]'' entitled "[[List of The Flintstones episodes|Dr. Sinister]]" spoofed the James Bond series ("James Bondrock") and featured, among other deathtraps, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Barney Rubble|Barney]] being tied to a slab with a slowly descending pendulum with blade, a la Poe's "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]". The duo escape when Barney holds his tied hands up and the blade slices through his bonds. He then unties himself and frees Fred before the final swing slices the slab in half.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8208">{{Rhetoric}}
'''Dispositio''' is the system used for the organization of arguments in Western classical [[rhetoric]]. The word is [[Latin]], and can be translated as "organization" or "arrangement".

It is the second of five canons of classical rhetoric (the first being [[inventio]], and the remaining being [[elocutio]], [[memoria]], and [[pronuntiatio]]) that concern the crafting and delivery of speeches and writing.

The first part of any rhetorical exercise was to discover the proper arguments to use, which was done under the formalized methods of ''inventio''. The next problem facing the orator or writer was to select various arguments and organize them into an effective discourse.

== Aristotle ==
[[Aristotle]] defined two essential parts of a discourse: the statement of the case and the proof of the case. For example, in a legal argument, a prosecutor must first declare the charges against the defendant and provide the relevant facts; then he must present the evidence that proves guilt. Aristotle allowed that in practice most discourse also requires an introduction and a conclusion.

== Latin rhetoric ==
Later writers on rhetoric, such as [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]] refined this organizational scheme even further, so that there were eventually six parts:
* the introduction, or ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''. The term exordium comes from the Latin term meaning "to urge forward." In the exordium, the speaker gives their main argument, and all the relevant information.
* the statement of the case, or ''narratio''. Quintilian explained that in the narratio "we shall for instance represent a person accused of theft as covetous, accused of adultery as lustful, accused of homicide as rash, or attribute the opposite qualities to these persons if we are defending them; further we must do the same with place, time and the like". 
* the outline of the major points in the argument, or ''divisio'' (sometimes known as ''partitio''). It has two functions: to name the issues in dispute and to list the arguments to be used in the order they will appear.
* the proof of the case, or ''confirmatio''. It confirms or validates the material given in the narratio and partitio.
* the refutation of possible opposing arguments, or ''confutatio''. If the rhetor anticipates that certain people in his audience may disagree with his speech, he must be prepared to refute the argument that could possibly be presented in opposition to his original speech.
* the conclusion, or ''peroratio''. Cicero taught that a rhetor can do three things in this step: sum up his arguments, cast anyone who disagrees with him in a negative light, and arouse sympathy for himself, his clients, or his case.

While this structure might appear to be highly rigid (and certainly some writers on the subject were overly pedantic), it was in practice a flexible model. Cicero and Quintilian, for example, encouraged writers to rearrange the structure when it strengthened their case: for instance, if the opposing arguments were known to be powerful, it might be better to place the refutation before the proof.

Within each major part, there were additional tactics that might be employed. For instance, a prosecutor might sum up his case with forceful repetition of his main points using a technique known as ''[[accumulatio]]''. The defense attorney in the same case might use a different approach in his summation.

Finally, ''dispositio'' was also seen as an iterative process, particularly in conjunction with ''[[inventio]]''. The very process of organizing arguments might lead to the need to discover and research new ones. An orator would refine his arguments and their organization until they were properly arranged. He would then proceed to those areas that we generally associate with rhetoric today&amp;mdash;the development of the style and delivery of the arguments.

===''Exordium''===
The ''exordium'' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|ɡ|ˈ|z|ɔr|d|i|ə|m}}; meaning "beginning" in [[Latin]]; from ''exordiri'', meaning "to begin") was the introductory portion of an oration. The term is Latin and the Greek equivalent was called the ''[[proem]]'' or ''prooimion''. 

In the ''exordium'', the orator lays out the purpose of the discourse. In doing this, they need to consider several things:

* What kind of cause is he presenting? For instance, is it an honorable cause (defense of a hero) or a dishonorable one (defense of a murderer)?
* Should a direct opening be favoured, or should the opening be more subtle and indirect? 
* In what manner ought the speaker to proceed (e.g., light-heartedly or seriously)?
* The speaker should introduce their own character or credentials, so as to make the audience predisposed to believing their arguments.
* If required, or possible, the speaker might also call into question the character or credentials of his opponent.
* Lastly, the speaker must avoid certain faults in the introduction. For example, this excerpt from the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' lists several faults:

:"In the Introduction of a cause we must make sure that our style is temperate and that the words are in current use, so that the discourse seems unprepared. An Introduction is faulty if it can be applied as well to a number of causes; that is called a banal Introduction. Again, an Introduction which the adversary can use no less well is faulty, and that is called a common Introduction. That Introduction, again, is faulty which the opponent can turn to his own use against you. And again that is faulty which has been composed in too laboured a style, or is too long; and that which does not appear to have grown out of the cause itself in such a way to have an intimate connection with the Statement of Facts; and, finally, that which fails to make the hearer well disposed or receptive or attentive." (''Rhetorica ad Herennium'', I. vii, 11, trans. Harry Caplan, Loeb Classical Library, 1954.)

In short, the ''exordium'' was the portion of the discourse in which the orator would prepare the audience to hear his arguments in a favorable frame of mind. "An exordium can serve different kinds of functions in the differing species of rhetoric, but in all of them some of the major themes of the coming discourse will be announced in advance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letters and Homilies For Hellenized Christians Volume II|last=Witherington III|first=Ben|publisher=IVP Academic|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8308-2933-0|location=USA|pages=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Peroratio''===
The ''peroratio'' ("peroration"), as the final part of a speech, had two main purposes in classical rhetoric: to remind the audience of the main points of the speech (''recapitulatio'') and to influence their emotions (''affectus'').  The role of the peroration was defined by Greek writers on rhetoric, who called it ''epilogos''; but it is most often associated with Roman orators, who made frequent use of emotional appeals.  A famous  example was the speech of [[Marcus Antonius Orator|Marcus Antonius]] in defence of [[Manius Aquillius (consul 101 BC)|Aquillius]], during which Antonius tore open the tunic of Aquillius to reveal his battle scars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Oratore]]'', [http://pages.pomona.edu/~cmc24747/sources/cic_web/de_or_2.htm  2.xlvii.194]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first century B.C. it was common for two or more speakers to appear on each side in major court cases.  In such cases it was considered a mark of honour to be asked to deliver the peroration.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]'', [http://www.attalus.org/old/brutus3.html#190  190]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dominican Institute for Oriental Studies''' or '''IDEO''' (from [[French language|French]]: ''Institut dominicain d'études orientales'') is a basic research centre located in [[Cairo]]. Its research field covers the ten first centuries of [[Islam]].

==History==
The Dominican Institute for Oriental Studies was founded in the early 50's, after the [[Second World War]] came to an end.

'''Electronic media''' are [[media (communication)|media]] that use [[electronics]] or [[electromechanical]] [[audience]] to access the content. This is in contrast to static media (mainly [[printing|print]] media), which today are most often [[Desktop publishing|created electronically]], but do not require electronics to be accessed by the end user in the printed form.  The primary electronic media sources familiar to the general public are [[video]] recordings, [[sound recording and reproduction|audio recordings]], [[multimedia]] presentations, [[Presentation program|slide presentations]], [[CD-ROM]] and [[online and offline|online]] content. Most [[new media]] are in the form of [[digital media]]. However, electronic media may be in either [[analogue electronics]] [[data]] or [[digital electronics|digital electronic]] [[digital data|data]] format.

Although the term is usually associated with content recorded on a [[Data storage device|storage medium]], recordings are not required for live [[broadcasting]] and online networking.

Any equipment used in the [[telecommunication|electronic communication]] process (e.g. [[television]], [[Receiver (radio)|radio]], [[telephone]], [[desktop computer]], [[game console]], [[handheld device]]) may also be considered electronic media.

== Uses ==
Electronic media are ubiquitous in most of the developed world. Electronic media devices have found their way into all parts of modern life. The term is relevant to [[media ecology]] for studying its impact compared to printed media and broadening the scope of understanding media beyond a simplistic aspect of media such as one delivery platform (e.g. the World Wide Web) aside from many other options. The term is also relevant to professional career development regarding related skill set.

The '''European Association for Digital Humanities''' ('''EADH'''), formerly known as the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC), is a [[digital humanities]] organisation founded in [[London]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="companion"&gt;History of Humanities Computing, in: A Companion to Digital Humanities (2004), ed. Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens, John Unsworth. Oxford: Blackwell|work= http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to promote the advancement of education in the digital humanities through the development and use of computational methods in research and teaching in the Humanities and related disciplines, especially literary and linguistic computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Constitution |work=EADH.org |url=http://www.allc.org/constitution | date=15 July 2013| accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Association joined the [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO).&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalhumanities.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A precursor for the later following annual conferences of the association was a meeting on literary and linguistic computing organized by Roy Wisbey and Michael Farringdon at the [[University of Cambridge]] in March, 1970. The year after the second conference in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]], in 1972, the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing was founded at a meeting at [[King's College, London]] (1973).&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; Together with the [[Association for Computers and the Humanities]] (ACH) and the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] (ACL), the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing sponsored and organized the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tei-c.org/About/history.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011 the Association's name was changed to the European Association for Digital Humanities, while keeping the allc.org domain name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= ALLC: Proposed Name Change |date= 20 December 2011 |url= http://www.allc.org/news-events/allc-proposed-name-change |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120211210537/http://www.allc.org/news-events/allc-proposed-name-change |archivedate= 11 February 2012 |accessdate= 20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change to 'EADH' was made in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conference ==
The first conferences of the association were held annually until 1988, when a protocol was agreed with the Association for Computing in the Humanities for co-sponsorship of joint international conferences. The venue for these joint conferences alternated between Europe and North America. The first one took place in 1989 at the [[University of Toronto]] in Canada. After the [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] had been formed in 2005, the first joint conference with the new name “Digital Humanities” was held at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Conferences, www.allc.org/conferences; for the 2006 conference, see http://www.allc-ach2006.colloques.paris-sorbonne.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journals ==
Initially, EADH published its own ''Bulletin'' three times a year; its journal twice yearly from 1980 to 1985.&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; Afterwards, bulletin and journal were merged in order to become ''[[Literary and Linguistic Computing]]'' (LLC) in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Terras, Melissa (2005). “Disciplined: Using Curriculum Studies to Define 'Humanities Computing’”, http://pear.hcmc.uvic.ca:8080/ach/site/xhtml.xq?id=43.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary and Linguistic Computing is a peer-reviewed, international journal that publishes texts "on all aspects of computing and information technology applied to literature and language research and teaching."&lt;ref&gt;http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
Membership of the association is by subscription to LLC.&lt;ref&gt;ALLC Membership,http://www.allc.org/about/membership&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010 there were 314 individual subscribers to Literary and Linguistic Computing.&lt;ref&gt;ALLC Membership Report December 2010, http://www.allc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/ALLC_Membership_report_December_2010.pdf.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8287">'''Exocannibalism''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''exo-'', "from outside" and cannibalism, "to eat humans"), as opposed to [[endocannibalism]], is the consumption of flesh outside one's close social group—for example, eating one's enemy. When done ritually, it has been associated with being a means of imbibing valued qualities of the victim or as an act of final violence against the deceased in the case of [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathy]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.deathreference.com/Bl-Ce/Cannibalism.html Cannibalism], Encyclopedia of Death and Dying.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a symbolic expression of the domination of an enemy in warfare.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Dow, [http://personalwebs.oakland.edu/~dow/personal/papers/cannibal/cannibal.html Cannibalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807033139/http://personalwebs.oakland.edu/~dow/personal/papers/cannibal/cannibal.html |date=2007-08-07 }}, Reprinted from Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, Vol. 1. Barbara A. Tenenbaum, ed. Pp. 535-537. New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons{{copyvio link|date=february 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices have been documented in cultures including the [[Aztecs]] from Mexico, the [[Island Caribs|Carib]] and the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]] from South America.

Historically, it has also been used as a practical expediency in especially desperate [[Attrition warfare|attritional]] or [[guerrilla warfare]] when the extreme hunger and the abundance of humans being killed coincide to create conditions ripe for cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, Yuki. ''Hidden horrors: Japanese War Crimes in World War II'', Westview Press, 1996, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; Some viewed the practice of exocannibalism  as an act of predation&lt;ref&gt;Menget, Patrik (1985): Guerre, Sociétés et Vision du Monde dans le basses Terres de L'Amerique du Sud. Jalons pour une étude comparative. In: Journal de la Société des Américanistes 71: 129-141.&lt;/ref&gt; tying the action to more of a prey versus predator scenario than one of ceremonial meaning. Exocannibalism has also historically been viewed as a way to acquire the strength and ability of a defeated enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, R. (2008). You Are What You Eat: Cannibalism, Autophagy and the Case of Armin Meiwes. Territories of Evil, 45, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a final act to either intake or extinguish the existence of an enemy. Notably, the cultures that view exocannibalism as a form of predation do not view the act as taboo. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Cultural practice==
Cannibalism is something that has been found wherever and whenever humans have formed societies. Traditionally, accounts of cannibalism were found embedded in myths and folklore as a common motive that indicated people were less than fully human. Exocannibalism in the form of eating enemies is usually done to express hostility and domination toward the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biasing Cannibalism in Anthropology|last = Neufeldt|first = Robyn|publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrator eats their victim to inflict ultimate indignity and humiliation. It has also been practiced along with headhunting and scalping to display war trophies. John Kantner, an archaeologist who studied alleged cannibalism in the American Southwest, believes that when resources decrease the competition of societies increased and exocannibalism can ensue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Exocannibalism would generally be considered to be the opposite of [[endocannibalism]], but they are both forms of ritual cannibalism. There have been no previous accounts of a culture practicing both forms of ritual cannibalism, aside from a recent study that confirmed the [[Wari’ people|Wari']], an Amazonian tribe in Brazil, practiced both forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dinner with a Cannibal|last = Travis-Henikoff|first = Carole A|publisher = Santa Monica Press|year = 2008|isbn = 9781595800305|location = Santa Monica, CA|pages = 165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wari ===
The Wari people of South America are known for their practice of both endocannibalism and exocannibalism. Endocannibalism had the ability to serve as a form of recognition and respect for the dead. Exocannibalism on the other hand was part of warfare. The Wari had very separate motives behind why they performed each of these modes of cannibalism but both forms had the same basic steps of roasting either flesh or bone and then eating it.&lt;ref&gt;Consuming Grief: Compassionate Cannibalism in an Amazonian Society. Beth A. Conklin. Austin, Texas: University Of Texas, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Wari warriors would kill enemies such as the Brazilians, Bolivians, and members of enemy tribes. The Wari consumed these enemies as a means of transforming them into a form of prey. They viewed warfare cannibalism as a form of predation or hunting. They used exocannibalism as a means by which to label their enemies as subhuman and make their flesh as unimportant as that of any other animal that was typically killed for food.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin B (1997) Consuming Images: Representations of Cannibalism on the Amazonian Frontier. Anthropological Quarterly, 70(2), 68-78. doi:10.2307/3317507&lt;/ref&gt; This practice of cannibalism was continued by the Wari people until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Vilaça A.

Available from: Academic Search Premier, Ipswich, MA. Accessed November 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fiji ===
The people of Fiji are also documented as having participated in exocannibalism as a form of ritualistic behavior, though history of this is typically hidden by European modification.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, S. (2003). Cannibals Talk: A Response to Obeyesekere &amp; Arens (AT 19,5). Anthropology Today, 19(6), 20-20. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/3695244&lt;/ref&gt; From Fijian legend, the development of the island was due to a god who brought with him cannibalism and warfare. When he arrived on the island, he then married into the single indigenous family. That family then populated the island. This legend along with cannibalism continued into the reality of Fijian people. During wartime, chiefs were able to have their pick of the warriors and soldiers who were killed, seeking out the most famous of those slain. The rest of the soldiers killed that chief did not want would be consumed by the rest of the common people. This form of consumption of the dead was not out of need but instead served as a means by which to assert their power over a conquered people. Consumption of human flesh was not viewed as taboo, but instead was viewed as an act of dining with the gods or dining on the food of gods.&lt;ref&gt;Sahlins MD. 1983. Raw women, cooked men, and other ‘great things’ of the Fiji Islands. The Ethnography of Cannibalism, P Brown, D Tuzin (eds). Society for Psychological Anthropology, University of California Press: Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toren C. 1998. Cannibalism and compassion: Transformations in Fijian concepts of the Person. Common Worlds and Single Lives: Constituting Knowledge in Pacific Societies, V Keck (ed.). Berg: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with consuming the flesh to show domination over slain enemies, cannibalism was also part of both political and religious rituals performed by the Fijian people. Cannibalism persisted in the Fijian culture because of the cultural beliefs regarding it.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz de Montellano BR. 1978. Aztec cannibalism: An ecological necessity? Science 200: 611–617.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role that gender plays as a risk factor for suicide has been studied extensively. While females show higher rates of non-fatal suicidal behavior and suicide ideation (thoughts),&lt;ref name="Krug"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; and reportedly attempt suicide more frequently than males do,&lt;ref name=EB2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fava"/&gt; males have a much higher rate of completed suicides.&lt;ref name=Var2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO 2000-2012"/&gt;

As of recent World Health Organization ([[WHO]]) releases, challenges represented by [[social stigma]], the [[taboo]] to openly discuss suicide, and low availability of data are still to date obstacles leading to poor data quality for both suicide and suicide attempts: "given the sensitivity of suicide – and the illegality of suicidal behaviour in some countries – it is likely that under-reporting and misclassification are greater problems for suicide than for most other causes of death.".&lt;ref name="WHO_Suicide2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide - Challenges and obstacles |website=who.int |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs398/en/ |date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WHO |title=Self-directed violence|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/factsheets/en/selfdirectedviolfacts.pdf |website=www.who.int |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors ===
Many researchers have attempted to find explanations for why gender is such a significant indicator for suicide.
A common explanation relies on the social constructions of [[hegemonic masculinity]] and [[femininity]]. According to literature on gender and suicide, male suicide rates are explained in terms of traditional gender roles. Male gender roles tend to emphasize greater levels of strength, independence, risk-taking behavior, [[socioeconomic status|economic status]], [[individualism]].&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Payne, Sarah| title=The social construction of gender and its influence on suicide: a review of the literature | journal=Journal of Men's Health | volume=5 | issue=1 | pages=23–35  | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875686708000146 | doi=10.1016/j.jomh.2007.11.002|display-authors=etal | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ParadoxSuicidalProcess2011&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=[[Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention]] |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2011.03.050 |authors=Schrijvers DL, Bollen J, Sabbe BG (Belgium) |date=6 May 2011 |title=Suicide Research: Selected Readings - The gender paradox in suicidal behavior and its impact on the suicidal process |volume= 6 (May 2011–October 2011) |pages=56–57 |url=https://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/499348/SuicideResearchVol6.pdf#page=67 |pmid=21529962 |journal=J Affect Disord}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Epidemiology" /&gt; Reinforcement of this gender role often prevents males from seeking help for suicidal feelings and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref name="Moller" /&gt;

Numerous other factors have been put forward as the cause of the gender paradox. Part of the gap may be explained by heightened levels of stress that result from traditional gender roles. For example, the death of a spouse and [[divorce]] are risk factors for suicide in both genders, but the effect is somewhat mitigated for females.&lt;ref name="Divorce"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Stack, Steven | title=New Micro-Level Data on the Impact of Divorce on Suicide, 1959–1980: A Test of Two Theories | journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume=52 | issue=1 | pages=119–127 | jstor=10.2307/352844 | doi=10.2307/352844 | year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Western world, females are more likely to maintain social and familial connections that they can turn to for support after losing their spouse.&lt;ref name="Divorce" /&gt; Another factor closely tied to gender roles is employment status. Males' vulnerability may be heightened during times of [[unemployment]] because of societal expectations that males should provide for themselves and their families.&lt;ref name="Moller" /&gt;

It has been noted that the gender gap is less stark in [[Developing country|developing nations]]. One theory put forward for the smaller gap is the increased burden of motherhood due to cultural norms. In regions where the identity of females is constructed around the family, having young children may correlate with lower risks for suicide.&lt;ref name="Payne" /&gt; At the same time, stigma attached to [[infertility]] or having children outside of marriage can contribute to higher rates of suicide among women.&lt;ref name="Girard"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Girard, Chris | title=Age, Gender, and Suicide: A Cross-National Analysis | journal=American Sociological Review | volume=58 | issue=4 | pages=553–574 | jstor=10.2307/2096076 | doi=10.2307/2096076 | year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a group of sociologists examined the gender and suicide gap by considering how cultural factors impacted suicide rates. The four cultural factors – power-distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity – were measured for 66 countries using data from the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology" /&gt; Cultural beliefs regarding individualism were most closely tied to the gender gap; countries that placed a higher value on individualism showed higher rates of male suicide. Power-distance, defined as the social separation of people based on finances or status, was negatively correlated with suicide. However, countries with high levels of power-distance had higher rates of female suicide.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology" /&gt; The study ultimately found that stabilizing cultural factors had a stronger effect on suicide rates for women than men.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rudmin, Lloyd Webster | title=Questions of Culture, Age, and Gender in the Epidemiology of Suicide | journal=[[Scandinavian Journal of Psychology]] | volume=44 | pages=373–381 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9450.00357/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false | doi=10.1111/1467-9450.00357 | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differing methods by gender ===
{{Main|Suicide methods}}
The reported difference in suicide rates for males and females is partially a result of the methods used by each gender. Although females attempt suicide at a higher rate,&lt;ref name=EB2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fava"/&gt; they are more likely to use methods that are less immediately lethal.&lt;ref name=Sue2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; Males frequently complete suicide via high mortality actions such as hanging, carbon-monoxide poisoning, and firearms. This is in contrast to females, who tend to rely on drug overdosing.&lt;ref name="gender paradox"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Schrijvers, Didier | title=The gender paradox in suicidal behavior and its impact on the suicidal process | journal=Journal of Affective Disorders | volume=138 | issue=2 | pages=19–26 | doi=10.1016/j.jad.2011.03.050 | pmid=21529962 | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While overdosing can be deadly, it is less immediate and therefore more likely to be caught before death occurs. In Europe, where the gender discrepancy is the greatest, a study found that the most frequent method of suicide among both genders was hanging; however, the use of hanging was significantly higher in males (54.3%) than in females (35.6%). The same study found that the second most common methods were firearms (9.7%) for men and poisoning by drugs (24.7%) for women.&lt;ref name="suicide methods" /&gt;

=== Preventive strategies ===
In the United States, both the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] and the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]] address different methods of reducing suicide, but do not recognize the separate needs of males and females.&lt;ref name="Payne" /&gt; In 2002, the English Department of Health launched a suicide prevention campaign that was aimed at high-risk groups including young men, prisoners, and those with mental health disorders.&lt;ref name="Payne" /&gt; The [[Campaign Against Living Miserably]] is a charity in the UK that attempts to highlight this issue for public discussion. Some studies have found that because young females are at a higher risk of attempting suicide, policies tailored towards this demographic are most effective at reducing overall rates. Researchers have also recommended more aggressive and long-term treatments and follow up for males that show indications of suicidal thoughts. Shifting cultural attitudes about [[gender roles]] and norms, and especially ideas about masculinity, may also contribute to closing the gender gap.&lt;ref name="Payne" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Thompson, Martie| title=Examining Gender Differences in Risk Factors for Suicide Attempts Made 1 and 7 Years Later in a Nationally Representative Sample | journal=Journal of Adolescent Health | volume=48 | pages=391–397 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X1000368X | doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.07.018|display-authors=etal | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence of completed suicide is vastly higher among males than females among all age groups in most of the world. As of 2015, almost two-thirds of worldwide suicides (representing about 1.5% of all deaths) are committed by men.&lt;ref name=GBD2015De&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators.|title=Global, regional, and national life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes of death, 1980-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.|journal=Lancet|date=8 October 2016|volume=388|issue=10053|pages=1459–1544|pmid=27733281|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31012-1|pmc=5388903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Since the 1950s, typically males have died from suicidal attempts three to five times more often than females.&lt;ref name="1950sUSstats"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deaths by suicide per 100,000 resident population in the United States from 1950 to 2015, by gender|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/187478/death-rate-from-suicide-in-the-us-by-gender-since-1950/|publisher=statista.com|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familyfirstaid.org/suicide.html|title=Teen Suicide Statistics|year=2001|publisher=FamilyFirstAid.org|work=Adolescent Teenage Suicide Prevention|accessdate=2006-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Less likely"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Murphy, George E. | title=Why Women are Less Likely Than Men to Commit Suicide | journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry | volume=39 | issue=4 | pages=165–175 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X98900578 | doi=10.1016/S0010-440X(98)90057-8 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of mental health resources may be a significant contributor to the gender difference in suicide rates in the US. Studies have shown that females are 13–21% more likely than males to receive a psychiatric affective diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Kung"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kung, Hsiang-Ching| title=Risk factors for male and female suicide decedents ages 15–64 in the United States | journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology | volume=38 | issue=8 | pages=419–426 | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-003-0656-x#page-1 | doi=10.1007/s00127-003-0656-x|display-authors=etal | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 72–89% of females who committed suicide had contact with a mental health professional at some point in their life and 41–58% of males who committed suicide had contact with a mental health professional.&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt;

Within the United States, there are variances in gendered rates of suicide by ethnic group.&lt;ref name="Cultural"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldston|first=David B.|author2=Sherry Davis Molock |author3=Leslie B. Whitbeck |author4=Jessica L. Murakami |author5=Luis H. Zayas |author6=Gordon C.

Among African American suicides, it has been suggested that females usually have better access to communal and familial relations that may mitigate other risk factors for suicide. Among Hispanic populations, the same study showed that cultural values of ''[[marianismo]]'', which emphasizes female docility and deference to males, may help explain the higher rate of suicide of Latinas relative to Latinos.&lt;ref name="Cultural" /&gt; The authors of this study did not extrapolate their conclusions on ethnicity to populations outside the United States.

=== Europe ===
The gender-suicide gap is generally highest in Western countries. Among the nations of Europe, the gender gap is particularly large in Eastern European countries such as [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], and [[Hungary]]. Some researchers attribute the higher rates in former Soviet countries to be a remnant of recent political instability. An increased focus on family led to females becoming more highly valued. Rapid economic fluctuations prevented males from providing fully for their families, which prevented them from fulfilling their traditional gender role. Combined, these factors could account for the gender gap.&lt;ref name="Moller"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Möller-Leimkühler, Anne Maria  | title=The gender gap in suicide and premature death or: why are men so vulnerable?  | journal=European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience  | volume=253  | issue=1 | pages= 1–8 | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-003-0397-6#page-1 | doi=10.1007/s00406-003-0397-6 | pmid=12664306 | date=Feb 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suicide methods"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Varnik, A| title=Suicide methods in Europe: a gender-specific analysis of countries participating in the ''European Alliance Against Depression'' | journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Public Health | volume=62 | pages=545–551 | url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/62/6/545.short | issue=6 | doi=10.1136/jech.2007.065391|display-authors=etal | year=2008| pmc=2569832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research indicates that higher instances of alcoholism among males in these nations may be to blame.&lt;ref name="Alcohol"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Landburg, Jonas | title=Alcohol and Suicide in eastern Europe | journal=Centre for Social Research on Alcohol and Drugs | volume=27 | pages=361–373| url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09595230802093778 | doi=10.1080/09595230802093778 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, suicides rates amongst under-45 men in UK reached a 15-year high of 78% of the total 5,140.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 'A crisis of masculinity': men are struggling to cope with life | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11238596/A-crisis-of-masculinity-men-are-struggling-to-cope-with-life.html|date=19 Nov 2014| accessdate = 2014-11-20 | publisher = The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-Western nations ===
A higher male mortality from suicide is also evident from data of non-Western countries: the [[Caribbean]], often considered part of the [[Western World|West]] is the most prominent example. In 1979–81, out of 74 countries with a non-zero suicide rate, 69 countries had male suicide rates greater than females, two reported equal rates for the sexes ([[Seychelles]] and [[Kenya]]), while three reported female rates exceeding male rates ([[Papua New Guinea]], [[Macau]], and [[French Guiana]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lester, Patterns, Table 3.3, pp. 31-33&lt;/ref&gt; The contrast is even greater today, with WHO statistics showing China as the only country where the suicide rate of females matches or exceeds that of males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide_rates/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122021659/http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide_rates/en/ |archivedate=January 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barraclough found that the female rates of those aged 5–14 equaled or exceeded the male rates only in 14 countries, mainly in [[South America]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barraclough BM |title=Sex ratio of juvenile suicide |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=434–5 |year=1987 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089085670965704X |doi=10.1097/00004583-198705000-00027 |pmid=3496328 |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In most countries, the majority of committed suicides are made by men but, in China, women are more likely to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="Barlow, D. H. 2011"&gt;Barlow, D. H., and V. M. Durand. Abnormal psychology, an integrative approach. Wadsworth Pub Co, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 China's ratio was around 8 males for every 10 females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Suicide rates, age-standardized Data by country|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.MHSUICIDEASDR?lang=en|publisher=WHO|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional gender roles in China hold women responsible for keeping the family happy and intact. Suicide for women in China is shown in literature to be an acceptable way to avoid disgrace that may be brought to themselves or their families.&lt;ref name="Barlow, D. H. 2011" /&gt;  According to a 2002 review, the most common reasons for the difference in rate between genders are: "the lower status of Chinese women, love, marriage, marital infidelity, and family problems, the methods used to commit suicide, and mental health of Chinese women."&lt;ref name=Zhang2002/&gt;  Another explanation for increased suicide in women in China is that pesticides are easily accessible and tend to be used in many suicide attempts made by women.&lt;ref name=Zhang2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=J|last2=Jiang|first2=C|last3=Jia|first3=S|last4=Wieczorek|first4=WF|title=An Overview of Suicide Research in China.|journal=Archives of Suicide Research |date=2002|volume=6|issue=2|pages=167–184|doi=10.1080/13811110208951174|pmid=20686645|pmc=2913725}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rate of nonlethal suicidal behavior is 40 to 60 percent higher in women than it is in men. This is due to the fact that more women are diagnosed as depressed than men, and also that depression is correlated with suicide attempts.&lt;ref name="Barlow, D. H. 2011" /&gt;

Global concerns about the '''gender disparity in computing''' occupations have gained more importance with the emerging [[information age]]. These concerns motivated [[public policy]] debates addressing [[gender equality]] as computer applications exerted increasing influence in society. This dialogue helped to expand information technology innovations and to reduce the consequences of [[sexism]].

== Background ==
{{See also|Women in computing}}
In the early days of computers and computing, women were well-represented in the field.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/researcher-reveals-how-“computer-geeks”-replaced-“computergirls”|title=Researcher reveals how “Computer Geeks” replaced “Computer Girls”|last=Frink|first=Brenda D.|date=1 June 2011|website=Gender News|publisher=Stanford University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312130252/http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/researcher-reveals-how-%E2%80%9Ccomputer-geeks%E2%80%9D-replaced-%E2%80%9Ccomputergirls%E2%80%9D#|archive-date=2015-03-12|dead-url=no|access-date=22 October 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often worked as "human computers," making complicated calculations and working in large groups, such as the [[Harvard Computers]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=82}} Women also worked on ballistics calculations and cryptography.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=130}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/women-were-key-code-breaking-bletchley-park-180954044/|title=Women Were Key to WWII Code-Breaking at Bletchley Park|last=Fessenden|first=Marissa|work=Smithsonian|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human computers who were women could be paid less than their male counterparts.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}} By 1943, the majority of human computers were women.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}} Many early programmers on machines such as [[ENIAC]], were mostly women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reason that women were involved as programmers and human computers was because "they expected programming to be a low skill clerical function," and that the difficult work was the creation of the hardware, which male engineers largely worked on.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The programmers of the ENIAC, six women who designed the public demonstrations and prepared the machine for its public debut were not fully recognized for their contributions by the media.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=51}}

By the 1960s, while computer programming was still touted as a good field for women to go into, major shifts were beginning to take place that would help push women out of the field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Men who were programming started to make the field more "prestigious," creating professional associations, education requirements for work and by actively discouraging hiring women in the field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hiring tools were introduced in which answers were shared among all-male groups and clubs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another way to push women out of the field was to use [[Personality test|personality tests]] that favored people who were not interested in working with others, which was slanted towards a certain type of male applicant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After these trends were entrenched in the industry, it has continued to perpetuate itself into the modern day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some computer science programs, such as [[Princeton University|Princeton]], in the mid-1960s wouldn't even admit women into their program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4892094/google-diversity-history-memo/|title=Women in Tech and the History Behind That Controversial Google Diversity Memo|last=Waxman|first=Olvia B.|date=8 August 2017|website=Time|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender gap==
A survey, conducted by SWIFT ("Supporting Women in Information Technology") based in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, asked 7,411 participants questions about their career choices. The survey found that females tend to believe that they lack the skill set needed to be successful in the field of computing. This study (as well as others) provides a strong base for a positive correlation between perceived ability and career choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Chan, Vania |author2=Stafford, Katie |author3=Klawe, Maria |author4=Chen, Grace |title=Gender Differences in Vancouver Secondary Students' Interests Related to Information Technology Careers |publisher=Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia |year=2000 |url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/swift/survey_stats/career_choice_survey/SurveyPaper.doc |access-date=2016-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221164825/http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/swift/survey_stats/career_choice_survey/SurveyPaper.doc# |archive-date=2007-02-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A project based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], "Strategies of Inclusion: Gender and the Information Society" (SIGIS) released its findings based on research conducted in 48 separate case studies all over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner, Wendy (2004). [http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/sigis/public/documents/SIGIS_D08_Final_Public.pdf "Strategies of Inclusion: Gender and the Information Society - Final Report"]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, SIGIS, University of Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings focus on recruiting as well as retention techniques for women already studying in the field. These techniques range from the introduction of role models, advertisement campaigns, and the allocation of quotas, in order to make the computing field appear more gender neutral.&lt;ref name="sigis"&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof Robin Williams|title=Getting More Women in Computer Science and Engineering|publisher=University of Edinburgh|url=http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/sigis/public/documents/SIGIS_D08_05_computing.pdf|access-date=2016-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716225701/http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/sigis/public/documents/SIGIS_D08_05_computing.pdf#|archive-date=2011-07-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educating reforms, which will increase the quality of the educating body and technological facilities, are also suggested.&lt;ref name="sigis" /&gt;

Research suggests that [[Malaysia]] has a much more equal split that varies around the half-way mark.&lt;ref name="mala"&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof. Vivian Anette Lagesen |title=A Cyberfeminist Utopia?: Perceptions of Gender and Computer Science among Malaysian Women Computer Science Students and Faculty|publisher=Sage Publications|url=http://sth.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/33/1/5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A job in the computing industry also implies a safe work environment. Strong belief by the previous generation that IT would be a flourishing sector with many job opportunities caused parents to encourage their children to take a computing career, no matter the gender.&lt;ref name="mala" /&gt;

In India, a growing number of women are studying and taking careers in technical fields. The percentage of women engineers graduating from IIT Bombay grew from 
1.8% in 1972 to 8% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simard |first=Caroline |url=http://anitaborginstitute.org/files/womenhightechworld.pdf |format=PDF |title= The state of women and technology fields around the world |publisher= Anita Borg Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women in Arab societies|Arab women]] made up 59% of students enrolled in computer science in 2014 at government universities located in Saudi Arabia.{{Sfn|Islam|2017|p=13}} Women in [[Eastern Europe]], especially in Bulgaria and Romania, have high rates of pursuing coding and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/women-in-tech-why-bulgaria-and-romania-are-leading-in-software-engineering/|title=Women in tech: Why Bulgaria and Romania are leading in software engineering {{!}} ZDNet|last=Fiscutean|first=Andrada|date=13 June 2017|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women remain underrepresented in information technology fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Varma | first1 = Roli | year = 2010 | title = Computing self-efficiency among women in India | url = http://www.unm.edu/~varma/print/JWMSE_CS%20Self%20Efficacy.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 257–274 | doi=10.1615/jwomenminorscieneng.v16.i3.40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics in education===
In the United States, the proportion of women represented in undergraduate [[computer science]] education and the white-collar [[information technology]] workforce peaked in the mid-1980s, and has declined ever since. In 1984, 37.1% of [[Computer Science]] degrees were awarded to women; the percentage dropped to 29.9% in 1989-1990, and 26.7% in 1997-1998.&lt;ref&gt;Camp, Tracy (2001). [http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~women/resources/aroundTheWeb/hostedPapers/Syllabus-Camp.pdf "Women in Computer Science: Reversing the Trend"]. Colorado School of Mines.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures from the [[Computing Research Association]] Taulbee Survey indicate that fewer than 12% of Computer Science bachelor's degrees were awarded to women at U.S. PhD-granting institutions in 2010-11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cra.org/uploads/documents/resources/taulbee/CS_Degree_and_Enrollment_Trends_2010-11.pdf "Computing Degree and Enrollment Trends"], 2010-2011 CRA Taulbee Survey. The Computing Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although teenage girls are now using computers and the Internet at rates similar to their male peers, they are five times less likely to consider a technology-related career or plan on taking post-secondary technology classes.&lt;ref&gt;Melkymuka, Kathleen (8 January 2001). [http://www.computerworld.com/article/2590257/it-personnel/if-girls-don-t-get-it---it-won-t-get-girls.html "If Girls Don't Get IT, IT Won't Get Girls"], Computer World.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology]] (NCWIT) reports that of the [[SAT]] takers who intend to major in computer and information sciences, the proportion of girls has steadily decreased relative to the proportion of boys, from 20 percent in 2001 to 12 percent in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Stross, Randall  (15 November 2008). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/business/16digi.html?_r=0 "What Has Driven Women Out of Computer Science?"], The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;  While this number has been decreasing, in 2001, the total number of these students (both boys and girls) reached its peak at 73,466.

According to a [[College Board]] report, in 2006 there were slightly more girls than boys amongst SAT takers that reported to having "course work or experience" in [[computer literacy]], word processing, internet activity, and creating spreadsheets/databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/cbsenior/yr2006/national-report.pdf 2006 College-Bound Seniors - Total Group Profile Report], CollegeBoard SAT.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also determined that more boys than girls (59% vs 41%) reported course work or experience with [[computer programming]], although this may likely be caused by false reporting. Of the 146,437 students (13%) who reported having ''no'' course work or experience, 61% were girls and 39% were boys.

More boys than girls take [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) Computer Science exams. According to the College Board in 2006, 2,594 girls and 12,068 boys took the AP Computer Science A exam, while 517 girls and 4,422 boys took the more advanced AP Computer Science AB exam. From 1996 to 2004, girls made up 16–17% of those taking the AP Computer Science A exam and around 10% of those taking AP Computer Science AB exam.

===Statistics in the workforce===
Women's representation in the computing and information technology workforce has been falling from a peak of 38% in the mid-1980s. From 1993 through 1999, NSF's SESTAT reported that the percentage of women working as computer/information scientists (including those who hold a bachelor's degree or higher in an S&amp;E field or have a bachelor's degree or higher and are working in an S&amp;E field) declined slightly from 33.1% to 29.6% percent while the absolute numbers increased from 170,500 to 185,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/us-workforce/ "Characteristics of Scientists and Engineers in the US"], National Science Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Catalyst in 2006 indicated that women comprise 27-29% of the computing workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Misa, ed. (2010). ''Gender Codes: Why Women Are Leaving Computing''. Wiley/IEEE Computer Society Press. pp. 32-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt; A [[National Public Radio]] report in 2013 stated that about 20% of all U.S. computer programmers are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

==Benefits of gender diversity==
A gender-diverse team is more likely to create products that meet people's requirements. When women are underrepresented, many technical decisions are based on men's experiences, opinions, and judgement, resulting in a male-slanted bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aauw.org/research/solving-the-equation/|title=Solving the Equation: The Variables for Women's Success in Engineering and Computing|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a review of research on gender-diverse teams reveals that gender-diverse teams are more productive, more creative, and more able to stay on schedule and within budget, compared to homogenous teams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/impactgenderdiversitytechbusinessperformance_print.pdf|title=What Is the Impact of Gender Diversity on Technology Business Performance?: Research Summary|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other research review suggests that the results are mixed, with many studies showing no result, non-linear results or even negative results of gender diversity on team performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/16372408/received-wisdom-relationship-between-diversity-organizational-performance|title=RECEIVED WISDOM AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIVERSITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research conducted by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] showed that companies with women in top management were more financially successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/is_there_a_payoff_from_top-team_diversity|title=Is there a payoff from top-team diversity?|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast analysis of sample major US companies showed no effect of inclusion of women (or minority members) on financial performance, these varied results give no conclusive evidence of the benefits of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8683.2010.00809.x/abstract|title=The Gender and Ethnic Diversity of US Boards and Board Committees and Firm Financial Performance|accessdate=25 August 2015 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8683.2010.00809.x|volume=18|journal=Corporate Governance: An International Review|pages=396–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Gender and Computers: Understanding the Digital Divide'' states that the lack of participation of females in computing excludes them from the "new economy", which calls for sophisticated computer skills in exchange for high salary positions.&lt;ref name="digital divide"&gt;Cooper, J.; Weaver, K. (2003). ''Gender and Computers: Understanding the Digital Divide''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-8058-4427-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors contributing to lack of female participation==

===Education===
Diminished participation by women relative to men in computer science dates from about 1984&lt;ref name=NSFstatistics&gt;{{cite web|title=TABLE 33. Computer sciences degrees awarded, by degree level and sex of recipient: 1966–2010|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf13327/pdf/tab33.pdf|publisher=NSF|accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following mass marketing of personal computers to boys as toys to play games. Fiddling with computers by boys resulted in increased interest and readiness for computer science classes by young men.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|author1=Steve Henn|title=When Women Stopped Coding|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding|accessdate=December 26, 2014|work=Morning Edition|publisher=NPR|date=October 21, 2014|quote=The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of over 7000 high school students in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]] showed that the degree of interest in the field of [[computer science]] for young women is comparably lower than that of young men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Handcock, Mark S. et al. (2004). [https://www.webcitation.org/67YOr88gp?url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/wccce/program04/Papers/mark.html "Focus on Women in Computer Science"], University of British Columbia. Archived from [http://www.cs.ubc.ca/wccce/program04/Papers/mark.html the original] on 10 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The same effect is seen in higher education; for instance, only 4% of female college freshmen expressed intention to major in computer science in the US.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt; Research has shown that some aspects about computing may discourage women. One of the biggest turn-offs is the "geek factor". High school girls often envisage a career in computing as a lifetime in an isolated cubicle writing code. The "geek factor" affects both male and female high school students, but it seems to have more of a negative effect on the female students.&lt;ref name="dean"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dean|first=Cornelia|title=Computer Science Takes Steps to Bring Women to the Fold|work=[[New York Times]]|date=17 April 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/science/17comp.html?_r=2&amp;8dpc=&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, computer programmers depicted in popular media are overwhelmingly male, contributing to an absence of role models for would-be female computer programmers.  However, in 2015, computer science has for the first time become the most popular major for female students at Stanford University.&lt;ref name=stanfordcs&gt;{{cite web|last1=McBride|first1=Sarah|title=Computer science now top major for women at Stanford University|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-women-technology-stanford-idUSKCN0S32F020151009|website=Reuters US Edition|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part to qualify for federal education funding distributed through the states, most U.S. states and districts now focus on ensuring that all students are at least "proficient" in mathematics and reading, making it difficult for teachers to focus on teaching concepts beyond the test. According to a Rand Corporation study, such a concentration on testing can cause administrators to focus resources on tested subjects at the expense of other subjects (e.g., science) or distract their attention from other needs.&lt;ref&gt;Stecher, B. M. (2002).  "Consequences of large-scale, high-stakes testing on school and classroom practice". In: Hamilton, L. S., B. M. Stecher, and S. P. Klein (Eds.). ''Making sense of test-based accountability in education''. Santa Monica, CA: Rand Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, computational thinking is unlikely to be taught either standalone or as integrated into other areas of study (e.g., mathematics, biology) anytime in the near future. The National Center for Women &amp; IT distributes free resources for increasing awareness of the need for teaching computer science in schools, including the "Talking Points" card, "Moving Beyond Computer Literacy: Why Schools Should Teach Computer Science".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncwit.org/resources.res.talking.curriculum.html Moving Beyond Computer Literacy: Why Schools Should Teach Computer Science] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529040434/http://www.ncwit.org/resources.res.talking.curriculum.html |date=May 29, 2012 }}, [[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female and male perspectives===
[[File:Not_boyfriends_computer.jpg|thumb|The sticker reads, "No, this is not my boyfriend's computer."]]
According to a 1998–2000 ethnographic study by Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], men and women viewed computers very differently. Women interviewees were more likely to state that they saw the computer as a tool for use within a larger societal and/or interdisciplinary context than did the men interviewed. On the other hand, men were more likely to express an interest in the computer as a machine.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margolis, J. et al. (1999). [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8515 ''Unlocking the Clubhouse''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713080000/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8515 |date=July 13, 2012 }}. The MIT Press. p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, women interviewed in this study perceived that many of their male peers were "geeks," with limited social skills. Females often disliked the idea that computers "become their life."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The students observed and interviewed in that study were probably not representative of students in general, since at that time, in order to be admitted to CMU Computer Science a student needed to have some programming experience. More research is needed to understand the ability to generalize Margolis' and Fisher's findings.

A two-year research initiative published in 2000 by [[AAUW]] found that "Girls approach the computer as a "tool" useful primarily for what it can do; boys more often view the computer as a "toy" and/or an extension of the self. For boys, the computer is inherently interesting. Girls are interested in its instrumental possibilities, which may include its use as an artistic medium. They express scorn toward boys who confuse "real" power and power on a screen. "I see a computer as a tool," a high school girl declares. "You [might] go play Kung Fu Fighting, but in real life you are still a stupid little person living in a suburban way."&lt;ref&gt;AAUW Educational Foundation Commission on Technology, Gender, and Teacher Education (2000). [http://history.aauw.org/files/2013/01/TechSavvy.pdf "Tech Savvy: Educating Girls in the New Computer Age"], p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed as far back as 2000 that boys and girls use computers at about the same rates, albeit for somewhat different purposes.

Nearly 1000 students in [[University of Akron]] were surveyed, and it was discovered that females hold a more negative attitude towards computers than males.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt; Another study assessed the computer-related attitude of over 300 students in [[University of Winnipeg]] and obtained similar results.&lt;ref name="digital divide" /&gt;

This is thought to contribute to the gender disparity phenomenon in computing, in particular the females' early lack of interest in the field.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt;

===Barriers to advancement===
Research on the barriers that women face in undergraduate computing&lt;ref&gt;Cohoon, J. McGrath; Aspray, William (2006). [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10924 ''Women and Information Technology: Research on Underrepresentation''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106035820/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10924 |date=January 6, 2012 }}, Chapter 5. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has highlighted such factors as:

* Undergraduate classroom teaching in which the "weedout" practices and policies privileging competition over cooperation tend to advantage men.
* Laboratory climates in which women are seen as foreign and not belonging at best, and experience blatant hostility and sexism at worst.
* Well-meaning people who unwittingly create [[stereotype threat]] by reminding students that "women can do computing as well as men".
* Strong resistance to changing the system in which these and other subtle practices are continuously reproduced.

Just like in the pre-college situation, solutions are most often implemented outside of the mainstream (e.g., providing role models, mentoring, and women's groups), which can also create the perception among women, their male peers, and their professors that to be successful, women need "extra help" to graduate. Most people do not realize that the "extra help" is not academic, but instead access to the kind of peer networks more readily available to male students. Many women decline to participate in these extracurricular support groups because they do not want to appear deficient. In short, the conditions under which women (and underrepresented minority students) study computing are not the same as those experienced by men.

===Lack of acknowledgment and promotion of skills===
Women in technical roles often feel that the skills and feedback they bring to their jobs are not valued. According to a Catalyst report called "Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers", 65% of females in technical roles felt that those they reported to were receptive and responsive to their suggestions, as compared to 75% of women in non-technical roles.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"&gt;Foust-Cummings, Heather; Sabattini, Laura; Carter, Nancy (2008). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/36/women-in-technology-maximizing-talent-minimizing-barriers "Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers"]. Catalyst.&lt;/ref&gt; This also speaks directly to the retention of females in the industry as females will commonly leave a company when they feel that what they are offering a company is not valued.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt; The report shows the concerns felt about this by sharing the following quote from an interviewee: "I would like to be involved with more projects than I am currently involved in; I feel that I am being underutilized. I would prefer my supervisor give me an opportunity to expand my skill sets and my responsibility at work".&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt;

However, it is not enough to just acknowledge skills. Women also lack the support and advocacy needed to promote these skills.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"&gt;(2003). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/17/bit-by-bit-catalysts-guide-to-advancing-women-in-high-tech-companies "Bit by Bit: Catalyst's Guide to Advancing Women in High Tech Companies"]. Catalyst.&lt;/ref&gt; Women feel alone and at a loss because they lack role models, networks, and mentors.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"/&gt; These support systems not only help women develop talent and opportunities for career advancement, but they are also needed to promote women to more senior roles.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"/&gt; It can be understood that advocacy is a major player in the advancement of females into senior tech roles.

===Stereotyping computer scientists===
Other research examines that undergraduates' stereotype of the people in computer science and how changing this stereotype through media can influence women's interest in computer science. Through this study they concluded that the image of computer science majors that is most prevalent in popular culture and in the minds of current undergraduates is someone who is highly intelligent, primarily obsessed with computers, and socially unskilled. This image can be considered to contrast with the more people-oriented, traditionally feminine image. According to this study, students continue to generate and propagate this stereotype when asked to describe people in computer science. Based on the results of their experiment based on this idea, they took a group of women and men undergraduates and had them read a stereotypical article and a non-stereotypical article. They found that women who read the non-stereotypical article were much more interested in computer science than those who read the article with the above-mentioned stereotypical computer science student.  Overall, they concluded that the underrepresentation of women in computing not due to women's lack of interest. The study contests the perception that college major decisions are free choices, instead they discuss the implications that the major decisions are more constrained by the prevalent stereotypes. This has a negative consequence such that it prevents women from developing an interest in these technical fields. The finding suggests that the stereotypical image of the computer scientists is unattractive to women who would otherwise be interested if presented with a true representation or role model from the computer science field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = The Stereotypical Computer Scientist: Gendered Media Representations As A Barrier To Inclusion For Women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 69 | issue = 1/2| page = 58 | doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0296-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial stereotyping is also an issue, as computer scientists can often be thought of as white or Asian males, which can make it difficult for people who fall outside of those ethnicities to get hired. Non-white or Asian women may experience additional difficulty because they fail to match either half of the stereotype.&lt;ref name="Ortutay 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ortutay|first1=Barbara|title=Why is there so much attention but so little progress for diversity in tech?|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-diversity-tech-little-progress-ap-bsi-20170125-story.html|accessdate=30 Apr 2017|work=chicagotribune.com|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=25 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it has been found that a women’s race is less likely to affect the probability of her choosing computing or a related field.&lt;ref name="Trusty 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trusty|first1=Jerry|title=Effects of high school course-taking and other variables on choice of science and mathematics college majors. (Research).|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|date=2002|volume=80|issue=4|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases that subvert the stereotype of typical people in computing include the person coming from a family that is already involved in computing or a related field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kekelis|first1=Linda S.|last2=Ancheta|first2=Rebecca Wepsic|last3=Heber|first3=Etta|title=Hurdles in the pipeline: girls and technology careers.|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|date=2005|volume=26|issue=1|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, coming from a family of a higher socioeconomic status is correlated to a higher likelihood of women choosing computing or a related field.&lt;ref name="Trusty 2002" /&gt; Yet, many computing companies only search for employees from prestigious schools, which leaves fewer opportunities.&lt;ref name="Ortutay 2017" /&gt;

===Fraternity-like startup environments===
The disproportionate number of startups in the computing industry, and the disproportionate hiring of primarily young workers, have created an environment in which many firms' technical teams consist largely of workers who are recent college graduates, sometimes giving the businesses fraternity-like cultures, leading to [[Sexism in the technology industry|sexism]] that discourages female participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/09/18/heres-the-conversation-men-need-to-have-about-sexism-as-told-by-a-man/|title=Sexism In Startups: The Frank Conversation We Need To Be Having|first=Joseph|last=Steinberg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of fraternity-like environments among technology teams of startup firms has been termed ''brogrammer culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-03-01/the-rise-of-the-brogrammer|title=The Rise of the 'Brogrammer'|first=Douglas MacMillan|last=dmac1|date=2 March 2012|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bringing women into computing==
[[File:Computer_Repairing_Lilongwe_Malawi.jpg|thumb|Computer Repairing Lilongwe Malawi]]
The majority of data collected about women in IT has been qualitative analysis such as interviews and case studies. This data has been used to create effective programs addressing the underrepresentation of women in IT.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J W; Beise, C M; Woszczynski, A B; Myers, M E. (2003).

Anita Borg Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of female college entrants expressing interest in majoring in computer science decreased in the 2000s to pre-1980's levels.&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite web|first=Andy |last=Eggers |title=Interest in computer science is volatile |url=http://www.iq.harvard.edu/blog/sss/archives/2008/11/interest_in_com.shtml |publisher=The Institute of Quantitative Social Science |date=17 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67YOs9Pdz?url=http://blogs.iq.harvard.edu/sss/archives/2008/11/interest_in_com.shtml |archivedate=10 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A research study was initialized by Allan Fisher, then Associate Dean for Undergraduate Computer Science Education at Carnegie Mellon University, and Jane Margolis, a social scientist and expert in gender equity in education, into the nature of this problem. The main issues discovered in interesting and retaining women in computer science were feelings of an experience gap, confidence doubts, interest in curriculum and pedagogy, and peer culture.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Lenore (2001). [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lblum/PAPERS/women_in_computer_science.pdf "Women in Computer Science: The Carnegie Mellon Experience"], Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science.&lt;/ref&gt; Universities across North America are changing their computer science programs to make them more appealing to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/23/358238982/to-get-women-to-work-in-computer-science-schools-get-them-to-class | title=To Get Women To Work In Computer Science, Schools Get Them To Class | publisher=NPR | date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proactive and positive exposures to early computer experiences, such as The Alice Project,&lt;ref name="Alice"&gt;[http://www.alice.org/index.php The Alice Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508000054/http://alice.org/index.php# |date=2012-05-08 }}, Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt; founded by the late [[Randy Pausch]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], are thought to be effective in terms of retention and creation of enthusiasm for women who may later consider entering the field. Institutions of higher education are also beginning to make changes regarding the process and availability of mentoring to women that are undergraduates in technical fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|author2=Kristen Moore |title=Time Talk: On Small Changes that Enact Infrastructural Mentoring for Undergraduate Women in Technical Fields|journal=Journal of Technical Writing &amp; Communication|year=2013|volume=43|issue=3|pages=333–354|doi=10.2190/TW.43.3.f|url=http://0-pq9se9hp4e.search.serialssolutions.com.maurice.bgsu.edu/?genre=article&amp;issn=00472816&amp;title=Journal+of+Technical+Writing+%26+Communication&amp;volume=43&amp;issue=3&amp;date=20130901&amp;atitle=Time+Talk%3a+On+Small+Changes+that+Enact+Infrastructural+Mentoring+for+Undergraduate+Women+in+Technical+Fields.&amp;spage=333&amp;pages=333-354&amp;sid=EBSCO:Academic+Search+Complete&amp;aulast=Sullivan%2c+Patricia|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strategy for addressing this issue has been early outreach to elementary and high-school girls. Programs like all-girl computer camps, girls' after-school computer clubs, and support groups for girls have been instilled to create more interest at a younger age.&lt;ref name="ramsey"/&gt; A specific example of this kind of program is the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] outreach program, in which a representative is sent to schools in Canada, speaking specifically to grade nine girls about the benefits of Information Technology careers. The purpose is to inform girls about the benefits and opportunities within the field of information technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cips.ca/women "Women in IT"], Canada's Association of IT Professionals.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies like [[IBM]] also encourage young women to become interested in engineering, technology and science. IBM offers EX.I.T.E. (Exploring Interests in Technology and Engineering) camps for young women from the ages of 11 to 13.

Additionally, attempts are being made to make the efforts of female computer scientists more visible through events such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women conference series which allows women in the field to meet, collaborate and present their work. In the U.S., the Association for Women in Computing was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1978. Its purpose is to provide opportunities for the professional growth of women in computing through networking, and through programs on technical and career-oriented topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awc-hq.org/home.html |title=Association for Women in Computing |publisher=Awc-hq.org |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) and other organizations have groups which promote the cause of women in computing, such as [[BCSWomen]], founded by [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], and the BCS Women's Forum. In Ontario, Canada, the '''Gr8 Designs for Gr8 Girls''' program was founded to develop grade 8 girls' interest in computer science.

=== 2000s efforts ===

====National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology====
[[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology|The National Center for Women &amp; IT]] (NCWIT) is currently one of the lead supporters of women's entry and retention in computing. Their goal is to help to create academic and work environments that are welcoming and fair for women. Their research shows that encouragement is one of the key elements to help women enter a primarily male-dominated field. They found women report more often than their male-counterpart that they entered computer science due to the influence of a teacher, family member, or friend's encouragement. Their findings conclude that support can make the difference in a woman's belief that she is competent enough to compete in computing. Thus, the NCWIT developed a program called Aspirations in Computing in order to provide girls with the necessary encouragement, a network of support, and female role models. In a survey done, nearly half of the girls polled said they would feel uncomfortable being the only girl in a group or class, one of the Aspirations main goals is to enable girls to feel less isolated in these predicaments. They have found that creating a sense of belonging or "fitting in" is fundamental for interest and current retention. The NCWIT Aspirations Award was created in order to involve women in a national competition, awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership skills, academics, and plans for graduate schooling. Due to their reach and awareness of the program, they saw a 54% increase in the girls applying in the 2013 season compared to the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;DuBow, Wendy M., et al.

====Postsecondary education organization====
Numerous postsecondary education institutions have student-run organizations that focus on the advancement of women in computer science. In addition to she++ based out of [[Stanford University]], [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT) supports a chapter of the organization called Women In Computing. The campus's chapter of the organization is composed of students, faculty and staff at RIT and they strive to support and further develop the culture of computing to women. This effort is not only focused on their campus, but in the larger community. They host events both on their campus located in Henrietta, New York, and within surrounding Rochester schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rit.edu/gccis/women-computing|title=Women in Computing|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; RIT is among a national list of schools that host a chapter of Women in Computing, which is founded in the organization [[Association for Computing Machinery|Association of Computing Machinery]]'s committee for women in computing (ACM-W).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.acm.org/|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University]] hosts the organization called Harvard Undergraduate Women in Computer Science (WiSC). The organization aims to promote women in computing across a variety of schools and industries, educate women on the profession of computer science, and provide opportunities for women in technical fields. WiCS supports the annual conference named WECode, a conference that aims to promote women's involvement in computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/business/innovation/blogs/inside-the-hive/2014/02/10/harvard-wecode-conference-welcomes-more-women-into-tech/jAlzh5KVabxMJQjhsjZa9N/blog.html|title=Harvard's WECode conference welcomes more women into tech|work=Boston.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/02/closing-the-gender-gap-in-computer-science/|title=Closing the gender gap in computer science|work=Harvard Gazette|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pacesetters====
In an effort to improve the gender composition in computing, the Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT) created a nationwide U.S. program called "Pacesetters". Through this program, twenty-four academic and corporate organizations added close to 1,000 "Net New Women" to the field of computer science by 2012. These Net New Women are women in the sciences that had not originally intended on pursuing a computer science degree. Pacesetters is the first program of its kind where different organizations come together to identify effective ways to broaden the participation of women in computer science. There are currently more than 300 corporations, academic institutions, government agencies and non-profit organizations devoted to this cause. Together they build internal teams in order to develop and fund the needed programs and share their overall results. Pacesetters organizations include some very prestigious companies such as AT&amp;T, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Georgia Tech, Pfizer, and IBM to name a few. These are a few examples of their results due to the work with Pacesetters:

*[[Google]]: built a new programs for undergraduate women and held a career development panel of engineers which gave women the chance to participate in mock interviews. Due to these efforts, the number of women applicants grew and Google doubled the number of women in their software engineering summer internship program in 2011 compared to 2010.
*[[Intel]]: piloted a program called Command Presence Workshop in which senior technical women participated in specialized training,
*[[Virginia Tech]]: created a team of CS faculty, advisors, and student mentors to interact with potential female undergraduates and high school students. They saw a 56% increase in the number of female students who showed interest in their science programs.

== Relation to gender theory ==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Csc as Possible major for woman.jpg|thumb|Possible Majors in C.Sc]] --&gt;
There are a number of thinkers who engage with gender theories and issues related to women and technology. Such thinkers include, for example, [[Donna Haraway]], [[Sadie Plant]], Julie Wosk, [[Sally Hacker|Sally L. Hacker]], [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], [[Janet Abbate]], [[Thelma Estrin]], and Thomas J. Misa, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Erika E | title = Recognizing a Collective Inheritance through the History of Women in Computing | url = | journal = CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture | volume = 15 | issue = 1| year = 2013 | doi = 10.7771/1481-4374.1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 book titled ''Gender and Information Technology: Moving Beyond Access to Co-Create Global Partnership'' uses [[Riane Eisler]]'s [[cultural transformation theory]] to offer an interdisciplinary, social systems perspective on issues of access to technology.&lt;ref name="kirkma"&gt;Kirk, Mary (2008). ''Gender and Information Technology: Moving Beyond Access to Co-Create Global Partnership''. Hershey, PA: IGI Global. {{ISBN|978-1-59904-786-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book explores how shifting from dominator towards partnership systems—as reflected in four primary social institutions (communication, media, education, and business) - might help society move beyond the simplistic notion of access to co-create a real digital revolution worldwide.&lt;ref name="kirkma" /&gt;

A 2000 book titled ''Athena Unbound''&lt;ref name="etzkowitz"&gt;Etzkowitz, Henry; Kemelgor, Carol; Uzzi, Brian (2000). ''Athena Unbound - The advancement of women in science and technology'', [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-511-03833-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a life-course analysis (based on interviews and surveys) of women in the sciences from an early childhood interest, through university, to graduate school and finally into the academic workplace. The thesis of this book is that "women face a special series of gender related barriers to entry and success in scientific careers that persist, despite recent advances".&lt;ref name="etzkowitz" /&gt;

Computer scientist [[Karen Petrie]], from [[University of Dundee]], has developed an argument to illustrate why an attack on [[Sexism in the technology industry|sexism in computing]] is not an attack on men.&lt;ref name="petrie"&gt;{{citation|author=Petrie, Karen|title=Attack on sexism not an attack on men|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=27 November 2013|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/attack-on-sexism-not-an-attack-on-men-1-3209552}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Gent]], [[University of St Andrews]], has described this idea which is key to the argument as the "[[Petrie Multiplier]]".&lt;ref name="gent"&gt;{{citation|author=Gent, Ian|title=The Petrie Multiplier: Why an Attack on Sexism in Tech is NOT an Attack on Men|work=Ian Gent's Blog|date=13 October 2013|url=http://iangent.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/the-petrie-multiplier-why-attack-on.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to J. McGrath Cohoon, senior research scientist for the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology, there are a few possible hypotheses for why women are underrepresented in computer sciences attributed to already established theories about the influence of gender and technology stereotypes. One gender related hypothesis is that women find it more difficult than men to contribute to the intellectual life of the field in the sense that reviewers of their work are unconsciously downgraded due to their status as women or those women have lower confidence in this field that inhibits women's willingness to publicly present their technical findings. Due to this barrier of women as second-class citizens in the computing world, it creates an environment that is not accessible to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 2011 | title = Gender And Computing Conference Papers | url = | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 54 | issue = 8| pages = 72–80 | doi=10.1145/1978542.1978561}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the Psychology of Women Quarterly backs this hypothesis up by concluding that even the enduring effect of single brief exposures to stereotypical role models leaves a strong mark. Their findings reported that the most important factor in recruiting women to the computer science field is that women meet with a potential role model, regardless of gender of that role model, that conveys to the woman a sense of belonging in the field. This finding suggests that support and encouragement are the two most important aspects that can influence women participation in computing. In order for women to be more receptive to the field is if the environment became a more welcoming place by their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | last2 = Drury | first2 = Benjamin J. | last3 = Vichayapai | first3 = Marissa | year = 2013 | title = Enduring Influence Of Stereotypical Computer Science Role Models on Women's Academic Aspirations | url = | journal = Psychology Of Women Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 72–79 | doi=10.1177/0361684312459328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cordelia Fine]] in her book [[Delusions of Gender]] argues that apparent differences are due to constant exposure to societal beliefs of gender difference. Fine also argues that "...while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don't yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Forum {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-1/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-2/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument for why women are less prevalent in computer science is the ill-defined nature of computing according to Paul De Palma. In his article Why Women Avoid Computer Science, he postulates that women find careers in computing unattractive. He finds that among the many reasons offered, he believes the nature of computing is what drives them away. He claims that young men who are drawn to computer science and engineering are those that like to tinker, those who like to use tools to create and dismantle objects. He further claims that computing is not a true profession, that traditional career paths such as law, business, and medicine are more certain and profitable on average than computing. He compares it to using a computer, computers nowadays do not come with lengthy manuals on the inner workings of the modern day computer, in fact our tools are always more complicated than their what they are used for, thus the tinkering nature of men, the drive born from gender stereotyping from birth, has made men successful in this field for they are more inclined to spend endless hours of tinkering with software and hardware. His claim revolves around the focus that boys and girls fall into gender stereotypes, girls who usually are given dolls and boys who are given trucks and toy tool boxes. He claims that these gender roles placed on children is one of the primary causes for the gender gap seen in computer science. He postulates that if we were to see more girls playing with trucks and other "boy-related" toys that perhaps we would see an increase in this tinkering nature and therefore more participation of women in the computer science field.&lt;ref&gt;De Palma, Paul.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2941">A '''gender expression''' is a person's behavior, mannerisms, interests, and appearance that are associated with [[gender]] in a particular cultural context, specifically with the categories of [[femininity]] or [[masculinity]]. This also includes [[gender role]]s. These categories rely on [[stereotype]]s about gender.
==Defining gender expression==

Gender expression typically reflects a person's [[gender identity]] (their internal sense of their own gender), but this is not always the case.&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Randal W.|title=Social Psychology: How Other People Influence Our Thoughts and Actions [2 volumes]|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610695923|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nF1DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA232|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=American Psychological Association|title=Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People|journal=American Psychologist|date=December 2015|volume=70|issue=9|page=861|url=http://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf|doi=10.1037/a0039906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender expression is separate and independent both from [[sexual orientation]] and [[Sex assignment|gender assigned at birth]]. A type of gender expression that is considered atypical for a person's externally perceived gender may be described as [[Gender variance|gender non-conforming]].

In men and boys, typical gender expression is often described as ''manly'', while atypical expression is known as [[Effeminacy|effeminate]]. In girls, atypical expression is called [[tomboy]]ish. In (especially queer) women, atypical and typical expression are known as [[butch and femme]] respectively. A mixture of typical and atypical expression may be described as [[Androgyny|androgynous]]. A type of expression that is perceived as neither typically feminine or masculine can be described as gender-neutral or undifferentiated.

The term ''gender expression'' is used in the [[Yogyakarta Principles]], which concern the application of international [[human rights law]] in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and [[Sex characteristics (legal term)|sex characteristics]].&lt;ref name="ypplus10"&gt;[http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles-en/yp10/ Yogyakarta Principles plus 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluating gender expression==

The [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]] was designed to evaluate gender expression objectively (within a White American cultural context).

In the [[United Kingdom]], sexism or [[gender inequality]] denotes the inconsistencies between individuals due to gender. The topic covers a variety of concerns from [[education]] to equal opportunity in terms of employment and wages.

==Legislation==
In response to the concerns, the government has implemented various legislation, especially concerning gender discrimination, both institutional and personal, in the workplace; the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975|Sex Discrimination Act of 1975]] protects individuals from being discriminated against in employment, vocational training, education, the provision and sale of goods, facilities and services, premises and the exercise of public functions due to their sex/gender; this was amended by the [[Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002]]. The [[Equal Pay Act 1970|Equal Pay Act of 1970]] mandates [[equal pay for equal work]] regardless of an individual's sex/gender, and the Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999 also protect the rights of individuals who intend to undergo, are undergoing, or have undergone [[gender reassignment|sex reassignment]]. These Regulations pertain to pay and treatment in employment, self-employment and vocational training.

The Equality Acts of [[Equality Act 2006|2006]] and [[Equality Act 2010|2010]] served to codify and combine all equality enactments within Great Britain, and provide comparable protections across all equality strands.

The [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC) is a non-departmental public body which has responsibility for the promotion and enforcement of equality and non-discrimination laws in England, Scotland and Wales, while the [[Government Equalities Office]] is a government department charged with promoting and improving gender equality within the UK government itself, responsible for leading the Discrimination Law Review, and providing advice on all other forms of equality to other UK government departments. The GEO was formerly known as the Women and Equality Unit.

In April 2012, British [[Feminism|feminist]] writer [[Laura Bates]] founded the [[Everyday Sexism Project]], a website and [[social media]] presence whose aim is to document everyday examples of [[sexism]] as reported by contributors; the submissions are then collated by a small group of volunteers led by Emer O'Toole, a researcher at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]]. By April 2013 the site had collected 25,000 entries from 15 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Laura. [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2013/apr/16/everyday-sexism-project-shouting-back "The Everyday Sexism Project: a year of shouting back"], ''The Guardian'', 16 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
Various U.K. media institutions have been labelled problematic with regards to sexism and gender discrimination - most notably being the [[Page 3]] feature found in the British [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', which consists of a large photograph of a [[toplessness|topless]] female [[Glamour model#Glamour models|glamour model]] usually published on the newspaper's third page. In August 2012, the [[No More Page 3]] campaign emerged, sparking widespread discussion and receiving heavy support from [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]] MP [[Caroline Lucas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC|first=news|title=Caroline Lucas in Page Three T-shirt protest during debate|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22873790|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=BBC news|date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cross-party support from over [http://nomorepage3.org/letter-to-the-editor-signed-by-mps/ 140 other MPs].

A YouGov survey in October 2012 found differences in attitude toward Page 3 among readers of different newspapers; 61% of ''Sun'' readers wished to retain the feature, while 24 percent said that the newspaper should stop showing Page 3 women. However, only 4% of ''Guardian'' readers said ''The Sun'' should keep Page 3, while 86% said it should be abolished. The poll also found wide differences by gender, with 48% of men overall saying that Page 3 should be retained, but just 17% of women taking that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey Report |url= http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/6jyst3v95o/YG-Archive-Pol-Sun-results-021012-Page-3-girls.pdf |work=YouGov / The Sun Survey Results|publisher=YouGov|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===
{{Main|Gender pay gap}}
The U.K. has a persistent gender pay gap, the most significant factors associated with which are part-time work, education, the size of the firm a person is employed in, and occupational segregation (women are under-represented in managerial and high-paying professional occupations.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first= Victoria |last= Thomson |date= October 2006 |title= How Much of the Remaining Gender Pay Gap is the Result of Discrimination, and How Much is Due to Individual Choices? |journal= International Journal of Urban Labour and Leisure |volume= 7 |issue= 2 |url= http://www.ijull.co.uk/vol7/2/thomson.pdf |accessdate= September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When comparing full-time roles, men in the U.K. tend to work slightly longer hours than women in full-time employment. Depending on the age bracket and percentile of hours worked men in full-time employment work between 1.35% and 17.94% more hours than women in full-time employment.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, 2013 Provisional Results http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-328216&lt;/ref&gt; Even when taking the differences in hours worked into account, a pay gap still exists in the U.K., and typically increases with age and earnings percentile.&lt;ref&gt;A Look At The Gender Pay Gap By Age And Earning Power | http://www.octopus-hr.co.uk/hrmoz/article/the-gender-pay-gap-by-age-and-earning-power.aspx#sthash.IL6IGoYj.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Inequality in the context of education has greater implications in terms of future employment. Elements of the school curriculum still advocate certain gender-specific practices.

Boys lag behind girls at important educational milestones. At [[Key Stage 2]] girls outperform boys. The proportion of students achieving level 4 and above in reading, writing and maths, in 2015, in England, was 77% boys compared to 83% girls. The gap is wider for students who receive a free school meal. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CDP-2016-0207/CDP-2016-0207.pdf House of Commons Library International Men's Day Briefing]&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls outperform boys in headline [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] results. In state-funded schools, the gap in those achieving 5+ grades a*-C including English and maths is around 10 percentage points.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Young women are more likely to enrol at university. In 2016 the gender gap in favour of women was the highest on record. "In England, young women are 36% more likely to apply to university and when both sexes are from disadvantaged backgrounds young women are 58% more likely to apply."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucas.com/corporate/news-and-key-documents/news/university-and-college-applicant-numbers-rise-02-ucas-reports|title=University and college applicant numbers rise by 0.2%, UCAS reports today|date=2016-02-03|newspaper=UCAS|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, [[sex education]] is not compulsory in the U.K.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=House of Lords votes against mandatory sex and relationship education in schools |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/01/28/house-of-lords-votes-against-mandatory-sex-and-relationship-education-in-schools/ |accessdate=17 April 2014 |newspaper=PinkNews |date=28 January 2014 |place=London |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[England and Wales]], the optional curriculum focuses mainly on biological areas such as the reproductive system, [[foetal development]], and the physical changes of adolescence, while information about contraception and safe sex is discretionary&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/legislation.htm Education Act 1996] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709095150/http://www.avert.org/legislation.htm |date=July 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussion about relationships and gender roles is often neglected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf Britain: Sex Education Under Fire] UNESCO Courier;Jul/Aug2000, Vol. 53 Issue 7/8, pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Bates remarked that "better sex and relationships education in schools is desperately needed" to teach areas around "healthy relationships, [[Rape#Consent|consent]], respect and sexual abuse" in response to tackling everyday sexism earlier in life.

{{Anthropology }}

'''History of anthropology'scientific word during the [[Renaissance]], has always meant "the study (or science) of man". The topics to be included and the terminology have varied historically. At present they are more elaborate than they were during the development of anthropology. For a presentation of modern social and cultural anthropology as they have developed in Britain, France, and North America since approximately 1900, see the relevant sections under [[Anthropology]].

==Etymology==
The term ''[[wiktionary:anthropology|anthropology]]'' ostensibly is a produced compound of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄνθρωπος}} ''anthrōpos'', "human being" (understood to mean "humankind" or "humanity"), and a supposed -λογία ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'', "study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=-logy | work=Online Etymological Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-logy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound, however, is unknown in ancient Greek or Latin, whether classical or mediaeval. It first appears sporadically in the scholarly Latin ''anthropologia'' of Renaissance France, where it spawns the French word ''anthropologie'', transferred into English as anthropology. It does belong to a class of words produced with the [[-logy]] suffix, such as archeo-logy, bio-logy, etc., "the study (or science) of".

The mixed character of Greek ''anthropos'' and Latin ''-logia'' marks it as [[New Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=-logy | encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary Unabridged and Seven Language Dictionary | volume=II H to R | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no independent noun, logia, however, of that meaning in classical Greek. The word λόγος ([[logos]]) has that meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos logos]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] attempted to rescue the etymology in his first address to the [[Anthropological Society of London]] as president and founder, 1863. He did find an ''anthropologos'' from Aristotle in the standard [[A Greek–English Lexicon|ancient Greek Lexicon]], which he says defines the word as "speaking or treating of man".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1863|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is entirely wishful thinking, as Liddell and Scott go on to explain the meaning: "i.e. fond of personal conversation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*a%3Aentry+group%3D178%3Aentry%3Da%29nqrwpolo%2Fgos anthropologos]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Aristotle, the very philosopher of the logos, could produce such a word without serious intent, there probably was at that time no anthropology identifiable under that name.

The lack of any ancient denotation of anthropology, however, is not an etymological problem. Liddell and Scott list 170 Greek compounds ending in ''–logia'', enough to justify its later use as a productive suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=end&amp;lookup=logia&amp;lang=greek logia]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks often used suffixes in forming compounds that had no independent variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buck|1933|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymological dictionaries are united in attributing ''–logia'' to ''logos'', from ''legein'', "to collect". The thing collected is primarily ideas, especially in speech. The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=leg- | encyclopedia=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] | edition=4th | chapter=Appendix I: Indo-European Roots | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "(It is one of) derivatives independently built to logos." Its morphological type is that of an abstract noun: log-os &gt; log-ia (a "qualitative abstract")&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buck|1933|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] origin of the name of anthropology does not exclude the possibility that ancient authors presented anthropogical material under another name (see below). Such an identification is speculative, depending on the theorist's view of anthropology; nevertheless, speculations have been formulated by credible anthropologists, especially those that consider themselves [[Structural functionalism|functionalists]] and others in history so classified now.

==The science of history==
[[Marvin Harris]], a historian of anthropology, begins ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory'' with the statement that anthropology is "the science of history".&lt;ref name=Harris1&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is not suggesting that [[history]] be renamed to anthropology, or that there is no distinction between history and [[prehistory]], or that anthropology excludes current social practices, as the general meaning of history, which it has in "history of anthropology", would seem to imply. He is using "history" in a special sense, as the founders of [[cultural anthropology]] used it:&lt;ref&gt;There is currently some regional and traditional equivocation about whether it should be called culture history, as in [[cultural anthropology]]; i.e., [[Culture-historical archaeology]], or [[social history]], as in [[social anthropology]], or the compromise, [[sociocultural anthropology]]. Different theorists have different practices, the distinctions being mainly verbal.&lt;/ref&gt; "the natural history of society", in the words of [[Herbert Spencer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "universal history of mankind", the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]] objective.&lt;ref name=Harris1/&gt; Just as [[natural history]] comprises the characteristics of organisms past and present, so cultural or social history comprises the characteristics of society past and present. It includes both documented history and prehistory, but its slant is toward institutional development rather than particular non-repeatable historical events.

According to Harris, the 19th-century anthropologists were theorizing under the presumption that the development of society followed some sort of laws. He decries the loss of that view in the 20th century by the denial that any laws are discernable or that current institutions have any bearing on ancient. He coins the term ideographic for them. The 19th-century views, on the other hand, are [[nomothetic]]; that is, they provide laws. He intends "to reassert the methodological priority of the search for the laws of history in the science of man".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is looking for "a general theory of history".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His perception of the laws: "I believe that the analogue of the Darwinian strategy in the realm of sociocultural phenomena is the principle of techno-environmental and techno-economic determinism", he calls [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]], which he also details in ''Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture.''

Elsewhere he refers to "my theories of historical determinism", defining the latter: "By a deterministic relationship among cultural phenomena, I mean merely that similar variables under similar conditions tend to give rise to similar consequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1991|pp=xii-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "tends to" implies some degree of freedom to happen or not happen, but in strict [[determinism]], given certain causes, the result and only that result must occur. Different philosophers, however, use determinism in different senses. The deterministic element that Harris sees is lack of human social engineering: "free will and moral choice have had virtually no significant effect upon the direction taken thus far by evolving systems of social life."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1991|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris agrees with the 19th-century view that laws are [[abstraction]]s from [[empirical evidence]]: "...sociocultural entities are constructed from the direct or indirect observation of the behavior and thought of specific individuals&amp;nbsp;...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions are not a physical reality; only people are. When they act in society, they do so according to the laws of history, of which they are not aware; hence, there is no historical element of free will. Like the 20th-century anthropologists in general, Harris places a high value on the empiricism, or collection of data. This function must be performed by trained observers.

He borrows terms from linguistics: just as a [[phonetics|phon-'''etic''' system]] is a description of sounds developed without regard to the meaning and structure of the language, while a [[phoneme|phon-'''emic''']] system describes the meaningful sounds actually used within the language, so anthropological data can be [[emic and etic]]. Only trained observers can avoid eticism, or description without regard to the meaning in the culture: "...&amp;nbsp;etics are in part observers' emics incorrectly applied to a foreign system...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He makes a further distinction between [[Synchrony and diachrony|synchronic and diachronic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synchronic ("same time") with reference to anthropological data is contemporaneous and cross-cultural. Diachronic ("through time") data shows the development of lines through time. Cultural materialism, being a "processually holistic and globally comparative scientific research strategy" must depend for accuracy on all four types of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural materialism differs from the others by the insertion of culture as the effect. Different material factors produce different cultures.

Harris, like many other anthropologists, in looking for anthropological method and data before the use of the term anthropology, had little difficulty finding them among the ancient authors. The ancients tended to see players on the stage of history as ethnic groups characterized by the same or similar languages and customs: the Persians, the Germans, the Scythians, etc. Thus the term history meant to a large degree the "story" of the fortunes of these players through time. The ancient authors never formulated laws. Apart from a rudimentary [[three-age system]], the stages of history, such as are found in Lubbock, Tylor, Morgan, Marx and others, are yet unformulated.

==Proto-anthropology==
Eriksen and Nielsen use the term proto-anthropology to refer to near-anthropological writings, which contain some of the criteria for being anthropology, but not all. They classify proto-anthropology as being "travel writing or social philosophy", going on to assert "It is only when these aspects&amp;nbsp;... are fused, that is, when data and theory are brought together, that anthropology appears."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Thomas Hylland | last1=Eriksen | first2=Finn Sivert | last2=Nielsen | title=A History of Anthropology | edition=2nd | series=Anthropology, Culture and Society Series | location=London | publisher=Pluto Press | year=1013 | pages=10–12 | url=http://hyllanderiksen.net/History2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process began to occur in the 18th century of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

===Classical Age===
Many anthropological writers find anthropological-quality theorizing in the works of [[Classical Greece]] and [[Classical Rome]]; for example, [[John Myres]] in ''Herodotus and Anthropology'' (1908); E. E. Sikes in ''The Anthropology of the Greeks'' (1914); [[Clyde Kluckhohn]] in ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1961), and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jonathan Z. | last=Smith | title=Map is Not Territory: Studies in the History of Religions | location=Chicage | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=1993 | page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equally long list may be found in French and German as well as other languages.

====Herodotus====
[[Herodotus]] was a 5th-century BC Greek historian who set about to chronicle and explain the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] that transpired early in that century. He did so in a surviving work conventionally termed ''the History'' or ''the Histories''. His first line begins: "These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus&amp;nbsp;...."

The [[Achaemenid Empire]], deciding to bring Greece into its domain, conducted a massive invasion across the [[Bosphorus]] using multi-cultural troops raised from many different locations. They were decisively defeated by the Greek city-states. Herodotus was far from interested in only the non-repeatable events. He provides ethnic details and histories of the peoples within the empire and to the north of it, in most cases being the first to do so. His methods were reading accounts, interviewing witnesses, and in some cases taking notes for himself.

These "researches" have been considered anthropological since at least as early as the late 19th century. The title, "Father of History" (''pater historiae''), had been conferred on him probably by [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=François | last=Hartog | title=The mirror of Herodotus : the representation of the other in the writing of history | series=New historicism, 5. | year=1988 | location=Berkeley | publisher=University of California Press | page=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pointing out that [[John Myres]] in 1908 had believed that Herodotus was an anthropologist on a par with those of his own day, [[James M. Redfield]] asserts: "Herodotus, as we know, was both Father of History and Father of Anthropology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=James M. | last=Redfield | title=Herodotus the Tourist | journal=Classical Philology | year=1985 | volume=80 | pages=97–118 | url=https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/class3676/secure/Redfield.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus calls his method of travelling around taking notes "theorizing". Redfield translates it as "tourism" with a scientific intent. He identifies three terms of Herodotus as overlapping on culture: ''diaitia'', material goods such as houses and consumables; ''[[Ethos|ethea]]'', the mores or customs; and ''nomoi'', the authoritative precedents or [[law]]s.

====Tacitus====
The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historian, [[Tacitus]], wrote many of our only surviving contemporary accounts of several ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples]].

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Cannibalism in Brazil ('French Antarctica') in 1555, by André Thevet.jpg|thumb|200px|Cannibalism among "the savages" in Brazil, as described and pictured by [[André Thévet]] ]]
[[File:Table of Natural History, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Table of natural history, 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]
Another candidate for one of the first scholars to carry out comparative ethnographic-type studies in person was the medieval [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] in the eleventh century, who wrote about the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. According to Akbar S. Ahmed, like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive [[participant observation]] with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, and presented his findings with [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] and [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]] using [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]].&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ahmed | first1 = Akbar S. | year = 1984 | title = Al-Beruni: The First Anthropologist | url = | journal = RAIN | volume = 60 | issue = 60| pages = 9–10 | doi = 10.2307/3033407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue, however, that he hardly can be considered an anthropologist in the conventional sense.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tapper (1995).

Medieval scholars may be considered forerunners of modern anthropology as well, insofar as they conducted or wrote detailed studies of the customs of peoples considered "different" from themselves in terms of geography. [[John of Plano Carpini]] reported of his stay among the [[Mongols]]. His report was unusual in its detailed depiction of a non-European culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/Publications/Source_pages/AnthroHist.htm Resources for a History of Anthropology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231041925/http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/Publications/Source_pages/AnthroHist.htm |date=2012-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marco Polo]]'s systematic observations of nature, anthropology, and geography are another example of studying human variation across space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tk421.net/essays/polo.html Marco Polo's Asia]&lt;/ref&gt; Polo's travels took him across such a diverse human landscape and his accounts of the peoples he met as he journeyed were so detailed that they earned for Polo the name "the father of modern anthropology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/011rowe.pdf The Renaissance Foundations of Anthropology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904194548/http://www.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/011rowe.pdf |date=2012-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{See also|Bernardino de Sahagún}}
The first use of the term "anthropology" in English to refer to a natural science of humanity was apparently in [[Richard Harvey (astrologer)|Richard Harvey's]] 1593 ''Philadelphus, a defense of the legend of Brutus in British history'', which, includes the passage: "Genealogy or issue which they had, Artes which they studied, Actes which they did. This part of History is named Anthropology."

==The Enlightenment roots of the discipline==
[[File: Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|left|220px|Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)]]

Many scholars consider modern anthropology as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] (1715–89),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=8407 http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=8407]&lt;/ref&gt; a period when Europeans attempted to study human behavior systematically, the known varieties of which had been increasing since the fifteenth century as a result of the [[first European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|first European colonization wave]]. The traditions of [[jurisprudence]], history, [[philology]], and [[sociology]] then evolved into something more closely resembling the modern views of these disciplines and informed the development of the [[social sciences]], of which anthropology was a part.

It took [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724-1804) 25 years to write one of the first major treatises on anthropology, ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' (1798), which treats it as a branch of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. "Introduction" to his 1961 translation of Kant's work, reprinted, [http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpfoucault1.htm Generation-online.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Kant is not generally considered to be a modern anthropologist, as he never left his region of Germany, nor did he study any cultures besides his own.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Brian, and Kain, Patrick (eds.), Essays on Kant's Anthropology, Cambridge University Press, 2003, 278pp., {{ISBN|0-521-79038-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, begin teaching an annual course in anthropology in 1772.
Developments in the systematic study of ancient civilizations through the disciplines of [[Classics]] and [[Egyptology]] informed both archaeology and eventually social anthropology, as did the study of East and South Asian languages and cultures. At the same time, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers, such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/sstopics/slovaklawsonlanguage/Herder_on_Language.pdf | title = Herder on Language | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], whose work formed the basis for the "culture concept", which is central to the discipline.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Institutionally, anthropology emerged from the development of [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]) that occurred during the European colonization of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Programs of ethnographic study originated in this era as the study of the "human primitives" overseen by colonial administrations.

There was a tendency in late eighteenth century Enlightenment thought to understand human society as natural phenomena that behaved according to certain principles and that could be observed empirically. In some ways, studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was not unlike studying the flora and fauna of those places.

Early anthropology was divided between proponents of [[unilineal evolution|unilinealism]], who argued that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process, from the most primitive to the most advanced, and various forms of non-lineal theorists, who tended to subscribe to ideas such as [[diffusionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Most nineteenth-century social theorists, including anthropologists, viewed non-European societies as windows onto the pre-industrial human past.

==Overview of the modern discipline==
Marxist anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] once characterized anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the social sciences". Understanding how [[anthropology]] developed contributes to understanding how it fits into other academic disciplines.
Scholarly traditions of [[jurisprudence]], history, [[philology]] and [[sociology]] developed during this time and informed the development of the [[social sciences]] of which anthropology was a part. At the same time, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as [[Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] whose work formed the basis for the culture concept which is central to the discipline.

These intellectual movements in part grappled with one of the greatest paradoxes of [[modernity]]: as the world is becoming smaller and more integrated, people's experience of the world is increasingly atomized and dispersed. As [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] observed in the 1840s:

{{Quotation|All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilized nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal interdependence of nations.}}

Ironically, this universal interdependence, rather than leading to greater human solidarity, has coincided with increasing racial, ethnic, religious, and class divisions, and new—and to some confusing or disturbing—cultural expressions. These are the conditions of life with which people today must contend, but they have their origins in processes that began in the 16th century and accelerated in the 19th century.

Institutionally anthropology emerged from [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]). This was the study of human beings—typically people living in European colonies. Thus studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was more or less equivalent to studying the flora and fauna of those places. It was for this reason, for instance, that [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] could write monographs on both ''The League of the Iroquois'' and ''The American Beaver and His Works''. This is also why the material culture of 'civilized' nations such as China have historically been displayed in fine arts museums alongside European art while artifacts from Africa or Native North American cultures were displayed in [[natural history museum]]s with dinosaur bones and nature dioramas. Curatorial practice has changed dramatically in recent years, and it would be wrong to see anthropology as merely an extension of colonial rule and European [[chauvinism]], since its relationship to [[imperialism]] was and is complex.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Drawing on the methods of the [[natural science]]s as well as developing new techniques involving not only structured interviews but unstructured "participant-observation"—and drawing on the new [[theory of evolution]] through [[natural selection]], they proposed the scientific study of a new object: "humankind", conceived of as a whole. Crucial to this study is the concept "culture", which anthropologists defined both as a universal capacity and propensity for social learning, thinking, and acting (which they see as a product of human evolution and something that distinguishes Homo sapiens—and perhaps all species of genus ''[[Hominoid|Homo]]''—from other species), and as a particular adaptation to local conditions that takes the form of highly variable beliefs and practices. Thus, "culture" not only transcends the opposition between nature and nurture; it transcends and absorbs the peculiarly European distinction between politics, religion, kinship, and the economy as autonomous domains. Anthropology thus transcends the divisions between the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to explore the biological, linguistic, material, and symbolic dimensions of humankind in all forms.

==National anthropological traditions==
{{Main|History of anthropology by country}}

As academic disciplines began to differentiate over the course of the nineteenth century, anthropology grew increasingly distinct from the biological approach of natural history, on the one hand, and from purely historical or literary fields such as Classics, on the other. A common criticism was that many social sciences (such as economists, sociologists, and psychologists) in Western countries focused disproportionately on Western subjects, while anthropology focuseed disproportionately on the "other".&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
Museums such as the [[British Museum]] weren't the only site of anthropological studies: with the [[New Imperialism]] period, starting in the 1870s, [[zoo]]s became unattended "laboratories", especially the so-called "ethnological exhibitions" or "Negro villages". Thus, "savages" from the colonies were displayed, often nudes, in cages, in what has been called "[[human zoos]]". For example, in 1906, Congolese [[pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] was put by anthropologist [[Madison Grant]] in a cage in the [[Bronx Zoo]], labelled "the missing link" between an orangutan and the "white race"—Grant, a renowned [[eugenicist]], was also the author of ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916). Such exhibitions were attempts to illustrate and prove in the same movement the validity of [[scientific racism]], which first formulation may be found in [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of Human Races]]'' (1853–55). In 1931, the [[Colonial Exhibition]] in Paris still displayed [[Kanaks]] from [[New Caledonia]] in the "indigenous village"; it received 24&amp;nbsp;million visitors in six months, thus demonstrating the popularity of such "human zoos".

Anthropology grew increasingly distinct from natural history and by the end of the nineteenth century the discipline began to crystallize into its modern form—by 1935, for example, it was possible for T.K. Penniman to write a history of the discipline entitled ''A Hundred Years of Anthropology''. At the time, the field was dominated by 'the comparative method'. It was assumed that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process from the most primitive to most advanced. Non-European societies were thus seen as evolutionary 'living fossils' that could be studied in order to understand the European past. Scholars wrote histories of prehistoric migrations which were sometimes valuable but often also fanciful. It was during this time that Europeans first accurately traced [[Polynesia]]n migrations across the [[Pacific Ocean]] for instance—although some of them believed it originated in [[Egypt]]. Finally, the concept of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] was actively discussed as a way to classify—and rank—human beings based on difference.

==== E.B. Tylor and James Frazer====
[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|left|Sir E. B. Tylor (1832-1917), nineteenth-century British anthropologist]]
[[File:JamesGeorgeFrazer.jpg|thumb|right|Sir James George Frazer (1854-1941)]]

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (2 October 1832&amp;nbsp;– 2 January 1917) and [[James Frazer|James George Frazer]] (1 January 1854&amp;nbsp;– 7 May 1941) are generally considered the antecedents to modern [[social anthropology]] in Britain. Although Tylor undertook a field trip to [[Mexico]], both he and Frazer derived most of the material for their comparative studies through extensive reading, not [[fieldwork]], mainly the Classics (literature and history of Greece and Rome), the work of the early European folklorists, and reports from missionaries, travelers, and contemporaneous ethnologists.

Tylor advocated strongly for unilinealism and a form of "uniformity of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/gad/history/044stocking.pdf Stocking, George Jr. (1963) "Matthew Arnold, E. B. Tylor, and the Uses of Invention", ''American Anthropologist'', 65:783-799, 1963] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202133549/http://www.aaanet.org/gad/history/044stocking.pdf |date=2007-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tylor in particular laid the groundwork for theories of [[cultural diffusionism]], stating that there are three ways that different groups can have similar cultural forms or technologies: "independent invention, inheritance from ancestors in a distant region, transmission from one race {{sic}} to another".&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1865) ''Researches into the early history of mankind the development of civilization.'' London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor formulated one of the early and influential anthropological conceptions of [[culture]] as "that complex whole, which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by [humans] as [members] of society".&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1871) ''Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom''. 2 vols. London, John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Stocking notes, Tylor mainly concerned himself with describing and mapping the distribution of particular elements of culture, rather than with the larger function, and he generally seemed to assume a Victorian idea of progress rather than the idea of non-directional, multilineal cultural development proposed by later anthropologists.

Tylor also theorized about the origins of religious beliefs in human beings, proposing a theory of [[animism]] as the earliest stage, and noting that "religion" has many components, of which he believed the most important to be belief in supernatural beings (as opposed to moral systems, cosmology, etc.). Frazer, a Scottish scholar with a broad knowledge of Classics, also concerned himself with religion, myth, and magic. His comparative studies, most influentially in the numerous editions of ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', analyzed similarities in religious belief and symbolism globally. Neither Tylor nor Frazer, however, was particularly interested in [[fieldwork]], nor were they interested in examining how the cultural elements and institutions fit together. The Golden Bough was abridged drastically in subsequent editions after his first.

==== Bronislaw Malinowski and the British School ====
Toward the turn of the twentieth century, a number of anthropologists became dissatisfied with this categorization of cultural elements; historical reconstructions also came to seem increasingly speculative to them. Under the influence of several younger scholars, a new approach came to predominate among British anthropologists, concerned with analyzing how societies held together in the present ([[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] analysis, rather than [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] or historical analysis), and emphasizing long-term (one to several years) immersion fieldwork. [[Cambridge University]] financed a [[William Rivers#Torres Straits Expedition|multidisciplinary expedition]] to the [[Torres Strait Islands]] in 1898, organized by [[Alfred Cort Haddon]] and including a physician-anthropologist, [[William Rivers]], as well as a linguist, a botanist, and other specialists. The findings of the expedition set new standards for ethnographic description.

A decade and a half later, Polish anthropology student [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884–1942) was beginning what he expected to be a brief period of [[fieldwork]] in the old model, collecting lists of cultural items, when the outbreak of the First World War stranded him in [[New Guinea]]. As a subject of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] resident on a British colonial possession, he was effectively confined to New Guinea for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronisław (1967) ''A diary in the strict sense of the term''. New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; World [1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

He made use of the time by undertaking far more intensive fieldwork than had been done by ''British'' anthropologists, and his classic ethnography, ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]'' (1922) advocated an approach to [[fieldwork]] that became standard in the field: getting "the native's point of view" through [[participant observation]]. Theoretically, he advocated a [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] interpretation, which examined how social institutions functioned to satisfy individual needs.

British social anthropology had an expansive moment in the [[Interwar period]], with key contributions coming from the Polish-British [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Meyer Fortes]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (1995) ''[http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521450489 The Expansive Moment: The Rise of Social Anthropology in Britain and Africa, 1918-1970] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106055917/http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521450489 |date=2007-11-06 }}'' review at {{jstor|646577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] also published a seminal work in 1922. He had carried out his initial fieldwork in the [[Andaman Islands]] in the old style of historical reconstruction. However, after reading the work of French sociologists [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], Radcliffe-Brown published an account of his research (entitled simply ''The Andaman Islanders'') that paid close attention to the meaning and purpose of rituals and myths. Over time, he developed an approach known as [[structural functionalism]], which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. (This contrasted with Malinowski's functionalism, and was quite different from the later French [[Structuralism#Structuralism in anthropology and sociology|structuralism]], which examined the conceptual structures in language and symbolism.)

Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown's influence stemmed from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions that furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for "Social Anthropology" by teaching at universities across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. From the late 1930s until the postwar period appeared a string of monographs and edited volumes that cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology (BSA). Famous ethnographies include ''The Nuer,'' by [[Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]], and ''The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi,'' by [[Meyer Fortes]]; well-known edited volumes include ''African Systems of Kinship and Marriage'' and ''African Political Systems.''

==== Post WW II trends ====
[[Max Gluckman]], together with many of his colleagues at the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]] and students at [[Manchester University]], collectively known as the [[Manchester School (anthropology)|Manchester School]], took BSA in new directions through their introduction of explicitly Marxist-informed theory, their emphasis on conflicts and conflict resolution, and their attention to the ways in which individuals negotiate and make use of the social structural possibilities.

In Britain, anthropology had a great intellectual impact, it "contributed to the erosion of [[Christianity]], the growth of [[cultural relativism]], an awareness of the survival of the primitive in modern life, and the replacement of [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] modes of analysis with [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]], all of which are central to modern culture."&lt;ref name="Heyck1997"&gt;Heyck, Thomas William (1997) at The American Historical Review, Vol. 102, No. 5 (December, 1997), pp. 1486–1488 {{doi|10.2307/2171126}} {{jstor|2171126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 1960s and 1970s, [[Edmund Leach]] and his students [[Mary Douglas]] and [[Nur Yalman]], among others, introduced French structuralism in the style of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]; while British anthropology has continued to emphasize social organization and economics over purely symbolic or literary topics, differences among British, French, and American sociocultural anthropologies have diminished with increasing dialogue and borrowing of both theory and methods. Today, social anthropology in Britain engages internationally with many other social theories and has branched in many directions.

In countries of the British Commonwealth, social anthropology has often been institutionally separate from [[physical anthropology]] and [[primatology]], which may be connected with departments of biology or zoology; and from archaeology, which may be connected with departments of [[Classics]], [[Egyptology]], and the like. In other countries (and in some, particularly smaller, British and North American universities), anthropologists have also found themselves institutionally linked with scholars of [[folklore]], [[Museology|museum studies]], [[human geography]], [[sociology]], [[social relations]], [[ethnic studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[social work]].

Anthropology has been used in Britain to provide an alternative explanation for the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]] to the technical explanations rooted in economic and political theory. Dr. [[Gillian Tett]], a [[Cambridge University]] trained anthropologist who went on to become a senior editor at the [[Financial Times]] is one of the leaders in this use of anthropology.

===Canada===
Canadian anthropology began, as in other parts of the Colonial world, as ethnological data in the records of travellers and missionaries. In Canada, [[Jesuit]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] such as Fathers LeClercq, Le Jeune and Sagard, in the 17th century, provide the oldest ethnographic records of native tribes in what was then the Dominion of Canada. The academic discipline has drawn strongly on both the British Social Anthropology and the American Cultural Anthropology traditions, producing a hybrid "Socio-cultural" anthropology.

==== George Mercer Dawson ====
True anthropology began with a [[Government agency|Government department]]: the [[Geological Survey of Canada]], and [[George Mercer Dawson]] (director in 1895). Dawson's support for anthropology created impetus for the profession in Canada. This was expanded upon by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who established a Division of Anthropology within the Geological Survey in 1910.

==== Edward Sapir ====
Anthropologists were recruited from England and the USA, setting the foundation for the unique Canadian style of anthropology. Scholars include the linguist and Boasian [[Edward Sapir]].

===France===
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
Anthropology in France has a less clear genealogy than the British and American traditions, in part because many French writers influential in anthropology have been trained or held faculty positions in sociology, philosophy, or other fields rather than in anthropology.

==== Marcel Mauss ====
Most commentators consider [[Marcel Mauss]] (1872–1950), nephew of the influential sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], to be the founder of the French anthropological tradition. Mauss belonged to Durkheim's ''[[Année Sociologique]]'' group. While Durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies, Mauss and his collaborators (such as [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Robert Hertz]]) drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies that were not as 'differentiated' as European nation states.

Two works by Mauss in particular proved to have enduring relevance: ''[[The Gift (book)|Essay on the Gift]],'' a seminal analysis of [[trade|exchange]] and [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], and his Huxley lecture on the notion of the person, the first comparative study of notions of person and selfhood cross-culturally.&lt;ref&gt;Mauss, Marcel (1938) "A category of the human mind: the notion of person; the notion of self", in M. Carrithers, S. Collins, and S. Lukes, eds. ''The Category of the Person: anthropology, philosophy, history''. Pp. 1-25. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press. Originally given as "Une categorie de l'Esprit Humain: La Notion de Personne, Celle de 'Moi'", for the Huxley Memorial Lecture and appeared in the ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the interwar years, French interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as [[surrealism]] and [[primitivism (art movement)|primitivism]], which drew on ethnography for inspiration. [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Michel Leiris]] are examples of people who combined anthropology with the French avant-garde. During this time most of what is known as ''ethnologie'' was restricted to museums, such as the [[Musée de l'Homme]] founded by [[Paul Rivet]], and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of [[folklore]].

==== Claude Lévi-Strauss ====
Above all, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] helped institutionalize anthropology in France. Along with the enormous influence that his theory of [[structuralism]] exerted across multiple disciplines, Lévi-Strauss established ties with American and British anthropologists. At the same time, he established centers and laboratories within France to provide an institutional context within anthropology, while training influential students such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Françoise Héritier]]. They proved influential in the world of French anthropology. Much of the distinct character of France's anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally funded research laboratories ([[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]) rather than academic departments in universities

Other influential writers in the 1970s include [[Pierre Clastres]], who explains in his books on the [[Guayakis|Guayaki]] tribe in [[Paraguay]] that "primitive societies" actively oppose the institution of the [[state (polity)|state]]. These stateless societies are not less evolved than societies with states, but chose to conjure the institution of [[authority]] as a separate function from society. The [[Leadership|leader]] is only a spokesperson for the group when it has to deal with other groups ("international relations") but has no inside authority, and may be violently removed if he attempts to abuse this position.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew Dean "Critical Re-vision: Clastres' Chronicle and the optic of [[primitivism]]", 2002 In ''Best of Anthropology Today, 1974–2000'', ed. J. Benthall, with a preface by M. Sahlins. London: Routledge. [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0415262550 Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important French social theorist since [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and Lévi-Strauss is [[Pierre Bourdieu]], who trained formally in philosophy and sociology and eventually held the Chair of Sociology at the Collège de France. Like Mauss and others before him, he worked on topics both in sociology and anthropology. His fieldwork among the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] of Algeria places him solidly in anthropology, while his analysis of the function and reproduction of fashion and cultural capital in European societies places him as solidly in sociology.

===United States===
From its beginnings in the early 19th century through the early 20th century, anthropology in the United States was influenced by the presence of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] societies. [[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franz Boas]], one of the pioneers of modern anthropology, often called the "Father of American Anthropology"]]
[[Cultural anthropology]] in the United States was influenced greatly by the ready availability of Native American societies as ethnographic subjects. The field was pioneered by staff of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and the Smithsonian Institution's [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], men such as [[John Wesley Powell]] and [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]].

Late-eighteenth-century ethnology established the scientific foundation for the field, which began to mature in the United States during the presidency of [[Andrew Jackson]] (1829–1837). Jackson was responsible for implementing the Indian Removal Act, the coerced and forced removal of an estimated 100,000 American Indians during the 1830s to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma; for insuring that the franchise was extended to all white men, irrespective of financial means while denying virtually all black men the right to vote; and, for suppressing abolitionists' efforts to end slavery while vigorously defending that institution. Finally, he was responsible for appointing Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] who would decide, in Scott v. Sandford (1857), that Negroes were "beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race&amp;nbsp;... and so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect". As a result of this decision, black people, whether free or enslaved, could never become citizens of the United States.

It was in this context that the so-called American School of Anthropology thrived as the champion of polygenism or the doctrine of multiple origins—sparking a debate between those influenced by the Bible who believed in the unity of humanity and those who argued from a scientific standpoint for the plurality of origins and the antiquity of distinct types. Like the monogenists, these theories were not monolithic and often used words like races, species, hybrid, and mongrel interchangeably. A scientific consensus began to emerge during this period "that there exists a Genus Homo, embracing many primordial types of 'species'". [[Charles Caldwell (physician)|Charles Caldwell]], [[Samuel George Morton]], [[Samuel A. Cartwright]], [[George Gliddon]], [[Josiah C. Nott]], and [[Louis Agassiz]], and even South Carolina Governor [[James Henry Hammond]] were all influential proponents of this school. While some were disinterested scientists, others were passionate advocates who used science to promote slavery in a period of increasing sectional strife. All were complicit in establishing the putative science that justified slavery, informed the Dred Scott decision, underpinned miscegenation laws, and eventually fueled Jim Crow. Samuel G. Morton, for example, claimed to be just a scientist but he did not hesitate to provide evidence of Negro inferiority to John C. Calhoun, the prominent pro-slavery Secretary of State to help him negotiate the annexation of Texas as a slave state.

The high-water mark of polygenic theories was Josiah Nott and Gliddon's voluminous eight-hundred page tome titled ''Types of Mankind'', published in 1854. Reproducing the work of Louis Agassiz and Samuel Morton, the authors spread the virulent and explicitly racist views to a wider, more popular audience. The first printing sold out quickly and by the end of the century it had undergone nine editions. Although many Southerners felt that all the justification for slavery they needed was found in the Bible, others used the new science to defend slavery and the repression of American Indians. Abolitionists, however, felt they had to take this science on its own terms. And for the first time, African American intellectuals waded into the contentious debate. In the immediate wake of Types of Mankind and during the pitched political battles that led to Civil War, [[Frederick Douglass]] (1818–1895), the statesman and persuasive abolitionist, directly attacked the leading theorists of the American School of Anthropology. In an 1854 address, entitled "The Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered", Douglass argued that "by making the enslaved a character fit only for slavery, [slaveowners] excuse themselves for refusing to make the slave a freeman.... For let it be once granted that the human race are of multitudinous origin, naturally different in their moral, physical, and intellectual capacities&amp;nbsp;... a chance is left for slavery, as a necessary institution.... There is no doubt that Messrs. Nott, Glidden, Morton, Smith and Agassiz were duly consulted by our slavery propagating statesmen" (p.&amp;nbsp;287).

==== Lewis Henry Morgan in the United States====
[[Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818–1881), a lawyer from [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], became an advocate for and ethnological scholar of the [[Iroquois]]. His comparative analyses of religion, government, material culture, and especially kinship patterns proved to be influential contributions to the field of anthropology. Like other scholars of his day (such as [[Edward Tylor]]), Morgan argued that human societies could be classified into categories of cultural evolution on a scale of progression that ranged from ''savagery'', to ''barbarism'', to ''civilization''. He focused on understanding how cultures integrated and systematized, and how the various features of one culture indicate an evolutionary status in comparison with other cultures. Generally, Morgan used technology (such as bowmaking or pottery) as an indicator of position on this scale.

==== Franz Boas ====
[[Franz Boas]] established academic anthropology in the United States in opposition to this sort of evolutionary perspective. His approach was empirical, skeptical of overgeneralizations, and eschewed attempts to establish universal laws. For example, Boas studied immigrant children to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable, and that human conduct and behavior resulted from nurture, rather than nature.

Influenced by the German tradition, Boas argued that the world was full of distinct ''cultures,'' rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little "civilization" they had. He believed that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations, like those made in the [[natural science]]s, were not possible.

In doing so, he fought discrimination against immigrants, blacks, and indigenous peoples of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) ''Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology''. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many American anthropologists adopted his agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular subjects for anthropologists today. The so-called "Four Field Approach" has its origins in Boasian Anthropology, dividing the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated fields of sociocultural, biological, linguistic, and archaic anthropology (e.g. archaeology). Anthropology in the United States continues to be deeply influenced by the Boasian tradition, especially its emphasis on culture.
[[File:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|[[Ruth Benedict]] in 1937]]

Boas used his positions at [[Columbia University]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to train and develop multiple generations of students. His first generation of students included [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], who each produced richly detailed studies of indigenous North American cultures. They provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages helped establish [[linguistics]] as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on [[Indo-European languages]].

The publication of [[Alfred Kroeber]]'s textbook, ''Anthropology,'' marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material, Boasians felt a growing urge to generalize. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists including [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up.

Though such works as ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' and ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined by [[Ralph Linton]], and Mead was limited to her offices at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]].

===Other countries===
Anthropology as it emerged amongst the Western colonial powers (mentioned above) has generally taken a different path than that in the countries of southern and central Europe ([[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the successors to the [[Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman empire]]s). In the former, the encounter with multiple, distinct cultures, often very different in organization and language from those of Europe, has led to a continuing emphasis on [[cross-cultural comparison]] and a receptiveness to certain kinds of cultural relativism.&lt;ref name="Spiro1987"&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) "Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason", in ''Culture and Human Nature: theoretical papers of Melford E. Spiro''. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp. 32–58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the successor states of continental Europe, on the other hand, anthropologists often joined with folklorists and linguists in building cultural perspectives on nationalism. Ethnologists in these countries tended to focus on differentiating among local ethnolinguistic groups, documenting local folk culture, and representing the prehistory of what has become a nation through various forms of public education (e.g., museums of several kinds).&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest. (1998) ''Language and solitude: Wittgenstein, Malinowski, and the Habsburg dilemma''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scheme, Russia occupied a middle position. On the one hand, it had a large region (largely east of the Urals) of highly distinct, pre-industrial, often non-literate peoples, similar to the situation in the Americas. On the other hand, Russia also participated to some degree in the nationalist (cultural and political) movements of Central and Eastern Europe. After the Revolution of 1917, views expressed by anthropologists in the USSR, and later the Soviet Bloc countries, were highly shaped by the requirement to conform to Marxist theories of social evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest, ed. (1980) ''Soviet and Western anthropology''. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece, there was since the 19th century a science of the [[folklore]] called ''laographia'' (laography), in the form of "a science of the interior", although theoretically weak; but the connotation of the field deeply changed after World War II, when a wave of Anglo-American anthropologists introduced a science "of the outside".&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Zoïa, "L'anthropologie en Grèce", Terrain, Numéro 14—L'incroyable et ses preuves (mars 1990), [En ligne], mis en ligne le 7 octobre 2005, [http://terrain.revues.org/document3641.html Terrain.revues.org], Consulté le 15 juin 2007. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Italy, the development of [[ethnology]] and related studies did not receive as much attention as other branches of learning&lt;ref&gt;Grottanelli, Vinigi ''Ethnology and/or Cultural Anthropology in Italy: Traditions and Developments (and Comments and Reply)''. Other authors: Giorgio Ausenda, Bernardo Bernardi, Ugo Bianchi, [[Y. Michal Bodemann]], Jack Goody, Allison Jablonko, David I. Kertzer, Vittorio Lanternari, Antonio Marazzi, Roy A. Miller, Jr., Laura Laurencich Minelli, David M. Moss, Leonard W. Moss, H. R. H. Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark, Diana Pinto, Pietro Scotti, Tullio Tentori. ''[[Current Anthropology]]'', Vol. 18, No. 4 (December, 1977), pp. 593–614 {{jstor|2741501}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but nonetheless included important researchers and thinkers like [[Ernesto De Martino]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bookrags.com/research/de-martino-ernesto-eorl-04/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]] and [[Norway]] are the countries that showed the most division and conflict between scholars focusing on domestic socio-cultural issues and scholars focusing on "other" societies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}. Some German and Austrian scholars have increased cultural anthropology as both legal anthropology regarding "other" societies and anthropology of Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Fikentscher: "Law and Anthropology: Outlines, Issues, and Suggestions", Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, C.H.

The development of [[World Anthropologies|world anthropologies]] has followed different trajectories.

==20th-century developments==
In the mid-20th century, American anthropology began to study its own history more systematically. In 1967 [[Marvin Harris]] published his ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory'', presenting argumentative examinations of anthropology's historical developments, and [[George W. Stocking, Jr.]], established the historicist school, examining the historical contexts of anthropological movements.

This article outlines the '''history of [[media studies]]'''.

==Chicago School==
Though not yet named as such, media studies' roots are in the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] and thinkers such as [[John Dewey]], [[Charles Cooley]] and [[George Herbert Mead|George Mead]]. These authors saw American society on the cusp of positive social change toward pure democracy. Mead argued that for an ideal society to exist, a form of communication must be developed to allow the unique individual to appreciate the attitudes, viewpoints and positions of others unlike himself, and allow him to be understood by others as well. Mead believed that this "new media" would allow humans to empathize with others, and therefore moves toward an "ideal of human society."&lt;ref&gt;Mead, George Herbert. "Obstacles and Promises in the Development of an Ideal Society." ''Mind, Self &amp; Society'', pp. 317–28. Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; Where Mead sees an ideal society, Dewey names it the "Great Community," and further asserts the assumption that humans are intelligent enough for self-government, and that that knowledge is "a function of association and communication."&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. "Search for the Great Community." The Public and Its Problems, pp. 143–84. New York: Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1927. "Nature, Communication, and Meaning." Experience and Nature, pp. 138–70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Cooley asserts that political communication makes public opinion possible, which in turn promotes democracy. Each of these authors represent the Chicago School’s attention to [[electronic communication]] as a facilitator of democracy, its faith in the informed electorate, and its focus on the individual as opposed to the mass.

==First M.A. Media Studies program in the U.S.==
The social impact of mass communication has been studied at The New School University in New York since its founding in 1919. The first college course to investigate the motion picture was offered here in 1926. [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s colleague, John Culkin, brought his Center for Understanding Media to The New School in 1975 and The New School began offering the Master of Arts degree in Media Studies, one of the first graduate programs of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/school-of-media-studies-about/&lt;/ref&gt; Today, among other programs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/school-of-media-studies-degrees-and-programs/&lt;/ref&gt; MA in Media Studies is still being offered by [http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/school-of-media-studies/ School of Media Studies, The New School], which will celebrate 40th anniversary of Media Studies at The New School during the academic year 2015-2016&lt;ref&gt;http://smscommons.newschool.edu/news/2015/09/14/media-studies-40th-anniversary-celebration-fall-2015-spring-2016/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propaganda studies==
Between the First and Second World Wars, the [[Institute for Propaganda Analysis]] briefly rose to importance. Their definition of propaganda was &lt;blockquote&gt;"expression of opinion or action by individuals or groups deliberately designed to influence opinion or actions of other individuals or groups with reference to predetermined ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Alfred M. (With Elizabeth Briant Lee)|year= 1937|title=The Fine Art of Propaganda: A Study of Father Coughlin’s Speeches}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Harold Lasswell]], who worked in the paradigm of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] of sociology wrote [[Propaganda Technique in the World War]], which included this definition of propaganda:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Propaganda in the broadest sense is the technique of influencing human action by the manipulation of representations. These representations may take spoken, written, pictorial or musical form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lasswell|first=Harold.|year= 1937|title= Propaganda Technique in the World War|pages= 214–22.|isbn=0-8240-0458-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These definitions of [[propaganda]] clearly show that this was a school of thought that focused on [[media influence|media effects]], as it highlighted the influence that media could have over its audiences attitudes and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= [[Harold Lasswell|Lasswell]]|first= Harold|year= 1937|title= [[Propaganda]]|encyclopedia =  Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences|pages= 521–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epitomizing this early school of media effects studies are experiments done by The Experimental Section of the Research Branch of the U.S. War Department's Information and Education Division. In the experiments, the effects of various U.S. wartime [[propaganda]] films on soldiers were observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= [[Carl Hovland|Hovland]]|first= Carl I.|author2=Arthur A. Lumsdaine |author3=Fred D. Shefield  |year= 1949|title= Experiments in Mass Communication|journal=  Studies in the Social Psychology in World War II, American Soldier Series|volume= 3|pages=3–16, 247–79.|publisher= Macmillan|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current Propaganda studies are applied into many fields besides politics. Herman described a propaganda model as "a model of media behavior and performance, not of media effects." (Herman, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;63)  He argued: "They are profit-seeking business, owned by very wealthy people (or other companies); and they are funded largely by advertisers who are also profit-seeking entities, and who want their advertisements to appear in a [[supportive selling environment]]."&lt;ref name="herman62"&gt;(Herman, 2000, p. 62)&lt;/ref&gt; He also presented "five factors: owner ship, advertising, sourcing, flak and anti-communist ideology-work as filters through which information must pass, and that individually and often in cumulative fashion they greatly influence media choices."&lt;ref name="herman62"/&gt; Until now, there is no conclusion of propaganda, debate still continues.

==Frankfurt School Critical Theory==
Typified by the philosophical and theoretical orientations of Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Leo Lowenthal, and Herbert Marcuse, the Frankfurt school contributed greatly to the development and application of critical theory in media studies.  Their Marxist critique of market-driven media was critical of its atomizing and leveling effects.

The Frankfurt school also lamented the effects of the "culture industry" on the production and appreciation of art.  For example, in ''A Social Critique of Radio Music'', Adorno asserts: &lt;blockquote&gt;"…music has ceased to be a human force and is consumed like other consumers’ goods.  This produces ‘commodity listening’…The listener suspends all intellectual activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adorno |first=Theodor W. |year= 1945|title= A Social Critique of Radio Music|journal= Kenyon Review |volume= 7|pages=208–17.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the Frankfurt school lamented on the effects of the "culture industry" they also began to identify [[mass culture]] and [[high culture]] as two distinct entities.  Scholars like Benjamin (1936) and Adorno (1945) can be credited with what would eventually become known as popular culture and high culture.  Their finite distinction of equating original production with ritualistic behavior as compared with mass culture that finds its identifying symbols in reproductions.  These reproductions are souless and lacking in definition and originality.

==Media effects==
{{main|Media effects}}
The less paradigm in media studies since the Second World War has been associated with the ideas, methods and findings of [[Paul Lazarsfeld|Paul F. Lazarsfeld]] and his school: media effect studies. Their studies focused on measurable, short-term behavioral ‘effects’ of media and concluded that the media played a limited role in influencing public opinion. The "Limited-Effects" Model developed by Lazarsfeld and his colleagues from Columbia was highly influential in the development of media studies. The model claims the mass media has "limited-effects" on voting patterns. Voters are influenced, rather, through the ‘two-step flow’ model, the idea that media messages are disseminated through personal interaction with ‘opinion leaders’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gitlinn |first=Todd |year=1974 |title=Media Sociology: the Dominant Paradigm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model of limited- effects was so influential that the question of media "effects" on politics was left largely unaddressed until the late 1960s. Eventually Mass Communication scholars began to study political behavior again and the limited-effects model was called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffee, Steven H., &amp; Hockheimer, J.. "The Beginnings of Political Communication Research in the United States: Origins of the ‘Limited Effects’ Model." The Media Revolution in America &amp; Western Europe, pp. 267–96. Ed. Ev Rogers &amp; F. Balle. Norwood, N.J.: Ablex, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses and gratification model==

As a response to the previous emphasis upon media effects, from the 1970s researchers became interested in how audiences make sense of media texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutchby|first=Ian |year= 2006|title=Media Talk: Conversation Analysis and the Study of Broadcasting |location=Berkshire |publisher=Open University Press|isbn= 0-335-20995-5|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[uses and gratifications]]" model, associated with [[Jay Blumler]] and [[Elihu Katz]], reflected this growing interest in the 'active audience'. One such example of this type of  research was conducted by Hodge and Tripp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hodge, R.|author2=Tripp, D.|year=1986|title=Children and Television|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press |isbn=0-8047-1352-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and separately Palmer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=P |year=1986 |title=The Lively Audience: A Study of Children around the TV set|location=Sydney|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=0-86861-970-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; about how school-children make sense of the Australian [[soap opera]] ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]''. They found that pupils could identify with the prisoners: they were "shut in", separated from their friends and wouldn't be there had they not been made to be, etc. Also, the children could compare the wardens to their teachers: "the hard-bitten old [one], the soft new one, the one you could take advantage of..."&lt;ref name="fiske"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=John |year= 1987 |title=Television Culture|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 0-415-03934-7|pages=68–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]] summarises:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The children inserted meanings of the program into their social experience of school in a way that informed both -- the meanings of school and the meanings of ''Prisoner'' were each influenced by the other, and the fit between them validated the other.&lt;ref name="fiske"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Human geography''' is the branch of [[geography]] that deals  with the study of people and their communities,
cultures, economies, and interactions with the environment by studying their relations with and across space and place.&lt;ref name="HGDICT"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Johnston|first=Ron|editor1-last=Johnston|editor1-first=Ron|editor2-last=Gregory|editor2-first=Derek|editor3-last=Pratt|editor3-first=Geraldine|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Watts|editor4-first=Michael|title=Human Geography|encyclopedia=The Dictionary of Human Geography| pages=353–60|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human geography attends to human patterns of social interaction, as well as spatial level interdependencies, and how they influence or affect the earth's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russel|first1=Polly|title=Human Geography|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelpsubject/socsci/humangeog/humangeography.html|website=British Library|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/human/index_en.html|title=Human Geography|last=Reinhold|first=Dennie|date=February 7, 2017|website=www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an intellectual discipline, [[geography]] is divided into the sub-fields of [[physical geography]] and human geography, the latter concentrating upon the study of human activities, by the application of [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[quantitative research]] methods.

==History==
{{Main article|History of geography}}
{{History of geography sidebar}}
Geography was not recognized as a formal academic discipline until the 18th century, although many scholars had undertaken geographical scholarship for much longer, particularly through [[cartography]].

The [[Royal Geographical Society]] was founded in [[England]] in 1830,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal Geographical Society|title=History|url=http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/History.htm|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the United Kingdom did not get its first full Chair of geography until 1917. The first real geographical intellect to emerge in [[United Kingdom]]'s geographical minds was [[Halford John Mackinder]], appointed reader at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1887.

The [[National Geographic Society]] was founded in the United States in 1888 and began publication of the ''National Geographic'' magazine which became, and continues to be, a great popularizer of geographic information. The society has long supported geographic research and education on geographical topics.

The Association of American Geographers was founded in 1904 and was renamed the [[American Association of Geographers]] in 2016 to better reflect the increasingly international character of its membership.

One of the first examples of geographic methods being used for purposes other than to describe and theorize the physical properties of the earth is [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s map of the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Though Snow was primarily a [[physician]] and a pioneer of [[epidemiology]] rather than a geographer, his map is probably one of the earliest examples of [[health geography]].

The now fairly distinct differences between the subfields of physical and human geography have developed at a later date. This connection between both physical and human properties of geography is most apparent in the theory of [[environmental determinism]], made popular in the 19th century by [[Carl Ritter]] and others, and has close links to the field of [[evolutionary biology]] of the time. Environmental determinism is the theory, that people's physical, mental and moral habits are directly due to the influence of their natural environment. However, by the mid-19th century, environmental determinism was under attack for lacking methodological rigor associated with modern science, and later as a means to justify [[racism]] and [[imperialism]].

A similar concern with both human and physical aspects is apparent during the later 19th and first half of the 20th centuries focused on [[regional geography]].The goal of regional geography, through something known as [[regionalisation]], was to delineate space into regions and then understand and describe the unique characteristics of each region through both human and physical aspects. With links to (possibilism) (geography) and [[cultural ecology]] some of the same notions of causal effect of the environment on society and culture remain with environmental determinism.

By the 1960s, however, the [[quantitative revolution]] led to strong criticism of regional geography. Due to a perceived lack of scientific rigor in an overly descriptive nature of the discipline, and a continued separation of geography from its two subfields of physical and human geography and from [[geology]], geographers in the mid-20th century began to apply statistical and mathematical models in order to solve spatial problems.&lt;ref name="HGDICT"/&gt; Much of the development during the quantitative revolution is now apparent in the use of [[geographic information systems]]; the use of statistics, spatial modeling, and positivist approaches are still important to many branches of human geography. Well-known geographers from this period are [[Fred K. Schaefer]], [[Waldo Tobler]], [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]], [[Peter Haggett]], [[Richard Chorley|Richard J. Chorley]], [[William Bunge]], and [[Torsten Hägerstrand]].

From the 1970s, a number of critiques of the positivism now associated with geography emerged. Known under the term '[[critical geography]],' these critiques signaled another turning point in the discipline. [[Behavioural geography|Behavioral geography]] emerged for some time as a means to understand how people made perceived spaces and places, and made locational decisions. The more influential 'radical geography' emerged in the 1970s and 1980s. It draws heavily on [[Marxist geography|Marxist]]'s theory and techniques, and is associated with geographers such as [[David Harvey]] and [[Richard Peet]]. Radical geographers seek to say meaningful things about problems recognized through quantitative methods,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Harvey, David| authorlink=David Harvey| title=Social Justice and the City| year=1973 | publisher=Edward Arnold | location=London | pages=128–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide explanations rather than descriptions, put forward alternatives and solutions, and be politically engaged,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0066-4812&amp;site=1 | title=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography: Celebrating Over 40 years of Radical Geography 1969-2009 | author=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography | year=2009 | accessdate=31 May 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010193949/http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0066-4812&amp;site=1 | archivedate=10 October 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than using the detachment associated with positivists. (The detachment and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of the quantitative revolution was itself critiqued by radical geographers as being a tool of capital). Radical geography and the links to Marxism and related theories remain an important part of contemporary human geography (See: ''[[Antipode (journal)|Antipode]]''). Critical geography also saw the introduction of 'humanistic geography', associated with the work of [[Yi-Fu Tuan]], which pushed for a much more [[qualitative data|qualitative]] approach in methodology.

The changes under critical geography have led to contemporary approaches in the discipline such as [[feminist geography]], [[Cultural geography#"New cultural geography"|new cultural geography]], "demonic" geographies&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Demonic geographies. Area. 49(4), pp. 503-509. https://doi.org/10.1111/area.12339&lt;/ref&gt;, and the engagement with [[postmodern]] and [[post-structural]] theories and philosophies.

==Fields==
The primary fields of study in human geography focus around the core fields of:

===Culture===
[[Cultural geography]] is the study of cultural products and norms - their variation across spaces and places, as well as their relations. It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language, religion, economy, government, and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Jordan-Bychkov, Terry G. |author2=Domosh, Mona |author3=Rowntree, Lester | title=The human mosaic: a thematic introduction to cultural geography | year=1994 | publisher=HarperCollinsCollegePublishers | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-06-500731-2 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Agriculture_in_Asia.jpg|thumb|This picture shows terraced rice agriculture in Asia.]]

* Subfields include: [[Social geography]], [[Animal geographies]], [[Language geography]], [[Sexuality and space]], [[Children's geographies]], and [[Religion and geography]].

===Development===
[[Development geography]] is the study of the Earth's geography with reference to the [[standard of living]] and the [[quality of life]] of its human inhabitants, study of the location, distribution and spatial organization of economic activities, across the Earth. The subject matter investigated is strongly influenced by the researcher's methodological approach.

===Economic===
[[File:Shan Street Bazaar.JPG|thumb|Economic Geography: Shan Street bazaar, market in Myanmar]]
[[Economic geography]] examines relationships between human economic systems, states, and other factors, and the biophysical environment.
* Subfields include: [[Marketing geography]] and [[Transportation geography]]

===Health===

[[Health geography]] is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]]. Health geography deals with the spatial relations and patterns between people and the environment. This is a sub-discipline of human geography, researching how and why diseases are spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dummer|first=Trevor J.B.|date=2008-04-22|title=Health geography: supporting public health policy and planning|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=178|issue=9|pages=1177–1180|doi=10.1503/cmaj.071783|issn=0820-3946|pmc=2292766|pmid=18427094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
[[Historical geography]] is the study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and "real" geographies of the past. Historical geography studies a wide variety of issues and topics. A common theme is the study of the geographies of the past and how a place or region changes through time. Many historical geographers study geographical patterns through time, including how people have interacted with their environment, and created the cultural landscape.

===Political===
[[Political geography]] is concerned with the study of both the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures.
* Subfields include: [[Electoral geography]], [[Geopolitics]], [[Strategic geography]] and [[Military geography]]

===Population===
[[Population geography]] is the study of ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to their environment or location.

===Settlement===
[[Settlement geography]], including [[urban geography]], is the study of [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural area]]s with specific regards to spatial, relational and theoretical aspects of settlement.  That is the study of areas which have a concentration of [[building]]s and [[infrastructure]].  These are areas where the majority of [[economy|economic]] activities are in the [[secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] and [[tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sectors]]. In case of urban settlement, they probably have a high [[population density]].
{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Urban ===
[[Urban geography]] is the study of cities, towns, and other areas of relatively dense settlement. Two main interests are site (how a settlement is positioned relative to the physical environment) and situation (how a settlement is positioned relative to other settlements). Another area of interest is the internal organization of urban areas with regard to different demographic groups and the layout of infrastructure. This subdiscipline also draws on ideas from other branches of Human Geography to see their involvement in the processes and patterns evident in an [[urban area]].&lt;ref name="Palm"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palm|first=Risa|date=2016-09-05|title=Urban geography: city structures|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/030913258200600104|journal=Progress in Geography|language=en|doi=10.1177/030913258200600104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Kaplan, Dave H. |author2=Holloway, Steven |author3=Wheeler, James O. |title=Urban Geography, 3rd. Edition | year=2014 | publisher=Wiley | location=Hoboken, NJ  | isbn=978-1-118-57385-3 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subfields include: [[Economic geography]], [[Population geography]], and [[Settlement geography]]. These are clearly not the only subfields that could be used to assist in the study of [[Urban geography]], but they are some major players.&lt;ref name="Palm"/&gt;

==Philosophical and theoretical approaches==
Within each of the subfields, various philosophical approaches can be used in research; therefore, an urban geographer could be a Feminist or Marxist geographer, etc.

Such approaches are:

==Journals==
As with all social sciences, human geographers publish research and other written work in a variety of academic journals. Whilst human geography is interdisciplinary, there are a number of journals that focus on human geography.

These include:

'''Human migration''' is the movement by people from one place to another with the intentions of settling, permanently or temporarily in a new location. The movement is often over long distances and from one country to another, but [[internal migration]] is also possible; indeed, this is the dominant form globally. People may migrate as individuals, in family units or in [[Mass migration|large groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://migrationsmap.net/#/USA/arrivals |title=  Migrations country wise|accessdate=7 June 2014}}. One of the major migration rushes took place in the gold run in 19th century in California, Australia, and Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; A person who moves from their home to another place because of natural disaster or civil disturbance may be described as a [[refugee]] or, especially within the same country, a [[displaced person]]. A person seeking refuge from political, religious, or other forms of persecution is usually described as an [[asylum seeker]].

[[Nomad]]ic movements are normally not regarded as migrations as there is no intention to settle in the new place and because the movement is generally [[Seasonal human migration|seasonal]]. Only a few nomadic people have retained this form of lifestyle in modern times. Also, the temporary movement of people for the purpose of travel, tourism, pilgrimages, or the commute is not regarded as migration, in the absence of an intention to live and settle in the visited places.

Many estimates of statistics in worldwide migration patterns exist.

The [[World Bank]] has published its ''Migration and Remittances Factbook'' annually since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAC/Resources/Factbook2011-Ebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Organisation for Migration]] (IOM) has published a yearly ''World Migration Report'' since 1999. The [[United Nations Statistics Division]] also keeps a database on worldwide migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://esa.un.org/unmigration/wallchart2013.htm | title=United Nations Population Division &amp;#124; Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent advances in research on migration via the Internet promise better understanding of migration patterns and migration motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oiarzabal | first1 = P.

Substantial internal migration can also take place within a country, either [[seasonal human migration]] (mainly related to agriculture and to tourism to urban places), or shifts of population into cities ([[urbanisation]]) or out of cities ([[suburbanisation]]). Studies of worldwide migration patterns, however, tend to limit their scope to [[international migration]].

The World Bank's ''Migration and Remittances Factbook'' of 2011 lists the following estimates for the year 2010: total number of immigrants: 215.8 million or 3.2% of world population.  In 2013, the percentage of international migrants worldwide increased by 33% with 59% of migrants targeting developed regions.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unfpa.org/resources/international-migration-2013-wall-chart|title= International Migration 2013 (wall chart) |year= 2013 |publisher= UNFPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost half of these migrants are women, which is one of the most significant migrant-pattern changes in the last half century.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt; Women migrate alone or with their family members and community. Even though female migration is largely viewed as associations rather than independent migration, emerging studies argue complex and manifold reasons for this.&lt;ref&gt;Thapan, M. (2008). Series Introduction in Palriwala and Uberoi (Eds.), Women and Migration in Asia (p. 359). New Delhi: Sage Publications. {{ISBN|978-0-7619-3675-6}} (Pb)&lt;/ref&gt;

Often{{quantify|date=September 2015}} a distinction is made {{by whom|date=September 2015}} between voluntary and involuntary migration, or between [[refugee]]s fleeing political conflict or natural disaster vs. economic or [[labour migration|labor migration]], but these distinctions are difficult to make and partially subjective, as the motivators for migration are often correlated. The World Bank's report estimates that, as of 2010, 16.3 million or 7.6% of migrants qualified as refugees. At the end of 2012, approximately 15.4 million people were refugees and persons in refugee-like situations - 87% of them found asylum in developing countries.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt;

Structurally, there is substantial South-South and North-North migration, i.e., most emigrants from high-income O.E.C.D. countries migrate to other high-income countries, and a substantial part (estimated at 43%) of emigrants from developing countries migrate to other developing countries. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] says that "[while the North has experienced a higher absolute increase in the migrant stock since 2000 (32 million) compared to the South (25 million), the South recorded a higher growth rate.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt; Between 2000 and 2013 the average annual rate of change of the migrant population in the developing regions (2.3%) slightly exceeded that of the developed regions (2.1%).&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt;

==Forced Migration==


The Global Commission on International Migration (GCIM), launched in 2003, published a report in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;The 90-page report, along with supporting evidence, is available on the GCIM website [http://www.gcim.org gcim.org]&lt;/ref&gt; International migration challenges at the global level are addressed through the [[Global Forum on Migration and Development]] and the [[Global Migration Group]], both established in 2006.

The United Nations reported that 2014 had the highest level of forced migration on record: 59.5 million individuals, caused by "persecution, conflict, generalized violence, or human rights violations", as compared with 51.2 million in 2013 (an increase of 8.3 million) and with 37.5 million a decade prior. {{As of | 2015}} one of every 122 humans is a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Worldwide displacement hits all-time high as war and persecution increase |url = http://www.unhcr.org/558193896.html |accessdate = 2015-09-21 |first = United Nations High Commissioner for |last = Refugees}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] has published 5 maps showing human migrations in progress in 2015 based on the UN report.&lt;ref&gt;

==Labor migration theories in the 21st century==

===Overview===

Numerous causes impel migrants to move to another country. For instance, [[globalization]] has increased the demand for workers in order to sustain national economies. Thus one category of [[economic migrant]]s - generally from impoverished developing countries - migrates to obtain sufficient income for survival.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.unfpa.org/migration | title=Migration}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Such migrants often send some of their income home to family members in the form of [[remittances|economic remittances]], which have become an economic staple in a number of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Jason de Parle, "A Good Provider is One Who Leaves", ''New York Times'', April 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; People may also move or are forced to move as a result of conflict, of [[human rights violations | human-rights violations]], of violence, or to escape persecution. In 2013 it was estimated{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} that around 51.2 million people fell into this category.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}} Other reasons people may move include to gain access to opportunities and services or to escape extreme weather. This type of movement, usually from rural to urban areas, may class as [[internal migration]].&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}} Socio-cultural and geo-historical factors also play a major role. In North Africa, for example, emigrating Europe counts as a sign of social prestige. Moreover, many countries were former [[colony | colonies]]. This means that many have relatives who live legally in the (former) colonial [[metropole]], and who often provide important help for immigrants arriving in that metropole.&lt;ref&gt;
For example: [[Moroccans in France]], [[Filipino Americans | Filipinos in the United States of America]], [[Koreans in Japan]] or [[Samoans in New Zealand]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Relatives may help with job research and with accommodation. The geographical proximity of Africa to Europe and the long historical ties between Northern and Southern Mediterranean countries also prompt many to migrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Fanack|title= The Key Drivers of North African Illegal Migration to Europe|url= https://chronicle.fanack.com/specials/international-affairs/north-african-illegal-migration-to-europe/|website= Fanack.com|accessdate= 14 July 2015|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150714172715/https://chronicle.fanack.com/specials/international-affairs/north-african-illegal-migration-to-europe/|archivedate= 14 July 2015|df= | quote = The proximity of North Africa to southern Europe, the liberal mobility policies of most European countries, and the historical links between northern and southern Mediterranean countries are all key factors encouraging people to migrate to Europe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of theories attempt to explain the international flow of capital and people from one country to another.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"&gt;
Jennissen, R. 2007. "Causality Chains in the International Migration Systems Approach." Population Research and Policy Review 26(4). 411 – 36.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassical economic theory===
{{main|Neoclassical economics}}This theory of migration states that the main reason for labor migration is wage difference between two geographic locations. These wage differences are usually linked to geographic labor demand and supply. It can be said that areas with a shortage of labor but an excess of capital have a high relative wage while areas with a high labor supply and a dearth of capital have a low relative wage. Labor tends to flow from low-wage areas to high-wage areas. Often, with this flow of labor comes changes in the sending as well as the receiving country. Neoclassical economic theory is best used to describe transnational migration, because it is not confined by international immigration laws and similar governmental regulations.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007" /&gt;

===Dual labor market theory===

Dual labor market theory states that migration is mainly caused by pull factors in more developed countries. This theory assumes that the labor markets in these developed countries consist of two segments: the primary market, which requires high-skilled labor, and the secondary market, which is very labor-intensive requiring low-skilled workers. This theory assumes that migration from less developed countries into more developed countries is a result of a pull created by a need for labor in the developed countries in their secondary market. [[Migrant worker]]s are needed to fill the lowest rung of the labor market because the native laborers do not want to do these jobs as they present a lack of mobility. This creates a need for migrant workers. Furthermore, the initial dearth in available labor pushes wages up, making migration even more enticing.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt;

===New economics of labor migration===

This theory states that migration flows and patterns can't be explained solely at the level of individual workers and their economic incentives, but that wider social entities must be considered as well. One such social entity is the household. Migration can be viewed as a result of risk aversion on the part of a household that has insufficient income. The household, in this case, is in need of extra capital that can be achieved through remittances sent back by family members who participate in migrant labor abroad. These [[remittances]] can also have a broader effect on the economy of the sending country as a whole as they bring in capital.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt; Recent research has examined a decline in U.S. interstate migration from 1991 to 2011, theorizing that the reduced interstate migration is due to a decline in the geographic specificity of occupations and an increase in workers’ ability to learn about other locations before moving there, through both information technology and inexpensive travel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp697.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Understanding the Long-Run Decline in Interstate Migration'', April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers find that the location-specific nature of housing is more important than moving costs in determining labour reallocation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2010/wp2010_18.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''The Role of Housing in Labour Reallocation'', November 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative deprivation theory===
{{main|Relative deprivation}}
Relative deprivation theory states that awareness of the income difference between neighbors or other households in the migrant-sending community is an important factor in migration. The incentive to migrate is a lot higher in areas that have a high level of economic inequality. In the short run, remittances may increase inequality, but in the long run, they may actually decrease it. There are two stages of migration for a worker: first, they invest in human capital formation, and then they try to capitalize on their investments. In this way, successful migrants may use their new capital to provide for better schooling for their children and better homes for their families. Successful high-skilled emigrants may serve as an example for neighbors and potential migrants who hope to achieve that level of success.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt;

===World systems theory===

[[World-systems theory]] looks at migration from a global perspective. It explains that interaction between different societies can be an important factor in social change within societies.  Trade with one country, which causes economic decline in another, may create incentive to migrate to a country with a more vibrant economy. It can be argued that even after decolonization, the economic dependence of former colonies still remains on mother countries. This view of [[international trade]] is controversial, however, and some argue that free trade can actually reduce migration between developing and developed countries. It can be argued that the developed countries import labor-intensive goods, which causes an increase in employment of unskilled workers in the less developed countries, decreasing the outflow of migrant workers. The export of capital-intensive goods from rich countries to poor countries also equalizes income and employment conditions, thus also slowing migration. In either direction, this theory can be used to explain migration between countries that are geographically far apart.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt;

===Osmosis: the unifying theory of human migration===

Old migration theories are generally embedded in geography, sociology or economics. They explain migration in specific periods and spaces. In fact, Osmosis theory explains the whole phenomenon of human migration. Based on the [[history of human migration]], Djelti (2017a)&lt;ref&gt;Djelti S, "The Evolution of the Human Migration Determinants" draft paper présented in the international conference on “Crossing Boundaries: Youth, Migration, and Development”, At Alakhawayn university in Ifran, Morocco – March 2–4, 2017 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427737_The_Evolution_of_the_Human_Migration_Determinants_1_Draft_paper&lt;/ref&gt; studies the evolution of its natural determinants. According to him, human migration is divided into two main types: the simple migration and the complicated one. The simple migration is divided, in its turn, into diffusion, stabilisation and concentration periods. During these periods, water availability, adequate climate, security and population density represent the natural determinants of human migration. For the complicated migration, it is characterised by the speedy evolution and the emergence of new sub-determinants notably earning, unemployment, networks and migration policies. Osmosis theory (Djelti, 2017b)&lt;ref&gt;Djelti S, "Osmosis: the Unifying Theory of Human Migration" Revue Algérienne d’Economie et du Management Vol. 08, N°: 02(2017) http://www.asjp.cerist.dz/raem{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427688_Osmosis_the_unifying_theory_of_human_migration&lt;/ref&gt; explains analogically human migration by the biophysical phenomenon of [[osmosis]]. In this respect, the countries are represented by [[animal cells]], the borders by the [[semipermeable membranes]] and the humans by [[ions]] of water. As to osmosis phenomenon, according to the theory, humans migrate from countries with less migration pressure to countries with high migration pressure. In order to measure the latter, the natural determinants of human migration replace the variables of the [[second principle of thermodynamics]] used to measure the [[osmotic pressure]].

==Sociological and Political Science theories==

===Sociology===
{{main|Sociology of immigration}}A number of social scientists have examined immigration from a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, paying particular attention to how immigration affects, and is affected by, matters of [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], as well as [[social structure]]. They have produced three main sociological perspectives: [[symbolic interactionism]], which aims to understand migration via face-to-face interactions on a micro-level; [[social conflict theory]] examines migration through the prism of competition for power and resources; [[structural functionalism]], based on the ideas of [[Émile Durkheim]], examines the role of migration in fulfilling certain functions within each society, such as the decrease of [[Anomie|despair and aimlessness]] and the consolidation of [[social network]]s.

More recently, as attention shifted away from countries of destination, sociologists have attempted to understand how [[transnationalism]] allows us to understand the interplay between migrants, their countries of destination, and their countries of origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sBJTOhDpauQC&amp;pg=PT5&amp;dq=schiller+basch#v=onepage&amp;q=schiller%20basch&amp;f=false|title=Nations Unbound: Transnational Projects, Postcolonial Predicaments, and Deterritorialized Nation-States|last=Basch|first=Linda|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|last3=Blanc|first3=Christina Szanton|date=2005-09-26|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135307035|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this framework, work on social remittances by [[Peggy Levitt]] and others has led to a stronger conceptualisation of how migrants affect socio-political processes in their countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levitt|first=Peggy|date=1998|title=Social Remittances: Migration Driven Local-Level Forms of Cultural Diffusion|jstor=2547666|journal=The International Migration Review|volume=32|issue=4|pages=926–948|doi=10.2307/2547666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical theories==

===Ravenstein===
Certain laws of [[social sciences|social science]] have been proposed to describe human migration. The following was a standard list after [[Ernst Georg Ravenstein|Ravenstein's]] (1834–1913) proposal in the 1880s. The laws are as follows:

# ''every migration flow generates a return or counter migration.''
# ''the majority of migrants move a short distance.
# ''migrants who move longer distances tend to choose big-city destinations.
# ''urban residents are often less migratory than inhabitants of rural areas.
# ''families are less likely to make international moves than young adults.
# ''most migrants are adults.
# ''large towns grow by migration rather than natural increase.
# ''migration stage by stage.
# ''urban rural difference.
# ''migration and technology.
# ''economic condition.

===Lee===
Lee's laws divide factors causing migrations into two groups of factors: push and pull factors. Push factors are things that are unfavourable about the area that one lives in, and pull factors are things that attract one to another area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 2060063|title= A Theory of Migration|author= Everett S. Lee|year= 1966|publisher= University of Pennsylvania|volume=3|pages=47–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Turkey’s political, social and economic conditions have been improving, making returning home all the more appealing for Turks at large. (pp.&amp;nbsp;94–99)

===Climate cycles===
The modern field of climate history suggests that the successive waves of Eurasian nomadic movement throughout history have had their origins in [[Climate change|climatic cycles]], which have expanded or contracted pastureland in Central Asia, especially [[Mongolia]] and to its west the [[Altai mountains|Altai]]. People were displaced from their home ground by other tribes trying to find land that could be grazed by essential flocks, each group pushing the next further to the south and west, into the highlands of [[Anatolia]], the [[Pannonian Plain]], into [[Mesopotamia]], or southwards, into the rich pastures of China. Bogumil Terminski uses the term "migratory domino effect" to describe this process in the context of [[Sea People]] invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Terminski, Bogumil. ''Environmentally-Induced Displacement. Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges''. CEDEM, Université de Liège, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other models===
* ''Migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation.''&lt;ref&gt;Idyorough, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Idyorough is of the view that towns and cities are a creation of the human struggle to obtain food, sex and security. To produce food, security and reproduction, human beings must, out of necessity, move out of their usual habitation and enter into indispensable social relationships that are cooperative or antagonistic.  Human beings also develop the tools and equipment to enable them to interact with nature to produce the desired food and security. The improved relationship (cooperative relationships) among human beings and improved technology further conditioned by the push and pull factors all interact together to cause or bring about migration and higher concentration of individuals into towns and cities.  The higher the technology of production of food and security and the higher the cooperative relationship among human beings in the production of food and security and in the reproduction of the human species, the higher would be the push and pull factors in the migration and concentration of human beings in towns and cities.  Countryside, towns and cities do not just exist but they do so to meet the human basic needs of food, security and the reproduction of the human species.  Therefore, migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation. Social services in the towns and cities are provided to meet these basic needs for human survival and pleasure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10478">'''The Kalahari Debate''' is a series of back and forth arguments that began in the 1980s amongst [[Anthropology|anthropologists]], [[Archaeology|archaeologists]], and [[History|historians]] about how the [[San people]] and [[hunter-gatherer]] societies in southern Africa have lived in the past. On one side of the debate were scholars led by [[Richard Borshay Lee]] and [[Irven DeVore]], considered traditionalists or "isolationists." On the other side of the debate were scholars led by Edward Wilmsen and James Denbow, considered revisionists or "integrationists."[[File:LocationKalahari.PNG|framed|The Kalahari Desert Region]]
Lee conducted early and extensive ethnographic research among a San community, the [[!Kung]] San. He and other traditionalists consider the San to have been, historically, isolated and independent hunter/gatherers separate from nearby societies. Wilmsen, Denbow and the revisionists oppose these views. They believe that the San have not always been an isolated community, but rather have played important economic roles in surrounding communities. They claim that over time the San have become a dispossessed and marginalized people.{{cn|date= October 2017}}

Both sides use both anthropological and archaeological evidence to fuel their arguments. They interpret cave paintings in [[Tsodilo Hills]], and they also use artifacts such as faunal remains of [[cattle]] or [[sheep]] found at San sites. They even find [[Early Stone Age]] and Early Iron Age technologies at San sites, which both sides use to back their arguments.{{cn|date= October 2017}}

==Traditionalists==
The San are a relatively small group of people whose communities are scattered throughout the [[Kalahari Desert]] in [[southern Africa]]. They are well known for practicing a hunter/gatherer subsistence strategy (also known as a "foraging" mode of production).&lt;ref name=OxenorOnions&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Richard|last2=Guenther|first2=Mathias|title=Oxen or onions? The search for trade (and truth) in the Kalahari."|date=1991|pages=592–601}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionalists, including [[Richard Borshay Lee|Richard Lee]] and other anthropologists, view the San as maintaining this old but adaptable way of life, even in the face of changing external circumstances. [[File:Botswana 051.jpg|thumbnail|San Hunter]] These anthropologists view the San as isolates who are not, and have never been, part of a greater Kalahari economy. The traditionalists believe that the San have adapted over time but without help from other societies. Emphasis is thereby placed on the cultural continuity and the cultural integrity of the San peoples.&lt;ref name=Revisionism&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alan|first1=Barnard|title=Kalahari revisionism, Vienna and the ‘indigenous peoples’ debate.”|journal=Social Anthropology|date=2006|volume=14|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lee’s 1979 book ''The !Kung San: Men, Women, and Work in a Foraging Society,'' his main goal was to be fully immersed in the !Kung San culture so that he could fully understand their way of life. He was puzzled as to how these people seemed to be living such an easy and happy life that relied heavily on hard work and the availability of food. Most of his studies of the San took place in the Dobe area, near the [[Tsodilo Hills]]. He was adopted into a kinship and given the name /Tontah which meant “White-Man.” He claims that the San were an isolated hunter-gatherer society that changed to farming and foraging at the end of the 1970s. Most of Lee’s historical data comes from [[Oral history|oral stories]] told by the !Kung San because they did not have anything written down. According to Lee the San were originally afraid of contact with outsiders.

Lee reports that the men did the hunting and hard labor while the women did housework. He later found out that the San weren’t just hunter-gatherers, but also herders, foragers, and farmers. In his book he states, “I learned that most of the men had had experience herding cattle at some point in their lives and that many men had owned cattle and goats in the past.”&lt;ref name=!Kung&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Richard|title=The !Kung San Men, Women, and Work in a Foraging Society|date=1979|publisher=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that they have learned all of this on their own. The San wanted wage pay for farming and taking care of cattle, goats, and sheep. This was their new way of life.

==Revisionists==
Edwin Wilmsen's 1989 book ''Land Filled With Flies'' kicked off the Kalahari Debate.[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumbnail|The San "Bushmen"]] Wilmsen made several remarks attacking anthropologists’ view of the San people. Most of his attacks were at Richard Lee and his work. Wilmsen made claims about the San such as, “Their appearance as foragers is a function of their relegations to an underclass in the playing out of historical processes that began before the current millennium and culminated in the early decades of this century.”&lt;ref name=landfilledwithflies&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilmsen|first1=Edwin|title=Land Filled With Flies|date=1989|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement upsets the traditionalists because it says that the San are not isolates but have been an underclass in a society throughout history. Wilmsen makes another statement against the traditionalists when he says, “The isolation in which they are said to have been found is a creation of our own view of them, not of their history as they lived it.”&lt;ref name=landfilledwithflies /&gt; He is beginning to say that anthropologists’ judgment is clouded because they already have a predisposed view of the San and hunter-gatherer societies as being isolates. Wilmsen states that the terms “Bushmen,” “Forager,” and “Hunter-Gatherer” contribute to the ideology of them being isolates. He says this is because these terms are commonly associated with isolated groups but his main claim is that for the San this is not the case. Wilmsen also goes on to claim that Lee approaches the San as a people without a history, that they have been doing the same thing forever. He states, “they are permitted antiquity while denied history”&lt;ref name=landfilledwithflies /&gt; Wilmsen continues the argument that anthropologists’ goal is to study hunter-gatherer groups who have lived on their own for centuries, which builds a stereotype for hunter-gatherers. He believes this is why Richard Lee’s views are flawed, and also why he is saying that the San are incorporated in a wider [[Political economy in anthropology|political economy]] in southern Africa.

The revisionists believe the [[!Kung]] were associated with [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking overlords throughout history, and involved with merchant capital.&lt;ref name=OxenorOnions /&gt; They believe the San in the Kalahari are a classless society because they are actually the lower class of a greater Kalahari society. The revisionists believe the !Kung San were heavily involved in trade. They believe the San were transformed by centuries of contact with Iron Age, [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]-speaking agro-pastoralists.&lt;ref name=Revisionism /&gt; This argues against the idea that they were a well-adapted hunter-gatherer culture, but instead advanced only through trade and help from nearby economies.

==Archaeological evidence==
When it comes to archaeological evidence, much work still has yet to be done. However, artifacts and [[Biofact (archaeology)|ecofacts]] have been found at southern African sites that could help prove the revisionist view of the San people.
[[File:Tsodilo Hills rock paintings4.jpg|thumbnail|Tsodilo Rock Art]]
Their strongest supporting site is in the [[Tsodilo Hills]], where rock art displays San looking over Bantu cattle. In the hills, there are 160 cattle pictures, 10 of which display stick figures near them.

Other evidence revisionists point to includes Early Iron Age products found in [[Later Stone Age]] sites. This includes metal and pottery found in the Dobe, Xia, and Botswana regions. Cow bones have also been found in northern Botswana, at Lotshitshi. These products are believed to be payment to the San for labor of caring for or possibly herding Bantu cattle.{{cn|date= October 2017}}

==Continuing debates==
The fuel of this debate is the constant back and forth critiquing by various scholars of each other’s work. Wilmsen would say Lee is blinded by a pre-destined view of the San as isolates. Lee would counter-argue every point that Wilmsen would make, saying either that he made mistakes in research or presents conclusions with little evidence to support them.

One specific instance is where Lee called out Wilmsen for mistaking the word “oxen” for “onins”, which meant “onions” in an old map of the Kalahari region.&lt;ref name=OxenorOnions /&gt; This discovery would make the San herders before the arrival of the anthropologists in the 50’s and 60’s and not after the 70’s, as Lee believes. This instance gave rise to Lee’s article "Oxen or Onions." In the article, Lee points out other flaws he believes he has found in Wilmsen’s argument. Critiques of Wilmsen’s work say that the cattle paintings could represent San stealing cattle rather than herding them. Another attack on Wilmsen’s work was that the amounts of [[pottery]] and iron found in Dobe and Botswana regions were so small they could fit in one hand.&lt;ref name=Revisionism /&gt; The small numbers of these artifacts make some scholars believe they are insufficient to be able to make such a claim. The same is true of the cattle bones found in Botswana. The small numbers of cattle bone fragments found on San [[Archaeological site|archaeological sites]] have made scholars question Wilmsen’s argument.&lt;ref name=Revisionism /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">'''Keywords''' are the words that academics use to reveal the internal structure of an author's 
reasoning.  While they are used primarily for [[rhetoric]], they are also used in a strictly 
grammatical sense for structural composition, reasoning, and comprehension.  Indeed, they are 
an essential part of any language.

There are many different types of keyword categories including: Conclusion, Continuation, Contrast,
Emphasis, Evidence, Illustration and Sequence. Each category serves its own function, as do the keywords
inside of a given category.

When someone uses a search engine, they type in one or more words describing what they are looking for:
'Norwich florist' or 'cheap holidays Greece', for example. These words or phrases are known as keywords.

==Corpus linguistic keywords==
In [[corpus linguistics]], key words are words that appear with statistically unusual frequency in a text
or a corpus of texts. They are identified by software that compares a word-list of the text with a word-list
based on a larger reference corpus. A suitable term for the phenomenon is [[keyness]]. The procedure used,
for example by [[WordSmith]], to list key words and phrases and plot where they appear in texts. These items
are very often of interest—particularly those human readers would not likely notice, such as prepositions,
time adverbs, and pronouns.

==Teaching Keywords==
One method used to teach keywords is called the "keyword method." It involves taking complex keywords that students do not know very well, and makes them into easier words. The easier words must have something to do with the complex keywords so students can correlate between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uberti|first1=H. Z.|last2=Scruggs|first2=T.

'''Language''' is a system that consists of the development, acquisition, maintenance and use of complex systems of [[communication]], particularly the [[human]] ability to do so&lt;!--Do not remove the qualifier "human" without first reading the article or consulting the discussions about this issue.--&gt;; and '''a language''' is any specific example of such a system.

The scientific study of language is called [[linguistics]]. Questions concerning the [[philosophy of language]], such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated at least since [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] in [[ancient Greece]]. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] have argued that language originated from [[emotion]]s while others like [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].

Estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and [[dialect]]s. [[Natural language]]s are [[speech|spoken]] or [[sign language|signed]], but any language can be [[Encoding (semiotics)|encoded]] into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]&amp;nbsp;– for example, in [[Whistled language|whistling]], [[sign language|signed]], or [[braille]]. This is because human language is [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]-independent. Depending on [[philosophy of language|philosophical perspectives]] regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the [[cognitive]] ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of [[semiosis]] to relate [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] to particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. [[Oral language|Oral]], [[sign language|manual]] and tactile languages contain a [[phonology|phonological]] system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or [[morpheme]]s, and a [[syntax|syntactic]] system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.

Human language has the properties of [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]] and [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of [[animal communication]]. Language is thought to have originated when early [[hominin]]s started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a [[Theory of mind|theory of other minds]] and a shared [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Chomsky|Fitch|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the [[human brain]], but especially in [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s. Humans [[language acquisition|acquire]] language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human [[culture]]. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[social stratification]], as well as [[social grooming]] and [[entertainment]].

Languages [[language change|evolve]] and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]] by [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparing]] modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a [[language family]]. The [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]] is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hindi]]; the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan family]] includes [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]] and the other [[Chinese language]]s, and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]; the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic family]] includes [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Somali language|Somali]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the [[Bantu languages]] include [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Zulu language|Zulu]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout [[Africa]]; and the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] include [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the [[Pacific]]. The languages of the [[Dravidian language|Dravidian family]], spoken mostly in Southern India, include [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]].  Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become [[Language death|extinct]] by the year 2100.

== Definitions ==
{{main|Philosophy of language}}
The English word ''language'' derives ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s}}'' "tongue, speech, language" through [[Latin]] ''lingua'', "language; tongue", and [[Old French]] ''[[wikt:language#Old French|language]]''.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=language |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=3rd|year=1992|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is sometimes used to refer to [[code]]s, [[cipher]]s, and other kinds of [[constructed language|artificially constructed communication systems]] such as formally defined computer languages used for [[programming language|computer programming]]. Unlike conventional human languages, a [[formal language]] in this sense is a [[system]] of [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] for [[encoding]] and decoding [[information]]. This article specifically concerns the properties of [[Natural language|natural human language]] as it is studied in the discipline of [[linguistics]].

As an object of linguistic study, "language" has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. "[[French language|French]]". The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word ''langage'' for language as a concept, ''[[langue and parole|langue]]'' as a specific instance of a language system, and ''parole'' for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.&lt;ref name="Lyons2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="LyonsIntro"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory.&lt;ref name="TraskLanguage"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pages=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.{{sfn|Bett|2010}}

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world&amp;nbsp;– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the [[linguistic turn]] and philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.{{sfn|Devitt|Sterelny|1999}}

===Mental faculty, organ or instinct===
One definition sees language primarily as the [[mind|mental faculty]] that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the [[human brain]]. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, [[creole languages]] and spontaneously developed sign languages such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]]. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely [[innatism|innate]], for example, in [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] theory of [[Universal Grammar]], or American philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]]'s extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a [[cognitive science]] framework and in [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Fitch|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pinker|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal symbolic system===
Another definition sees language as a [[formal system]] of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed [[structural linguistics|structural systems]] consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=93}} This [[structuralism|structuralist]] view of language was first introduced by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]],&lt;ref name="Saussure"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Saussure|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of Saussure's view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is [[Noam Chomsky]], the originator of the [[generative linguistics|generative theory of grammar]], who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=130}} Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Chomsky|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in [[formal logic]], in [[formal grammar|formal]] [[theoretical linguistics|theories of grammar]], and in applied [[computational linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=93, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|1998|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and other [[formal logic]]ians.

===Tool for communication===
[[File:ASL family.jpg|right|thumb|A conversation in [[American Sign Language]]]]
Yet another definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment. [[Functional theories of grammar]] explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was "tailored" to serve the communicative needs of its users.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Van Valin|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of language is associated with the study of language in [[pragmatics|pragmatic]], [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]], and interactive frameworks, as well as in [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]]. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of [[linguistic typology]], or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of [[grammaticalization]] tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as [[J.L. Austin]], [[Paul Grice]], [[John Searle]], and [[Willard van Orman Quine|W.O. Quine]].{{sfn|Nerlich|2010|p=192}}

===Unique status of human language===
{{main|Animal language|Great ape language}}

A number of features, many of which were described by [[Charles Hockett]] and called [[Hockett's design features|design features]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |title=The Problem of Universals in Language |last=Hockett |first=Charles F. |date=1966 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110023354/http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |archive-date=10 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2013-05-11 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; set human language apart from other known systems of communication, such as those used by non-human [[Animal language|animals]].

Communication systems used by other animals such as [[Bee learning and communication|bees]] or [[great ape language|apes]] are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hockett|1960}}; {{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, human language is open-ended and [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]], meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form an infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).&lt;ref name="Trask5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one study has demonstrated that an Australian bird, the [[chestnut-crowned babbler]], is capable of using the same acoustic elements in different arrangements to create two functionally distinct vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Crane |first2=Jodie S.|last3=Savage |first3=James L.|last4=Russel |first4=Andrew F. |last5=Townsend |first5=Simon W. |date=29 June 2015 |title=Experimental Evidence for Phonemic Contrasts in a Nonhuman Vocal System |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=13|issue=6|pages=e1002171|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002171|pmid=26121619 |pmc=4488142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Southern pied babbler|pied babblers]] have demonstrated the ability to generate two functionally distinct vocalisations composed of the same sound type, which can only be distinguished by the number of repeated elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Ridley |first2=Amanda R.|last3=Townsend |first3=Simon W. |date=20 July 2017 |title=Element repetition rates encode functionally distinct information in pied babbler 'clucks' and 'purrs' |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=20 |issue=5|pages=953–60|doi=10.1007/s10071-017-1114-6|pmid=28730513|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/89798/7/WRAP-element-repetition-rates-encode-functionally-Townsend-2017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through social learning: for instance a [[bonobo]] named [[Kanzi]] learned to express itself using a set of symbolic [[lexigram]]s. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The gorilla [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] reportedly uses as many as 1000 words in [[American Sign Language]], and understands 2000 words of spoken English. There are some doubts about whether her use of signs is based on complex understanding or simple [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]]; {{harvcoltxt|Candland|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ [[grammatical categories|grammatical and semantic categories]], such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used to express exceedingly complex meanings.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"/&gt; Human language is also unique in having the property of [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursivity]]: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun phrase (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]&lt;/nowiki&gt;") or a clause can contain another clause (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[I see [the dog is running]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;").&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt; Human language is also the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as ''modality independent''. This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality, whereas [[sign language]]s and writing use the visual modality, and [[braille]] writing uses the tactile modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=165–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human language is also unique in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called ''[[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]]'', and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of [[bee]]s that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.&lt;ref name="Trask5"/&gt;

Oil on board, 1563.&lt;br&gt;Humans have speculated about the origins of language throughout history. The [[Christian mythology|Biblical myth]] of the [[Tower of Babel]] is one such account; other cultures have different stories of how language arose.&lt;ref name="Haugen"/&gt;
}}
Theories about the origin of language differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on the generative view of language pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]] see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ulbaek|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky is one prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"/&gt; He suggests that for scholars interested in the nature of language, "talk about the evolution of the language capacity is beside the point."{{sfn|Chomsky|1972|p=86}} Chomsky proposes that perhaps "some random mutation took place [...] and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}} Though cautioning against taking this story literally, Chomsky insists that "it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}}

Continuity-based theories are held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], hold the precedents to be [[animal cognition]],&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt; whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist [[Michael Tomasello]], see it as having developed from [[animal communication]] in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation.&lt;ref name="Tomasello 2008"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from [[music]], a view already espoused by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], and [[Charles Darwin]]. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]].{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=466–507}} [[Stephen R. Anderson|Stephen Anderson]] states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered&amp;nbsp;... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because language emerged in the early [[prehistory]] of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a [[larynx]] capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=250–92}}

It was mostly undisputed that pre-human [[australopithecine]]s did not have communication systems significantly different from those found in [[great ape]]s in general. However, a 2017 study on [[Origin of language#Ardipithecus ramidus|Ardipithecus ramidus]] challenges this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |pmid=28363458 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus  and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=101–21 |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago.

{{main|Linguistics|History of linguistics}}
The study of language, [[linguistics]], has been developing into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in [[India]] more than 2000 years ago, after the development of the [[Brahmi script]]. Modern linguistics is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdisciplines===
The academic study of language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, [[descriptive linguistics]] examines the grammar of single languages, [[theoretical linguistics]] develops theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, [[sociolinguistics]] studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, [[neurolinguistics]] studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, [[computational linguistics]] builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and [[historical linguistics]] relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the [[comparative method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
The formal study of language is often considered to have started in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. However, [[Sumer]]ian scribes already studied the differences between [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century AD, the French [[Port-Royal Grammar]]ians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by British [[philologist]] and expert on ancient India [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1914|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.&lt;ref name="Saussure"/&gt;

By introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|Langue-parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue''), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clarke|1990|pages=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary linguistics===
In the 1960s, [[Noam Chomsky]] formulated the [[Generative linguistics|generative theory of language]]. According to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]]; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the formal theories of the generative school, [[Functional theories of grammar|functional theories of language]] propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. [[Formal grammar|Formal theories of grammar]] seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Functional grammar analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyzes the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approaches not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate even as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formal and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation"; {{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework of [[cognitive linguistics]] interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|Cruse|2004|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological and neural architecture of language and speech==
Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=11–14, 105–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the [[genetics|genetic]] bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is [[FOXP2]], which may cause a kind of [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia|congenital language disorder]] if affected by [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fisher|Lai|Monaco|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brain===
{{main|Neurolinguistics|Language processing in the brain}}
[[File:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|Language Areas of the brain. The [[Angular Gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[Supramarginal Gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green, and the [[Primary Auditory Cortex]] is represented in pink.]] The brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref name="Lesser205"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lesser|1989|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is [[Wernicke's area]], which is in the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop [[receptive aphasia]], a condition in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax|sentence structure]]. The second area is [[Broca's area]], in the posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop [[expressive aphasia]], meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=105–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, [[word repetition]], and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|p=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[electrophysiology]] to study language processing in individuals without impairments.&lt;ref name="Lesser205"/&gt;

Spoken language relies on human physical ability to produce [[sound]], which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the [[ear drum]]. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box ([[larynx]]), and the upper vocal tract&amp;nbsp;– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of [[Segment (linguistics)|segmental and suprasegmental]] elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[phonation]] type, voice [[timbre]], and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], all of which may have effects across multiple segments.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consonant]]s and [[vowel]] segments combine to form [[syllable]]s, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. [[Acoustics|Acoustically]], these different segments are characterized by different [[formant]] structures, that are visible in a [[spectrogram]] of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; Vowels are called ''[[Close vowel|close]]'' when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel {{ipa|[i]}} (English "ee"), or ''[[open vowel|open]]'' when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel {{ipa|[a]}} (English "ah"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes, creating vowels such as {{ipa|[u]}} (English "oo"). The quality also changes depending on whether the lips are [[Roundedness|rounded]] as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that between {{ipa|[i]}} (unrounded front vowel such as English "ee") and {{ipa|[y]}} ([[rounded front vowel]] such as German "ü").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, [[alveolar ridge]], [[palate]], [[Soft palate|velum]], [[uvula]], or [[glottis]]. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by [[manner of articulation]], or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called ''[[occlusive]]'' or ''[[stop consonant|stop]]'', or different degrees of aperture creating ''[[fricative]]s'' and ''[[approximant consonant|approximants]]''. Consonants can also be either ''[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced or unvoiced]]'', depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English {{ipa|[s]}} in ''bus'' ([[sibilant|unvoiced sibilant]]) from {{ipa|[z]}} in ''buzz'' ([[Voiced alveolar sibilant#Voiced alveolar sibilant|voiced sibilant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and these are called ''[[Nasal consonant|nasals]]'' or ''[[Nasalization|nasalized]]'' sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called ''[[Lateral consonant|laterals]]'', because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called ''[[rhotics]]'') that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt;

By using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
When described as a system of [[symbolic communication]], language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[meaning (semiotics)|meanings]], and a [[code (semiotics)|code]] connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of [[semiosis]], how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called [[semiotics]]. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ancient Tamil Script.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription at [[Thanjavur]]]]
Some of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"/&gt;

The rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called [[syntax]] or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called [[semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=218–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantics===
{{main|Semantics|Semiotics|Meaning (linguistics)}}
Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.

Thus, languages must have a [[vocabulary]] of signs related to specific meaning. The English sign "dog" denotes, for example, a member of the species ''[[Canis familiaris]]''. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the [[lexicon]], and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a [[lexeme]]. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of [[Grammatical category|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages contain the semantic structure of [[predicate (grammar)|predication]]: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign [[truth value]]s to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[x [is y]]" or "[x [does y]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"/&gt;

===Sounds and symbols===

Depending on modality, language structure can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in [[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Goldsmith|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called [[phonetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"/&gt;

Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called [[phonemes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called [[minimal pair]]. In English, for example, the words ''bat'' {{ipa|[bæt]}} and ''pat'' {{ipa|[pʰæt]}} form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/p/}} differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}} (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between [[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated and non-aspirated]] pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Hindi]] do: the unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''spin'' {{ipa|[spɪn]}} and the aspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''pin'' {{ipa|[pʰɪn]}} are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called [[allophones]]), whereas in [[Mandarin Chinese]], the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words {{ipa|[pʰá]}} 'crouch' and {{ipa|[pá]}} 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).&lt;ref name="Trask214"/&gt;

All [[oral language|spoken languages]] have phonemes of at least two different categories, [[vowels]] and [[consonants]], that can be combined to form [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[pitch accent|pitch]], [[Vowel length|duration]], and [[tonal language|tone]] to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called [[suprasegmental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] and [[Pirahã language]] with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like [[Taa language#Phonology|Taa]] may have as many as 141 phonemes.&lt;ref name="Trask214"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sign language]]s, [[Phoneme#Phonemes in sign languages|the equivalent to phonemes]] (formerly called [[chereme]]s) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C. (1960). ''Sign Language Structure: An Outline of the Visual Communication Systems of the American Deaf,'' Studies in linguistics: Occasional papers (No. 8). Buffalo: Dept. of Anthropology and Linguistics, University of Buffalo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg (1965). ''A dictionary of American sign languages on linguistic principles.'' Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|pp=539–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Writing system]]s represent language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The [[Latin alphabet]] (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the [[Inuktitut]] syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In [[logographic]] scripts, each sign represents an entire word,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.

Because all languages have a very large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the [[Arabic script]]), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Coulmas|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===
{{main|Grammar}}
Grammar is the study of how meaningful elements called ''[[morpheme]]s'' within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be ''free'' or ''bound''. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called ''[[word]]s'', and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called [[affix]]es. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called ''syntax''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grammatical categories====
{{main|Grammatical category}}
Grammar can be described as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Allerton|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically [[morphosyntactic alignment|distinguishing between their relations]] to a predicate, the encoding of [[Grammatical tense|temporal]] and [[Preposition and postposition|spatial]] relations on predicates, and a system of [[grammatical person]] governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Word classes====
Languages organize their [[parts of speech]] into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as "dog" and "song", are usually called [[noun]]s. The second, which includes "run" and "sing", are called [[verb]]s. Another common category is the [[adjective]]: words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as "red" or "big". Word classes can be "open" if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively "closed" if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix, as in "noun-like"). In other languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]], the situation is the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically, verbs are used to construct [[predicate (grammar)|predicates]], while nouns are used as [[argument]]s of predicates. In a sentence such as "Sally runs", the predicate is "runs", because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally". Some verbs such as "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John". A predicate that can only take a single argument is called [[transitivity (grammar)|''intransitive'']], while a predicate that can take two arguments is called [[transitive verb|''transitive'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] like "and" that serve to join two sentences, [[article (grammar)|articles]] that introduce a noun, [[interjections]] such as "wow!", or [[ideophones]] like "splash" that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the general noun classifier for humans is ''nin'' (人), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Senft|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''san-nin no gakusei'' (三人の学生) lit. "3 human-classifier of student"&amp;nbsp;— three students
For trees, it would be:
:''san-bon no ki'' (三本の木) lit. "3 classifier-for-long-objects of tree"&amp;nbsp;— three trees

====Morphology====
In linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several [[morpheme]]s. For instance, the English word "unexpected" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes "un-", "expect" and "-ed".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aronoff|Fudeman|2011|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or [[affix]]es can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: ''[[prefix]]es'' precede the root, [[suffix]]es follow the root, and [[infix]]es are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word "run", which in the past tense is "ran". This process is called ''[[ablaut]]''. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of [[inflection]], which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of [[Morphological derivation|derivation]], which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb "sing" has the inflectional forms "singing" and "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Bauer|2003}}; {{harvcoltxt|Haspelmath|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called [[Isolating language|isolating]], or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word ''bonus'', or "good", consists of the root ''bon-'', meaning "good", and the suffix -''us'', which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and [[nominative]] case. These languages are called ''[[fusional languages]]'', because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are [[agglutinative languages]] which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is [[Turkish language|Turkish]], where for example, the word ''evlerinizden'', or "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ''ev-ler-iniz-den'' with the meanings ''house-plural-your-from''. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called [[polysynthetic languages]]. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in [[Persian language|Persian]] the single word ''nafahmidamesh'' means ''I didn't understand it'' consisting of morphemes ''na-fahm-id-am-esh'' with the meanings, "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with more complexity, in the [[Yupik language|Yupik]] word ''tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq'', which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes ''tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq'' with the meanings, "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme ''tuntu'' ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called ''[[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]''. For example, in many Indo-European languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective ''bonus'', or "good", is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example, in the [[Basque language|Basque]] phrase ''ikusi nauzu'', or "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb ''n-au-zu'' (similar to English "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the ''n''- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the – ''zu'' suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see you-did-me"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syntax====
{{main|Syntax}}
[[File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|In addition to word classes, a sentence can be analyzed in terms of grammatical functions: "The cat" is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the phrase, "on the mat" is a [[locative (case)|locative]] phrase, and "sat" is the core of the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].]]

Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as "I love you" is meaningful, but "*love you I" is not.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The prefixed asterisk * conventionally indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical, i.e. syntactically incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt; Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baker|2001|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master was cursing the slaves" mean different things, because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in [[Latin language|Latin]], both ''Dominus servos vituperabat'' and ''Servos vituperabat dominus'' mean "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because ''servos'', or "slaves", is in the [[accusative case]], showing that they are the [[Object (grammar)|grammatical object]] of the sentence, and ''dominus'', or "master", is in the [[nominative case]], showing that he is the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of [[Wh-movement|inverse word order in questions]], which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question, it becomes "Who is John talking to?", and not "John is talking to who?". The latter example may be used as a way of placing [[focus (linguistics)|special emphasis]] on "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called [[phrase]]s, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.{{sfn|Baker|2001|pp=269–70}} To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=218–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out. For example, "the cat" is one phrase, and "on the mat" is another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: "[And] on the mat, the cat sat".&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"/&gt; There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;

===Typology and universals===
{{Main|Linguistic typology|Linguistic universal}}

Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1992}};{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic [[word order]], the relative order of the [[verb]], and its constituents in a normal indicative [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. In English, the basic order is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]]: "The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)", whereas for example, the corresponding sentence in the [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian language]] [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] would be ''d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy'' (snake man bit), [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]].&lt;ref name="CroftErg"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word order type is relevant as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of [[prepositions]] or [[postpositions]]. Such correlations are called [[Linguistic universals|implicational universals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Greenberg|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]] type have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009|p=45}}; {{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1994|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses the [[Nominative–absolutive language|nominative-accusative]] word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun ''I''. Some languages, called [[Ergativity|ergative]], Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such as "I run", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of "me run". Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun "I" be used.&lt;ref name="CroftErg"/&gt; In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the [[Tripartite language|tripartite type]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages, "language universals", or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;

==Social contexts of use and transmission==
[[File:Place des Abbesse (the plaque with the je t'aime=te iubesc in 311 laguages).jpg|thumb|The [[Wall of Love]] in [[Paris]], where the phrase "I love you" is featured in 250 languages of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.travelfranceonline.com/wall-of-love-mur-des-je-taime-montmartre/|title=Wall of Love&amp;nbsp;– Mur des Je t'aime&amp;nbsp;– Montmartre|publisher=Travel France Online|accessdate = 30 November 2014|date=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on [[speech community|communities of speakers]] in which children [[language acquisition|learn language]] from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to [[communicate]] and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.&lt;ref name="Myths"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Evans|Levinson|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to [[language contact]]. The process is similar to the process of [[evolution]], where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a [[phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, languages differ from biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of [[diffusion]], as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their [[first language]] or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming [[endangered language|endangered]] as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage and meaning===
{{main|Pragmatics}}

The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called [[deixis]], which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, "I" (which designates the person speaking), "now" (which designates the moment of speaking), and "here" (which designates the position of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=54–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of "naming", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of "pronouncing someone man and wife", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called [[speech act]]s, although they can also be carried out through writing or hand signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=226–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called [[conversational implicature]]s. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring [[communicative competence]] in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=100–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
{{main|Language acquisition|Second-language acquisition|Second language|Language education}}
All healthy, [[Human development (biology)|normally developing]] human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children acquiring [[sign language|sign]] or [[oral language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bonvillian |first1=John D. |author2=Michael D. Orlansky |author3=Leslie Lazin Novack |title=Developmental milestones: Sign language acquisition and motor development |journal=Child Development |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=December 1983 |pages=1435–45 |doi=10.2307/1129806|pmid=6661942 |jstor=1129806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study. In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'', naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] called this process "an instinctive tendency to acquire an art".&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt;

First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different [[Phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]]. Around six months of age, a child will begin [[babbling]], producing the speech sounds or [[handshape]]s of the languages used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average [[vocabulary]] of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 [[word]]s. A child's first [[utterance]]s are [[Holophrasis|holophrases]] (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, he or she will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin to produce [[telegraphic speech]], or short sentences that are less [[Grammar|grammatically]] complex than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the point that it resembles adult language.&lt;ref name="OGrady-Cho"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=O'Grady |first1=William |last2=Cho |first2=Sook Whan |chapter=First language acquisition |title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=fourth |location=Boston |publisher=Bedford St. Martin's |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennison"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kennison|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies published in 2013 have indicated that unborn [[fetus]]es are capable of language acquisition to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;"First Impressions: We start to pick up words, food preferences and hand-eye coordination long before being born", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 1 (July 2015), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beth Skwarecki, "Babies Learn to Recognize Words in the Womb", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 26 August 2013 [http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2013/08/babies-learn-recognize-words-womb]&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Macaro|editor-first1=Ernesto| year=2010 | title=Continuum companion to second language acquisition|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9922-5|pages=137–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
{{see also|Culture#Language_and_culture|l1=Culture|Speech community}}
[[File:Arnold Lakhovsky Conversation.png|thumb|right|[[Arnold Lakhovsky]], ''The Conversation'' (c. 1935)]]
Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but also through having different "cultures of speaking." Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]], [[Anthropological linguistics|ethnolinguists]], and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between [[Speech community|speech communities]].&lt;ref name=Duranti2003&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Duranti|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists use the term "[[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]" to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically or socioculturally defined [[dialect]]s as well as the [[register (sociolinguistics)|jargons]] or [[style shifting|styles]] of [[subculture]]s. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Agha|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups, or between [[social class]]es, just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dixon|1972|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures, for example, have elaborate systems of "social [[deixis]]", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=311–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor", or "Your Honor", but in other languages, such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in languages of east Asia such as [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Old Javanese|Javanese]], different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"/&gt;

===Writing, literacy and technology===
{{main|Writing|Literacy}}
[[File:Winnipeg Forks - Plains Cree Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An inscription of [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] using [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], an [[abugida]] developed by Christian missionaries for Indigenous Canadian languages]]
Throughout history a number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented. These are called [[writing systems]].

The use of writing has made language even more useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and [[formal education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Olson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[4th millennium BC]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]]. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of [[cultural diffusion]]. A similar debate exists for the [[Chinese script]], which developed around 1200 BC. The [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] (including among others [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script]]s) are generally believed to have had independent origins.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"/&gt;

===Change===
{{main|Language change|Grammaticalization}}
[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The first page of the poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', written in [[Old English]] in the early medieval period (800–1100 AD). Although Old English is the direct ancestor of modern English, it is unintelligible to contemporary English speakers.]]
All languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire [[Phonological change|phonological system]]. [[Sound change]] can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or [[distinctive feature|phonetic feature]] by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be ''conditioned'' in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be ''regular'', which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be ''sporadic'', affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a [[chain shift]] in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the [[Germanic languages]] when the sound change known as [[Grimm's law]] affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *{{PIE|bʰ}} became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous *{{PIE|b}} in turn became /p/, and the previous *{{PIE|p}} became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why [[Italic languages]] such as Latin have ''p'' in words like '''''p'''ater'' and '''''p'''isces'', whereas Germanic languages, like English, have '''''f'''ather'' and '''''f'''ish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clackson|2007|pp=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin ''mea domina'' to eventually become the [[French language|French]] ''madame'' and American English ''ma'am''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as [[idiom]]s or particular constructions become [[grammaticalized]]. This frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of [[Caribbean Spanish]] the final /s/ has eroded away. Since [[Standard Spanish]] uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking the [[grammatical person|second person]] subject "you" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun ''tú''. This means that the sentence "what's your name" is ''¿como te llamas?'' {{ipa|[ˈkomo te ˈjamas]}} in Standard Spanish, but {{ipa|[ˈkomo ˈtu te ˈjama]}} in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Zentella|2002|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English "going to" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. ''I'm gonna'').

Language change may be motivated by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] towards more common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as social classes, or with [[Language ideology|ideologies]], and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact===
{{main|language contact}}
One important source of language change is contact and resulting [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] interact on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multilingualism]] is likely to have been the norm throughout [[human history]] and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the [[Nation state|ethno-national state]], monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Romaine|2001|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this may lead to the formation of [[Sprachbund|language areas]] in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the [[Balkan language area]], the [[Mesoamerican language area]], and the [[Ethiopian language area]]. Also, larger areas such as [[South Asia]], Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific [[areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aikhenvald|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including [[language convergence]], [[loanword|borrowing]], and [[relexification]] (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new [[mixed language]]s that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called [[pidgins]] occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a [[creole language]]. An example of such mixed languages is [[Tok Pisin]], the official language of [[Papua New-Guinea]], which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and [[Austronesian languages]]; others are [[Haitian Creole|Kreyòl ayisyen]], the French-based creole language spoken in [[Haiti]], and [[Michif language|Michif]], a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language [[Cree language|Cree]] and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}}; {{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Matras|Bakker|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[SIL Ethnologue]]'' defines a "living language" as "one that has at least one speaker for whom it is their first language". The exact number of known living languages varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of "language", and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and [[dialects]]. As of 2016, ''Ethnologue'' cataloged 7,097 living human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics|title = Ethnologue statistics|website = Summary by world area {{!}} Ethnologue|publisher = SIL|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ethnologue'' establishes linguistic groups based on studies of [[mutual intelligibility]], and therefore often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example, the [[Danish language]] that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutish]]) by the ''Ethnologue''.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt;

According to the ''Ethnologue'', 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers. These languages together account for 94% of the world's population, whereas 94% of the world's languages account for the remaining 6% of the global population. To the right is a table of the world's 10 most spoken languages with population estimates from the ''Ethnologue'' (2009 figures).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages and dialects===
{{main|Dialect#Dialect or language}}
[[File:Novi Sad mayor office.jpg|thumb|[[Multilingualism|Multi-lingual]] sign outside the [[mayor]]'s office in [[Novi Sad]], written in the four official languages of the city: [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian Rusyn]]]]
There is no [[Language or dialect|clear distinction]] between a language and a [[dialect]], notwithstanding a famous [[aphorism]] attributed to linguist [[Max Weinreich]] that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]".&lt;ref name="5 minute linguist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rickerson |first=E.M. |title=What's the difference between dialect and language? |url=http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |work=The Five Minute Linguist |publisher=College of Charleston |accessdate=17 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219070627/http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] are, for example, often classified as "dialects" of Chinese, even though they are more different from each other than [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is from [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. Before the [[Yugoslav civil war]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] was considered a single language with two dialects, but now [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] are considered different languages and employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive [[writing system]]s, or degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language families of the world===
{{Main|Language family|Dialectology|Historical linguistics|List of language families}}
[[File:Primary Human Language Families Map.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Principal language families of the world (and in some cases geographic groups of families). For greater detail, see ''[[:Template:Distribution of languages in the world|Distribution of languages in the world]]''.]]
The world's languages can be grouped into [[Language family|language families]] consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of [[language isolate]]s: languages that cannot be shown to be related to any other languages in the world. Among them are [[Basque language|Basque]], spoken in Europe, [[Zuni language|Zuni]] of [[New Mexico]], [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] of Mexico, [[Ainu language|Ainu]] of Japan, [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]] of [[Pakistan]], and many others.&lt;ref name="Katzner"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Katzner|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language family of the world that has the most speakers is the [[Indo-European languages]], spoken by 46% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}, "[http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/family Summary by language family]"&lt;/ref&gt; This family includes major world languages like [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the [[Eurasia]]n [[Migration Period]] (c. 400–800 AD),{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and subsequently through the [[History of colonialism|European colonial expansion]], which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the [[Americas]] and much of [[Africa]]. The [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] are spoken by 20%&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Hakka, [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Cantonese]], and hundreds of smaller languages.&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009}}; {{harvcoltxt|Brown|Ogilvie|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]] is home to a large number of language families, the largest of which is the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo language family]], which includes such languages as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Shona language|Shona]], and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; A similar number of people speak the [[Afroasiatic languages]], which include the populous [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language]], and the languages of the [[Sahara]] region, such as the [[Berber languages]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]].&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The [[Austronesian languages]] are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch from [[Madagascar]] to [[maritime Southeast Asia]] all the way to [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; It includes such languages as [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Maori language|Māori]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]], and many of the indigenous languages of [[Indonesia]] and [[Formosan languages|Taiwan]]. The Austronesian languages are considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the [[Dravidian languages]] of [[South Asia]] (among them [[Kannada language|Kannada]] [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]), the [[Turkic languages]] of Central Asia (such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] (among them [[Khmer language|Khmer]]), and [[Tai–Kadai languages]] of [[Southeast Asia]] (including [[Thai language|Thai]]).&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The areas of the world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas, [[Papua New Guinea]], [[West Africa]], and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages, though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language families include the [[Quechumaran languages|Quechumaran]], [[Arawak languages|Arawak]], and [[Tupi-Guarani languages|Tupi-Guarani]] families of South America, the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]], [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]], and [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] of [[Mesoamerica]], and the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]], [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]], and [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language families of [[North America]]. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the [[Pama-Nyungan languages|Pama-Nyungan family]], whereas New Guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.&lt;ref name="Katzner"/&gt;

===Language endangerment===
{{main|Endangered language|Language loss|Language shift|Language death|}}
[[File:Linguistic diversity.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Together, the eight countries in red contain more than 50% of the world's languages. The areas in blue are the most linguistically diverse in the world, and the locations of most of the world's endangered languages.]]
[[endangered language|Language endangerment]] occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or [[language shift|shift]] to speaking another language. [[Language loss]] occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a ''[[dead language]]''. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an ''[[extinct language]]''. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of [[globalization]] and [[neo-colonialism]], where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The more commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Moseley|2010}}: "[http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php Statistics]"&lt;/ref&gt; and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of languages by number of native speakers|top 20 languages]], those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) operates with five levels of language endangerment: "safe", "vulnerable" (not spoken by children outside the home), "definitely endangered" (not spoken by children), "severely endangered" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and "critically endangered" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often [[Speaker types|semi-speakers]]). Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common ''[[lingua franca]]'', such as English or [[Esperanto]], there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the [[tower of Babel]] in the [[Old Testament]], that linguistic diversity causes political conflict,&lt;ref name="Haugen"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Haugen|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is contradicted by the fact that many of the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav]] and [[American Civil War]], or the genocide of [[Rwanda]], whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by [[language revitalization|revitalizing]] endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted [[Language policy|specific legislation]] to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous [[speech community|speech communities]]. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into the many possible relationships, intersections and tensions between language and gender is diverse. It crosses disciplinary boundaries, and, as a bare minimum, could be said to encompass work notionally housed within [[applied linguistics]], [[linguistic anthropology]], conversation analysis, cultural studies, feminist media studies, feminist psychology, gender studies, interactional sociolinguistics, linguistics, [[mediated stylistics]], [[sociolinguistics]] and media studies. In methodological terms, there is no single approach that could be said to 'hold the field'. Discursive, poststructural, ethnomethodological, ethnographic, phenomenological, positivist and experimental approaches can all be seen in action during the study of language and gender, producing and reproducing what [[Susan Speer]] has described as 'different, and often competing, theoretical and political assumptions about the way discourse, ideology and gender identity should be conceived and understood'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Speer | first = Susan | author-link = Susan Speer | chapter = Introduction: feminism, discourse and conversation analysis | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mp4oaHvYz74C&amp;pg=PA7 | editor-last1 = Speer | editor-first1 = Susan A. | editor-link1 = Susan Speer | title = Gender talk: feminism, discourse and conversation analysis | pages = 7–8 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780415246446 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, research in this area can perhaps most usefully be divided into three main areas of study: first, there is a broad and sustained interest in the varieties of speech associated with a particular [[gender]]; second, there is a related interested in the social norms and conventions that (re)produce gendered language use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah |chapter= Language and culture | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dlzthEZGkmsC&amp;pg=PA350 | editor-last1 = Fasold | editor-first1 = Ralph W. | editor-last2 = Connor-Linton | editor-first2 = Jeff | title = An introduction to language and linguistics | pages = 343&amp;ndash;372 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780521612357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[Variety (linguistics)|variety of speech]] (or [[sociolect]]) associated with a particular gender is sometimes called a '''genderlect'''); and third, there are studies that focus on the contextually specific and locally situated ways in which gender is constructed and operationalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Attenborough | first = Frederick | author-link = Frederick T.

Prominent scholars include [[Deborah Tannen]], [[Penelope Eckert]], [[Janet Holmes (linguist)|Janet Holmes]], [[Mary Bucholtz]], [[Kira Hall]], [[Deborah Cameron (linguist)|Deborah Cameron]], and others. The 1995 edited volume ''Gender Articulated: Language and the Socially Constructed Self''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Hall | editor-first1 = Kira | editor-last2 = Bucholtz | editor-first2 = Mary | editor-link2 = Mary Bucholtz | title = Gender articulated: language and the socially constructed self | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 9781136045424 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is often referred to as a central text on language and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Holmes | editor-first1 = Janet | editor-last2 = Meyerhoff | editor-first2 = Miriam | editor-link1 = Janet Holmes | title = The handbook of language and gender | publisher = Blackwell Pub | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780631225027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies ==
In 1975 [[Robin Lakoff]] identified a "women's register", which she argued served to maintain women's (inferior) role in society.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, R. 1975"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lakoff | first = Robin | title = Language and woman's place: text and commentaries | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | origyear = 1975 | isbn = 9780195167573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakoff argued that women tend to use linguistic forms that reflect and reinforce a subordinate role. These include [[tag question]]s, [[High rising terminal|question intonation]], and "weak" [[Speech act#Classifying illocutionary speech acts|directives]], among others (see also [[#Speech practices associated with gender|Speech practices associated with gender]], below).&lt;ref name=Wolfram&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Wolfram | editor-first1 = Walt | editor-last2 = Schilling-Estes | editor-first2 = Natalie | title = American English: dialects and variation | publisher = Blackwell Pub. | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2006 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781405112666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies such as Lakoff's have been labeled the "deficit approach", since they posit that one gender is deficient in terms of the other. Descriptions of women's speech as deficient can actually be dated as far back as [[Otto Jespersen|Otto Jespersen's]] "The Woman", a chapter in his 1922 book ''Language: Its Nature and Development, and Origin.''&lt;ref name="Jespersen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jespersen | first = Otto | author-link = Otto Jespersen | chapter = The woman | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6jtXmwEACAAJ | title = Language: its nature, development, and origin | publisher = Hamlin Press | location = | origyear = 1922 | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781473302310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jespersen's idea that women's speech is deficient relative to a male norm went largely unchallenged until Lakoff's work appeared fifty years later.&lt;ref name=Wolfram/&gt;  Nevertheless, despite the political incorrectness of the chapter's language from a modern perspective, Jespersen's contributions remain relevant.  These include the prospect of language change based on social and gendered opportunity, lexical and phonological differences, and the idea of genderlects and gender roles influence language.

Not long after the publication of ''Language and Woman's Place'', other scholars began to produce studies that both challenged Lakoff's arguments and expanded the field of language and gender studies.&lt;ref name=Bucholtz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolfram/&gt; One refinement of the deficit argument is the so-called "dominance approach", which posits that gender differences in language reflect power differences in society.&lt;ref name="OBarr"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = O'Barr | first1 = William | last2 = Atkins | first2 = Bowman | chapter = 'Women's language' or 'powerless language' | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KpM_AAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Borker | editor-first1 = Ruth | editor-last2 = Furman | editor-first2 = Nelly | editor-last3 = MacConnel-Ginet | editor-first3 = Sally | title = Women and language in literature and society | pages = 93&amp;ndash;110 | publisher = Praeger | location = New York | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780030578939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennifer Coates outlines the historical range of approaches to gendered speech in her book ''Women, Men and Language''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Coates | first = Jennifer | title = Women, men and language: a sociolinguistic account of gender differences in language | publisher = Routledge | location = Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon New York, NY | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZU1ACwAAQBAJ  | year = 2016 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781317292531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She contrasts the four approaches known as the deficit, dominance, difference, and dynamic approaches.

''Deficit'' is an approach attributed to Jespersen that defines adult male language as the standard, and women's language as deficient.&lt;ref name="Jespersen" /&gt;  This approach created a dichotomy between women's language and men's language.  This triggered criticism to the approach in that highlighting issues in women's language by using men's as a benchmark.  As such, women's language was considered to have something inherently 'wrong' with it.

''Dominance'' is an approach whereby the female sex is seen as the subordinate group whose difference in style of speech results from male supremacy and also possibly an effect of patriarchy. This results in a primarily male-centered language. Scholars such as Dale Spender&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Spender | first = Dale | title = Man made language | publisher = New York University Press | location = London New York New York | year = 1998 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780863584015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Don Zimmerman and Candace West&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | chapter = Small insults: a study of interruptions in conversations between unacquainted persons | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xiliAAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Thorne | editor-first1 = Barrie | editor-last2 = Kramarae | editor-first2 = Cheris | editor-last3 = Main Henley | editor-first3 = Nancy | title = Language, gender, and society | pages = 102&amp;ndash;117 | publisher = Newbury House | location = Rowley, Massachusetts | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780883772683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subscribe to this view.

''Difference'' is an approach of equality, differentiating men and women as belonging to different 'sub-cultures' as they have been socialised to do so since childhood. This then results in the varying communicative styles of men and women. Deborah Tannen is a major advocate of this position.&lt;ref name=YJDU&gt;{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah | title = You just don't understand: women and men in conversation | publisher = Morrow | location = New York, NY | year = 1990 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=evwRw4SkF8MC | isbn = 9780060959623 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tannen compares gender differences in language to cultural differences. Comparing conversational goals, she argues that men tend to use a "report style", aiming to communicate factual information, whereas women more often use a "rapport style", which is more concerned with building and maintaining relationships.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt;

The "dynamic" or "[[social constructionist]]" approach is, as Coates describes, the most current approach to language and gender.  Instead of speech falling into a natural gendered category, the dynamic nature and multiple factors of an interaction help a socially appropriate gendered construct.  As such, West and Zimmerman describe these constructs as "[[doing gender]]" instead of the speech itself necessarily being classified in a particular category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243287001002002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; This is to say that these social constructs, while affiliated with particular genders, can be utilized by speakers as they see fit.

Scholars including Tannen and others argue that differences are pervasive across media, including face-to-face conversation,&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitzpatrick | first1 = Mary Anne | last2 = Mulac | first2 = Anthony | last3 = Dindia | first3 = Kathryn | title = Gender-preferential language use in spouse and stranger interaction | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 14 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 18&amp;ndash;39 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0261927x95141002 | date = March 1995 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927x95141002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HannahMurachver&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hannah | first1 = Annette | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | title = Gender and conversational style as predictors of conversational behavior | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 153&amp;ndash;174 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0261927x99018002002 | date = June 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927x99018002002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; written essays of primary school children,&lt;ref name="Mulac"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mulac | first1 = Anthony | last2 = Studley | first2 = Lisa B.  | last3 = Blau | first3 = Sheridan | title = The gender-linked language effect in primary and secondary students' impromptu essays | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 23 | issue = 9&amp;ndash;10 | pages = 439&amp;ndash;470 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/bf00289762 | date = November 1990 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00289762 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; email,&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = Rob | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | title = Predicting gender from electronic discourse | journal = [[British Journal of Social Psychology]] | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 193&amp;ndash;208 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1348/014466601164812 | date = June 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.1348/014466601164812 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even toilet graffiti.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Green | first = James A. | title = The writing on the stall: gender and graffiti | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 282&amp;ndash;296 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0261927X03255380 | date = September 2003 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927X03255380 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Cameron, among other scholars, argues that there are problems with both the dominance and the difference approach. Cameron notes that throughout the history of scholarship on language and gender male-associated forms have been seen as the [[Markedness|unmarked norm]] from which the female deviates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = Verbal hygiene | publisher = Routledge | location = Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9786613954404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the norm 'manager' becomes the marked form 'manageress' when referring to a female counterpart. On the other hand, Cameron argues that what the difference approach labels as different ways of using or understanding language are actually displays of differential power. Cameron suggests, "It is comforting to be told that nobody needs to 'feel awful': that there are no real conflicts, only misunderstandings. ... But the research evidence does not support the claims made by Tannen and others about the nature, the causes, and the prevalence of male-female miscommunication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = The myth of Mars and Venus: do men and women really speak different languages | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780199214471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that social differences between men's and women's roles are not clearly reflected in language use. One additional example is a study she has done on call center operators in the UK, where these operators are trained to be scripted in what they say and to perform the necessary '[[emotional labor]]' (smiling, expressive intonation, showing rapport/empathy and giving minimal responses) for their customer-callers. This emotional labor is commonly associated with the feminine domain, and the call center service workers are also typically females. However, the male workers in this call center do not orient to the covertly gendered meanings when they are tasked to perform this emotional labor. While this does not mean that the 'woman's language' is revalued, nor does this necessarily call for a feminist celebration, Cameron highlights that it is possible that with time, more men may work in this service industry, and this may lead to a subsequent "de-gendering" of this linguistic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = Styling the worker: gender and the commodification of language in the globalized service economy | journal = [[Journal of Sociolinguistics]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 323&amp;ndash;347 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9481.00119 | date = August 2000 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9481.00119 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2010/GEN144/um/CAMERON_Styling_the_Worker.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication styles are always a product of context, and as such, gender differences tend to be most pronounced in single-gender groups. One explanation for this, is that people [[Communication Accommodation Theory|accommodate]] their language towards the style of the person they are interacting with. Thus, in a mixed-gender group, gender differences tend to be less pronounced. A similarly important observation is that this accommodation is usually towards the language style, not the gender of the person. That is, a polite and empathic male will tend to be accommodated to on the basis of their being polite and empathic, rather than their being male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = Rob | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | last3 = Green | first3 = James | title = Where Is the gender in gendered language?  | journal = [[Psychological Science]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 171&amp;ndash;175 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00329 | date = March 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.00329 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Ochs argues that gender can be indexed directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ochs | first = Elinor | chapter = Indexing gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Jh59S6WIS98C&amp;pg=PA338 | editor-last1 = Duranti | editor-first1 = Alessandro | editor-last2 = Goodwin | editor-first2 = Charles | title = Rethinking context : language as an interactive phenomenon | pages = 335&amp;ndash;357 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge England New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780521422888 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct indexicality is the primary relationship between linguistics resources (such as lexicon, morphology, syntax, phonology, dialect and language) and gender. For example, the pronouns "he" and "she" directly indexes "male" and "female". However, there can be a secondary relationship between linguistic resources and gender where the linguistic resources can index certain acts, activities or stances which then indirectly index gender. In other words, these linguistic resources help constitute gender. Examples include the Japanese particles "wa" and "ze". The former directly index delicate intensity, which then indirectly indexes the female "voice" while the latter directly indexes coarse intensity, which then indirectly indexes the male "voice".

Women are generally believed to speak a better "language" than men do. This is a constant misconception, but scholars believe that no gender speaks a better language, but that each gender instead speaks its own unique language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Azizi | first = Masoud | chapter = Language and gender: Do women speak a better language? | chapterurl = https://www.academia.edu/4007491/Azizi_M._2011_._Language_and_gender_Do_women_speak_a_better_language_In_A._Shafaei_Ed._Frontiers_of_Language_and_Teaching_Vol._2_Proceedings_of_the_2011_International_Online_Language_Conference_pp._90-93_._Boca_Raton_Universal-Publishers | editor-last = Shafaei | editor-first = A. | title = Frontiers of language and teaching (Vol. 2): Proceedings of the 2011 International Online Language Conference (IOLC 2011) | pages = 90&amp;ndash;93 | publisher = Universal Publishers, BrownWalker Press | location = Boca Raton, Florida | year = 2011 | oclc = 794001605}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion has sparked further research into the study of the differences between the way men and women communicate.

=== Children's television ===
A specific area of study within the field of language and gender is the way in which it affects [[Children's television series|''children's television'']]. Mulac et al.'s "''Male/Female Language Differences and Attributional Consequences in Children's Television''" focuses on identifying differing speech patterns of male versus female characters in popular children's television programs at the time (the 1980s).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mulac | first1 = Anthony | last2 = Bradac | first2 = James J. | last3 = Karol Mann | first3 = Susan | title = Male/female language differences and attributional consequences in children's television | journal = [[Human Communication Research]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 481&amp;ndash;506 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2958.1985.tb00057.x | date = June 1985 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1985.tb00057.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data gathered by Mulac et al. comes from a two-week period in 1982 from three [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] daytime programs and three categories from [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial network programs]] (action, comedy/adventure, and commercials) that aired on Saturdays. They analyzed randomly selected interactive dialogue taken once from every ten minutes of their tapes. Mulac et al. collected data for 37 language variables, from which they determined the thirteen that showed significant differences between usage by male and female characters. Mulac et al.'s definitions of these thirteen features are as follows:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
!Vocalized Pauses
|Utterance without semantic meaning (uh, um, etc.)&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-
!Verbs

|-
!Uncertainty Verbs
|Verb phrase that shows some level of uncertainty ('I'm not sure if...', 'It might be', etc.)&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-
!Action Verbs
|Verbs that specify physical action&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-
!Present Tense Verbs
|Verb phrases in the present tense, including but not limited to habitual actions and historical present&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-
!Adverbials Begin Sentence

!Polite Forms
|Utterances that express some degree of [[politeness]]&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

The following tended to be higher in frequency for males: vocalized pauses, action verbs, present tense verbs, justifiers, subordinating conjunctions, and grammatical "errors". On the other hand, the following were found to occur more for females: total verbs, uncertainty verbs, adverbials beginning sentences, judgmental adjectives, concrete nouns, and polite forms. In addition, female characters had longer sentences on average.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another facet of Mulac et al.'s research was to gather participants' subjective ratings on characters' socio-intellectual status (high/low social status, white/blue collar, literate/illiterate, rich/poor), dynamism (aggressive/unaggressive, strong/weak, loud/soft, active/passive), and aesthetic quality (pleasing/displeasing, sweet/sour, nice/awful, beautiful/ugly), based on the transcripts from the shows' dialogue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Aubrey's 2004 study "''The Gender-Role Content of Children's Favorite Television Programs and Its Links to Their Gender-Related Perceptions''" identifies gender stereotypes in children’s television programs and evaluates the effects of these stereotypes on children’s personal [[Gender role|gender-role]] values and interpersonal attraction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aubrey | first1 = Jennifer Stevens | last2 = Harrison | first2 = Kristen | title = The gender-role content of children's favorite television programs and its links to their gender-related perceptions | journal = Media Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 111&amp;ndash;146 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1207/s1532785xmep0602_1 | date = 2004 | url = https://doi.org/10.1207/s1532785xmep0602_1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aubrey chose shows for the study based on children’s responses when asked to name their favorite television program (the top-named show was [[Rugrats]], followed by [[Doug (TV series)|Doug]]). Some of the stereotypes found in the study pertain to language/communication, but most are stereotypes or attributes of the characters such as assertiveness, aggression, emotionality, and cattiness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In regards to language, the study found that male characters were more likely to ask questions, assert opinions, and direct others than female characters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Female characters, on the other hand, were more likely to "receive or make comments about body or beauty" than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In general, Aubrey found less stereotypical content for female characters than for male, which they recognize to be a possible effect of either the higher presence of male characters or the difficulty of measuring [[Passivity (behavior)|passivity]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Speech practices associated with gender ==
Not all members of a particular sex may follow the specific gender roles that are prescribed by society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah | title = Gender and discourse | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780195101249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns in gender and communication that follow are only the norms for each gender, and not every member of the corresponding sex may fit into those patterns.

===Minimal responses===
One of the ways in which the communicative behaviors of men and women differ is in their use of minimal responses, i.e., [[paralinguistic]] features such as 'mm' and 'yeah', which is behaviour associated with collaborative language use.&lt;ref name="Carli"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Carli | first = Linda L. | title = Gender, language, and influence | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 941&amp;ndash;951 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association|APA]] via [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.941 | date = November 1990 | url = https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.941 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men generally use them less frequently than women, and when they do, it is usually to show agreement, as Don Zimmerman and Candace West's study of [[turn-taking]] in conversation indicates.&lt;ref name="ZimmWest"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Zimmerman | first1 = Don H. | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Sex roles, interruptions and silences in conversation | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VgjUyTDftkwC | editor-last1 = Thorne | editor-first1 = Barrie | editor-last2 = West | editor-first2 = Candace | title = Language and sex: difference and dominance | pages = 105&amp;ndash;129 | publisher = Newbury House Publishers | location = Rowley, Massachusetts | year = 1975 | isbn = 9780883770436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the above can be true in some contexts and situations, studies that dichotomize the communicative behavior of men and women may run the risk of over-generalization. For example, "minimal responses appearing "throughout streams of talk", such as "mm" or "yeah", may only function to display active listening and interest and are not always signs of "support work", as Fishman claims. They can—as more detailed analysis of minimal responses show—signal understanding, demonstrate agreement, indicate scepticism or a critical attitude, demand clarification or show surprise.&lt;ref name="Fishman, Pamela 1978"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fishman | first = Pamela | title = Interaction: The work women do | journal = [[Social Problems]] | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 387&amp;ndash;400 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/800091 | jstor = 800091 | date = February 1977 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/800091 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, both male and female participants in a conversation can employ these minimal responses for interactive functions, rather than gender-specific functions.

===Questions===
Men and women differ in their use of questions in conversations. For men, a question is usually a genuine request for information whereas with women it can often be a rhetorical means of engaging the other's conversational contribution or of acquiring attention from others conversationally involved, techniques associated with a collaborative approach to language use.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Barnes | first = Douglas | title = Language and learning in the classroom | journal = Journal of Curriculum Studies | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 27&amp;ndash;38 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0022027710030104  | date = 1971 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0022027710030104  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women use questions more frequently.&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd"&gt;{{cite book | last = Todd | first = Alexandra Dundas | chapter = A diagnosis of doctor-patient discourse in the prescription of contraception | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Qt4oBnGYmNcC&amp;pg=PA183 | editor-last1 = Fisher | editor-first1 = Sue | editor-last2 = Todd | editor-first2 = Alexandra Dundas | title = The social organization of doctor-patient communication | pages = 183&amp;ndash;212 | publisher = Ablex Pub. Corp | location = Norwood, New Jersey | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780893916992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study carried out by Alice Freed and Alice Greenwood in 1996 showed that there was no significant difference in the use of questions between genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freed | first1 = Alice F. | last2 = Greenwood | first2 = Alice | title = Women, men, and type of talk: What makes the difference? | journal = [[Language in Society]] | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;26 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | doi = 10.1017/S0047404500020418 | date = March 1996 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/S0047404500020418 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In writing, however, both genders use rhetorical questions as literary devices. For example, Mark Twain used them in "[[The War Prayer]]" to provoke the reader to question his actions and beliefs. Tag questions are frequently used to verify or confirm information, though in women's language they may also be used to avoid making strong statements.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, R. 1975"/&gt;

===Turn-taking===
As the work of Victoria DeFrancisco shows, female linguistic behaviour characteristically encompasses a desire to take turns in conversation with others, which is opposed to men's tendency towards centering on their own point or remaining silent when presented with such implicit offers of conversational turn-taking as are provided by [[hedge (linguistics)|hedge]]s such as "y' know" and "isn't it".&lt;ref name="DeFrancisco"&gt;{{cite journal | last = DeFrancisco | first = Victoria Leto | title = The sounds of silence: how men silence women in marital relations | journal = [[Discourse &amp; Society]] | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 413&amp;ndash;423 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0957926591002004003 | date = October 1991 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0957926591002004003 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This desire for turn-taking gives rise to complex forms of interaction in relation to the more regimented form of turn-taking commonly exhibited by men.&lt;ref name="SSJ"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sacks | first1 = Harvey | last2 = Schegloff | first2 = Emanuel A. | last3 = Jefferson | first3 = Gail | title = A simple systematics for the organization of turn-taking for conversation | journal = [[Language (journal)|Language]] | volume = 50 | issue = 4 (part 1) | pages = 696&amp;ndash;735 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.1353/lan.1974.0010 | jstor = 412243 | date = December 1974 | url = https://doi.org/10.1353/lan.1974.0010 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing the topic of conversation===
According to Bruce Dorval in his study of same-sex friend interaction, males tend to change subject more frequently than females.&lt;ref name="Dorval"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Dorval | editor-first = Bruce | title = Conversational organization and its development | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZYsoAAAAYAAJ | volume = Volume XXXVIII | publisher = Ablex | location = Norwood, New Jersey | year = 1990 | series = Advances in Discourse Processes | isbn = 9780893916633 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference may well be at the root of the conception that women chatter and talk too much. Goodwin observes that girls and women link their utterances to previous speakers and develop each other's topics, rather than introducing new topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goodwin | first = Majorie Harness | title = He-said-she-said: talk as social organization among Black children | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ESDkGWmjNiIC | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780253206183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study of young American couples and their interactions reveal that while women raise twice as many topics as men, it is the men's topics that are usually taken up and subsequently elaborated in the conversation.&lt;ref name="Fishman, Pamela 1978"/&gt;

===Self-disclosure===
{{Refimprove section |date=November 2011}}
Female tendencies toward [[self-disclosure]], i.e., sharing their problems and experiences with others, often to offer sympathy,&lt;ref name="Dindia"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dindia | first1 = Kathryn | last2 = Allen | first2 = Mike | title = Sex differences in disclosure: A meta-analysis | journal = [[Psychological Bulletin]] | volume = 112 | issue = 1 | pages = 106&amp;ndash;124 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association|APA]] via [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.106 | date = July 1992 | url = https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.106 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrasts with male tendencies to non-self disclosure and professing advice or offering a solution when confronted with another's problems.&lt;ref name=YJDU/&gt;

Self-disclosure is not simply providing information to another person. Instead, scholars define self-disclosure as sharing information with others that they would not normally know or discover. Self-disclosure involves risk and vulnerability on the part of the person sharing the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Borchers |first=Tim |title=Interpersonal communication: self-disclosure | publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon |year=1999 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120720092451/http://www.abacon.com/commstudies/interpersonal/indisclosure.html | archive-date = 20 July 2012 |url=http://www.abacon.com/commstudies/interpersonal/indisclosure.html |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to genderlect, self-disclosure is important because genderlect is defined as the differences in male and female communication. Men and women have completely different views of self-disclosure.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Developing a close relationship with another person requires a certain level of intimacy, or self-disclosure. It typically is much easier to get to know a woman than it is to get to know a man.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} It has been proven{{By whom|date=September 2013}} that women get to know someone on a more personal level and they are more likely to desire to share their feelings.

It has also been said{{By whom|date=September 2013}} that people share more via technology. The phenomenon is known as [[Computer-mediated communication|Computer Mediated Communication]], also known as CMC.  This form of communication typically involves text only messages that tend to lose their nonverbal cues.  Men and women are both more likely to self-disclose on the computer than they would be face to face.  People are more confident when using Computer Mediated Communication because communication is faceless, which makes it easier to divulge information.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Research has been conducted to examine whether self-disclosure in adult friendship differs according to gender and marital status. Sixty-seven women and fifty-three men were asked about intimate and non-intimate self-disclosure to closest same-sex friends. Disclosure to spouse among married respondents was also assessed. The intimate disclosure of married men to friends was lower than that of unmarried men, married women and unmarried women; the intimate disclosure of these last three groups was similar. Married people's non-intimate disclosure to friends was lower than that of unmarried people, regardless of gender. Married people's intimate disclosure to their spouses was high regardless of gender; in comparison, married men's intimate disclosure to their friends was low, while married women's disclosure to their friends was moderate or even as high as disclosure to their spouses. The results suggest that sex roles are not the only determinant of gender differences in disclosure to friends. Marital status appears to have an important influence on disclosure in friendship for men but not for women. It was concluded that research on gender differences in self-disclosure and friendship has neglected an important variable, that of marital status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Derlega | first1 = Valerian J. | last2 = Metts | first2 = Sandra | last3 = Petronio | first3 = Sandra  | last4 = Margulis | first4 = Stephen T.  | title = Self-disclosure | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Newbury Park | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j7m6QgAACAAJ | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780803939554 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This research goes to show that when a man is married he is less likely to have intimate self-disclosure. This could be because a man may feel he is betraying his wife's confidence by disclosing information that might be considered private. However, the research also showed that the married women didn't change much in either situation, because women tend to self disclose more than men.

Men tend to communicate differently with other men than they do with other women, while women tend to communicate the same with both men and women. "Male and female American students who differed in masculinity and in femininity self-disclosed to a same-sex stranger in contexts that made either social/expressive motives or instrumental motives salient. The results were consistent with the primary assertion that measures of sex role identity are better predictors of contextual variations in self-disclosure than is sex per se. Sex consistently failed to predict subjects' willingness to self-disclose, both within and across contexts, whereas femininity promoted self-disclosure in the context that was clearly social and expressive in character. Although masculinity failed to exert the expected facilitative impact on self-disclosure within the instrumental context, it nonetheless influenced the results; androgynous subjects, who scored high in both masculinity and femininity, were more self-revealing across contexts than was any other group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ashida | first1 = Sato | last2 = Koehly | first2 = Laura M. | last3 = Roberts | first3 = J.

Displaying strictly feminine or masculine traits will not be to one's advantage in communication, because it is important to be able to recognize and utilize these traits to be an effective communicator.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

From a social skills perspective, gender, tunic, and cultural differences in relationships may stem, in part, from differences in communication. The influence of biological sex on communication values has received scholarly attention. In general, women value affectively oriented communication skills more than men, and men value instrumentally oriented communication skills more than women, although the effect size for these differences are generally small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Anuradha | first = M. | title = Gender stereotyping in television commercials aimed at children in India | journal = Media Asia | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 209&amp;ndash;215 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/01296612.2012.11689939 | date = 2012 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/01296612.2012.11689939 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-disclosure is also very important when it comes to a close dating relationship between men and women. Successful communication in relationships is one of the greatest difficulties most couples are forced to overcome. Men in relationships with women may practice self-disclosure more often than their female partner. Self-disclosure is considered to be a key factor in facilitating intimacy. For example, American heterosexual couples were studied using various measures twice a year. By using the average scores of both partners, they found that self-disclosure was higher in those couples who remained together at the second administration of the surveys than in those who broke up between two administrations. Similarly, researchers asked heterosexual couples who had just begun dating to complete a self-disclosure measure and to answer the same questionnaire four months later. They found that couples who were still dating four months later reported greater self-disclosure at the initial contact than did those who later broke up. This test shows self-disclosure can be beneficial to facilitating a positive relationship. Self-disclosure is a process which typically begins rapidly, but then plateaus as the couple gains more information.  The initial self-disclosure is extremely important when first meeting someone. The first interactions between a potential couple could be deciding factors in the success or failure of the relationship.

Self-disclosure is difficult because not all women and men communicate the same.

===Verbal aggression===
Aggression can be defined by its three intersecting counterparts: indirect, relational and social. Indirect aggression occurs when the victim is attacked through covert and concealed attempts to cause social suffering. Examples are gossiping, exclusion or ignoring of the victim. Relational aggression, while similar to indirect, is more resolute in its attentions. It can be a threat to terminate a friendship or spreading false rumors. The third type of aggression, social aggression, "is directed toward damaging another's self-esteem, social status, or both, and may take direct forms such as verbal rejection, negative facial expressions or body movements, or more indirect forms such as slanderous rumors or social exclusion."&lt;ref name="Blake, J.

Dr. M.K. Underwood, leading researcher in child clinical psychology and developmental psychology, began using the term social aggression in several of her experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Underwood | first = M.K. | title = Speech {{!}} Keynote Speaker | url = http://www.collin.edu/conference/studentresearch/keynote.html | publisher = Collin College Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Student Research Conference  | date = 2011 | access-date = 1 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, Underwood followed 250 third-graders and their families in order to understand how anger is communicated in relationships, especially in face-to-face and behind-the-back situations. It was found that technology and electronic communication has become a key factor in social aggression. This discovery has been termed [[cyber-bullying]]. In another experiment, social aggression was used to see if verbal and nonverbal behaviors contributed to a person's social value.&lt;ref name="Blake, J. J. 2011"/&gt; It was found that those who communicated nonverbal signals were seen as angry and annoyed by their peers. In a third study, the experimenters determined that while socially aggressive students were vastly disliked, they were alleged to be the popular kids and had the highest marked social status. Most research has been based on teacher assessments, case studies and surveys.

For years, all research on aggression focused primarily on males because it was believed females were non-confrontational. Recently however, people have realized that while "boys tend to be more overtly and physically aggressive, girls are more indirectly, socially, and relationally aggressive."&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; In a study done measuring cartoon character's aggressive acts on television, these statistics were found:&lt;ref name="Luther, C. A. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luther | first1 = Catherine A. | last2 = Legg Jr. | first2 = J. Robert | title = Gender differences in depictions of social and physical aggression in children's television cartoons in the US | journal = Journal of Children &amp; Media | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 191&amp;ndash;205 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/17482791003629651 | date = 2010 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/17482791003629651 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 76.9% of physical aggression was committed by male characters
* 23.1% of physical aggression was committed by female characters
* 37.2% of social aggression was committed by male characters
* 62.8% of social aggression was committed by female characters

Physical and social aggression emerge at different points in life. Physical aggression occurs in a person's second year and continues till preschool. Toddlers use this aggression to obtain something they want that is otherwise denied or another has. In preschool, children become more socially aggressive and this progresses through adolescence and adulthood. Social aggression is not used to acquire materialistic things but to accomplish social goals.&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = Lisa H. | last2 = Underwood | first2 = Marion K. | last3 = Beron | first3 = Kurt J. | title = Peer victimization as a mediator of the relation between facial attractiveness and internalizing problems | journal = Merrill-Palmer Quarterly | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 319&amp;ndash;347 | publisher = [[Wayne State University Press]] | jstor = 23098049 | doi = 10.1353/mpq.2011.0016 | date = July 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1353/mpq.2011.0016 | ref = harv | postscript = .| pmc = 3186210 }} [https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/mpq/vol57/iss3/6/ Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in first grade, research has shown that young females are more disliked when they are socially aggressive than when young males are physically aggressive. However, until the fourth grade there is an overall negative correlation between aggression and popularity.&lt;ref name="Garandeau"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garandeau | first1 = Claire F. | last2 = Ahn | first2 = Hai-Jeong | last3 = Rodkin | first3 = Philip C. | title = The social status of aggressive students across contexts: The role of classroom status hierarchy, academicachievement, and grade | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 1699&amp;ndash;1710 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association|APA]] via [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0025271 | date = November 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1037/a0025271 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of fifth grade, aggressive children, both male and female, are more popular than their non-aggressive counterparts.  This popularity does not insinuate likeability.

In the seventh grade, social aggression seems to be at its peak. When eight-, eleven- and fifteen-year-olds were compared, there were high reports of social aggression but no apparent statistical differences between the age groups.&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"/&gt;

Several studies have shown that social aggression and high academic performance are incompatible. In classrooms with a high achievement record, researchers were less likely to find social aggression. Vice versa can be found for classrooms with a low achievement record.&lt;ref name="Garandeau" /&gt;

In adolescence, social aggression boosts female's popularity by maintaining and controlling the social hierarchy. Furthermore, males are also ranked higher in popularity if they are physically aggressive. But, if males practice relational or social aggression then they are seen as unpopular among their peers.&lt;ref name="Blake, J. J. 2011"/&gt; When it comes to different forms social aggression, males are more prone to use direct measures and females indirect.

In addition to gender, the conditions in which a child grows up in also affects the likelihood of aggression.&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"/&gt; Children raised in a divorced, never married or low-income family are more likely to show social aggression. This is speculated because of the higher rates of conflict and fighting already in the household. Parents who use an aversive style of parenting can also contribute to the social aggression in their children.&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"/&gt; Researchers venture that "perhaps children who are treated harshly by parents have a higher baseline level of anger…and may lack the opportunities to practice more direct, assertive strategies for conflict resolution so may be prone to maligning others or lashing out when they are angry."&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"/&gt;

Through the last couple decades, the media has increased its influence over America's youth. In a study done measuring the aggressive acts committed by cartoon characters on television, out of 8927 minutes of programming time 7856 aggressive acts took place. This is roughly .88 aggressive acts per minute.&lt;ref name="Luther, C. A. 2010"/&gt; Because television and cartoons are one of the main mediums for entertainment, these statistics can be troubling. If children relate to the characters, then they are more likely to commit similar acts of aggression. For teenagers, popular films and series such as ''[[Mean Girls]]'' (2004), ''[[Easy A]]'' (2010) and ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'' (2007) have shown an exaggerated, damaging view of how society works. Already, latest studies have shown an increase of social aggression in girls. Other experiments, such as one done by  [[Albert Bandura]], the [[Bobo doll experiment]], have shown similar results of society shaping your behavior because of the impact of a model.

The development of social aggression can be explained by the social identity theory and evolutionary perspective.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt;

The social identity theory categorizes people into two groups, in-groups and out-groups. You see yourself as part of the in-group and people who are dissimilar to you as part of the out-group. In middle and high school these groups are known as cliques and can have several names. In the popular 2004 teen drama ''Mean Girls'', "varsity jocks", "desperate wannabes", "over-sexed band geeks", "girls who eat their feelings", "cool Asians" and "the Plastics" were several cliques from the movie.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; Two common middle and high school cliques seen in everyday life are the popular crowd, in-group, and everyone else, out-group. The out-group has several other divisions but for the most part the in-group will categorize the out-groups all as one.

Around this time, it becomes important for a females social identity to be associated with the in-group. When a girl possess qualities that are valued in the in-group, then her social identity will increase. However, if her characteristics resemble those of the out-group, then she will be attack the out-group in order to keep her social standing within the in-group. This intergroup struggle, also known as social competition, mostly comes the in-group condemning the out-group, not the other way around.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt;

Moreover, social aggression can lead to intragroup competition. Inside the social groups there is also a hierarchal ranking, there are followers and there are leaders. When one's position in the group does not lead to positive self-identity, then the group members will feud with one another to increase status and power within the clique. Studies show that the closer a female is to her attacker, the less likely she is to forgive.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt;

Where the social identity theory explains direct social aggression, research done in the evolutionary perspective explains indirect social aggression. This aggression stemmed from "successful competition for scarce resources… and enables optimal growth and development."&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; Two tactics used are the coercive and prosocial strategies. The coercive strategies involve controlling and regulating all resources of the out-group through a monopoly. For this scheme, one must rely heavily on threats and aggression. The other strategy, prosocial, involves helping and sharing resources. This method shows complete dominance for the in-group, because in order for others to survive they must subordinate themselves to receive resources. Ability to control resources effectively results in higher-ranking in the in-group, popular crowd.

Social aggression can be detrimental for both ends of the spectrum, the out-group and in-group members. Longitudinal studies prove that aggression can lead to victims feeling lonely and socially isolated. In addition, targets report feeling depressed and affected by other health risks such as headaches, sleepiness, abdominal pain and bedwetting.&lt;ref name="Luther, C. A. 2010"/&gt; The aggressors on the other hand, were suggested to "encounter future problems in social relationships or emotional difficulties during early childhood."&lt;ref name="Luther, C. A. 2010"/&gt; In academics, victims were reported to having below average test scores and low achievement.

Studies that measure cross-gender differences show that females find social aggression to be more hurtful than males do. The results of the hurt and pain felt by female victims can be seen in all ages.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; Pre-school teachers have reported several cases of female students feeling depressed. In high school, the female victims begin to slowly isolate themselves. A year later, this seclusion has led to social phobia. Furthermore, in college, pressure and aggression from Greek life has lowered life satisfaction and increased antisocial behavior in several female students.

While social aggression has several downfalls, it has also led to a mature social competence of males and females. Being part of an in-group can increase a person's self-worth and contribute to his or her personal identity. In terms of the evolutionary perspective, being able to control definite and indefinite resources can increase a person's social competence.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; Some research argues that reports of social aggression and bullying can teach students in school what is considered unacceptable behavior. In a 1998 survey, 60% of students found that bullying "makes kids tougher."&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; However, there is additional need for support on this claim.

Since 1992, there have been nine school intervention and prevention programs, which have met the rigorous criteria of efficacy, to avert social aggression.&lt;ref name="Leff, S. R. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leff | first1 = Stephen S. | last2 = Waasdorp | first2 = Tracy Evian | last3 = Crick | first3 = Nicki R. | title = A review of existing relational aggression programs: strengths, limitations, and future directions | journal = [[School Psychology Review]] | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 508&amp;ndash;535 | publisher = [[National Association of School Psychologists|NASP]] | pmc = 3111222 | date = 2010 | url = http://www.nasponline.org/publications/periodicals/spr/volume-39/volume-39-issue-4/a-review-of-existing-relational-aggression-programs-strengths-limitations-and-future-directions | ref = harv | postscript = . | pmid=21666876}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs include Early Childhood Friendship Project (2009), You Can't Say You Can't Play (1992), I Can Problem Solve (2008), Walk Away, Ignore, Talk, Seek Help (2003), Making Choices: Social Problem Skills for Children (2005), Friend to Friend (2009), Second Step (2002), Social Aggression Prevention Program (2006), Sisters of Nia (2004).

When designing a prevention program, it is important to remember to keep the program age and gender appropriate.&lt;ref name="Leff, S. R. 2010"/&gt; For example, Early Childhood Friendship Project and You Can't Say You Can't Play have visual activities for the preschoolers and integrate puppet shows into the lesson plan. In addition, because males and females approach aggression differently there must be personalized plans to fit both genders.

However, intervention programs even with the best intentions can be harmful.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; For one, the progress of the intervention can be short lived. Studies have measured the effectiveness of intervention programs three separate times during the course of one year and no improvements were shown. Secondly, because social aggression is said to increase social identity and belonging to a group, many students have tried to disrupt the programs. A third implication is that the interventions need to study how adverse behaviors develop. Otherwise the solution might not fit the problem. Lastly, the programs must be designed to fit the needs of girls and boys and not the ones of the researchers. If the intervention program is designed to give insight for research rather than reducing and bettering aggression, then it can be detrimental to society.

Although a few forms of behavior may be sex-specific, in general they reflect patterns of power and control between the sexes, which are found in all human groups, regardless of sex composition. These modes of behaviors are perhaps more appropriately labeled 'powerlects' instead of 'genderlects'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lamb | first = Theodore A. | title = Nonverbal and paraverbal control in Dyads and Triads: sex or power differences? | journal = [[Social Psychology Quarterly]] | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 49&amp;ndash;53 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.2307/3033863 | date = March 1981 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/3033863 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Listening and attentiveness===
In a conversation, meaning does not reside in the words spoken, but it filled in by the person listening.  Each person decides if they think others are speaking in the spirit of differing status or symmetrical connection. The likelihood that individuals will tend to interpret someone else's words as one or the other depends more on the hearer's own focus, concerns, and habits than on the spirit in which the words were intended.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt;

It appears that women attach more weight than men to the importance of [[Empathy|listening]] in conversation, with its connotations of power to the listener as confidant of the speaker. This attachment of import by women to listening is inferred by women's normally lower rate of interruption &amp;mdash; i.e., disrupting the flow of conversation with a topic unrelated to the previous one&lt;ref name="PFishman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Fishman | first = Pamela | title = Interactional shitwork | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170321032801/http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/heresies2.pdf | archive-date = 21 March 2017 | url = http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/heresies2.pdf | work = [[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics]], special issue: Patterns of Communication and Space Among Women | pages = 99&amp;ndash;101 | date = May 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; and by their largely increased use of minimal responses in relation to men.&lt;ref name="ZimmWest"/&gt; Men, however, interrupt far more frequently with non-related topics, especially in the mixed sex setting and, far from rendering a female speaker's responses minimal, are apt to greet her conversational spotlights with silence, as the work of Victoria DeFrancisco demonstrates.&lt;ref name="DeFrancisco"/&gt;

When men talk, women listen and agree.  However men tend to misinterpret this agreement, which was intended in a spirit of connection, as a reflection of status and power.  A man might conclude that a woman is indecisive or insecure as a result of her listening and attempts of acknowledgment.  When in all actuality, a woman's reasons for behaving this way have nothing to do with her attitudes toward her knowledge, but are a result of her attitudes toward her relationships. The act of giving information frames the speaker with a higher status, while the act of listening frames the listener as lower.  However, when women listen to men, they are not necessarily thinking in terms of status, but in terms of connection and support.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt;

===Marriages===

Individual roles are gendered by social interaction, the media, and language. There are certain stereotypes society places on the way men and women communicate. Women are often believed to talk too much while men talk too little. Men are stereotyped to be more of a public speaker and leader, while women are stereotyped to talk more in private among their family and friends. For women, society views their use of communication as a way to express feelings and emotions. For men, society views their use of communication as a way to express power and negotiate status among other individuals.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt; There are also certain societal stereotypes about how men and women communicate within a heterosexual marriage or relationship. When a man and a women are communicating within their relationship, the traditional language roles are altered. The man becomes more passive and the woman becomes more active. A man's stereotypical silent communication style is often disappointing for women, while a woman's emotionally articulate communication style is often seen as aggravating for a man.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt; This creates the assumption that women and men have opposing communication styles, therefore creating society's cliche that men and women don't understand each other. This leads to many inter-relational quarrels because of one individual blaming the other for communicating inefficiently due to using the communication style that society has constructed according to their biological sex.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt;{{Failed verification|talk=I just don't understand|date=May 2016}}

===Dominance versus subjection===
This, in turn, suggests a dichotomy between a male desire for conversational dominance – noted by Helena Leet-Pellegrini with reference to male experts speaking more verbosely than their female counterparts – and a female aspiration to group conversational participation.&lt;ref name="Leet"&gt;{{cite book | last = Leet-Pellegrini | first = Helena M. | chapter = Conversational dominance as a function of gender and expertise | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8w1iAAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Giles | editor-first1 = Howard | editor-last2 = Robinson | editor-first2 = W. Peters | editor-last3 = Smith | editor-first3 = Philip M. | title = Language: social psychological perspectives: selected papers from the first International Conference on Social Psychology and Language held at the University of Bristol, England, July 1979 | pages = 97&amp;ndash;104 | publisher = Pergamon Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780080246963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One corollary of this is, according to Jennifer Coates, that males are afforded more attention in the context of the classroom and that this can lead to their gaining more attention in scientific and technical subjects, which in turn can lead to their achieving better success in those areas, ultimately leading to their having more power in a technocratic society.&lt;ref name="Coates93"&gt;{{cite book | last = Coates | first = Jennifer | title = Women, men and language : a sociolinguistic account of gender differences in language | publisher = Routledge | location = Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon New York, NY | year = 2016 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781315645612 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversation is not the only area where power is an important aspect of the male/female dynamic. Power is reflected in every aspect of communication from what the actual topic of the communication, to the ways in which it is communicated.  Women are typically less concerned with power more concerned with forming and maintaining relationships, whereas men are more concerned with their status. Girls and women feel it is crucial that they be liked by their peers, a form of involvement that focuses on symmetrical connection.  Boys and men feel it is crucial that they be respected by their peers, as form of involvement that focuses on asymmetrical status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah | title = I only say this because I love you | publisher = Virago | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781860499814 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences in priorities are reflected in the ways in which men and women communicate.  A woman's communication will tend to be more focused on building and maintaining relationships.  Men on the other hand, will place a higher priority on power, their communication styles will reflect their desire to maintain their status in the relationship.

According to Tannen's research, men tend to tell stories as another way to maintain their status.  Primarily, men tell jokes, or stories that focus on themselves.  Women on the other hand, are less concerned with their own power, and therefore their stories revolve not around themselves, but around others. By putting themselves on the same level as those around them, women attempt to downplay their part in their own stories, which strengthens their connections to those around them.

===Politeness===
Lakoff identified three forms of politeness: formal, deference, and camaraderie. Women's language is characterized by formal and deference politeness, whereas men's language is exemplified by camaraderie.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, R. 1975"/&gt;

Politeness in speech is described in terms of positive and negative face.&lt;ref name="Brown+Levinson"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Brown | first1 = Penelope |last2 = Levinson | first2 = Stephen | chapter = Universals in language usage: politeness phenomena | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YvFsAAAAIAAJ | editor-last = Goody | editor-first = Esther | title = Questions and politeness: strategies in social interaction | pages = 56&amp;ndash;289 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780521292504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Positive face'' refers to one's desire to be liked and admired, while ''negative face'' refers to one's wish to remain autonomous and not to suffer imposition. Both forms, according to Penelope Brown's study of the Tzeltal language, are used more frequently by women whether in mixed or single-sex pairs, suggesting for Brown a greater sensitivity in women than have men to face the needs of others.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Penelope | chapter = How and why are women more polite: some evidence from a Mayan community | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=10NbPwAACAAJ | editor-last1 = McConnell-Ginet | editor-first1 = Sally | editor-last2 = Borker | editor-first2 = Ruth | editor-last3 = Furman | editor-first3 = Nelly | title = Women and language in literature and society | pages = 111&amp;ndash;136 | publisher = Praeger | location = New York | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780275905200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, women are to all intents and purposes largely more polite than men. However, negative face politeness can be potentially viewed as weak language because of its associated [[hedge (linguistics)|hedge]]s and tag questions, a view propounded by O'Barr and Atkins (1980) in their work on courtroom interaction.&lt;ref name="OBarr"/&gt;

==Gender-specific vocabulary==
Some natural languages have intricate systems of gender-specific [[vocabulary]].

* [[Irish Sign Language]], due to single sex Deaf schools, developed separate male and female vocabularies which can still be seen today.
*  It is speculated that [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] women had a special language called ''Emesal'', distinct from the main language, ''Emegir'', which was spoken by both genders. The women's language had a distinct vocabulary, found in the records of religious rituals to be performed by women, also in the speech of goddesses in mythological texts. There has been some dispute about the role of Emesal, with suggestions by some scholars that Emegir was a dialect used by the public and more informally while Emesal was a literary language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Whittaker | first = Gordon | chapter = Linguistic anthropology and the study of Emesal as (a) women's language | chapter-url = https://www.scribd.com/document/45691958/Whittaker-Linguistic-Anthropology-and-Emesal | editor-last1 = Parpola | editor-first1 = Simo | editor-last2 = Whiting | editor-first2 = Robert M. | title = Sex and gender in the ancient Near East: proceedings of the 47th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Helsinki, July 2-6, 2001 | pages = 633&amp;ndash;644 | publisher = Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project | location = Helsinki | year = 2002 | isbn = 9789514590542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For a significant period of time in the history of the ancient [[languages of India]], after the formal language [[Sanskrit]] diverged from the popular [[Prakrit]] languages, some Sanskrit plays recorded the speech of women in Prakrit, distinct from the Sanskrit of male speakers.  This convention was also used for illiterate and low-caste male speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Halder | first = Shashwati | chapter = Prakrit |chapter-url = http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Prakrit | editor-last1 = Islam | editor-first1 = Sirajul | editor-last2 = Jamal | editor-first2 = Shashwati | title = Banglapedia: national encyclopedia of Bangladesh | publisher = [[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] | location = Dhaka | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9789845120364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Garifuna language|Garifuna]] has a vocabulary split between terms used only by men and terms used only by women. This does not however affect the entire vocabulary but when it does, the terms used by men generally come from [[Cariban languages|Carib]] and those used by women come from [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
* The indigenous Australian language [[Yanyuwa language|Yanyuwa]] has separate dialects for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kirton | first = Jean F. | chapter = Yanyuwa, a dying language | chapter-url = http://www.ethnologue.com/show_work.asp?id=21977 | editor-last = Ray | editor-first = Michael J. | title = Aboriginal language use in the Northern Territory: 5 reports: Work Papers of the Summer Institute of Linguistics | pages = 1&amp;ndash;18 | publisher = Summer Institute of Linguistics | location = Darwin | year =  1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Ancient Greek]], there is evidence for some difference between the speech of men and women, as evidenced for example in the comedies of [[Aristophanes]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
*In the [[Lakota language]], a small number of enclitics (approximately eight) differ in form based on the gender of the speaker. While many native speakers and linguists agree that certain enclitics are associated with particular genders, such usage may not be exclusive. That is, individual men sometimes use enclitics associated with women, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Trechter | first = Sarah | chapter =  Contextualizing the exotic few: gender dichotomies in Lakhota | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O5rmCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101 | editor-last1 = Bucholtz | editor-first1 = Mary | editor-last2 = Liang | editor-first2 = A.C. | editor-last3 = Sutton | editor-first3 = Laurel A. | title = Reinventing identities: the gendered self in discourse | pages = 101&amp;ndash;122 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York London | year = 1999 | isbn = 0195126297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Media Practice Model''' is a media effects model used within the area of [[mass communication]].  This model was developed by '''Jeanne R. Steele''' and '''Jane D. Brown''' in 1995, and it takes a practice perspective which means that it focuses on everyday activities and routines of [[media consumption]]. This [[theoretical]] framework was developed to better understand what drives [[teenagers]] to pick one media source over another, and what factors play a role in this decision. The Media Practice Model emphasizes the constant interaction between consumers and the media, and focuses on the [[dialectical]] aspect of this interaction, suggesting that it is the adolescents’ individual characteristics, environment and daily practices that allow the media to have stronger or weaker effects on them (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Steele, J.R., &amp; Brown, J.D. (1995). Adolescent room culture: Studying media in the context of everyday life. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 24(5), 551.  Retrieved November 30, 2010, from ABI/INFORM Global. (Document ID: 12036417)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The model was developed based on a study that progressed from 1987 through 1993, and used a variety of methods such as daily [[newspaper|journals]], in-depth [[interviews]], self-administered [[questionnaires]] and “room touring” to understand, as the Steele and Brown call it, the adolescents’ “room [[culture]].” This environment was chosen based on the facts that adolescents’ bedrooms are usually cluttered with different media materials and sources, as well as the fact that this is a place where adolescents spend a good part of their day. This is also a place that provides an intimate environment where adolescents can experiment with possible selves (Markus &amp; Nurius, 1986).&lt;ref&gt;Markus, H., &amp; Nurius, P. (1986). Possible selves. Am. Psychol. 41: 954-969&lt;/ref&gt; The Media Practice Model was based on the findings of this first study, and the incorporation of other media effects theories such as [[Selective Exposure Theory]], [[Uses and Gratifications]], [[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]], [[Cultivation theory]], and Emotional Conditioning.

== Components ==

The Media Practice Model proposed by Steele and Brown has the concepts of selection, [[interaction]] and application as the three main components, but also takes into account one’s [[Identity formation|identity]] and lived experience. [[Identity formation]] is the key component of this model and it represents the main task of adolescent formation (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). It is believed that adolescents’ sense of who they are influences their interactions with the media, and those interactions in turn influence their sense of who they are, in what Steele and Brown call an ongoing process of [[cultural]] production and reproduction. The [[theoretical]] perspective of “'''lived through experience'''” ([[Vygotsky]], 1978),&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, L.S. (1978). Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes. In M. Cole, V. John-Steiner, S. Scribner, and E. Souberman (Eds.). Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; also takes into account the [[Developmental stage theories|developmental stage]], the [[sociocultural]] differences based on gender, class, and race, as well as other factors such as [[religious beliefs]], interactions within one’s neighborhood, school, family, friends circle, and so on. This concept of “lived experience” emphasizes the idea that adolescents’ interaction with the media does not happen in a vacuum. It is argued that the continuous dialectal relationship between the other four components of the Media Practice Model, selection, interaction, application, and identity, all occur within the context of “lived experience (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).” 
	

'''Selection''', within the Media Practice Model, is simply defined as the act of choosing among media related alternatives (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). Selection is influenced by [[motivation]]s, which in turn affects [[attention]] to the media selected. In this context, the concept of motivation is defined based on previous theories such as [[Selective exposure theory|selective exposure]] and [[uses and gratifications theory]]. This means that a teenager’s motivation to attend to certain media might be based on [[affective]], [[behavioral]], [[cognitive]] and [[Instrumental value|instrumental]] needs, or it could also simply be a result of [[habituation]] (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). As far as factoring in “lived experience”, in their initial study Steele and Brown found that selection is also influenced by gender and race. Thus, boys were more likely to be more interested in media that dealt with sports, and this was also reflected in how their rooms were decorated. Also, an African-American girl was more interested in magazines and certain types of music that reflected her [[ethnic heritage]]. 
	

'''Interaction''' is defined as the [[cognitive]], [[affective]], and [[behavioral]] engagement with the media that produces [[cultural]] meanings, which are affected by adolescents’ evaluation and interpretation of the media content. In terms of practice, interaction was conceptually defined as what is actually happening at the moment adolescent use the media (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). As noted in the definition, adolescents can interact with the media on different levels such as cognitive (processing information), affective (arousal), or behavioral (dancing, channel surfing, etc.). However, researchers in communication have been more concerned with the cognitive and affective interactions, and adolescents’ evaluation and interpretation of media content are clearly more closely related to those two types of interactions.

:''Evaluation'' and ''interpretation'' of media content are also believed to play an important role in the process of [[identity formation]]. Thus, adolescents are more likely to prefer characters that they can relate to, that match with who they are or would like to become (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). In their study, Steele and Brown (1995) came across different interpretation and evaluation of the media, as teenagers were trying to make sense of the messages the media were conveying. This process of sense making is sometimes very complex, as teenagers are trying to understand themselves and the world around them by trying to balance their already formed beliefs and worldviews, with the sometimes contradictory messages of the media (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).

The concept of “lived experience” was shown to have a role in the interaction component of the model as well. As found by Steele and Brown, [[racial]] understanding, class and gender also affected how teenagers interpreted and evaluated the messages conveyed by the media.

'''Application''' is defined as the [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] ways in which adolescents use media in their everyday lives (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). The Media Practice Model looks at two different types of application: appropriation and incorporation.

:''Appropriation'' is an active, [[intentional]], easily visible and goal oriented use of the media by adolescents. Steele and Brown (1995) found some typical examples of media appropriation when it comes to teenagers: enhance a mood or cope with feelings; sort through cultural values and norms; make a statement about identity; imitate admired behavior; fantasize about possible selves or situations. ''Incorporation'', on the other hand, is harder to recognize because it is more internal, it is less visible, and most of the times happens [[unconsciously]]. Incorporation refers to taking the messages and beliefs conveyed by the media and making them a part of the [[self]], building on already existing [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[feeling]]s and [[knowledge]] (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). In trying to better explain the concept of incorporation, Steele and Brown (1995) build upon other media effects theories such as framing, cultivation, and emotional conditioning.

== Development ==
	
Based on reviewers’ critiques that the concepts of incorporation and appropriation are one and the same thing, and also based on a new study performed in 1999, Steele slightly revised this component of the Media Practice Model. Based on the study, Steele noticed that within the application component of the model, a new factor stood out: resistance. Resistance was defined as “teens’ practice of using media to open up a space for combating the status quo (Steele, 1999).” This suggests that when adolescents feel marginalized they engage with media that go against the dominant culture. This way they become fans of movies that depict drug usage, are graphically violent or show sexually explicit material, or start listening to less culturally popular genres of music such as [[hard rock]] or [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] (Steele, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Steele, J. (1999). Teenage Sexuality and Media Practice: Factoring in the Influences of Family, Friends, and School (Book). Journal of Sex Research, 36(4), 331-341. Retrieved from Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete database&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Besides contributing to the Media Practice Model through the discussed revision to the application component, Steele’s (1999) study also provided more depth to the “lived experience” component. It demonstrated more explicitly how one’s race, gender, and developmental stage plays an important role in their media practices and choices. Also, while acknowledging the importance of media content, this study puts more emphasis on media practice rather than on [[Content (media)|media content]] or [[media effects]].

Since it was first introduced by Steele and Brown in 1995, and then revised in 1999 by Steele, the Media Practice Model has been used by other researchers in different contexts; however, this model has experienced modest popularity. One of the main drawbacks of this model is its general scope and simplified description of media use. Even so, this model allows for the integration of a whole multitude of variables within its main components, and offers scholars the possibility to use it for more in-depth investigative purposes if desired.

== Around the world ==

=== Australia ===
Media is studied as a broad subject in most states in [[Australia]], with the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] being world leaders in [[curriculum]] development[http://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/about/programs/learningdev/intrnatinlisingschlsplan.pdf] {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}. Media studies in Australia was first developed as an area of study in Victorian [[University|universities]] in the early 1960s, and in [[secondary school]]s in the mid 1960s.

Today, almost all [[List of Australian Universities|Australian universities]] teach media studies. According to the [[Government of Australia]]'s "Excellence in Research for Australia" report, the leading universities in the country for media studies (which were ranked well above World standards by the report's scoring methodology) are [[Monash University]], [[Queensland University of Technology|QUT]], [[RMIT University|RMIT]], [[University of Melbourne]], [[University of Queensland]] and [[University of Technology, Sydney|UTS]].&lt;ref&gt;'' Excellence in Research for Australia'', "Section 2: Results by Field of Research Code", [[Australian Research Council]] ([[Government of Australia]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'' Excellence in Research for Australia'', "Section 4: Institutional Report" (20. Languages, Communication and Culture), [[Australian Research Council]] ([[Government of Australia]]), p286&lt;/ref&gt;

In secondary schools, an early film studies course first began being taught as part of the Victorian junior secondary curriculum during the mid 1960s. And, by the early 1970s, an expanded media studies course was being taught. The course became part of the senior secondary curriculum (later known as the [[Victorian Certificate of Education]] or "VCE") in the 1980s. It has since become, and continues to be, a strong component of the VCE. Notable figures in the development of the Victorian secondary school curriculum were the long time Rusden College media teacher Peter Greenaway (not the British film director), Trevor Barr (who authored one of the first media text books ''Reflections of Reality'') and later John Murray (who authored ''The Box in the Corner'', ''In Focus'', and ''10 Lessons in Film Appreciation'').

Today, Australian states and territories that teach media studies at a secondary level are [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[Northern Territory]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], Victoria and [[Western Australia]]. Media studies does not appear to be taught in the state of [[New South Wales]] at a secondary level.

In Victoria, the VCE media studies course is structured as: Unit 1 - Representation, Technologies of Representation, and New Media; Unit 2 - Media Production, Australian Media Organisations; Unit 3 - Narrative Texts, [[Production Planning]]; and Unit 4 - Media Process, Social Values, and Media Influence. Media studies also form a major part of the [[Primary school|primary]] and junior secondary curriculum, and includes areas such as [[photography]], [[print media]] and [[television]].

Victoria also hosts the peak media teaching body known as ATOM which publishes ''Metro'' and ''Screen Education'' magazines.

=== Canada ===

In Canada, media studies and communication studies are incorporated in the same departments and cover a wide range of approaches (from critical theory to organizations to research-creation and political economy, for example). Over time, research developed to employ theories and methods from cultural studies, philosophy, political economy, gender, sexuality and race theory, management, rhetoric, film theory, sociology, and anthropology. [[Harold Innis]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]] are famous Canadian scholars for their contributions to the fields of media ecology and political economy in the 20th century. They were both important members of the [[Toronto School of communication theory|Toronto School of Communication]] at the time. More recently, the [[School of Montreal]] and its founder [[James R. Taylor]] significantly contributed to the field of organizational communication by focusing on the ontological processes of organizations.

Carleton University and the University of Western Ontario, 1945 and 1946 prospectively, created Journalism specific programs or schools. A Journalism specific program was also created at Ryerson in 1950. The first communication programs in Canada were started at Ryerson and Concordia Universities. The Radio and Television Arts program at Ryerson were started in the 1950s, while the Film, Media Studies/Media Arts, and Photography programs also originated from programs started in the 1950s. The Communication studies department at Concordia was created in the late 1960s. Ryerson's Radio and Television, Film, Media and Photography programs were renowned by the mid 1970s, and its programs were being copied by other colleges and universities nationally and Internationally.

Today, most universities offer undergraduate degrees in Media and Communication Studies, and many Canadian scholars actively contribute to the field, among which: [[Brian Massumi]] (philosophy, cultural studies), [[Kim Sawchuk]] (cultural studies, feminist, ageing studies), [[Carrie Rentschler]] (feminist theory), and [[François Cooren]] (organizational communication).

In his book “Understanding Media, The Extensions of Man”, media theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]] suggested that [["the medium is the message"]], and that all human artefacts and technologies are media. His book introduced the usage of terms such as “media” into our language along with other precepts, among them “global village” and “Age of Information”.  A medium is anything that mediates our interaction with the world or other humans. Given this perspective, media study is not restricted to just media of communications but all forms of technology. Media and their users form an ecosystem and the study of this ecosystem is known as [[media ecology]].

McLuhan says that the “technique of fragmentation that is the essence of machine technology” shaped the restructuring of human work and association and “the essence of automation technology is the opposite”.  He uses an example of the electric light to make this connection and to explain “the medium is the message”. The electric light is pure information and it is a medium without a message unless it is used to spell out some verbal ad or a name. The characteristic of all media means the “content” of any medium is always another medium. For example, the content of writing is speech, the written word is the content of print, and print is the content of the telegraph. The change that the medium or technology introduces into human affairs is the “message”. If the electric light is used for Friday night football or to light up your desk you could argue that the content of the electric light is these activities. The fact that it is the medium that shapes and controls the form of human association and action makes it the message.  The electric light is over looked as a communication medium because it doesn’t have any content. It is not until the electric light is used to spell a brand name that it is recognized as medium. Similar to radio and other mass media electric light eliminates time and space factors in human association creating deeper involvement. McLuhan compared the “content” to a juicy piece of meat being carried by a burglar to distract the “watchdog of the mind”. The effect of the medium is made strong because it is given another media “content”. The content of a movie is a book, play or maybe even an opera.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLuhan|first1=Marshall|title=Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man|date=1964|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-262-63159-8|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan talks about media being “hot” or “cold” and touches on the principle that distinguishes them from one another. A hot medium (i.e., radio or Movie) extends a single sense in “high definition”. High definition means the state of being well filled with data. A cool medium (i.e., Telephone and TV) is considered “low definition” because a small amount of data/information is given and has to be filled in. Hot media are low in participation and cool media are high in participation. Hot media are low in participation because it is giving most of the information and it excludes. Cool media are high in participation because it gives you information but you have to fill in the blanks and it is inclusive. He used lecturing as an example for hot media and seminars as an example for low media. If you use a hot medium in a hot or cool culture makes a difference.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill"/&gt;

=== China ===

There are two universities in China that specialize in media studies. [[Communication University of China]], formerly known as the Beijing Broadcasting Institute, that dates back to 1954.  CUC has 15,307 full-time students, including 9264 undergraduates, 3512 candidates for doctor and master's degrees and 16780 students in programs of continuing education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuc.edu.cn/en2/about%20cuc.html|title=Welcome to Communication University of China|work=cuc.edu.cn|accessdate=26 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730111502/http://www.cuc.edu.cn/en2/about%20cuc.html|archivedate=30 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other university known for media studies in China is [[Zhejiang University of Media and Communications (ZUMC)]] which has campuses in Hangzhou and Tongxiang. Almost 10,000 full-time students are currently studying in over 50 programs at the 13 Colleges and Schools of ZUMC. Both institutions have produced some of China's brightest broadcasting talents for television as well as leading journalists at magazines and newspapers.

===Czech republic===

There is no university specialized on journalism and media studies, but there are seven public universities which have a department of media stuides. Three biggest are based in Prague (Charles University),  Brno (Masaryk University) and Olomouc (Palacký University). There are another nine private universities and colleges which has media studies department.

=== France ===
One prominent French media critic is the sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] who wrote among other books ''On Television'' (New Press, 1999). Bourdieu's analysis is that television provides far less autonomy, or freedom, than we think. In his view, the market (which implies the hunt for higher advertising revenue) not only imposes uniformity and banality, but also a form of invisible censorship. When, for example, television producers "pre-interview" participants in news and public affairs programs, to ensure that they will speak in simple, attention-grabbing terms, and when the search for viewers leads to an emphasis on the sensational and the spectacular, people with complex or nuanced views are not allowed a hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/08/02/reviews/980802.02sunstet.html?_r=2 Cass R. Sunstein, New York Times, ''Television, a French sociologist explains, dumbs itself down'', August 2, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===

In Germany two main branches of media theory or media studies can be identified.

The first major branch of media theory has its roots in the humanities and cultural studies, such as film studies ("Filmwissenschaft"), theater studies ("Theaterwissenschaft") and [[German studies|German language and literature studies]] ("Germanistik") as well as Comparative Literature Studies ("Komparatistik"). This branch has broadened out substantially since the 1990s. And it is on this initial basis that a culturally-based media studies (often emphasised more recently through the disciplinary title ''Medienkulturwissenschaft'') in Germany has primarily developed and established itself. 

This plurality of perspectives make it difficult to single out one particular site where this branch of Medienwissenschaft originated. While the Frankfurt-based theatre scholar, Hans-Theis Lehmanns term "post dramatic theater" points directly to the increased blending of co-presence and mediatized material in the German theater (and elsewhere) since the 1970s, the field of theater studies from the 1990s onwards at the Freie Universität Berlin, led in particular by Erika Fischer-Lichte, showed  particular interest in the ways in which theatricality influenced notions of performativity in aesthetic events. Within the field of Film Studies, again, both Frankfurt and Berlin were dominant in the development of new perspectives on moving image media. Heide Schlüpman in Frankfurt and Gertrud Koch, first in Bochum then in Berlin, were key theorists contributing to an aesthetic theory of  the cinema (Schlüpmann) as ''dispositif'' and the moving image as medium, particularly in the context of illuion (Koch). Many scholars who became known as media scholars in Germany originally were scholars of German, such as Friedrich Kittler, who taught at the Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, completed both his dissertation and habilitation in the context of ''Germanistik''. One of the early publications in this new direction is a volume edited by Helmut Kreuzer, ''Literature Studies - Media Studies'' (''Literaturwissenschaft – Medienwissenschaft''), which summarizes the presentations given at the Düsseldorfer Germanistentag 1976.

The second branch of media studies in Germany is comparable to [[Communication Studies]]. Pioneered by [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]] in the 1940s, this branch studies mass media, its institutions and its effects on society and individuals. The German [[Institute for Media and Communication Policy]], founded in 2005 by media scholar [[Lutz Hachmeister]], is one of the few independent research institutions that is dedicated to issues surrounding media and communications policies.

The term ''Wissenschaft'' cannot be translated straightforwardly as ''studies'', as it calls to mind both scientific methods and the humanities. Accordingly, German media theory combines philosophy, psychoanalysis, history, and scienctific studies with media-specific research.

''Medienwissenschaften'' is currently one of the most popular courses of study at universities in Germany, with many applicants mistakenly assuming that studying it will automatically lead to a career in TV or other media. This has led to widespread disillusionment, with students blaming the universities for offering highly theoretical course content. The universities maintain that practical journalistic training is not the aim of the academic studies they offer.&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Martin Wiarda: [http://www.zeit.de/2005/21/C-KW Medien-was?], ''Die Zeit'', 19. May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===

Media Studies is a fast growing academic field in India, with several dedicated departments and research institutes. With a view to making the best use of communication facilities for information, publicity and development, the Government of India in 1962-63 sought the advice of the Ford Foundation/UNESCO team of internationally known mass communication specialists who recommended the setting up of a national institute for training, teaching and research in mass communication. Anna University was the first university to start Master of Science in Electronic Media programmes. It offers a five-year integrated programme and a two-year programme in Electronic Media. The [http://www.annauniv.edu/MediaScience/ Department of Media Sciences] was started in January 2002, branching off from the UGC's Educational Multimedia Research Centre (EMMRC). National Institute of Open Schooling, the world's largest open schooling system, offers Mass Communication as a subject of studies at senior secondary level. All the major universities in the country have mass media and journalism studies departments. [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] (CSDS), Delhi has media studies as one of their major emphasis. [http://cis-india.org/ Centre for Internet and Society, Bangaluru] that does interdisciplinary research on internet and digital technologies also is worth mentioning.

=== Netherlands ===

In the [[Netherlands]], media studies are split into several academic courses such as [[communication studies|(applied) communication sciences]], communication- and information sciences, communication and media, media and culture or theater, film and television sciences. Whereas communication sciences focuses on the way people communicate, be it mediated or unmediated, media studies tends to narrow the communication down to just mediated communication. However, it would be a mistake to consider media studies a specialism of communication sciences, since media make up just a small portion of the overall course. Indeed, both studies tend to borrow elements from one another.

Communication sciences (or a derivative thereof) can be studied at [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]], [[Radboud University]], [[Tilburg University]], [[University of Amsterdam]], [[University of Groningen]], [[University of Twente]], [[Roosevelt Academy]], [[University of Utrecht]], [[VU University Amsterdam]] and [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]].

Media studies (or something similar) can be studied at the University of Amsterdam, VU University Amsterdam, Erasmus University Rotterdam, University of Groningen and the University of Utrecht.

=== New Zealand ===

Media studies in [[New Zealand]] is healthy, especially due to renewed activity in the country's [[Cinema of New Zealand|film industry]] and is taught at both secondary and tertiary education institutes.  Media studies in NZ can be regarded as a singular success, with the subject well-established in the tertiary sector (such as [http://www.waikato.ac.nz/film/ Screen and Media Studies] at the University of Waikato; Media Studies, Victoria University of Wellington; Film, Television and Media Studies, University of Auckland; Media Studies, Massey University; Communication Studies, University of Otago). Different Media Studies courses can offer students a range of specialisations- such as cultural studies, media theory and analysis, practical film-making, journalism and communications studies. But what makes the case of New Zealand particularly significant in respect of Media Studies is that for more than a decade it has been a nationally mandated and very popular subject in secondary (high) schools, taught across three years in a very structured and developmental fashion, with Scholarship in Media Studies available for academically gifted students. According to the New Zealand Ministry of Education Subject Enrolment figures &lt;ref&gt;NZ Ministry of Education https://educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/schooling/student-numbers/subject-enrolment&lt;/ref&gt; 229 New Zealand schools offered Media Studies as a subject  in 2016, representing more than 14,000 students.  

=== Pakistan ===

In [[Pakistan]], media studies programs are widely offered. [[University of the Punjab]] Lahore is the oldest department. Later on [[University of Karachi]], Peshawar University, [[Bahauddin Zakariya University|BZU]] Multaan, [[Islamia University, Bahawalpur|Islamia University Bahwalpur]] also started communication programs. Now, newly established universities are also offering mass communication program in which [[University of Gujrat]] emerged as a leading department. [[Bahria University|Bahria]] University which is established by [[Pakistan Navy]] is also offering BS in media studies.

=== Switzerland ===

In [[Switzerland]], media and communication studies are offered by several higher education institutions including the [[International University in Geneva]], [[Zurich University of Applied Sciences]], [[University of Lugano]], [[University of Fribourg]] and others.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the [[United Kingdom]], media studies developed in the 1960s from the academic study of [[English studies|English]], and from [[literary criticism]] more broadly. The key date, according to Andrew Crisell, is 1959:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When Joseph Trenaman left the BBC's Further Education Unit to become the first holder of the Granada Research Fellowship in Television at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]]. Soon after in 1966, the Centre for Mass Communication Research was founded at [[University of Leicester|Leicester University]], and degree programmes in media studies began to sprout at [[polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnics]] and other universities during the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="crisell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crisell|first=Andrew |year= 2002|title=An Introductory History of British Broadcasting|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 0-415-24792- 6 |pages=186–7 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[James Halloran]] at Leicester University is credited with much influence in the development of media studies and communication studies, as the head of the university's Centre for Mass Communication Research, and founder of the International Association for Media and Communication Research.&lt;ref name=mosco&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mosco|first1=Vincent|title=The Political Economy of Communication|date=9 September 2011|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=9781446204948|page=89|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V57yrDMaO9oC&amp;pg=PA89|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media Studies is now taught all over the UK. It is taught at Key Stages 1– 3, Entry Level, GCSE and at A level and the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] offers formal qualifications at a number of different levels. It is offered through a large area of exam boards including [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]] and [[Welsh Joint Education Committee|WJEC]].

Much research in the field of news media studies has been led by the [[Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism]]. Details of the research projects and results are published in the RISJ annual report.&lt;ref&gt;https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/page/annual-report&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=October 2014}}
[[Mass communication]], [[Communication studies]] or simply 'Communication' may be more popular names than “media studies” for academic departments in the United States. However, the focus of such programs sometimes excludes certain media—film, book publishing, video games, etc. The title “media studies” may be used alone, to designate film studies and rhetorical or critical theory, or it may appear in combinations like “media studies and communication” to join two fields or emphasize a different focus. It is a very broad study as media has many platforms in the modern world. Social Media is an industry that has gotten a lot of attention in recent years. Our primary form of entertainment is no longer our TVs but we have access to a screen about worldwide events all the time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[File:MIT Comparative Media Studies Writing square logo.png|150px|thumbnail|right|MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing]]
In 1999, the MIT Comparative Media Studies program started under the leadership of [[Henry Jenkins]], since growing into a graduate program, MIT's largest humanities  major, and, following a 2012 merger with the Writing and Humanistic Studies program, a roster of twenty faculty, including Pulitzer Prize-winning author [[Junot Diaz]], science fiction writer [[Joe Haldeman]], games scholar [[T. L. Taylor]], and media scholars [[William Uricchio]] (a CMS co-founder), [[Edward Schiappa]], and Heather Hendershot. Now named Comparative Media Studies/Writing, the department places an emphasis on what Jenkins and colleagues had termed "applied humanities": it hosts several research groups for civic media, [[digital humanities]], games, computational media, documentary, and mobile design, and these groups are used to provide graduate students with research assistantships to cover the cost of tuition and living expenses. The incorporation of Writing and Humanistic Studies also placed MIT's Science Writing program, Writing Across the Curriculum, and Writing and Communications Center under the same roof.

Formerly an interdisciplinary major at the University of Virginia the Department of Media Studies was officially established in 2001 and has quickly grown to wide recognition. This is partly thanks to the acquisition of Professor [[Siva Vaidhyanathan]], a cultural historian and media scholar, as well as the Inaugural Verklin Media Policy and Ethics Conference, endowed by the CEO of Canoe Ventures and UVA alumnus David Verklin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/365654-David_Verklin.php|title=David Verklin|work=broadcastingcable.com|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a group of undergraduate students in the Media Studies Department established the Movable Type Academic Journal, the first ever undergraduate academic journal of its kind. The department is expanding rapidly and doubled in size in 2011.

Brooklyn College, part of the City University of New York, has been offering graduate studies in television and media since 1961.  Currently, the Department of Television and Radio administers an MS in Media Studies, and hosts the Center for the Study of World Television.

The University of Southern California has three distinct centers for media studies:  the Center for Visual Anthropology (founded in 1984), the Institute for Media Literacy at the School of Cinematic Arts (founded in 1998) and the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism (founded in 1971).

[[University of California, Irvine]] had in [[Mark Poster]] one of the first and foremost theorists of media culture in the US, and can boast a strong Department of Film &amp; Media Studies. [[University of California, Berkeley]] has three institutional structures within which media studies can take place: the department of Film and Media (formerly Film Studies Program), including famous theorists as  Mary Ann Doane and Linda Williams, the Center for New Media, and a long established interdisciplinary program formerly titled Mass Communications, which recently changed its name to Media Studies, dropping any   connotations which accompany the term “Mass” in the former title. Until recently, [[Radford University]] in Virginia used the title "media studies" for a department that taught practitioner-oriented major concentrations in journalism, advertising, broadcast production and Web design. In 2008, those programs were combined with a previous department of communication (speech and public relations) to create a School of Communication. (A media studies major at Radford still means someone concentrating on journalism, broadcasting, advertising or Web production.)

The [[University of Denver]] has a renowned program for digital media studies. It is an interdisciplinary program combining Communications, Computer Science, and the arts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19529">The '''missing years''' in the [[Hebrew calendar]] refer to a chronological discrepancy between Talmudic chronologists for the destruction of the [[First Temple]] in 423 BCE (3338 [[Hebrew calendar|AM]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Rashi]] on [[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Avodah Zara'' 9a; [[Josephus]], ''[[Seder hadoroth]]'' year 3338 [[Anno Mundi]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the modern secular dating for it in 587 BCE.

== Destruction of the First Temple ==
{{Main|Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)}}
Both the [[Babylonian Chronicles]] and the biblical Chronicles indicate that [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] captured Jerusalem, but secular scholars have attempted to set a year when the event took place. The Babylonian Chronicles, which were published by [[Donald Wiseman]] in 1956, establish that Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem the first time on 2 Adar (16 March) 597 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Wiseman, ''Chronicles of Chaldean Kings in the British Museum'' (London: Trustees of the British Museum, 1956) 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chronicles, with the names of Jewish kings, is derived from [https://web.archive.org/web/20141030154541/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/cuneiform_nebuchadnezzar_ii.aspx British Museum – Cuneiform tablet with part of the Babylonian Chronicle (605–594 BC)], (See also [http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc5/jerusalem.html Chronicle Concerning the Early Years of Nebuchadnezzar II] Reverse, lines 11'–13')

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the seventh year (of Nebuchadnezzar, 599 BCE) in the month Chislev (Nov/Dec) the king of Babylon assembled his army, and after he had invaded the land of Hatti ([[Syro-Hittite states|northern Syria and southern Anatolia]]) he laid siege to the city of Judah. On the second day of the month of Adar (16 March) he conquered the city and took the king ([[Jeconiah]]) prisoner. He installed in his place a king ([[Zedekiah]]) of his own choice, and after he had received rich tribute, he set forth to Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;No 24 WA21946, The Babylonian Chronicles, The British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|36:6–10|HE}} says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;6 Against him ([[Jehoiakim]]) came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
8 ... and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem...
10 And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before Wiseman's publication, [[E. R. Thiele]] had determined from the biblical texts that Nebuchadnezzar's initial capture of Jerusalem occurred in the spring of 597 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). {{ISBN|0-8254-3825-X}}, 9780825438257, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; while other scholars, including [[William F. Albright]], more frequently dated the event to 598 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Strand, "Thiele's Biblical Chronology As a Corrective for Extrabiblical Dates," ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 34 (1996) 310, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the date of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|first siege of Jerusalem]] in about 597 BCE to the date of the destruction of the First Temple requires resort to biblical sources.

2 Chronicles 36:11 says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;11 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There has been some debate as to when the second siege of Jerusalem took place. Although there is no dispute that Jerusalem fell the second time in the summer month of Tammuz ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:6|HE}}), Albright dates the end of Zedekiah's reign (and the fall of Jerusalem) to 587 BCE, whereas Thiele offers 586 BCE.&lt;ref name=Thiele&gt;Edwin Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). {{ISBN|0-8254-3825-X}}, 9780825438257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiele's reckoning is based on the presentation of Zedekiah's reign on an accession basis, which was used for most but not all of the kings of Judah. In that case, the year that Zedekiah came to the throne would be his ''first'' partial year; his first full year would be 597/596 BCE, and his eleventh year, the year Jerusalem fell, would be 587/586 BCE. Since Judah's regnal years were counted from [[Tishrei]] in autumn, this would place the end of his reign and the capture of Jerusalem in the summer of 586 BCE.&lt;ref name=Thiele /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie McFall, “A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles,” ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 (1991) 45.[https://lmf12.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/transguide.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating in Seder Olam Rabbah==

=== Two-year difference within the Hebrew calendar ===
The 2nd century CE rabbinic work [[Seder Olam Rabbah]], which formed the basis of the era counting of the Hebrew calendar, interpreted the  [[prophecy of seventy weeks]] in {{bibleverse||Daniel|9:24–27|HE}} as referring to a period of 490 years, with a "week" being interpreted as a period of seven years, which would pass between the destruction of the [[First Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple]]. This is used to date the destruction of the First Temple to 423 BCE (3338 AM) – about 165 years after the current scholarly dating of the event. The discrepancy between these two dates is referred to as "missing years".

Today, Hebrew dating places the creation of the world near the end of "Year One" AM and afterwards the first year of Adam's life as "Year Two" AM. However, Seder Olam Rabba shows that the Hebrew dating originally counted the first year of Adam's life as "Year Zero" AM. This may mean that the Hebrew dating has shifted in the course of history such that traditional dating of ancient events appears two years earlier than the modern Hebrew dating would be.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Frank, ''Talmudic and Rabbinic Chronology'', 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbinic tradition&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gans]], Tzemach David (צמח דוד).&lt;/ref&gt; says that the First Temple was destroyed in "year 3338" AM and the Second Temple in "year 3828" AM. If there was no calendar shift, the Common Era equivalents would be 423 BCE and 68 CE, respectively. If there was a calendar shift, the destructions would have taken place in our years 3339 and 3829 AM, or in 3340 and 3830 AM, and the Common Era equivalents would be 422 BCE and 69 CE, respectively, or 421 BCE and 70 CE.

If there was no calendar shift, the length of the missing-years period would be 163 years (586 minus 423). If there was a calendar shift, the length of the missing-years period would be 164 or 165 years.

=== The missing years and Daniel ===
A popular explanation for the missing years suggests that the Jewish sages interpreted the prophecy in {{bibleverse||Daniel|9:24–27|HE}} as meaning that there would be 490 years from the destruction of the First Temple to the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] and, working backwards from the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] (in 3828 AM), wrongly dated the destruction of the First Temple (in 3338 AM).

A variation on this argument states that the Jews deliberately altered the dating so that the true date of the "anointed one" ([[Mashiah]]) mentioned in {{bibleverse||Daniel|9:25|HE}} would be hidden. Other apologists&lt;ref&gt;This position was proposed by Rabbi Shimon Schwab in "Comparative Jewish Chronology," in the Ateret Tzvi Jubilee Volume in honor of Rabbi Joseph Breuer (Feldheim 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; have countered with claims that the dating was indeed altered for one or another reason and should be understood as fable, not history.

These explanations come from the ambiguous meaning of the word 'week' in Hebrew, which means 'a heptad', or a group of seven. The Hebrew word for 'week' is used to refer to periods of seven days as well as seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{StrongHebrew|7620}}&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding of this number as referring to 490 years can also be found in Seder Olam. Christians also interpreted these verses as years and connect them to Jesus, although [[Rashi]]'s interpretation is such that it upholds the tradition that the anointed one in question is the Persian king Cyrus.

{{see also|Prophecy of Seventy Weeks}}

== Highlighting discrepancies ==

===Mistakes in the Hebrew or secular dating===
If traditional dates are assumed to be based on the standard Hebrew calendar, then the differing traditional and modern secular dating of events cannot both be correct. Attempts to reconcile the two systems must show one or both to have errors.

====Missing reign lengths in the Hebrew dating====
Secular scholars see the discrepancy between the traditional and secular date of the destruction of the First Temple arising as a result of Jewish sages missing out the reign lengths of several Persian kings during the Persian Empire's rule over [[Land of Israel|Israel]]. Modern secular scholars tally ten Persian kings whose combined reigns total 208 years. By contrast, ancient Jewish sages only mention four Persian kings totaling 52 years. The reigns of several Persian kings appear to be missing from the traditional calculations.

==== Missing years in Jewish tradition ====
R' [[Azariah dei Rossi]], in ''Me'or Einayim'' (c. 1573), was likely the first Jewish authority to claim that the traditional Hebrew dating is not historically precise regarding the years before the Second Temple.

R' [[Nachman Krochmal]] in ''Guide to the perplexed of our times'' (Hebrew, 1851) points to the Greek name Antigonos mentioned in the beginning of Avot as proof that there must have been a longer period to account for this sign of Hellenic influence. He posits that certain books of the Bible such as [[Ecclesiastes|Kohelet]] and [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] were written or redacted during this period.

R' [[David Zvi Hoffman]] (1843–1921) points out that the Mishna in Avot (1:4) in describing the chain of tradition uses the plural "accepted from them" even though the previous Mishna only mentions one person. He posits that there must have been another Mishna mentioning two sages that was later removed.

It has been noted that the traditional account of Jewish history shows a discontinuity in the beginning of the 35th century: The account of [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] is complete only until this time. It has been postulated that this work was written to complement another historical work, about subsequent centuries until the time of [[Hadrian]], which is no longer extant.

It appears that Jewish dating systems only arose in the 35th century, so that precise historical records would naturally have existed only from that time onwards. The Minyan Shtarot system, used to date official Jewish documents, started in the year 3449. According to Lerman's thesis, the year-count "from Creation" was established around the same time (see [[Birkat Hachama]]).

It has also been posited that certain calculations in the Talmud compute better according to the secular dating. Two possible harmonizations are proposed by modern rabbis:

* R' [[Shimon Schwab]] points to the words "seal the words and close the book" in the book of Daniel as a positive commandment to obscure the calculations for the Messiah mentioned within.  However, R' Schwab later withdrew this suggestion once it became clear that the whole basis for the dating of the [[sabbatical]] and [[jubilee (biblical)|jubilee]] years would be undermined, labeling it a mere thought experiment.
* An alternative solution suggests that the sages were concerned with the acceptance of the [[Mishna]]. There existed a Rabbinical tradition that the year 4000 marked the close of the "era of Torah". The authors of the [[Ḥakirah (journal)|Ḥakirah]] article propose that the Sages therefore arranged the chronology so that the redaction of the Mishna should coincide with that date and thus have a better chance of acceptance.

====Critiques of secular dating====
Attempts have been made to reinterpret the historical evidence to agree with the Rabbinic tradition (see ''Excursus: Rabbinic Tradition'', below), however this approach to the discrepancy is problematic. The reinterpretation of the Greek, Babylonian and Persian sources that is required to support the traditional dating has been achieved only in parts and has not yet been achieved in its entirety. Similar problems face other attempts to revise secular dating (such as those of [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]] and [[David Rohl]]) and mainstream scholarship rejects such approaches. Where and how the Gregorian or Julian calendric differential gets factored in, remains another argument entirely.

{{hidden begin|border=1px #aaa solid|title={{center|''Excursus'': '''Rabbinic Tradition'''}}}}

According to the Aramaic '''[[Scroll of Antiochus]]''', from the Second Temple's rebuilding till the 23rd year of the reign of Antiochus Eupator, son of Antiochus Epiphanes who invaded Judaea, there had transpired '''213 years''' in total. Quoting verbatim from that ancient Aramaic record:
 
בִּשׁנַת עַסרִין וּתלָת שְׁנִין לְמִמלְכֵיהּ, בִּשׁנַת מָאתַן וּתלָת עֲסַר שְׁנִין לְבִניַין בֵּית אֱלָהָא דֵיך, שַׁוִּי אַנפּוֹהִי לְמִיסַּק לִירוּשְׁלֵם

Literal translation: ''In the twenty third year of his kingdom, in the two-hundred and thirteenth year of the rebuilding of this, God's house, he (Antiochus Eupator) put his face to go up to Jerusalem.''

This timeframe is taken in conjunction with another date in the [[Seleucid Era]] counting mentioned by [[Josephus]], in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (book 12, chapter 9, section 2). Based on Josephus' record,  Antiochus Eupator began his reign after his father's death (Antiochus Epiphanes) in ''anno'' 149 of the [[Seleucid Era]] (= 162 BCE). Twenty-three years into Antiochus Eupator's reign would have then been ''anno'' 172 of the [[Seleucid Era]], or what was then 139 BCE. Since, according to the [[Megillat Antiochus|Scroll of Antiochus]], the [[Second Temple]] had already been standing 213 years, this means that the [[Second Temple]] was completed in ''anno'' '''352 BCE''', being what was then the 6th year of the reign of [[Darius I|Darius]] the king (i.e. Darius, the son of Hystaspes), the year in which the king finished its building according to Ezra 6:15. Although this date of the Temple's rebuilding largely disagrees with modern scholarship who base their chronologies upon the [[Babylonian Chronicles]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Parker &amp; Waldo H. Dubberstein, ''Babylonian Chronology 626 BC - AD 75'', Providence 1956&lt;/ref&gt; and its rebuilding in 516 BCE, it is, nonetheless, held by religious Jewish circles as being accurate and reliable, since it is founded upon a tradition passed down generation after generation. The [[Babylonian Chronicles]], however, are known to be lacking in certain regnal years ascribed to some kings, besides disagreeing in other places with the ancient Egyptian records outlining the regnal years of eight successive Persian kings, preserved in the [[Manetho|Third Book of Manetho]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Ancient Fragments'', ed. I. P. Cory, Esq., p. 65, London 1828. Manetho was the high priest and scribe of Egypt who wrote down his history for Ptolemy Philadelphus.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jewish tradition, the Second Temple stood '''420 years''',&lt;ref&gt;Tosefta (''Zevahim'' 13:6); Palestinian Talmud (''Megillah'' 18a), ''et al''.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, it was destroyed by Titus in the 2nd year of the reign of [[Vespasian]], in 68 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Questions &amp; Responsa'', ''responsum'' # 389; in other editions, ''responsum'' # 234 (Hebrew). Maimonides states explicitly this tradition, putting the destruction of the Second Temple in the lunar month Av, in the year which preceded ''anno'' 380 of the Seleucid era (i.e. 68 CE). See also ''She'harim la'luah ha'ivry'' (Gates to the Hebrew Calendar) by Rahamim Sar-Shalom, 1984 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; For a discussion of subject, see [[Seder Olam Rabbah]].

The 2nd century Jewish chronicler wrote in ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]'' (chapter 30): "Rabbi Yose says: The kingdom of Persia during the time of the Temple lasted [only] '''34 years'''." Many have misconstrued these words to mean that the author of ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]'' has contracted the entire Persian period of over 200 years into a supposed period of 34 years. According to [[Rashi|RASHI]],&lt;ref&gt;RASHI’s commentary on the Bablylonian Talmud (''Avodah Zarah'' 9a, s.v. מלכות פרס בפני הבית)&lt;/ref&gt; the 34-year Persian period must be understood in the context of their hegemony over Israel while the Second Temple stood. Meaning, 34 years is the precise timeframe between the building of the Second Temple under [[Darius I|Darius]] (I) in 352 BCE (according to Jewish calculations) and [[Alexander the Great]]'s rise to power in 318 BCE – collected altogether as 34 years of Persian hegemony over Israel while the Temple stood. This timeframe, therefore, does not signify the end of the dynasties in Persia, but rather of their rule and hegemony over Israel before [[Alexander the Great]] rose to power.

'''Modern [[rhetoric]]''' has gone through many changes since the age of ancient Rome and Greece to fit the societal demands of the time.  [[Kenneth Burke]], who is largely credited for defining the notion of modern rhetoric, described modern rhetoric as, "Rooted in an essential function of language itself, a function that is wholly realistic, and is continually born anew; the use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols."&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. A Rhetoric of Motives. London, England: University of California Press, Ltd, 1950. Print. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;   Burke’s theory of rhetoric directed attention to the division between classical and modern rhetoric.  The intervention of outside academic movements, such as structuralism, semiotics, and critical theory, made important contributions to a modern sense of rhetorical studies.

==Support and criticism==
Some critics disagree with a changing definition of rhetoric, including [[Brian Vickers]], who argued that modern rhetoric demeans classical rhetoric: "It first reduces its scope, and then applies it to purposes that it never dreamt of."&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, Brian. "The Atrophy of Modern Rhetoric, Vico to De Man." Rhetorica 6.1 (1988): 21-56. Web. 15 February 2010. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;   He also critiques Burke’s writing on modern rhetoric, saying it is, "A [rhetorical] system that rearranges the components of classical rhetoric so idiosyncratically as to be virtually unusable."&lt;ref&gt;Vickers 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
	Kenneth Burke was heavily influenced by modern social stratification and the way which symbols allow social unification and polarization, particularly in A Rhetoric of Motives.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Don. "Marxist Influences on the Rhetorical Theory of Kenneth Burke." Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric 7.4 (1974): 217-233. Web. 9 April 2010. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;   Burke sees these social changes as a social drama, acted out in rhetorical performance.  Burke also employs Freudian principles in his works on modern rhetoric. He highlights the importance of modern psychology, where identification of the audience plays a key role.  The principle of identification, as Burke explains, is the speaker appealing to the audience’s opinions and ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Burke. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;   Identification is crucial for modern rhetorical study and the principal of [[constitutive rhetoric]].

==Other influences==
A significant event, deemed the "[[linguistic turn]]," drastically changed how modern rhetoric was theorized and practiced.  The linguistic turn linked different areas of study by their common concern for symbol-systems in shaping the way humans interpret the world and create meaning.  Interpreting the world and creating meaning is the basis for Richard E. Vatz's "Myth of the Rhetorical Situation," Philosophy and Rhetoric, Summer: 1973 and The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion, Kendall Hunt, 2012, 2013.  This is a change from the traditional understanding of words being labels for ideas and concepts, to the notion of language constituting social reality.

The [[public sphere]] was studied by scholars such as [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Gerard A. Hauser]].  Jürgen Habermas described the public sphere as the sphere of private people coming together as a public that is accessible by all, to openly discuss the general rules governing society.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen. The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society. 2nd ed. The MIT Press, 1991. Print. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;   Gerard Hauser described the public sphere differently in terms of rhetoric.  Hauser explained it to be formed by the dialogue surrounding issues, emphasizing how the members of society that engage in the dialogue were the components of the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, Gerald. Vernacular Dialogue and the Rhetoricality of Public Opinion. Communication Monographs, 1998. Print. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;   The public sphere grows by attaining more members who will engage in the vernacular.  Hauser’s definition of the rhetorical public sphere still shares the notion of open debate and accessibility, assuming that the participants are actively engaged in the discourse.

==Conclusion==
Some scholars that support the notion of modern rhetoric offer normative models that differ from classical rhetoric.  Modern rhetorical study, some say, should stress two-way communication based on mutual trust and understanding to improve the speaker’s ability to persuade.&lt;ref&gt;Ede, Lisa, and [[Andrea Lunsford]]. "On Distinctions Between Classical and Modern Rhetoric." Educational Resources Information Center (1982): 1-29. Web. 17 February 2010. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;   Acknowledging that all communication and symbols are rhetorical, scholars of the field also call for a continued expansion of the objects of study, in order to improve communicative practices and bring about more egalitarian speech.

{{Literature}}
A '''novel''' is a relatively long work of [[narrative]] [[fiction]], normally in [[prose]], which is typically published as a [[book]].

The entire [[genre]] has been seen as having "a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years",&lt;ref name="The True Story of the Novel"&gt;Margaret Anne Doody, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BBYU6jyA3MUC&amp;pg=PA1 ''The True Story of the Novel'']. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1996, rept. 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;1. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; with its origins in classical [[Classical Greece|Greece]] and [[Classical Rome|Rome]], in [[medieval]] and early [[Modern history|modern]] [[Chivalric romance|romance]], and in the tradition of the Italian renaissance [[novella]]. (Since the 18th century, the term "novella", or "novelle" in German, has been used in English and other European languages to describe a long [[short story]] or a short novel.)

Murasaki Shikibu's ''[[Tale of Genji]]'' (1010) has been described as the world's first novel. Spread of printed books in China led to the appearance of [[Four Great Classical Novels|classical Chinese novels]] by the [[Ming dynasty#Literature and arts|Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644). Parallel European developments occurred after the [[Spread of the printing press|invention of the printing press]]. [[Miguel de Cervantes]], author of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (the first part of which was published in 1605), is frequently cited as the first significant European [[novelist]] of the [[modern era]].&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster 1995"&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature''.  Kathleen Kuiper, ed. 1995. Merriam-Webster, Springfield, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Watt]], in ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957), suggested that the modern novel was born in the early 18th century.

[[Walter Scott]] made a distinction between the novel, in which (as he saw it) "events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society" and the '''romance''', which he defined as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents".&lt;ref&gt;"Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p.&amp;nbsp;129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;xxv. Romance should not be confused with [[Harlequin Romance]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, many such romances, including the [[Historical novel|historical romances]] of Scott,&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning, pp.&amp;nbsp;xxv–xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''&lt;ref name="Moers, Ellen 1978"&gt;Moers, Ellen. ''Literary Women: The Great Writers''[1976] (London: The Women’s Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick] Robert McCrum, "The Hundred best novels: Moby Dick", ''The Observer'', Sunday 12 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a "kindred term". This sort of romance is in turn different from the [[genre fiction]] love romance or [[romance novel]]. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: "a novel is ''le roman'', ''der Roman'', ''il romanzo''."&lt;ref name="Doody 1996, p. 15"&gt;Doody (1996), p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining the genre==
[[File:Madame de Pompadour.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Madame de Pompadour]] spending her afternoon with a book ([[François Boucher]], 1756)]]
A novel is a long, fictional narrative which describes intimate human experiences. The novel in the [[modern era]] usually makes use of a literary prose style. The development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in [[printing]], and the introduction of cheap paper in the 15th century.

The present English (and Spanish) word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''novella'' for "new", "news", or "short story of something new", itself from the [[Latin]] ''novella'', a singular noun use of the neuter plural of ''novellus'', diminutive of ''novus'', meaning "new".&lt;ref&gt;''Britannica Online Encyclopedia'' [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110453/novel] accessed 2 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most European languages use the word "romance" (as in French, Dutch, Russian, Slovene, [[Serbo-Croatian]], Romanian, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian "roman"; Finnish "romaani"; German "Roman"; Portuguese "romance" and Italian "romanzo") for extended narratives.
* A fictional narrative
[[Fiction]]ality is most commonly cited as distinguishing novels from [[historiography]]. However this can be a problematic criterion. Throughout the [[early modern period]] authors of historical narratives would often include inventions rooted in traditional beliefs in order to embellish a passage of text or add credibility to an opinion. Historians would also invent and compose speeches for didactic purposes. Novels can, on the other hand, depict the social, political and personal realities of a place and period with clarity and detail not found in works of history.
* Literary prose
While prose rather than verse became the standard of the modern novel, the ancestors of the modern European novel include verse epics in the [[Romance languages|Romance language]] of southern France, especially those by [[Chrétien de Troyes]] (late 12th century), and in [[Middle English]] ([[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s (c. 1343 – 1400) ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Doody (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;18–3, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 19th century, fictional narratives in verse, such as [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1824), [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s ''[[Eugene Onegin|Yevgeniy Onegin]]'' (1833), and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'s ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'' (1856), competed with prose novels. [[Vikram Seth]]'s ''[[The Golden Gate (Vikram Seth novel)|The Golden Gate]]'' (1986), composed of 590 [[Onegin stanza]]s, is a more recent example of the verse novel.&lt;ref&gt;Doody (1996), p.&amp;nbsp;187.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Content: intimate experience
Both in 12th-century Japan and 15th-century Europe, prose fiction created intimate reading situations. On the other hand, verse epics, including the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Aeneid]]'', had been recited to a select audiences, though this was a more intimate experience than the performance of plays in theaters. A new world of individualistic fashion, personal views, intimate feelings, secret anxieties, "conduct", and "gallantry" spread with novels and the associated prose-romance.
* Length
The novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose fiction, followed by the [[novella]]. However, in the 17th century, critics saw the romance as of epic length and the novel as its short rival. A precise definition of the differences in length between these types of fiction, is, however, not possible.The requirement of length has been traditionally connected with the notion that a novel should encompass the "totality of life."&lt;ref&gt;[[György Lukács]] ''The Theory of the Novel. A historico-philosophical essay on the forms of great epic literature'' [first German edition 1920], transl. by Anna Bostock (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early novels==

[[File:Tosa Mitsuoki—Portrait of Murasaki Shikibu.jpg|thumb|Paper as the essential carrier: [[Murasaki Shikibu]] writing her ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' in the early 11th century, 17th-century depiction]]
Although early forms of the novel are to be found in a number of places, including [[classical Rome]], 10th– and 11th-century Japan, and [[Elizabethan England]], the European novel is often said to have begun with ''[[Don Quixote]]'' in 1605.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster 1995" /&gt;

Early works of extended fictional prose, or novels, include works in [[Latin]] like the ''[[Satyricon]]'' by [[Petronius Arbiter|Petronius]] (c. 50 AD), and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]] (c. 150 AD), works in [[Ancient Greek]] such as ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'' by [[Longus]] (c. late second century AD), works in [[Sanskrit]] such as the 6th– or 7th-century ''[[Daśakumāracarita]]'' by [[Daṇḍin]], and in the 7th-century ''[[Kadambari]]'' by [[Banabhatta]], [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s 11th-century Japanese work ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', the 12th-century ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (or ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', the 17th-century Latin title) by [[Ibn Tufail]], who wrote in [[Arabic]], the 13th-century ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'' by [[Ibn al-Nafis]], another Arabic novelist, and ''[[Blanquerna]]'', written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] by [[Ramon Llull]] (1283), and the 14th-century Chinese ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Luo Guanzhong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=Jeffrey|title=Longus: Daphnis and Chloe; Xenophon of Ephesus: Anthia and Habrocomes|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press: Loeb Classical Library|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0674996335|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murasaki Shikibu's ''[[Tale of Genji]]'' (1010) has been described as the world's first novel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581365/The-Tale-of-Genji "The Tale of Genji"]  Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Japanese''. Reischauer, Edwin O. Belknap Press.  Cambridge, MA 1980. p.&amp;nbsp;49. {{ISBN|0674471784}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and shows essentially all the qualities for which [[Madame de La Fayette|Marie de La Fayette]]'s novel ''[[La Princesse de Clèves]]'' (1678) has been praised: individuality of perception, an interest in character development, and psychological observation.&lt;ref&gt;''Identity in Asian Literature'' edited by Lisbeth Littrup. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Urbanization and the spread of printed books in [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) China led to the evolution of oral storytelling into fictional [[Four Great Classical Novels|novels]] by the [[Ming dynasty#Literature and arts|Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644). Parallel European developments did not occur until after the invention of the printing press by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in 1439, and the rise of the publishing industry over a century later allowed for similar opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/printing-press | title=Printing press &amp;#124; History &amp; Types}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, Ibn Tufail's ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan'' and Ibn al-Nafis' ''Theologus Autodidactus'' are works of didactic philosophy and theology. In this sense, ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan'' would be considered an early example of a [[philosophical novel]],&lt;ref name=Jon&gt;Jon Mcginnis, ''Classical Arabic Philosophy: An Anthology of Sources'', p.&amp;nbsp;284, [[Hackett Publishing Company]], {{ISBN missing}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Attar&gt;[[Samar Attar]], ''The Vital Roots of European Enlightenment: Ibn Tufayl's Influence on Modern Western Thought'', Lexington Books, {{ISBN missing}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Theologus Autodidactus'' would be considered an early theological novel.&lt;ref name=Meyerhof&gt;[[Muhsin Mahdi]] (1974), "''The Theologus Autodidactus of Ibn at-Nafis'' by Max Meyerhof, Joseph Schacht", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''94''' (2), pp.&amp;nbsp;232–34. {{doi|10.2307/600915}}. {{JSTOR|600915}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan'', with its story of a human outcast surviving on an island, is also likely to have influenced [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719), because the work was available in an English edition in 1711.&lt;ref&gt;''The Improvement of Human Reason, exhibited in the life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan: written in Arabic above 500 Years ago, by Abu Jaafar Ebn Tophail'' [...] ''newly translated from the original Arabick, by Simon Ockley'' (London: W. Bray, 1711).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Epic poetry]] exhibits some similarities with the novel, and the Western tradition of the novel reaches back into the field of verse epics, though again not in an unbroken tradition. The epics of Asia, such as the [[Sumer]]ian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' (1300–1000 BC), and [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] such as the ''[[Ramayana]]'' (400 BCE and 200 CE), and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (4th century BC) were as unknown in [[early modern Europe]] as was the [[Anglo-Saxon]] epic of ''[[Beowulf]]'' (c. 750–1000 AD), which was rediscovered in the late 18th century and early 19th century. Other non-European works, such as the [[Torah]], the [[Koran]], and the [[Bible]], are full of stories, and thus have also had a significant influence on the development of prose narratives, and therefore the novel. Then at the beginning of the 18th century, French prose translations brought Homer's works to a wider public, who accepted them as forerunners of the novel.

===Chivalric Romances===
{{Main|Chivalric romance}}
[[File:Chaucer Troilus frontispiece.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] reciting ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'': early-15th-century manuscript of the work at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]]]
Romance or chivalric romance is a type of [[narrative]] in [[prose]] or [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] popular in the aristocratic circles of [[High Middle Ages|High Medieval]] and [[Early Modern Europe]]. They were marvel-filled [[adventure]]s, often of a [[knight-errant]] with [[hero]]ic qualities, who undertakes a [[quest]], yet it is "the emphasis on heterosexual love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the ''[[chanson de geste]]'' and other kinds of [[epic poetry|epic]], which involve heroism."&lt;ref&gt;"Chivalric romance", in Chris Baldick, ed., ''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of [[courtly love]].

Originally, romance literature was written in [[Old French]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Occitan]], later, in [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[German language|German]]. During the early 13th century, romances were increasingly written as prose.

The shift from verse to prose dates from the early 13th century. The ''[[Lancelot-Grail|Prose Lancelot]]'' or ''Vulgate Cycle'' includes passages from that period. This collection indirectly led to [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' of the early 1470s. Prose became increasingly attractive because it enabled writers to associate popular stories with serious histories traditionally composed in prose, and could also be more easily translated.&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Caxton]]'s preface to his 1485 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with [[Irony|ironic]], [[Satire|satiric]] or [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] intent. Romances reworked [[legend]]s, [[fairy tale]]s, and history, but by about 1600 they were out of fashion, and [[Miguel de Cervantes]] famously [[burlesque]]d them in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605). Still, [[Medievalism|the modern image of medieval]] is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word "medieval" evokes knights, distressed damsels, dragons, and such tropes.&lt;ref&gt;[[C.S. Lewis]], ''[[The Discarded Image]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;9 {{ISBN|0521477352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1800, the connotations of "romance" was modified with the development [[Gothic fiction]].

===The novella===
{{Main|Novella}}

The term "novel" originates from the production of short stories, or [[novella]] that remained part of a European oral culture of storytelling into the late 19th century. Fairy tales, jokes, and humorous stories designed to make a point in a conversation, and the [[exemplum]] a priest would insert in a sermon belong into this tradition. Written collections of such stories circulated in a wide range of products from practical compilations of examples designed for the use of clerics to compilations of various stories such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]'' (1354) and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' (1386–1400). The ''[[Decameron]]'' (1354) was a compilation of one hundred [[novelle]] told by ten people—seven women and three men—fleeing the [[Black Death]] by escaping from [[Florence]] to the Fiesole hills, in 1348.

==Renaissance period: 1500–1700==
[[File:1474 Melusine Ausgabe Augsburg Johann Bämler Blatt 2.png|thumb|1474: The customer in the copyist's shop with a book he wants to have copied. This illustration of the first printed German [[Melusine]] looked back to the market of manuscripts.]]

The modern distinction between history and fiction did not exist in the early sixteenth century and the grossest improbabilities pervade many historical accounts found in the early modern print market. [[William Caxton]]'s 1485 edition of [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' (1471) was sold as a true history, though the story unfolded in a series of magical incidents and historical improbabilities. [[Sir John Mandeville]]'s ''Voyages'', written in the 14th century, but circulated in printed editions throughout the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;The [[English Short Title Catalogue|ESTC]] notes 29 editions published between 1496 and 1785 [http://estc.bl.uk/F/YMU7APITB3P8CLP4R6J16RSRKXTRGRN9HE79F36U1UPQP8QVU9-05108?func=short-sort&amp;set_number=093136&amp;sort_option=01---A02---A ESTC search result]&lt;/ref&gt; was filled with natural wonders, which were accepted as fact, like the one-footed Ethiopians who use their extremity as an umbrella against the desert sun. Both works eventually came to be viewed as works of fiction.

In the 16th and 17th centuries two factors led to the separation of history and fiction. The invention of printing immediately created a new market of comparatively cheap entertainment and knowledge in the form of [[chapbooks]]. The more elegant production of this genre by 17th- and 18th-century authors were ''[[belles lettres]]—''that is, a market that would be neither low nor academic. The second major development was the first best-seller of modern fiction, the Spanish ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'', by García Montalvo. However, it was not accepted as an example of ''belles lettres''. The ''Amadis'' eventually became the archetypical romance, in contrast with the modern novel which began to be developed in the 17th century.

===Chapbooks===
{{Main|Chapbook}}
A chapbook is an early type of [[popular literature]] printed in [[early modern Europe]]. Produced cheaply, chapbooks were commonly small, paper-covered booklets, usually printed on a single sheet folded into books of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages. They were often illustrated with crude [[woodcut]]s, which sometimes bore no relation to the text. When illustrations were included in chapbooks, they were considered [[popular prints]]. The tradition arose in the 16th century, as soon as [[printing press|printed]] books became affordable, and rose to its height during the 17th and 18th centuries and Many different kinds of [[ephemera]] and popular or folk literature were published as chapbooks, such as [[almanac]]s, [[children's literature]], [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[nursery rhyme]]s, [[pamphlet]]s, [[poetry]], and political and religious [[Tract (literature)|tracts]].&lt;ref name=mit.edu&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapbooks: Definition and Origins|url=http://web.mit.edu/21h.418/www/nhausman/chap1.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "chapbook" for this type of literature was coined in the 19th century. The corresponding French and German terms are ''[[bibliothèque bleue]]'' (blue book) and ''[[Volksbuch]]'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[chapmen]]'', chap, a variety of [[peddler]], which folks circulated such literature as part of their stock.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Margaret Spufford|last=Spufford|first=Margaret |date=1984|title= The Great Reclothing of Rural England|publisher= Hambledon Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0907628477}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Leitch, R. |date=1990|title='Here Chapman Billies Take Their Stand': A Pilot Study of Scottish Chapmen, Packmen and Pedlars|work=Proceedings of the Scottish Society of Antiquarians 120|pages= 173–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal historical subject matter of chapbooks was abridgements of ancient historians, popular medieval histories of knights, stories of comical heroes, religious legends, and collections of jests and fables.&lt;ref&gt;See Rainer Schöwerling, ''Chapbooks. Zur Literaturgeschichte des einfachen Lesers. Englische Konsumliteratur 1680–1840'' (Frankfurt, 1980), [[Margaret Spufford]], ''Small Books and Pleasant Histories. Pleasant Fiction and its Readership in Seventeenth-Century England'' (London, 1981) and Tessa Watt, ''Cheap Print and Popular Piety 1550–1640'' (Cambridge, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The new printed books reached the households of urban citizens and country merchants who visited the cities as traders. Cheap printed histories were, in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially popular among apprentices and younger urban readers of both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;See Johann Friedrich Riederer German satire on the widespread reading of novels and romances: "Satyra von den Liebes-Romanen", in: ''Die abentheuerliche Welt in einer Pickelheerings-Kappe'', vol. 2 (Nürnberg, 1718). [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1718-liebes-romane.html online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The early modern market, from the 1530s and 1540s, divided into low [[chapbooks]] and high market expensive, fashionable, elegant [[belles lettres]]. The ''[[Amadis]]'' and [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' were important publications with respect to this divide. Both books specifically addressed the new customers of popular histories, rather than readers of ''belles lettres''. The Amadis was a multi–volume fictional history of style, that aroused a debate about style and elegance as it became the first best-seller of popular fiction. On the other hand, ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'', while it adopted the form of modern popular history, in fact satirized that genre's stylistic achievements. The division, between low and high literature, became especially visible with books that appeared on both the popular and ''belles lettres'' markets in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries: low  chapbooks included abridgments of books such as [[Miguel Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605/1615)

The term "chapbook" is also in use for present-day publications, commonly short, inexpensive booklets.&lt;ref name="mit.edu"/&gt;

===Heroic romances===
{{main|Heroic romances|17th-century French literature}}
Heroic Romance is a genre of imaginative literature, which flourished in the 17th century, principally in France.

The beginnings of modern fiction in France took a pseudo-[[bucolic]] form, and the celebrated ''[[L'Astrée]]'', (1610) of [[Honore d'Urfe]] (1568–1625), which is the earliest French novel, is properly styled a [[pastoral]]. Although its action was, in the main, languid and sentimental, there was a side of the Astree which encouraged that extravagant love of glory, that spirit of " panache", which was now rising to its height in France. That spirit it was which animated [[Marin le Roy de Gomberville]] (1603–1674), who was the inventor of what have since been known as the Heroical Romances. In these there was experienced a violent recrudescence of the old medieval elements of romance, the impossible valour devoted to a pursuit of the impossible beauty, but the whole clothed in the language and feeling and atmosphere of the age in which the books were written. In order to give point to the [[chivalrous]] actions of the heroes, it was always hinted that they were well-known public characters of the day in a romantic disguise.

===Satirical romances===
[[File:Richard Head 1666.png|left|thumb|[[Richard Head]], ''The English Rogue'' (1665)]]
Stories of witty cheats were an integral part of the European novella with its tradition of [[fabliaux]]. Significant examples include ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'' (1510), ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' (1554), [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen|Grimmelshausen]]'s ''[[Der abenteuerliche Simplicissimus|Simplicissimus Teutsch]]'' (1666–1668) and in England [[Richard Head]]'s ''The English Rogue'' (1665). The tradition that developed with these titles focused on a hero and his life. The adventures led to satirical encounters with the real world with the hero either becoming the pitiable victim or the rogue who exploited the vices of those he met.

A second tradition of satirical romances can be traced back to [[Heinrich Wittenwiler]]'s ''Ring'' (c. 1410) and to [[François Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' (1532–1564), which parodied and satirized heroic romances, and did this mostly by dragging them into the low realm of the burlesque. Cervantes' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1606/1615) modified the satire of romances: its hero lost contact with reality by reading too many romances in the Amadisian tradition.

Other important works of the tradition are [[Paul Scarron]]'s ''Roman Comique'' (1651–57), the anonymous French ''Rozelli'' with its satire on Europe's religions, [[Alain-René Lesage]]'s ''[[Gil Blas]]'' (1715–1735), [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' (1742) and ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), and [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Jacques the Fatalist]]'' (1773, printed posthumously in 1796).&lt;ref&gt;Compare also: Günter Berger, ''Der komisch-satirische Roman und seine Leser. Poetik, Funktion und Rezeption einer niederen Gattung im Frankreich des 17. Jahrhunderts'' (Heidelberg: Carl Winter Universitätsverlag, 1984), Ellen Turner Gutiérrez ''The reception of the picaresque in the French, English, and German traditions'' (P. Lang, 1995), and Frank Palmeri, ''Satire, History, Novel: Narrative Forms, 1665–1815'' (University of Delaware Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Histories===
[[File:1719-heathcot-robinson-crusoe.png|thumb|1719 newspaper reprint of ''Robinson Crusoe'']]
A market of literature in the modern sense of the word, that is a separate market for fiction and poetry, did not exist until the late seventeenth century. All books were sold under the rubric of "History and politicks" in the early 18th century, including [[pamphlet]]s, [[memoir]]s, [[travel literature]], political analysis, serious histories, romances, poetry, and novels.

That fictional histories shared the same space with academic histories and modern journalism had been criticized by historians since the end of the Middle Ages: fictions were "lies" and therefore hardly justifiable at all. The climate, however, changed in the 1670s.

The romance format of the quasi–historical works of [[Madame d'Aulnoy]], [[César Vichard de Saint-Réal]],&lt;ref&gt;See his ''Dom Carlos, nouvelle histoire'' (Amsterdam, 1672) and the recent dissertation by Chantal Carasco, ''Saint-Réal, romancier de l'histoire: une cohérence esthéthique et morale'' (Nantes, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras]],&lt;ref&gt;Jean Lombard, ''Courtilz de Sandras et la crise du roman à la fin du Grand Siècle'' (Paris: PUF, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer]], allowed the publication of histories that dared not risk an unambiguous assertion of their truth. The literary market-place of the late 17th and early 18th century employed a simple pattern of options whereby fictions could reach out into the sphere of true histories. This permitted its authors to claim they had published fiction, not truth, if they ever faced allegations of libel.

Prefaces and title pages of 17th– and early 18th-century fiction acknowledged this pattern: histories could claim to be romances, but threaten to relate true events, as in the ''[[Roman à clef]]''. Other works could, conversely, claim to be factual histories, yet earn the suspicion that they were wholly invented. A further differentiation was made between private and public history: [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' was, within this pattern, neither a "romance" nor a "novel". It smelled of romance, yet the preface stated that it should most certainly be read as a true private history.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Defoe, [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1719-robinson-crusoe/p-iii.html ''Robinson Crusoe''] (London: W. Taylor, 1719)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cervantes and the modern novel===
{{See also|Picaresque novel}}

The rise of the novel as an alternative to the romance began with the publication of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]' ''[[Novelas ejemplares|Novelas Exemplares]]'' (1613). It continued with [[Paul Scarron|Scarron]]'s ''Roman Comique'' (the first part of which appeared in 1651), whose heroes noted the rivalry between French romances and the new Spanish genre.&lt;ref&gt;See Paul Scarron, ''The Comical Romance'', Chapter XXI. "Which perhaps will not be found very Entertaining" (London, 1700) with its call for the new genre. [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/library/e-1700-0002.html#c21 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 17th-century critics looked back on the history of prose fiction, proud of the generic shift that had taken place, leading towards the modern novel/novella.&lt;ref&gt;See [Du Sieur,] "Sentimens sur l'histoire" in: ''Sentimens sur les lettres et sur l'histoire, avec des scruples sur le stile'' (Paris: C. Blageart, 1680) [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1683-1712-novels.html online edition] and Camille Esmein's ''Poétiques du roman. Scudéry, Huet, Du Plaisir et autres textes théoriques et critiques du XVIIe siècle sur le genre romanesque'' (Paris, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The first perfect works in French were those of Scarron and [[Madame de La Fayette]]'s "Spanish history" ''Zayde'' (1670). The development finally led to her ''[[La Princesse de Clèves|Princesse de Clèves]]'' (1678), the first novel with what would become characteristic French subject matter.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Europe witnessed the generic shift in the titles of works in French published in Holland, which supplied the international market and English publishers exploited the novel/romance controversy in the 1670s and 1680s.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Robert Letellier|Robert Ignatius Letellier]], ''The English novel, 1660–1700: an annotated bibliography'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary critics listed the advantages of the new genre: brevity, a lack of ambition to produce epic poetry in prose; the style was fresh and plain; the focus was on modern life, and on heroes who were neither good nor bad.&lt;ref&gt;See the preface to ''The Secret History of Queen Zarah'' (Albigion, 1705)– the English version of Abbe Bellegarde, "Lettre à une Dame de la Cour, qui lui avoit demandé quelques Reflexions sur l'Histoire" in: ''Lettres curieuses de littérature et de morale'' (La Haye: Adrian Moetjens, 1702) [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1683-1712-novels.html online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; The novel's potential to become the medium of urban gossip and scandal fuelled the rise of the novel/novella. Stories were offered as allegedly true recent histories, not for the sake of scandal but strictly for the moral lessons they gave. To prove this, fictionalized names were used with the true names in a separate key. The ''[[Mercure Gallant]]'' set the fashion in the 1670s.&lt;ref&gt;DeJean, Joan. ''The Essence of Style: How the French Invented Fashion, Fine Food, Chic Cafés, Style, Sophistication, and Glamour'' (New York: Free Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Collections of letters and memoirs appeared, and were filled with the intriguing new subject matter and the [[epistolary novel]] grew from this and led to the first full blown example of scandalous fiction in [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'' (1684/ 1685/ 1687). Before the rise of the literary novel, reading novels had only been a form of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, William B.

However, one of the earliest English novels, [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719), has elements of the romance, unlike these novels, because of its exotic setting and story of survival in isolation. ''Crusoe'' lacks almost all of the elements found in these new novels: wit, a fast narration evolving around a group of young fashionable urban heroes, along with their intrigues, a scandalous moral, gallant talk to be imitated, and a brief, conciseness plot.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The new developments did, however, lead to [[Eliza Haywood]]'s epic length novel, ''Love in Excess'' (1719/20) and to [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1741).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Some literary historians date the beginning of the English novel with Richardson's ''Pamela'', rather than ''Crusoe.''&lt;ref name="asj.upd.edu.ph"&gt;Cevasco, George A.

==18th century novels==
{{main|Augustan prose}}

The idea of the "rise of the novel" in the 18th century is especially associated with [[Ian Watt]]'s influential study ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957).&lt;ref&gt;Ian Watt's, ''The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding'' (London, 1957).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2018}} In Watt's conception, a rise in fictional realism during the 18th century came to distinguish the novel from earlier prose narratives.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise of the Novel'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1963), p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1769 Laurence Sterne Tristram Shandy v6 p70.jpg|thumb|[[Laurence Sterne]], ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', vol.6, pp.&amp;nbsp;70–71 (1769)]]

===Philosophical novel===
{{main|Philosophical fiction}}
The rising status of the novel in 18th-century can be seen in the development of philosophical&lt;ref&gt;See [[Jonathan Israel|Jonathan Irvine Israel]], ''Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650–1750'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2002), pp.&amp;nbsp;591–599, Roger Pearson, ''The fables of reason: a study of Voltaire's "Contes philosophiques"'' (Oxford University Press 1993), Dena Goodman, ''Criticism in action: Enlightenment experiments in political writing'' ([[Cornell University Press]] 1989), Robert Francis O'Reilly, ''The Artistry of Montesquieu's Narrative Tales'' (University of Wisconsin., 1967), and René Pomeau and Jean Ehrard, ''De Fénelon à Voltaire'' (Flammarion, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[experimental novel]]s.

Philosophical fiction was not exactly new. [[Plato]]'s dialogues were embedded in fictional narratives and his ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' is an early example of a [[Utopia]]. The tradition of works of fiction that were also philosophical texts continued with [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516) and [[Tommaso Campanella]]'s ''[[The City of the Sun|City of the Sun]]'' (1602). However, the actual tradition of the [[philosophical novel]] came into being in the 1740s with new editions of More's work under the title ''Utopia: or the happy republic; a philosophical romance'' (1743).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Voltaire]] wrote in this genre in ''[[Micromégas|Micromegas: a comic romance, which is a biting satire on philosophy, ignorance, and the self-conceit of mankind]]'' (1752, English 1753). His ''[[Zadig]]'' (1747) and ''[[Candide]]'' (1759) became central texts of the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and of the modern novel.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

An example of the [[experimental novel]] is [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' (1759–1767), with its rejection of continuous narration.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tristram-Shandy].&lt;/ref&gt; In it the author not only addresses readers in his preface but speaks directly to them in his fictional narrative. In addition to Sterne's narrative experiments, there has visual experiments, such as a marbled page, a black page to express sorrow, and a page of lines to show the plot lines of the book. The novel as a whole focuses on the problems of language, with constant regard to [[John Locke]]'s theories in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref name=griffin&gt;{{cite journal |last=Griffin |first=Robert J. |year=1961 |title=Tristram Shandy and Language |journal=College English |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=108–12|jstor=372959 |doi=10.2307/372959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The romance genre in the 18th century===
[[File:Richardson pamela 1741.jpg|left|thumb|[[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'' (1741)]]

The rise of the word novel at the cost of its rival, the romance, remained a Spanish and English phenomenon, and though readers all over Western Europe had welcomed the novel(la) or short history as an alternative in the second half of the 17th century, only the English and the Spanish had, however, openly discredited the romance.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

But the change of taste was brief and [[François Fénelon|Fénelon's]] ''Telemachus'' (1699/1700) already exploited a nostalgia for the old romances with their heroism and professed virtue. [[Jane Barker]] explicitly advertised her ''Exilius'' as "A new Romance", "written after the Manner of Telemachus", in 1715.&lt;ref&gt;See the preface to her [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1715-exilius.html ''Exilius''] (London: E. Curll, 1715)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robinson Crusoe]] spoke of his own story as a "romance", though in the preface to the third volume, published in 1720, Defoe attacks all who said "that [...] the Story is feign'd, that the Names are borrow'd, and that it is all a Romance; that there never were any such Man or Place".

The late 18th century brought an answer with the [[romanticism|Romantic]] Movement's readiness to reclaim the word romance, with the [[gothic romance]], and the [[historical novel]]s of [[Walter Scott]]. ''Robinson Crusoe'' now became a "novel" in this period, that is a work of the new realistic fiction created in the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===The sentimental novel===
{{main|Sentimental novel}}
Sentimental novels relied on emotional responses, and feature scenes of distress and tenderness, and the plot is arranged to advance emotions rather than action. The result is a valorization of "fine feeling", displaying the characters as models of refined, sensitive emotional effect. The ability to display such feelings was thought at this time to show character and experience, and to help shape positive social life and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Maxwell and Katie Trumpener, eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Fiction in the Romantic Period'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this genre is [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740), composed "to cultivate the Principles of Virtue and Religion in the Minds of the Youth of Both Sexes", which focuses on a potential victim, a heroine that has all the modern virtues and who is vulnerable because her low social status and her occupation as servant of a libertine who falls in love with her. She, however, ends in reforming her antagonist.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Male heroes adopted the new [[sentimental novel|sentimental]] character traits in the 1760s. [[Laurence Sterne]]'s [[Yorick]], the hero of the ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy|Sentimental Journey]]'' (1768) did so with an enormous amount of humour. [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield|Vicar of Wakefield]]'' (1766) and [[Henry Mackenzie]]'s ''Man of Feeling'' (1771) produced the far more serious role models.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Thees works inspired a [[Subculture|sub]]- and [[counterculture]] of [[pornography|pornographic]] novels, for which Greek and Latin authors in  translations had provided elegant models from the last century.&lt;ref&gt;The elegant and clearly fashionable edition of ''The Works of [[Lucian]]'' (London: S. Briscoe/ J. Woodward/ J. Morphew, 1711), would thus include the story of "Lucian's Ass", vol.1 pp.&amp;nbsp;114–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Pornography includes [[John Cleland]]'s ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' (1748), which offered an almost exact reversals of the plot of novel's that emphasised virtue. The prostitute Fanny Hill learns to enjoy her work and establishes herself as a free and economically independent individual, in editions one could only expect to buy under the counter.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert Darnton, ''The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France'' (New York: Norton, 1995), Lynn Hunt, ''The Invention of Pornography: Obscenity and the Origins of Modernity, 1500–1800'' (New York: Zone, 1996), Inger Leemans, ''Het woord is aan de onderkant: radicale ideeën in Nederlandse pornografische romans 1670–1700'' (Nijmegen: Vantilt, 2002), and Lisa Z. Sigel, ''Governing Pleasures: Pornography and Social Change in England, 1815–1914'' (January: Scholarly Book Services Inc, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Less virtuous protagonists can also be found in satirical novels, like [[Richard Head]]'s ''English Rogue'' (1665), that feature brothels, while women authors like [[Aphra Behn]] had offered their heroines alternative careers as precursors of the 19th-century [[femme fatale|femmes fatales]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'' (1684/ 1685/ 1687)&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

The genre evolves in the 1770s with, for example, Werther in [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (1774) realising that it is impossible for him to integrate into the new conformist society, and [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]] in ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'' (1782) showing a group of aristocrats playing games of intrigue and amorality.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

===The social context of the 18th century novel===

====Changing cultural status====
By around 1700, fiction was no longer a predominantly aristocratic entertainment, and printed books had soon gained the power to reach readers of almost all classes, though the reading habits differed and to follow fashions remained a privilege. Spain was a trendsetter into the 1630s but French authors superseded [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Francisco de Quevedo|de Quevedo]], and [[Mateo Alemán|Alemán]] in the 1640s. As [[Pierre Daniel Huet|Huet]] was to note in 1670, the change was one of manners.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Daniel Huet, ''The History of Romances'', transl. by Stephen Lewis (London: J. Hooke/ T. Caldecott, 1715), pp.&amp;nbsp;138–140.&lt;/ref&gt; The new French works taught a new, on the surface freer, gallant exchange between the sexes as the essence of life at the French court.

The situation changed again from 1660s into the 1690s when works by French authors were published in Holland out of the reach of French censors.&lt;ref&gt;See for the following: Christiane Berkvens-Stevelinck, H. Bots, P.G. Hoftijzer (eds.), ''Le Magasin de L'univers: The Dutch Republic as the Centre of the European Book Trade: Papers Presented at the International Colloquium, Held at Wassenaar, 5–7 July 1990'' (Leiden/ Boston, MA: Brill, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch publishing houses pirated of fashionable books from France and created a new market of political and scandalous fiction. This led to a market of European rather than French fashions in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;See also the article on [[Pierre Marteau]] for a profile of the European production of (not only) political scandal.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1711 The Court and City Vagaries.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|Intimate short stories: ''The Court and City Vagaries'' (1711).]]

By the 1680s fashionable political European novels had inspired a second wave of private scandalous publications and generated new productions of local importance. Women authors reported on politics and on their private love affairs in The Hague and in London. German students imitated them to boast of their private amours in fiction.&lt;ref&gt;See ''George Ernst Reinwalds Academien- und Studenten-Spiegel'' (Berlin: J.A. Rüdiger, 1720), pp.&amp;nbsp;424–427 and the novels written by such "authors" as Celander, Sarcander, and Adamantes at the beginning of the 18th century.&lt;/ref&gt; The London, the anonymous international market of the Netherlands, publishers in Hamburg and Leipzig generated new public spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry Into a Category of the Bourgeois Society'' [1962], translated by Thomas Burger (MIT Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Once private individuals, such as students in university towns and daughters of London's upper class began write novels based on questionable reputations, the public began to call for a reformation of manners.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''Entertainments'' pp.&amp;nbsp;74–77, Jane Barker's preface to her [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1715-exilius.html ''Exilius''] (London: E. Curll, 1715), and ''George Ernst Reinwalds Academien- und Studenten-Spiegel'' (Berlin: J.A. Rüdiger, 1720), pp.&amp;nbsp;424–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important development in Britain, at the beginning of the century, was that new journals like ''[[Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' and ''[[Tatler (1709)|The Tatler]]'' reviewed novels. In Germany [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s ''Briefe, die neuste Literatur betreffend'' (1758) appeared in the middle of the century with reviews of art and fiction. By the 1780s such reviews played had an important role in introducing new works of fiction to the public.

Influenced by the new journals, reform became the main goal of the second generation of 18th-century novelists. ''The Spectator'' Number 10 had stated that the aim was now "to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality […] to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses"). Constructive criticism of novels had until then been rare.&lt;ref&gt;See Hugh Barr Nisbet, Claude Rawson (eds.), ''The Cambridge history of literary criticism'', vol. IV (Cambridge University Press 1997); and Ernst Weber, ''Texte zur Romantheorie: (1626–1781)'', 2 vols. (München: Fink, 1974/ 1981) and the individual volumes of Dennis Poupard (et al.), ''Literature Criticism from 1400 to 1800: '' (Detroit, Mich.: Gale Research Co, 1984 ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; The first treatise on the history of the novel was a preface to Marie de La Fayette's  novel ''Zayde'' (1670).

A much later development was the introduction of novels into school and later university curricula.{{when|date=July 2018}}

====The acceptance of novels as literature====

The French churchman and scholar [[Pierre Daniel Huet]]'s ''[[Traitté de l'origine des romans]]'' (1670) laid the ground for a greater acceptance of the novel as literature, that is comparable to the [[classics]], in the early 18th century. The theologian had not only dared to praise fictions, but he had also explained techniques of theological interpretation of fiction, which was a novelty. Furthermore, readers of  novels and romances could gain insight not only into their own culture, but also that of distant, exotic countries.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

When the decades around 1700 saw the appearance of new editions of the classical authors [[Petronius]], [[Lucian]], and [[Heliodorus of Emesa]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Works of T. Petronius Arbiter'' [...] ''second edition'' [...] (London: S. Briscoe/ J. Woodward/ J. Morphew, 1710); ''The Works of Lucian,'', 2 vols. (London: S. Briscoe/ J. Woodward/ J. Morphew, 1711). See ''The Adventures of Theagenes and Chariclia'' [...]'', 2 vols. (London: W. Taylor/ E. Curll/ R. Gosling/ J. Hooke/ J. Browne/ J. Osborn, 1717),&lt;/ref&gt; the publishers equipped them with prefaces that referred to Huet's treatise. and the [[Western canon|canon]] it had established. Also exotic works of Middle Eastern fiction entered the market that gave insight into Islamic culture. ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' was first published in Europe from 1704 to 1715 in French, and then translated immediately into English and German, and was seen as a contribution to Huet's history of romances.&lt;ref&gt;August Bohse's (alias Talander) "Preface" to the German edition. (Leipzig: J.L. Gleditsch/ M.G. Weidmann, 1710).&lt;/ref&gt;

The English, ''Select Collection of Novels in six volumes'' (1720–22), is a milestone in this development of the novel's prestige. It included Huet's ''Treatise'', along with the European tradition of the modern novel of the day: that is, novella from [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s to [[Marie de La Fayette]]'s masterpieces. [[Aphra Behn]]'s novels had appeared in the 1680s but became classics when reprinted in collections. [[François Fénelon|Fénelon]]'s ''Telemachus'' (1699/1700) became a classic three years after its publication. New authors entering the market were now ready to use their personal names rather than pseudonyms, including [[Eliza Haywood]], who in 1719 following in the footsteps of Aphra Behn used her name with unprecedented pride.

==19th century novels==

===Romanticism===
{{main|Romanticism}}
{{See also|Newgate novel}}
[[File:Walter Scott Waverley illustration (Pettie-Huth).jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|Image from a Victorian edition of [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'']]
The very word [[romanticism]] is connected to the idea of romance, and the romance genre experienced a revival, at the end of the 18th century, with [[gothic fiction]], that began in 1746 with English author [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', subtitled (in its second edition) "A Gothic Story". Other important works are [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794) and [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|'Monk' Lewis]]'s ''[[The Monk]]'' (1795).

The new romances challenged the idea that the novel involved a [[realism (arts)|realistic]] depictions of life, and destabilized the difference the critics had been trying to establish, between serious classical art and popular fiction. Gothic romances exploited the [[grotesque]],&lt;ref&gt;See Geoffrey Galt Harpham,'' On the Grotesque: Strategies of Contradiction in Art and Literature'', 2nd ed. (Davies Group, Publishers, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and some critics thought that their subject matter deserved less credit than the worst medieval tales of [[Arthurian romance|Arthurian knighthood]].&lt;ref&gt;See Gerald Ernest Paul Gillespie, Manfred Engel, and Bernard Dieterle, ''Romantic prose fiction'' (John Benjamin's Publishing Company, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of this new type of fiction were accused of exploiting all available topics to thrill, arouse, or horrify their audience. These new [[romanticism|romantic]] novelists, however, claimed that they were exploring  the entire realm of fictionality. And psychological interpreters, in the early 19th century, read these works as encounters with the deeper hidden truth of the human imagination: this included sexuality, [[Angst|anxieties]], and insatiable [[desire (emotion)|desires]]. Under such readings, novels were described as exploring deeper human motives, and it was suggested that such artistic freedom would reveal what had not previously been openly visible.

The romances of [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]], ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom|Les 120 Journées de Sodome]]'' (1785), [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]'s ''[[Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque]]'' (1840), [[Mary Shelley]], ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), and [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]], ''[[Die Elixiere des Teufels]]'' (1815), would later attract 20th-century psychoanalysts and supply the images for 20th- and 21st-century horror films, [[romance novel|love romances]], [[fantasy]] novels, [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] computer games, and the [[surrealism|surrealists]].

The [[historical romance]] was also important at this time. But, while earlier writers of these romances paid little attention to historical reality, [[Walter Scott]]'s [[historical novel]] ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'' (1814) broke with this tradition, and he invented "the true historical novel".&lt;ref name="The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885"&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne Davis. New York: Prentice Hall, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;885.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time he was influenced by [[gothic romance]], and had collaborated in 1801 with [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|'Monk' Lewis]] on ''Tales of Wonder''.&lt;ref name="The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885" /&gt; With his [[Waverley novels]] Scott "hoped to do for the Scottish border" what [[Goethe]] and other German poets "had done for the [[Middle Ages]], "and make its past live again in modern romance".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne Davis, p.&amp;nbsp;884.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's novels "are in the mode he himself defined as romance, 'the interest of which turns upon marvelous and uncommon incidents'".&lt;ref name=norton&gt;''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', vol.2, 7th edition, ed. M.H. Abrams. New York: Norton, 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; He used his imagination to re-evaluate history by rendering things, incidents and protagonists in the way only the novelist could do. His work remained historical fiction, yet it questioned existing historical perceptions. The use of historical research was an important tool: Scott, the novelist, resorted to documentary sources as any historian would have done, but as a romantic he gave his subject a deeper imaginative and emotional significance.&lt;ref name=norton/&gt; By combining research with "marvelous and uncommon incidents", Scott attracted a far wider market than any historian could, and was the most famous novelist of his generation, throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885" /&gt;

===The Victorian period: 1837–1901===

In the 19th century the relationship between authors, publishers, and readers, changed. Authors originally had only received payment for their manuscript, however, changes in [[History of copyright law|copyright laws]], which began in 18th and continued into 19th century&lt;ref&gt;See Mark Rose, ''Authors and Owners: The Invention of Copyright'' 3rd ed. (Harvard University Press, 1993) and Joseph Lowenstein, ''The Author's Due: Printing and the Prehistory of Copyright'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; promised royalties on all future editions. Another change in the 19th century was that novelists began to read their works in theaters, halls, and bookshops.&lt;ref&gt;See Susan Esmann, "Die Autorenlesung&amp;nbsp;– eine Form der Literaturvermittlung", ''Kritische Ausgabe'' 1/2007 [http://kritische-ausgabe.de/hefte/werkstatt/esmann.pdf PDF; 0,8 MB].&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the nineteenth century the market for [[popular fiction]] grew, and competed with works of literature. New institutions like the [[circulating library]] created a new market with a mass reading public.&lt;ref&gt;See Richard Altick and Jonathan Rose, ''The English Common Reader: A Social History of the Mass Reading Public, 1800–1900'', 2nd ed. (Ohio State University Press, 1998) and William St. Clair, ''The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period'' (Cambridge: CUP, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another difference was that novels began to deal with more difficult subjects, including current political and social issues, that were being discussed in newspapers and magazines. The idea of social responsibility became a key subject, whether of the citizen, or of the artist, with the theoretical debate concentrating on questions around the moral soundness of the modern novel.&lt;ref&gt;See: James Engell, ''The committed word: Literature and Public Values'' (Penn State Press, 1999) and Edwin M. Eigner, George John Worth (ed.), ''Victorian criticism of the novel'' (Cambridge: CUP Archive, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Questions about artistic integrity, as well as [[aestheticism|aesthetics]], including, for example. the idea of "[[art for art's sake]]", proposed by writers like [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], were also important.&lt;ref&gt;Gene H. Bell-Villada, ''Art for Art's Sake &amp; Literary Life: How Politics and Markets Helped Shape the Ideology &amp; Culture of Aestheticism, 1790–1990'' (University of Nebraska Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Major British writers such as [[Charles Dickens]]&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Benson, "Charles Dickens". ''The North American Review'', Vol. 195, No. 676 (Mar., 1912), pp.&amp;nbsp;381–91.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Hardy]]&lt;ref&gt;Jane Millgate, "Two Versions of Regional Romance: Scott's ''The Bride of Lammermoor'' and Hardy's ''Tess of the d'Urbervilles''. ''Studies in English Literature'', 1500–1900, Vol. 17, No. 4, Nineteenth Century (Autumn, 1977), pp.&amp;nbsp;729–38.&lt;/ref&gt; were influenced by the romance genre tradition of the novel, which had been revitalized during the Romantic period. The [[Brontë sisters]] were notable mid-19th-century authors in this tradition, with [[Anne Brontë]]'s ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'', [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lucasta Miller, ''The Brontë Myth''. London: Vintage, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Publishing at the very end of the 19th century, [[Joseph Conrad]] has been called, "a supreme 'romancer'".&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Literary Terms &amp; Literary Theory'', ed. J.A. Cuddon, 4th ed., revised C.E. Preston (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;761.&lt;/ref&gt; In America "the romance ... proved to be a serious, flexible, and successful medium for the exploration of philosophical ideas and attitudes." Notable examples include [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', and [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.&lt;ref name="Literary Terms 1995 p.450"&gt;''A Handbook of Literary Terms'', 7th edition, ed. Harmon and Holman (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;450.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of European novelists were similarly influenced influenced during this period by the earlier romance tradition, along with the [[Romantic Movemennticism|Romanticism]], including [[Victor Hugo]], with novels like ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (1831) and ''[[Les Misérables]]'' (1862), and [[Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov]] with ''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'' (1840).

[[File:UncleTomsCabinCover.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|[[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852)]]

Many 19th-century authors dealt with significant social matters.&lt;ref&gt;For the wider context of 19th-century encounters with history see: [[Hayden White]], ''[[Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe]]'' (Baltimore: [[Johns Hopkins University]], 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]]'s novels depicted the world of the [[working class]]es, which [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]'s non-fiction explores. In the United States slavery and racism became topics of far broader public debate thanks to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), which dramatizes topics that had previously been discussed mainly in the abstract. [[Charles Dickens]]' novels led his readers into contemporary [[workhouses]], and provided first-hand accounts of [[child labor]]. The treatment of the subject of war changed with [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' (1868/69), where he questions the facts provided by historians. Similarly the treatment of crime is very different in [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866), where the point of view is that of a criminal. Women authors had dominated fiction from the 1640s into the early 18th century, but few before [[George Eliot]] so openly questioned the role, education, and status of women in society, as she did.

As the novel became a platform of modern debate, [[nationalist|national literatures]] were developed that link the present with the past in the form of the [[historical novel]]. [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'' (1827) did this for Italy, while novelists in Russia and the surrounding Slavonic countries, as well as [[Scandinavia]], did likewise.

Along with this new appreciation of history, the future also became a topic for fiction. This had been done earlier in works like [[Samuel Madden]]'s ''[[Memoirs of the Twentieth Century]]'' (1733) and [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[The Last Man]]'' (1826), a work whose plot culminated in the catastrophic last days of a mankind extinguished by the plague. [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]'' (1887) and [[H.G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895) were concerned with technological and biological developments. [[Industrialization]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]] and Marx's theory of [[social class|class]] divisions shaped these works and turned historical processes into a subject of wide debate. Bellamy's ''Looking Backward'' became the second best-selling book of the 19th century after Harriet Beecher Stowe's ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Scott Donaldson and Ann Massa ''American Literature: Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries'' (David &amp; Charles, 1978), p.&amp;nbsp;205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claire Parfait, ''The Publishing History of Uncle Tom's Cabin, 1852–2002'' (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Such works led to the development of a whole genre of popular [[science fiction]] as the 20th century approached.

[[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) had a major influence on modern novelists, in the way that it replaced the 18th- and 19th-century narrator with a text that attempted to record inner thoughts, or a "[[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]". This term was first used by [[William James]] in 1890 and is used (or the related [[interior monologue]]) by [[modernists]] like [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[Marcel Proust]], as well as, later [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[William Faulkner]].&lt;ref&gt;See Erwin R. Steinberg (ed.) ''The Stream-of-consciousness technique in the modern novel'' (Port Washington, N.Y: Kennikat Press, 1979). On the extra-European usage of the technique see also: Elly Hagenaar/ Eide, Elisabeth, "Stream of consciousness and free indirect discourse in modern Chinese literature", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', 56 (1993), p.&amp;nbsp;621 and P.M. Nayak (ed.), ''The voyage inward: stream of consciousness in Indian English fiction'' (New Delhi: Bahri Publications, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1920s [[expressionist]] [[Alfred Döblin]] went in a different direction with ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'' (1929), where interspersed non-fictional text fragments exist alongside the fictional material to create another new form of realism, which differs from that of stream-of-consciousness.

Later works like [[Samuel Beckett]]'s trilogy ''[[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]'' (1951), ''[[Malone Dies]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]'' (1953), as well as [[Julio Cortázar]]'s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cortázar novel)|Rayuela]]'' (1963) and [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' (1973) all make use of the stream-of-consciousness technique. On the other hand, [[Robert Coover]] is an example of those authors who, in the 1960s,  fragmented their stories and challenged time and sequentiality as fundamental structural concepts.
[[File:Chinua Achebe - Buffalo 25Sep2008.jpg|right|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Chinua Achebe]], Buffalo, 2008]]
The 20th century novels deals with a wide range of subject matter. [[Erich Maria Remarque]]'s ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1928) focusses on young German's experiences of [[World War I]]. The [[Jazz Age]] is explored by American [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], and the [[Great Depression]] by fellow American [[John Steinbeck]]. The rise of [[totalitarian]] states is the subject of British writer [[George Orwell]]. France's existentialism is the subject of French writers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'' (1938) and [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' (1942). The [[counterculture of the 1960s]] led to revived interest in [[Hermann Hesse]]'s ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'' (1927), and produced such iconic works of its own like [[Ken Kesey]]'s ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' and [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]''. Novelist have also been interested in the subject of racial and [[gender identity]] in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Susan Hopkins, ''Girl Heroes: The New Force In Popular Culture'' (Annandale NSW:, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Kavadlo of [[Maryville University]] of St. Louis has described [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' (1996) as "a closeted [[Feminism|feminist]] critique".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kavadlo|first=Jesse|date=Fall/Winter 2005|title=The Fiction of Self-destruction: Chuck Palahniuk, Closet Moralist|url=|journal=Stirrings Still: The International Journal of Existential Literature|volume=2|issue=2|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Doris Lessing]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]] were feminist voices during this period.

Furthermore, the major political and military confrontations of the 20th and 21st centuries have also influenced novelists. The events of [[World War II]], from a German perspective, are dealt with by [[Günter Grass]]' ''[[The Tin Drum]]'' (1959) and an American by [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[Catch-22]]'' (1961). The subsequent [[Cold War]] influenced popular [[spy fiction|spy novels]]. Latin American self-awareness in the wake of the (failing) left revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s resulted in a "[[Latin American Boom]]", linked to with the names of novelists [[Julio Cortázar]], [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Carlos Fuentes]] and [[Gabriel García Márquez]], along with the invention of a special brand of postmodern [[magic realism]].

Another major 20th-century social events, the so-called [[sexual revolution]] is reflected in the modern novel.&lt;ref&gt;See: Charles Irving Glicksberg, ''The Sexual Revolution in Modern American Literature'' (Nijhoff, 1971) and his ''The Sexual Revolution in Modern English Literature'' (Martinus Nijhoff, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' had to be published in Italy in 1928; British censorship lifted its ban as late as 1960. [[Henry Miller]]'s ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'' (1934) created the comparable US scandal. Transgressive fiction from [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Lolita]]'' (1955) to [[Michel Houellebecq]]'s ''[[Les Particules élémentaires]]'' (1998) entered a literary field that eventually led to more pornographic works such as [[Anne Desclos]]' ''[[Story of O]]'' (1954) to [[Anaïs Nin]]'s ''[[Delta of Venus]]'' (1978).

In the second half of the 20th century, [[postmodernism|Postmodern]] authors subverted serious debate with playfulness, claiming that art could never be original, that it always plays with existing materials.&lt;ref&gt;See for a first survey [[Brian McHale]], ''Postmodernist Fiction'' (Routledge, 1987) and John Docker, ''Postmodernism and popular culture: a cultural history'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that language is self-referential was already an  accepted truth in the world of [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]]. A postmodernist re-reads popular literature as an essential cultural production. Novels from [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' (1966), to [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (1980) and ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' (1989) made use of [[intertextuality|intertextual]] references.&lt;ref&gt;See Gérard Genette, ''Palimpsests'', trans.

While the reader of so-called [[Classic book|serious literature]] will follow public discussions of novels, popular fiction production employs more direct and short-term marketing strategies by openly declarating of the work's genre. Popular novels are based entirely on the expectations for the particular genre, and this includes the creation of a series of novels with an identifiable brand name. e.g. the [[Sherlock Holmes]] series by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]

Popular literature holds a larger market share. [[Romance fiction]] had an estimated $1.375&amp;nbsp;billion share in the US book market in 2007. [[Inspirational literature]]/religious literature followed with $819&amp;nbsp;million, [[science fiction]]/[[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] with $700&amp;nbsp;million, [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] with $650&amp;nbsp;million and then classic literary fiction with $466&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;See the page [http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics Romance Literature Statistics: Overview]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223085813/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics |date=2007-12-23 }} (visited March 16, 2009) of ''[http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home Romance Writers of America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203140439/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home |date=2010-12-03 }}'' homepage.

Genre literature might be seen as the successor of the early modern [[chapbook]]. Both fields share a focus on readers who are in search of accessible reading satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Richetti ''Popular Fiction before Richardson. Narrative Patterns 1700–1739'' (Oxford: OUP, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th-century love romance is a successor of the novels [[Madeleine de Scudéry]], [[Madame de La Fayette|Marie de La Fayette]], [[Aphra Behn]], and [[Eliza Haywood]] wrote from the 1640s into the 1740s. The modern [[adventure novel]] goes back to [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719) and its immediate successors. Modern [[pornography]] has no precedent in the chapbook market but originates in libertine and hedonistic belles lettres, of works like [[John Cleland]]'s ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' (1749) and similar eighteenth century novels. [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[James Bond]]'' is a descendant of the anonymous yet extremely sophisticated and stylish narrator who mixed his love affairs with his political missions in ''La Guerre d'Espagne'' (1707). [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'' is influenced by [[Tolkien]], as well as [[Arthurian literature]], including its 19th-century successors. Modern [[horror fiction]] also has no precedent on the market of chapbooks but goes back to the elitist market of early-19th-century [[Romantic literature]]. Modern popular science fiction has an even shorter history, from the 1860s.

The authors of popular fiction tend to advertise that they have exploited a controversial topic and this is a major difference between them and so-called elitist literature. [[Dan Brown]], for example, discusses, on his website, the question whether his ''Da Vinci Code'' is an anti-Christian novel.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Brown on his [http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html website] visited February 3, 2009. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116181432/http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html |date=January 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And because authors of popular fiction have a fan community to serve, they can risk offending [[literary critic]]. However, the boundaries between popular and serious literature have blurred in recent years, with [[postmodernism]] and [[poststructuralism]], as well as by adaptation of popular literary classics by the film and television industries.
[[File:J. K. Rowling 2010.jpg|right|upright=0.9|thumb|[[J.K. Rowling]], 2010]]
Crime became a major subject of 20th and 21st century genre novelists and [[crime fiction]] reflects the realities of modern industrialized societies. Crime is both a personal and public subject: criminals each have their personal motivations; detectives, see their moral codes challenged. [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s [[psychological thriller|thrillers]] became a medium of new psychological explorations. [[Paul Auster]]'s ''[[The New York Trilogy|New York Trilogy]]'' (1985–1986) is an example of experimental [[postmodern]]ist literature based on this genre.

[[Fantasy]] is another major area of commercial fiction, and a major example is [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954/55), a work originally written for young readers that became a major cultural artefact. Tolkien in fact  revived the tradition of European [[epic (genre)|epic]] literature in the tradition of [[Beowulf]], the North Germanic [[Edda]] and the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Cycles]].

[[Science fiction]], is another important type of genre fiction and it has developed in a variety of ways, ranging from the early, technological adventure [[Jules Verne]] had made fashionable in the 1860s, to [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) about Western [[consumerism]] and technology. [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) deals with [[totalitarianism]] and [[surveillance]], among other matters, while [[Stanisław Lem]], [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] produced modern classics which focus on the interaction between humans and machines. The surreal novels of [[Philip K Dick]] such as ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' explore the nature of reality, reflecting the widespread recreational experimentation with drugs and cold-war paranoia of the 60's and 70's. Writers such as [[Ursula le Guin]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] explore feminist and broader social issues in their works. [[William Gibson]], author of the cult classic ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984), is one of a new wave of authors who explore post-apocalyptic fantasies and [[virtual reality]].

{{Refimprove|date=July 2014}}
'''Pleonasm''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|iː|ə|n|æ|z|ə|m}}; {{ety|grc|''{{linktext|πλεονασμός}}'', {{lang|grc-Latn|pleonasmós}}}}, {{ety||''{{linktext|πλέον}}'', {{lang|grc-Latn|pleon}}|more; too much}}) is the use of more [[word]]s or [[morpheme|parts of words]] than are necessary or sufficient for clear expression: for example ''black darkness'' or ''burning fire''. Such [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] is, by traditional [[rhetoric]]al criteria, a manifestation of [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]. However, pleonasm may also be used for emphasis, or because the phrase has already become established in a certain form.

==Usage==
Most often, ''pleonasm'' is understood to mean a word or phrase which is useless, [[cliché]]d, or repetitive, but a pleonasm can also be simply an unremarkable use of [[idiom]]. It can aid in achieving a specific linguistic effect, be it social, poetic, or literary. In particular, pleonasm sometimes serves the same function as rhetorical repetition—it can be used to reinforce an idea, contention, or question, rendering writing clearer and easier to understand. Further, pleonasm can serve as a [[redundancy check]]: If a word is unknown, misunderstood, or misheard, or the medium of communication is poor—a wireless telephone connection or sloppy handwriting—pleonastic phrases can help ensure that the entire meaning gets across even if some of the words get lost.

===Idiomatic expressions===
Some pleonastic phrases are part of a language's idiom, like "tuna fish" and "safe haven" in American [[English language|English]]. They are so common that their use is unremarkable and often even unnoticeable for native speakers, although in many cases the redundancy can be dropped with no loss of meaning.

When expressing possibility, English speakers often use potentially pleonastic expressions such as ''It may be possible'' or ''maybe it's possible'', where both terms (verb ''may''&amp;nbsp;/ adverb ''maybe'' and adjective ''possible'') have the same meaning under certain constructions. Many speakers of English use such expressions for possibility in general, such that most instances of such expressions by those speakers are in fact pleonastic. Others, however, use this expression only to indicate a distinction between ontological possibility and epistemic possibility, as in "Both the ontological possibility of X under current conditions and the ontological impossibility of X under current conditions are epistemically possible" (in [[Propositional logic|logical]] terms, "I am not aware of any facts inconsistent with the truth of proposition X, but I am likewise not aware of any facts inconsistent with the truth of the negation of X"). The habitual use of the double construction to indicate possibility ''per se'' is far less widespread among speakers of most other languages (except in Spanish; see examples); rather, almost all speakers of those languages use one term in a single expression:
* French: ''Il est possible'' or ''il peut arriver''.
* Romanian: ''Este posibil'' or ''se poate întâmpla''.
* Typical Spanish pleonasms
** ''Voy a subir arriba'' - I am going to go up upstairs, "''arriba''" not being necessary.
** ''Entra para adentro'' - Go in inside, "''para adentro''" not being necessary.

In a [[verb framing|satellite-framed]] language like English, [[verb phrase]]s containing [[grammatical particle|particle]]s that denote direction of motion are so frequent that even when such a particle is pleonastic, it seems natural to include it (e.g. "enter into").

===Professional and scholarly use===
Some pleonastic phrases, when used in professional or scholarly writing, may reflect a standardized usage that has evolved or a meaning familiar to specialists but not necessarily to those outside that discipline. Such examples as "null and void", "terms and conditions", "each and every" are [[legal doublet]]s that are part of [[Legal English|legally operative language]] that is often drafted into legal documents. A classic example of such usage was that by the [[Lord Chancellor]] at the time (1864), [[Richard Bethell, 1st Baron Westbury|Lord Westbury]], in the English case of ''{{lang|la|ex parte}} Gorely'',&lt;ref&gt;''Ex p Gorely'', (1864) 4 De G L &amp; S 477.&lt;/ref&gt; when he described a phrase in an Act as "redundant and pleonastic". Although this type of usage may be favored in certain contexts, it may also be disfavored when used gratuitously to portray false erudition, obfuscate, or otherwise introduce verbiage. This is especially so in disciplines where imprecision may introduce ambiguities (such as the natural sciences).&lt;ref name="Partridge"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stylistic preference===
In addition, pleonasms can serve purposes external to meaning. For example, a speaker who is too terse is often interpreted as lacking ease or grace, because, in oral and sign language, sentences are spontaneously created without the benefit of editing. The restriction on the ability to plan often creates much redundancy. In written language, removing words not strictly necessary sometimes makes writing seem stilted or awkward, especially if the words are cut from an idiomatic expression.

On the other hand, as is the case with any literary or rhetorical effect, excessive use of pleonasm weakens writing and speech; words distract from the content. Writers wanting to conceal a thought or a purpose obscure their meaning with verbiage. [[William Strunk Jr]]. advocated concision in ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' (1918):

{{quote|Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.}}

Yet, one has only to look at [[Baroque]], [[Mannerist]], and [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] sources for different opinions.

===Literary uses===
* "This was the '''most''' unkind'''est''' cut of all." &amp;mdash;[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' (Act 3, Scene 2,183).
* "I will be brief: your noble son is mad:/Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,/What is't but to be nothing else but mad?" &amp;mdash; ''[[Hamlet]]'' (Act 2, Scene 2)
* "Beyond the garage were some decorative trees trimmed as carefully as '''poodle dogs'''." &amp;mdash;[[Raymond Chandler]], ''[[The Big Sleep]]''.
* "Let me tell you this, when social workers offer you, '''free, gratis and for nothing''', something to hinder you from swooning, which with them is an obsession, it is useless to recoil ..." &amp;mdash;[[Samuel Beckett]], ''[[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]''.

==Types==
{{Original research section|date=September 2010}}
There are two kinds of pleonasm: '''syntactic pleonasm''' and '''semantic pleonasm'''.

===Syntactic pleonasm===
[[Syntax|Syntactic]] pleonasm occurs when the [[grammar]] of a language makes certain [[function word]]s optional. For example, consider the following [[English language|English]] sentences:

* "I know you're coming."
* "I know that you're coming."

In this construction, the [[grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] ''that'' is optional when joining a sentence to a [[verb]] phrase with ''know''. Both sentences are grammatically correct, but the word ''that'' is pleonastic in this case. By contrast, when a sentence is in spoken form and the verb involved is one of assertion, the use of ''that'' makes clear that the present speaker is making an indirect rather than a direct quotation, such that he is not imputing particular words to the person he describes as having made an assertion; the demonstrative adjective ''that'' also does not fit such an example. Also, some writers may use "that" for technical clarity reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Possible Worlds: an introduction to Logic and its Philosophy|year=1979|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/pw/index.htm|author=Norman Swartz &amp; Raymond Bradley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some languages, such as French, the word is not optional and should therefore not be considered pleonastic.

The same phenomenon occurs in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] with subject pronouns. Since Spanish is a [[null-subject language]], which allows subject pronouns to be deleted when understood, the following sentences mean the same:

* "{{lang|es|Yo te amo.}}"
* "{{lang|es|Te amo.}}"

In this case, the pronoun {{lang|es|yo}} ('I') is grammatically optional; both sentences mean "I love you" (however, they may not have the same tone or ''intention''—this depends on [[pragmatics]] rather than grammar). Such differing but [[syntax|syntactically]] equivalent constructions, in many languages, may also indicate a difference in [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]].

The process of deleting pronouns is called ''[[pro-drop language|pro-dropping]]'', and it also happens in many other languages, such as [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Latin]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Scandinavian languages]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], some&lt;!-- if not all --&gt; [[Slavic languages]], and the [[Lao language]].

In contrast, formal English requires an overt subject in each clause. A sentence may not need a subject to have valid meaning, but to satisfy the syntactic requirement for an explicit subject a pleonastic (or [[dummy pronoun]]) is used; only the first sentence in the following pair is acceptable English:

* "It's raining."
* "Is raining."

In this example the pleonastic "it" fills the subject function, however, it does not contribute any meaning to the sentence. The second sentence, which omits the pleonastic '''it''' is marked as ungrammatical although no meaning is lost by the omission.&lt;ref&gt;Haegeman, L. (1991). ''Introduction to Government and Binding Theory''. Blackwell Publishing. pp 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Elements such as "it", or "there" serving as empty subject markers are also called (syntactic) [[Syntactic expletive|expletive]]s, and also dummy pronouns. Compare:

* "There is rain."
* "Today is rain."

The pleonastic {{lang|fr|ne}} ({{lang|fr|ne pléonastique}}), expressing uncertainty in formal [[French language|French]], works as follows:
*"{{lang|fr|Je crains qu'il ne pleuve.}}"&lt;br /&gt;('I fear it may rain.')
*"{{lang|fr|Ces idées sont plus difficiles à comprendre que je ne pensais.}}"&lt;br /&gt;('These ideas are harder to understand than I thought.')

Two more striking examples of French pleonastic construction are the word {{lang|fr|aujourd'hui}} translated as 'today', but originally meaning "on the day of today", and the phrase {{lang|fr|Qu'est-ce que c'est?}} meaning 'What's that?' or 'What is it?', while literally it means "What is it that it is?".

There are examples of the pleonastic, or dummy, negative in English, such as the construction, heard in the New England region of the United States, in which the phrase "So don't I" is intended to have the same positive meaning as "So do I."&lt;ref&gt;Horn, Laurence R. ''Universals of Human Language'', Volume I, edited by Joseph H. Greenberg, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Jim P. (2008), "''So''-inversion as Polarity Focus"; in Michael Grosvald and Dianne Soares (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 38th Western Conference on Linguistics''; Fresno, California: University of California Press; pp. 304-317&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Robert South]] said, "It is a pleonasm, a figure usual in [[Bible|Scripture]], by a multiplicity of expressions to signify one notable thing",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ukIVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA368|chapter=Sermon XIII Preached at St. Mary's, Oxford, on Sept. 12, 1658 |title=Five additional volumes of sermons preached upon several occasions,|volume=8|first=Robert |last=South|date=1744|page=368|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was observing the [[Biblical Hebrew]] poetic propensity to repeat thoughts in different words, since written Biblical Hebrew was a comparatively early form of written language and was written using oral patterning, which has many pleonasms. In particular, very many verses of the [[Psalms]] are split into two halves, each of which says much the same thing in different words. The complex rules and forms of written language as distinct from spoken language were not as well-developed as they are today when the books making up the [[Old Testament]] were written.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, Walter J., ''Orality and Literacy (New Accents)'', p. 38, {{ISBN|0-415-28129-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McWhorter, John C. ''Doing Our Own Thing'', p. 19. {{ISBN|1-59240-084-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[parallelism (rhetoric)]].

This same pleonastic style remains very common in modern poetry and songwriting (e.g., "Anne, with her father&amp;nbsp;/ is out in the boat&amp;nbsp;/ riding the water&amp;nbsp;/ riding the waves&amp;nbsp;/ on the sea", from [[Peter Gabriel]]'s "Mercy Street").

====Types of syntactic pleonasm====
* ''Overinflection'': Many languages with [[inflection]], as a result of convention, tend to inflect more words in a given phrase than actually needed in order to express a single grammatical property. Take for example the German, ''Die alten Frauen sprechen''. Even though the plural form of the noun tells us the grammatical number of the noun phrase, the German language still dictates that the definite article, attributive adjective, and the verb must all also express the plural. Not all languages are quite as redundant however, and will permit inflection for number when there is an obvious numerical marker, as is the case with Hungarian, which does have a plural proper, but would express ''two flowers'' as ''two flower''. (The same is the case in [[Celtic languages]], where numerical markers precede singular nouns.) The main contrast between Hungarian and other tongues such as German or even English (to a lesser extent) is that in either of the latter, expressing plurality when already evident is not optional, but mandatory; making the neglect of these rules result in an ungrammatical sentence. As well as for number, our aforementioned German phrase also overinflects for grammatical case.
* ''[[Double negative|Multiple negation]]'': In some languages, repeated [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]] may be used for emphasis, as in the English sentence, "There ai'''n't nothing''' wrong with that". While a literal interpretation of this sentence would be "There is not nothing wrong with that," i.e. "There is something wrong with that," the intended meaning is, in fact, the opposite: "There is nothing wrong with that" or "There isn't anything wrong with that." The repeated negation is used pleonastically for emphasis. However, this is not always the case. In the sentence "I do'''n't not''' like it," the repeated negative may be used to convey ambivalence ("I neither like nor dislike it") or even affirmation ("I ''do'' like it"). (Rhetorically, this becomes the device of [[litotes]]; it can be difficult to distinguish litotes from pleonastic double negation, a feature which may be used for [[irony|ironic]] effect.) Although the use of "double negatives" for emphatic purposes is sometimes discouraged in standard English, it is mandatory in other languages like Spanish or French. For example, the Spanish phrase {{lang|es|No es nada}} ('It is nothing') contains both a negated verb ("no es") and another negative, the word for nothing ("nada").
* ''Multiple affirmations'': In English, repeated affirmation can be used to add emphasis to an affirmative statement, just as repeated negation can add emphasis to a negative one. A sentence like ''I '''do''' love you'', with a stronger intonation on the ''do'', uses double affirmation. This is because all languages, by default, automatically express their sentences in the affirmative{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} and must then alter the sentence in one way or another to express the opposite. Therefore, the sentence ''I love you'' is ''already'' affirmative, and adding the extra ''do'' only adds emphasis and does not change the meaning of the statement.
* ''Double possession'': The [[English possessive#Double genitive|double genitive]] of English, as with ''a friend of mine'', although seemingly pleonastic, and therefore has been stigmatized, has a long history of use by careful writers and has been analyzed as either a [[partitive]] genitive or an [[appositive]] genitive.
* ''Multiple quality gradation'': In English, different [[degrees of comparison]] ([[comparative]]s and [[superlative]]s) are created through a morphological change to an adjective (e.g. "prettier", "fastest") or a syntactic construction (e.g. "more complex", "most impressive"). It is thus possible to combine both forms for additional emphasis: "more bigger" or "bestest". This may be considered ungrammatical, but is common in informal speech for some English speakers. "The most unkindest cut of all" is from Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar''. Musical notation has a repeated Italian superlative in ''[[wikt:fortississimo|fortississimo]]'' and ''[[wikt:pianississimo|pianississimo]]''.

:Not all uses of constructions such as "more bigger" are pleonastic, however. Some speakers who use such utterances do so in an attempt, albeit a grammatically unconventional one, to create a non-pleonastic construction: A person who says "X is more bigger than Y" may, in the context of a conversation featuring a previous comparison of some object Z with Y, mean "The degree by which X exceeds Y in size is greater than the degree by which Z exceeds Y in size". This usage amounts to the treatment of "bigger than Y" as a single grammatical unit, namely an adjective itself admitting of degrees, such that "X is more bigger than Y" is equivalent to "X is more bigger-than-Y than Z is." Another common way to express this is: "X is even bigger than Z."

===Semantic pleonasm===
Semantic pleonasm is a question more of style and usage than of grammar&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Bergen, Evans, Cor Nelia, and others, (1957), ''A dictionary of contemporary American usage'', Random House&lt;/ref&gt;. Linguists usually call this ''redundancy'' to avoid confusion with syntactic pleonasm, a more important phenomenon for theoretical [[linguistics]]. It usually takes one of two forms: Overlap or prolixity.

'''Overlap''': One word's semantic component is subsumed by the other:
* "Receive a '''free gift''' with every purchase."
* "I ate a '''tuna fish''' sandwich."
* "The plumber fixed our '''hot''' water '''heater'''." (This pleonasm was famously attacked by American comedian [[George Carlin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |at="'‘George Carlin at USC'’ (1978)" section |title=Divine Comedy: 25 Best Stand-Up Specials and Movies |first1=Steve |last1=Ciabattoni |first2=David |last2=Fear |first3=Tim |last3=Grierson |first4=Matthew |last4=Love |first5=Noel |last5=Murray |first6=Scott |last6=Tobias |work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Penske Business Media |date=29 July 2015 |access-date=27 July 2018|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/divine-comedy-25-best-stand-up-specials-and-movies-70696/}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is not truly redundant; a device that increases the temperature of cold water to room temperature would also be a water heater, although it did not heat hot water.)
* ''The '''Big''' Friendly '''Giant'''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'' (title of a children's book by [[Roald Dahl]]), a giant is inherently big

'''Prolixity''': A phrase may have words which add nothing, or nothing logical or relevant, to the meaning.
* "I'm going '''down''' south."&lt;br /&gt;(South is not really "down", it is just drawn that way on maps by convention.)
* "You can't seem to face '''up to''' the facts."
* "He '''entered into''' the room."
* "Every '''mother's''' child" (as in 'The Christmas Song' by Nat King Cole', also known as 'Chestnuts roasting...')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Christmas Song by Nat King Cole|url=https://genius.com/Nat-king-cole-the-christmas-song-lyrics|website=Lyrics|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. (Being a child, or a human at all, generally implies being the child of/to a mother. So the redundancy here is used to broaden the context of the child's curiosity regarding the sleigh of Santa Claus, including the concept of maternity. The full line goes: "And every mother's child is gonna spy, to see if reindeer really know how to fly". One can furthermore argue that the word "mother" is included for the purpose of lyrical flow, adding two syllables, which make the line sound complete, as "every child" would be to short to fit the lyrical/rhyme scheme. )
* "What therefore God hath joined '''together''', let no man put asunder."
* "He raised '''up''' his hands in a gesture of surrender."
* "Where are you '''at'''?"
* "located" or similar before a [[preposition]]: the preposition contains the idea of locatedness and does not need a servant.
* "the actual house itself" for "the house", and similar: unnecessary re-specifiers.
* "Actual fact": fact.
* "On a daily basis": daily.
* "On a --ly basis" or "on a -- basis": --ly.
* "This particular item": this item.
* "Different" or "separate" after numbers: for example:
** "4 different [[species]]" are merely "4 species", as two non-different species are together one same species.
** "9 separate cars": cars are always separate. (However, in "a discount if you buy ten different items", "different" has meaning, because if the ten items include two packets of frozen peas of the same weight and brand, those ten items are not all different.)
*"Despite the fact that": although

An expression like "tuna fish", however, might elicit one of many possible responses, such as:
# It will simply be accepted as '''synonymous''' with "tuna".
# It will be perceived as '''redundant''' (and thus perhaps silly, illogical, ignorant, inefficient, dialectal, odd, and/or intentionally humorous).
# It will imply a '''distinction'''. A reader of "tuna fish" could properly wonder: "Is there a kind of tuna which is not a fish? There is, after all, a dolphin mammal and a [[mahi-mahi|dolphin fish]]." This assumption turns out to be correct, as a "tuna" can also mean a [[opuntia|prickly pear]].&lt;ref name="MW Tuna"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tuna |title=tuna |work=Merriam-Webster.com |date=12 June 2018 |access-date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, "tuna fish" is sometimes used to refer to the flesh of the animal as opposed to the animal itself (similar to the distinction between ''beef'' and ''cattle'').&lt;ref name="MW Tuna" /&gt;
# It will be perceived as a verbal clarification, since the word "tuna" is quite short, and may, for example, be misheard as "tune" followed by an [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], or (in dialects that [[arhotic|drop the final ''-r'' sound]]) as "tuner".

Careful speakers and writers to are aware of pleonasms, especially with cases such as "tuna fish", which is normally used only in some dialects of [[American English]], and would sound strange in other variants of the language, and even odder in translation into other languages.

Similar situations are:
*"Ink pen" instead of merely "pen" in the southern United States, where "pen" and "pin" are pronounced similarly.
*"Extra accessories" which must be ordered separately for a new camera, as distinct from the accessories provided with the camera as sold.

Not all constructions that are typically pleonasms are so in all cases, nor are all constructions derived from pleonasms themselves pleonastic:
* "Put that glass '''over there''' on the table."&lt;br /&gt; This could, depending on room layout, mean "Put that glass on the table across the room, not the table right in front of you"; if the room were laid out like that, most English speakers would intuitively understand that the distant, not immediate table was the one being referred to; however, if there were only one table in the room, the phrase would indeed be pleonastic. Also, it could mean, "Put that glass on that certain spot on the table"; thus, in this case, it is ''not'' pleonastic.
* "I'm going '''way down''' South."&lt;br /&gt; This may imply "I'm going much farther south than you might think if I didn't stress the southerliness of my destination"; but such phrasing is also sometimes—and sometimes jokingly—used pleonastically when simply "south" would do; it depends upon the context, the intent of the speaker/writer, and ultimately even on the expectations of the listener/reader.

===Morphemic pleonasm===
{{original research|section|date=January 2016}}
[[Morpheme]]s, not just words, can enter the realm of pleonasm: Some word-parts are simply optional in various languages and dialects. A familiar example to American English speakers would be the allegedly optional "-al-", probably most commonly seen in "publically" vs. "publicly"—both spellings are considered correct/acceptable in American English, and both pronounced the same, in this dialect, rendering the "publically" spelling pleonastic in US English; in other dialects it is "required", while it is quite conceivable that in another generation or so of American English it will be "forbidden". This treatment of words ending in "-ic", "-ac", etc., is quite inconsistent in US English—compare "maniacally" or "forensically" with "stoicly" or "heroicly"; "forensicly" doesn't look "right" in any dialect, but "heroically" looks internally redundant to many Americans. (Likewise, there are thousands of mostly American Google search results for "eroticly", some in reputable publications, but it does not even appear in the 23-volume, 23,000-page, 500,000-definition ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), the largest in the world; and even American dictionaries give the correct spelling as "erotically".) In a more modern pair of words, [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] dictionaries say that "electric" and "electrical" mean exactly the same thing. However, the usual adverb form is "electrically". (For example, "The glass rod is electrically charged by rubbing it with silk".)

Some{{who|date=January 2016}} (mostly US-based) [[prescriptive grammar]] pundits would say that the "-ly" not "-ally" form is "correct" in any case in which there is no "-ical" variant of the basic word, and vice versa; i.e. "maniacally", not "maniacly", is correct because "maniacal" is a word, while "publicly", not "publically", must be correct because "publical" is (arguably) not a real word (it does not appear in the ''OED''). This logic is in doubt, since most if not all "-ical" constructions arguably are "real" words and most have certainly occurred more than once in "reputable" publications, and are also immediately understood by any educated reader of English even if they "look funny" to some, or do not appear in popular dictionaries. Additionally, there are numerous examples of words that have very widely accepted extended forms that have skipped one or more intermediary forms, e.g. "disestablishmentarian" in the absence of "disestablishmentary" (which does not appear in the ''OED''). At any rate, while some US editors might consider "-ally" vs. "-ly" to be pleonastic in some cases, the majority of other English speakers would not, and many "-ally" words are not pleonastic to anyone, even in American English.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
&lt;!-- This paragraph is pretty speculative, full of "some"s and "many"s and "in doubt"s --&gt;

The most common definitely pleonastic morphological usage in English is "[[irregardless]]", which is very widely criticized as being a non-word. The standard usage is "regardless", which is already negative; adding the additional negative ''ir-'' is interpreted by some as logically reversing the meaning to "with regard to/for", which is certainly not what the speaker intended to convey. (According to most dictionaries that include it, "irregardless" appears to derive from confusion between "regardless" and "irrespective", which have overlapping meanings.)

===Morphemic pleonasm in Mandarin Chinese===
There are several instances in Chinese vocabulary where pleonasms and [[cognate object]]s are present. Their presence usually indicate the plural form of the noun or the noun in formal context.
*{{lang|zh|书 – 书籍}} ('book(s)' – in general)
*{{lang|zh|纸 – 纸张}} ('paper, tissue, pieces of paper' – formal)

In some instances, the pleonasmic form of the verb is used with the intention as an emphasis to one meaning of the verb, isolating them from their idiomatic and figurative uses. But over time, the pseudo-object, which sometimes repeats the verb, is almost inherently coupled with the it.

For example, the word {{lang|zh|睡}} ('to sleep') is an intransitive verb, but may express different meaning when coupled with objects of prepositions as in "to sleep with". However, in Mandarin, {{lang|zh|睡}} is usually coupled with a pseudo-character {{lang|zh|觉}}, yet it is not entirely a cognate object, to express the act of resting.

*{{lang|zh|我要睡}} ('I want sleep'). Although such usage of {{lang|zh|睡}} is not found among native speakers of Mandarin and may sound awkward, this expression is grammatically correct and it is clear that {{lang|zh|睡}} means 'to sleep/to rest' in this context.
*{{lang|zh|我要睡觉}} ('I want to sleep') and {{lang|zh|我要睡了}} ('I'm going to sleep'). In this context, {{lang|zh|睡觉}} ('to sleep') is a complete verb and native speakers often express themselves this way. Adding this particle clears any suspicion from using it with any direct object shown in the next example:
*{{lang|zh|我要睡她}} ('I want to have sex with her') and {{lang|zh|我要和她睡}} ('I want to sleep with her'). When the verb follows an animate direct object {{lang|zh|她}} the meaning changes dramatically. The first instance is mainly seen in colloquial speech. Note that the object of preposition of "to have sex with" is the equivalent of the direct object of {{lang|zh|睡}} in Mandarin.

One can also find a way around this verb, using another one which does not is used to express idiomatic expressions nor necessitate a pleonasm, because it only has one meaning:
*{{lang|zh|我要就寝}} ('I want "to dorm{{"'}})
Nevertheless, {{lang|zh|就寝}} is a verb used in high-[[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] diction, just like English verbs with Latin roots.

There is no relationship found between Chinese and English regarding verbs that can take pleonasms and cognate objects. Although the verb ''to sleep'' may take a cognate object as in "sleep a restful sleep", it is a pure coincidence, since verbs of this form are more common in Chinese than in English; and when the English verb is used without the cognate objects, its diction is natural and its meaning is clear in every level of diction, as in "I want to sleep" and "I want to have a rest".

===Subtler redundancies===
In some cases, the redundancy in meaning occurs at a syntactic level above the word, such as at the phrase level:

: "It's [[déjà vu]] all over again."
: "I never make predictions, especially about the future."

The redundancy of these two well-known statements is deliberate, for [[humor]]ous effect. (See [[Yogi_Berra#Yogi-isms]].) But one does hear educated people say "my predictions about the future of politics" for "my predictions about politics", which are equivalent in meaning. While predictions are necessarily about the future (at least in relation to the time the prediction was made), the nature of this future can be subtle (e.g., "I predict that he died a week ago"—the prediction is about future discovery or proof of the date of death, not about the death itself). Generally "the future" is assumed, making most constructions of this sort pleonastic. The latter humorous quote above about not making predictions – by [[Yogi Berra]] – is not really a pleonasm, but rather an [[irony|ironic]] [[play on words]].

But "It's ''déjà vu'' all over again." could mean that there was earlier another ''déjà vu'' of the same event or idea, which has now arisen for a third time.

Redundancy, and "useless" or "nonsensical" words (or phrases, or morphemes) can also be inherited by one language from the influence of another, and are not pleonasms in the more critical sense, but actual changes in grammatical construction considered to be required for "proper" usage in the language or dialect in question. [[Irish English]], for example, is prone to a number of constructions that non-Irish speakers find strange and sometimes directly confusing or silly:

* "I'&lt;b&gt;m after&lt;/b&gt; put'''ting''' it on the table."&lt;br /&gt;('I [have] put it on the table.') This example further shows that the effect, whether pleonastic or only pseudo-pleonastic, can apply to words and word-parts, and multi-word phrases, given that the fullest rendition would be "I '''am after''' put'''ting''' it on the table".
* "Have a look at '''your''' man there."&lt;br /&gt;('Have a look at that man there.') An example of word substitution, rather than addition, that seems illogical outside the dialect. This common possessive-seeming construction often confuses the non-Irish enough that they do not at first understand what is meant. Even "'''Have a '''look at that man''' there'''" is arguably further doubly redundant, in that a shorter "Look at that man" version would convey essentially the same meaning.)
* "She's my wife''' so she is'''."&lt;br /&gt;('She's my wife.') Duplicate subject and verb, post-complement, used to emphasize a simple factual statement or assertion.

All of these constructions originate from the application of [[Irish Gaelic]] grammatical rules to the English dialect spoken, in varying particular forms, throughout the island.

Seemingly "useless" additions and substitutions must be contrasted with similar constructions that are used for stress, humor, or other intentional purposes, such as:

*"I abso'''-fuckin'-'''lutely agree!"&lt;br /&gt;([[tmesis]], for stress)
*"Topless'''-shmopless'''—nudity doesn't distract me."&lt;br /&gt;([[shm-reduplication]], for humor)

The latter of these is a result of Yiddish influences on modern English, especially [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] US English.

Sometimes editors and grammatical stylists will use "pleonasm" to describe simple wordiness. This phenomenon is also called [[prolixity]] or [[logorrhea (rhetoric)|logorrhea]]. Compare:

*"The sound of the [[loud music]] drowned out the sound of the burglary."
*"The loud music drowned out the sound of the burglary."
or even:
*"The music drowned out the burglary."

The reader or hearer does not have to be told that loud music has a sound, and in a newspaper headline or other abbreviated prose can even be counted upon to infer that "burglary" is a proxy for "sound of the burglary" and that the music necessarily must have been loud to drown it out, unless the burglary was relatively quiet (this is not a trivial issue, as it may affect the legal culpability of the person who played the music); the word "loud" may imply that the music should have been played quietly if at all. Many are critical of the excessively abbreviated constructions of "[[headline]]-itis" or "[[News style|newsspeak]]", so "loud [music]" and "sound of the [burglary]" in the above example should probably not be properly regarded as pleonastic or otherwise genuinely redundant, but simply as informative and clarifying.

Prolixity is also used simply to obfuscate, confuse, or euphemize and is not necessarily redundant or pleonastic in such constructions, though it often is. "Post-traumatic stress disorder" ([[shell shock]]) and "pre-owned vehicle" ([[used car]]) are both tumid euphemisms but are not redundant. Redundant forms, however, are especially common in business, political, and even academic language that is intended to sound impressive (or to be vague so as to make it hard to determine what is actually being promised, or otherwise misleading). For example: "This quarter, we are presently focusing with determination on an all-new, innovative integrated methodology and framework for rapid expansion of customer-oriented external programs designed and developed to bring the company's consumer-first paradigm into the marketplace as quickly as possible."

In contrast to redundancy, an [[oxymoron]] results when two seemingly contradictory words are adjoined.

===Other forms===
Redundancies sometimes take the form of foreign words whose meaning is repeated in the context:
*"We went to '''the El Restaurante restaurant'''."
*"'''The'' La Brea ''tar''' pits are fascinating."
*"Roast beef served '''with ''au'' ''jus'' sauce'''."
*"'''Please''' R.'''S.V.P.'''"
*"The Schwarz'''wald''' '''Forest''' is deep and dark."
*"The Drakens'''berg''' '''Mountains''' are in South Africa."
*Libre'''Office''' '''office''' suite.
*'''The ''hoi polloi.''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'''
*I'd like to hav'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''e a '''''chai'' tea'''.

These sentences use phrases which mean, respectively, "the {{Not a typo|the}} restaurant restaurant", "the {{Not a typo|the}} tar tar", "with {{Not a typo|in}} juice sauce" and so on. However, many times these redundancies are necessary—especially when the foreign words make up a proper noun as opposed to a common one. For example, "We went to Il Ristorante" is acceptable provided the audience can infer that it is a restaurant (if they understand Italian and English it might likely, if spoken rather than written, be misinterpreted as a generic reference and not a proper noun, leading the hearer to ask "Which ristorante do you mean?" Such confusions are common in richly bilingual areas like [[Montreal]] or the [[American Southwest]] when people mix phrases from two languages at once). But avoiding the redundancy of the Spanish phrase in the second example would only leave an awkward alternative: "La Brea pits are fascinating".

Most find it best to not even drop articles when using proper nouns made from foreign languages:

*"The movie is playing at '''the El''' Capitan theater."

This is also similar to the treatment of definite and indefinite articles in titles of books, films, etc. where the article can—some would say ''must''—be present where it would otherwise be "forbidden":

* "Stephen King'''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s''' ''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'''The''' Shining'' is scary."&lt;br /&gt;(Normally, the article would be left off following a possessive.)
* "I'm having '''an ''An''&lt;nowiki /&gt;''' ''American Werewolf in London'' movie night at my place."&lt;br /&gt;(Seemingly doubled article, which would be taken for a [[stuttering|stutter]] or typographical error in other contexts.)

Some cross-linguistic redundancies, especially in placenames, occur because a word in one language became the title of a place in another (e.g., the [[Sahara Desert]]—"Sahara" is an English approximation of the word for "deserts" in Arabic). A supposed extreme example is [[Torpenhow Hill]] in [[Cumbria]], if etymologized as meaning "hill" in the language of each of the cultures that have lived in the area during recorded history, could be translated as "Hillhillhill Hill". See the [[List of tautological place names]] for many more examples.

Acronyms can also form the basis for redundancies; this is known humorously as [[RAS syndrome]] (for Redundant Acronym Syndrome Syndrome):

*"I forgot my '''PIN number''' for the '''ATM machine'''." So actually it says: "I forgot my Personal Identification Number number for the Automated Teller Machine machine."
*"I upgraded the '''RAM memory''' of my computer."
*"She is infected with the '''HIV virus'''."
*"I have installed a '''CMS system''' on my server."
*"Next year, I will hike the '''PCT Trail'''."

In all the examples listed above, the word after the acronym repeats a word represented in the acronym—respectively, "Personal Identification Number number", "Automated Teller Machine machine", "Random Access Memory memory", "Human Immunodeficiency Virus virus", "Content Management System system". (See [[RAS syndrome]] for many more examples.) The expansion of an acronym like PIN or HIV may be well known to English speakers, but the acronyms themselves have come to be treated as words, so little thought is given to what their expansion is (and "PIN" is also pronounced the same as the word "pin"; disambiguation is probably the source of "PIN number"; "SIN number" for "Social Insurance Number number" {{sic}} is a similar common phrase in Canada.) But redundant acronyms are more common with technical (e.g. computer) terms where well-informed speakers recognize the redundancy and consider it silly or ignorant, but mainstream users might not, since they may not be aware or certain of the full expansion of an acronym like "RAM".

Some redundancies are simply typographical. For instance, when a short inflexional word like "the" occurs at the end of a line, it is very common to accidentally repeat it at the beginning of the line, and a large number of readers would not even notice it.

Carefully constructed expressions, especially in poetry and political language, but also some general usages in everyday speech, may appear to be redundant but are not. This is most common with cognate objects (a verb's object that is cognate with the verb):
*"She '''slept''' a deep '''sleep'''."

Or, a classic example from Latin:
*''[[mutatis mutandis]]'' = "with change made to what needs to be changed" (an [[ablative absolute]] construction)

The words need not be etymologically related, but simply conceptually, to be considered an example of cognate object:
*"We '''wept''' '''tears''' of joy."

Such constructions are not actually redundant (unlike "She slept a sleep" or "We wept tears") because the object's modifiers provide additional information. A rarer, more constructed form is [[polyptoton]], the stylistic repetition of the same word or words derived from the same root:

* "...[T]he only thing we have to '''fear''' is '''fear''' itself."—[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], "[http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres49.html First Inaugural Address]", March 1933.
* "With eager '''feeding'''[,] '''food''' doth choke the '''feeder'''."—[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', II, i, 37.

As with cognate objects, these constructions are not redundant because the repeated words or derivatives cannot be removed without removing meaning or even destroying the sentence, though in most cases they could be replaced with non-related synonyms at the cost of style (e.g., compare "The only thing we have to fear is terror".)

==Semantic pleonasm and context==
In many cases of semantic pleonasm, the status of a word as pleonastic depends on context. The relevant context can be as local as a neighboring word, or as global as the extent of a speaker's knowledge. In fact, many examples of redundant expressions are not inherently redundant, but can be redundant if used one way, and are not redundant if used another way. The "up" in "climb up" is not always redundant, as in the example "He climbed up and then fell down the mountain." Many other examples of pleonasm are redundant only if the speaker's knowledge is taken into account. For example, most English speakers would agree that "tuna fish" is redundant because tuna is a kind of fish. However, given the knowledge that "tuna" can also refer a kind of edible prickly pear,&lt;ref name="MW Tuna" /&gt; the "fish" in "tuna fish" can be seen as non-pleonastic, but rather a disambiguator between the fish and the prickly pear.

Conversely, to English speakers who do not know Spanish, there is nothing redundant about "the La Brea tar pits" because the name "La Brea" is opaque: the speaker does not know that it is Spanish for "the tar". Similarly, even though [[Scuba diving|scuba]] stands for "self-contained underwater breathing apparatus", a phrase like "the scuba gear" would probably not be considered pleonastic because "scuba" has been reanalyzed into English as a simple word, and not an acronym suggesting the pleonastic word sequence "apparatus gear". (Most do not even know that it is an acronym and do not spell it SCUBA or S.C.U.B.A. Similar examples are [[radar]] and [[laser]].)

'''Post-socialist art''' (or post-communist art) is a term used in analysis of art arriving from post-socialist (post-communist) countries taken as different in their nature from Western, [[Postmodern art]].

Crucial for such art is that:
# Because of having no market of art such art was Modernist in a sense of being non-commercial (Groys, 2004), but also;
# Having no market of art authorship was weakened authorship allowed working under pseudonyms, anonymously or even collectively (Peraica, 2006); and finally;
# Such art was necessary referring to the inner history of art, as commonly to Russian Avantgard [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[El Lissitzky]]

Socialist art started opening to Western markets already in the eighties, introducing Slovenian collective [[IRWIN]], Belgrade Malevich (aka Goran Djordjevic) and other artists [[Peter Weibel]] named Retro-avantgard. In the second wave of nineties it was followed by a weakened political versions which were massively funded (Most of such art was financed by [[George Soros]], similarly to [[Socialist realism]] which Lead thinkers as Miško Šuvaković to name such art [[Soros Realism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8012">A '''procedural drama''' is a [[genre]] of [[television program]]ming which focuses on how crimes are solved or some other aspect of a law enforcement agency, legislative body, or court of law.  Some dramas include a lab or conference room with high-tech or state-of-the-art equipment where the main characters meet to work out the problem. Shows usually have an episodic format that does not require the viewer to have seen previous [[episode]]s. Episodes typically have a self-contained, also referred to as stand-alone, plot that is introduced and resolved within the same episode.
 
The procedural format is popular around the world.&lt;ref name="dl062711"&gt;{{cite news | first = Tim | last = Adler | url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/06/why-tv-procedurals-also-rule-the-world/ | title = Why TV Procedurals Also Rule The World | date = June 27, 2011 | accessdate = June 27, 2011 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the director of a TV consultancy said, "The continuing trend is for procedurals because they use a predictable structure."&lt;ref name="dl062711"/&gt; Due to their stand-alone episodic nature, they are more accessible to new viewers than serials. Self-contained episodes also make it easier for viewers to return to a show if they have missed some episodes.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | author = Gerard Gilbert | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/american-law--british-order-1626849.html | title = American law... British order | date = 2009-02-20 | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, procedural dramas can usually be re-run with little concern for episode order.&lt;ref name="dl062711"/&gt;

Procedurals are often criticized for being [[Wiktionary:formulaic|formulaic]].&lt;ref name="formulaic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="formulaover"&gt;{{cite news | author = James Hibberd | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5160IN20090207 | title = Networks' new pilots favor formula over experiment | date = 2009-02-06 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | accessdate = 2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedurals are also generally less character-driven than serialized shows. However, some procedurals have more character emphasis than is typical of the format.&lt;ref name="duelling"&gt;{{cite news | author = | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/duelling-sleuths/2006/08/08/1154802894078.html | title = Duelling sleuths | date = 2006-08-10 | work = [[The Age]] | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nomystery"&gt;{{cite news | author = Bill Carter | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/17/arts/television/17ncis.html?_r=1 | title = No Mystery: Ratings Heat Up for ‘NCIS’ | date = 2008-11-16 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some may occasionally feature a storyline stretching over several episodes (often called a [[story arc]]).&lt;ref name="changes"&gt;{{cite news | author = Jason Hughes | url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/09/23/what-if-house-stopped-being-a-procedural/ | title = What if House stopped being a procedural? | date = 2009-09-23 | work = [[TVSquad]] | accessdate = 2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular variant is the [[police procedural]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11879">'''Queer of color critique''' is a methodology that recognizes the [[Intersectionality|intersections]] of race, gender, class, sexuality, capital, and nation, and disidentifies with the universality of social categories present in canonical [[sociology]] and historical materialism. [[Roderick Ferguson]] is credited with coining this term in his 2004 book ''Aberrations in Black, ''and draws from woman of color [[feminism]], postcolonial studies, [[queer theory]] and [[African-American studies|African American studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Valles-Morales, Jesus. "On Queer of Color Criticism, Communication Studies, and Corporeality. ''Kaleidoscope: A Graduate Journal of Qualitative Communication Research ''14 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In his critique of canonical sociology, Ferguson argues that racialized heteronormativity and heteropatriarchy has played a conspicuous role in shaping sociology and social policy, and recognizes its intersection with revolutionary nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Albertine, Susan. "Aberrations in Black: Toward a Queer of Color Critique (Book Review)." ''American Literature ''77.3 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Queer of color critique operates as a method for building unlikely coalitions across different identity categories. In framing queer of color critique, Ferguson draws from [[Barbara Smith]] and the [[Combahee River Collective|Combahee River Collective's]] use of coalitional politics to address gender, race, and sexuality in context with capitalist expansion.

== Influences  ==

Queer of color critique has been taken up by multiple scholars as an attempt at a more intersectional framework on which to build and extend their work in various, sometimes intersecting academic subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, José Esteban. Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota, 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Queerness and indigeneity ===

Though most references at the intersection of queerness and indigeneity fall on [[Two-Spirit]] identity and ideas surrounding it, queer of color critique extends the discussion to settler colonialism, future potentialities of Native identity and life, and general discourse about how [[Native American studies|Native Studies]] as an academic study can benefit from a sort of "queering". According to scholar [[Andrea Smith (academic)|Andrea Smith]], looking at indigeneity from this perspective questions the limitations of a "subjectless" or "postidentity" analysis in regards to the shedding of a particular ethnic identity, which in itself has roots in colonialist and nationalist ideology. On the other hand, even this sort of critique does not fully acknowledge the extent of the absence of indigeneity in the context of direct and indirect investment in settler colonialism by those of color doing the critiquing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Smith, Andrea. "Queer Theory and Native Studies: The Heteronormativity of Settler Colonialism." GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 16.1-2 (2010): 41-68. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgensen, Scott Lauria. ''Spaces between Us: Queer Settler Colonialism and Indigenous Decolonization''. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== De-colonial Studies ===
The unraveling of colonialist ideology,—the belief in a normative society—according to scholar [[Emma Perez]], is necessary to fully understand national histories and identities, specifically of queer individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perez|first=Emma|date=2003|title=Queering the Borderlands: The Challenges of Excavating the Invisible and Unheard|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/50898|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=24|pages=122–131|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Queer diasporic critique ===

Queer [[Diaspora|diasporic]] critique can be considered an extension of and complement to queer of color critique in that it considers ethnic and cultural identity as an underlying context when analyzing and critiquing arguments based on [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], white centered [[Queer theory|queer theories]], as well as critiquing the heteronormativity of [[area studies]]. Oftentimes, these ideas are connected to ideas of [[nationhood]] and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puar|first=Jasbir K.|date=2008-06-01|title='the Turban Is Not a Hat': Queer Diaspora and Practices of Profiling|journal=Sikh Formations|volume=4|issue=1|pages=47–91|doi=10.1080/17448720802075439|issn=1744-8727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lesk, Andrew. "Queerly Canadian: An Introductory Reader in Sexuality Studies Ed. by Maureen FitzGerald and Scott Rayter (review)." ''University of Toronto Quarterly''. University of Toronto Press, 28 Oct. 2015. Web. 29 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of scholar [[Gayatri Gopinath]], "While both queer of color and queer diasporic analysis are part of a collective endeavor to reshape queer studies through a thorough engagement with questions of race, nationalism, and transnationalism, it may also be useful to explore some of the points at which the interventions and emphases of each project both intersect and diverge." In this respect, critique emphasizing diaspora tends to focus more on a "global restructuring of capital and its attendant gender and sexual hierarchies" and the creation of "home" in regards to diaspora and [[transnationalism]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gopinath, Gayatri. "Bollywood Spectacles: Queer Diasporic Critique in the Aftermath of 9/11." Social Text 23.3-4 84-85 (2005): 157-69. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Queer Muslims ====

An example of queer of color critique in practice can be seen in the analysis of queer Muslims in Europe done by scholar [[Fatima El-Tayeb]], which touches on the larger themes explored in [[queer theory]]. Among these is the idea of "[[Coming out|coming-out]]" as a person of diaspora, which challenges the currently held notion of its role in the creation of a "normative, healthy and desirable LGBT identity". Another describes how the idea of [[Islamophobia]] permeates into the [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] oppressions faced by queer Muslims in the west. The ideas of migration and "home" are also critiqued in that the ethnic migrant laborer lives amongst an "increasingly segregated, criminalized and policed multi-ethnic population of color". These queer diasporic and queer of color critiques therefore act as a lens through which to view homonormativity and the various facets through which is functions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;El-Tayeb, F. "'Gays Who Cannot Properly Be Gay': Queer Muslims in the Neoliberal European City." European Journal of Women's Studies 19.1 (2012): 79-95. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Puar, Jasbir K. Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer times. Durham, NC: Duke UP, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a type of community manifestation of this type of critique, the queer of color activist group [[Strange Fruit: A Dutch Queer Collective]] takes an intersectional, colored approach to queer activism. This helps undermine binaries such as the "Muslim/European dichotomy to the normative coming out narrative", which, according to [[Fatima El-Tayeb|El-Tayeb]], perpetuate homonormativity and racism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Scholarship ===
Some notable scholars who have incorporated queer of color critique into their work are [[Roderick Ferguson]], Jesus Values-Morales, [[Andrea Smith (academic)|Andrea Smith]], [[Gayatri Gopinath]], Fatima El-Tayeb, Martin Manalansan IV, [[Juana María Rodríguez]], [[José Esteban Muñoz]], [[Emma Perez]], Edward Brockenbrough, Salvador Vidal-Ortiz, Amy Villarejo, [[Jasbir Puar]], Scott Lauria Morgensen, [[Kevin Kumashiro|Kevin K. Kumashiro]], [[Lawrence La Fountain-Stokes]], Chandan Reddy, Jennifer C. Nash, and others.

'''Regional geography''' is a major branch of [[geography]]. It focuses on the interaction of different cultural and natural geofactors in a specific land or landscape, while its counterpart, systematic geography, concentrates on a specific geofactor at the global level. 

== Basics ==
Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as natural elements, human elements, and [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalization]] which covers the techniques of delineating space into [[region]]s. Rooted in the tradition of the German speaking countries, the two pillars of regional geography are the idiographic study of ''Länder'' or spatial individuals (specific places, countries, continents) and the typological study of ''Landschaften'' or spatial types (landscapes such as coastal regions, mountain regions, border regions, etc.).

== Approach ==
Regional geography is also a certain approach to geographical study, comparable to [[quantitative revolution|quantitative geography]] or [[critical geography]]. This approach prevailed during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, a period when then regional geography paradigm was central within the geographical sciences. It was later criticised for its descriptiveness and the lack of theory. Strong criticism was leveled against it in particular during the 1950s and the [[quantitative revolution]]. Main critics were G. H. T. Kimble&lt;ref&gt;Kimble, G.H.T. (1951): ''The Inadequacy of the Regional Concept'', London Essays in Geography, edd. L.D. Stamp and S.W. Wooldridge, pp. 492-512.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred K. Schaefer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, F.K. (1953): ''Exceptionalism in Geography: A Methodological Examination'', [[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]], vol. 43, pp. 226-245.&lt;/ref&gt; The regional geography paradigm has influenced many other geographical sciences, including [[economic geography]] and [[geomorphology]]. Regional geography is still taught in some universities as a study of the major regions of the world, such as Northern and Latin America, Europe, and Asia and their countries. In addition, the notion of a city-region approach to the study of geography, underlining urban-rural interactions, gained credence since the mid-1980s. Some geographers have also attempted to reintroduce a certain amount of regionalism since the 1980s. This involves a complex definition of regions and their interactions with other [[scale (spatial)|scale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, G. and Jones, M. (2001): ''Renewing The Geography of Regions'', Environment and Planning D, 16(9), pp. 669-695.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable figures ==
Notable figures in regional geography were [[Alfred Hettner]] in Germany, with his concept of [[chorology]]; [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] in France, with the [[Possibilism (geography)|possibilism]] approach (possibilism being a softer notion than [[environmental determinism]]); and, in the United States, [[Richard Hartshorne]] with his concept of areal differentiation. The school of [[Carl O. Sauer]], strongly influenced by  Alfred Hettner and Paul Vidal de la Blache, is also seen as regional geography in its broadest sense.

The '''respective case''' (also called the '''dedative''' or '''relative''') is a [[grammatical case]] invented by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in his [[constructed language]] [[Quenya]] (the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|elven language]] of the book ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''). It is not clear if this case is used with [[preposition]]s, [[transitive verb|transitive]] or [[intransitive verb]]s, or has a more general use. Based on a few examples, one linguist has deduced the possibility that it is used as a kind of [[locative]] (e.g.: ''i coa i taures / i coa i tauressë'' the house in the forest).&lt;ref name="hf7"&gt;Helge Fauskanger, "[http://ardalambion.immaginario.net/ardalambion/quenya.htm#Heading7 'Quenya: L’antica lingua]'', “I sostantivi”, Gianluca Comastri, Italian trans., Ardalambion. Accessed 16 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible use is to translate expressions with the preposition “about.” For example, in translating “He told me about the invasion,” the Quenya word for “invasion” might appear in the respective/dedative. The seeming absence of any other case being used to translate this preposition lends support to this conjecture. In the constructed language [[Ithkuil]] the case corresponding to the preposition about is called '''Referential case'''&lt;ref name="Ithkuil-cases"&gt;[http://ithkuil.net/04_case.html A Grammar of Ithkuil Chapter 4: Case Morphology]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Love in a Tub.png|thumb|Refinement meets burlesque in Restoration comedy. In this scene from [[George Etherege]]'s ''Love in a Tub'', musicians and well-bred ladies surround a man who is wearing a tub because he has lost his trousers.]]

"'''Restoration comedy'''" is English [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710. [[Comedy of manners]] is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy.&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, Arthur [https://books.google.com/books?id=TD8xG2Jnc10C&amp;pg=PA149 ''British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan''] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; After public stage performances had been banned for 18 years by the [[Puritan]] regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signalled a renaissance of [[English drama]].&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Antitheatricality]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexually explicit language was encouraged by  [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] (1660–1685) personally and by the rakish style of his court. Historian [[George Norman Clark]] argues:

{{quote|The best-known fact about the Restoration drama is that it is immoral. The dramatists did not criticize the accepted morality about gambling, drink, love, and pleasure generally, or try, like the dramatists of our own time, to work out their own view of character and conduct. What they did was, according to their respective inclinations, to mock at all restraints. Some were gross, others delicately improper....The dramatists did not merely say anything they liked: they also intended to glory in it and to shock those who did not like it.&lt;ref&gt;George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660-1714'' (1956) p 369.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The socially diverse audiences included both aristocrats, their servants and hangers-on, and a substantial middle-class segment. These playgoers were attracted to the comedies by up-to-the-minute topical writing, by crowded and bustling plots, by the introduction of the first professional actresses, and by the rise of the first celebrity actors. This period saw the first professional female playwright, [[Aphra Behn]].

==Theatre companies==

===Original patent companies, 1660–1682===
[[Image:Settle-Morocco.png|thumb|The sumptuously decorated Dorset Gardens playhouse in 1673, with one of the sets for [[Elkannah Settle]]'s ''The Empress of Morocco''. The [[thrust stage|apron stage]] at the front which allowed intimate audience contact is not visible in the picture (the artist is standing on it).]] Charles II was an active and interested patron of the drama. Soon after his restoration, in 1660, he granted exclusive play-staging rights, so-called [[letters patent|Royal patents]], to the [[King's Company]] and the [[Duke's Company]], led by two middle-aged [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] playwrights, [[Thomas Killigrew]] and [[William Davenant]]. The patentees scrambled for performance rights to the previous generation's [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and Caroline plays, which were the first necessity for economic survival before any new plays existed. Their next priority was to build new, splendid [[patent theatre]]s in [[Drury Lane]] and [[Dorset Gardens]], respectively. Striving to outdo each other in magnificence, Killigrew and Davenant ended up with quite similar theatres, both designed by [[Christopher Wren]], both optimally provided for music and dancing, and both fitted with moveable scenery and elaborate machines for thunder, lightning, and waves.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dramatists of the Restoration renounced the tradition of satire, as recently embodied by [[Ben Jonson]], and devoted themselves to the [[comedy of manners]], which uncritically accepted the social code of the upper class.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p194"&gt;Hodgart (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dGrCooK63TsC&amp;pg=PA194 pp.194, 189]&lt;/ref&gt;

The audience of the early Restoration period was not exclusively [[noble court|courtly]], as has sometimes been supposed, but it was quite small and could barely support two companies. There was no untapped reserve of occasional playgoers. Ten consecutive performances constituted a smash hit. This closed system forced playwrights to be extremely responsive to popular taste. Fashions in the drama would change almost week by week rather than season by season, as each company responded to the offerings of the other, and new plays were urgently sought. The King's Company and the Duke's Company vied with one another for audience favour, for popular actors, and for new plays, and in this hectic climate the new [[genre]]s of [[heroic drama]], [[she-tragedy|pathetic drama]], and Restoration comedy were born and flourished.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, 17, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Company, 1682–1695===
Both the quantity and quality of the drama suffered when in 1682 the more successful Duke's Company absorbed the struggling King's Company, and the amalgamated ''United Company'' was formed. The production of new plays dropped off sharply in the 1680s, affected by both the monopoly and the political situation (see [[Restoration comedy#Decline of comedy, 1678–90|Decline of comedy]] below). The influence and the incomes of the actors dropped, too.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 38–48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 80s, predatory investors ("Adventurers") converged on the United Company, while management was taken over by the lawyer [[Christopher Rich (theatre manager)|Christopher Rich]]. Rich attempted to finance a tangle of "farmed" shares and sleeping partners by slashing salaries and, dangerously, by abolishing the traditional perks of senior performers, who were stars with the clout to fight back.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 51–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of the theatres, 1695–1700===
The company owners, wrote the young United Company employee [[Colley Cibber]], "who had made a monopoly of the stage, and consequently presum'd they might impose what conditions they pleased upon their people, did not consider that they were all this while endeavouring to enslave a set of actors whom the public were inclined to support."&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Performers like the legendary [[Thomas Betterton]], the tragedienne [[Elizabeth Barry]], and the rising young comedian [[Anne Bracegirdle]] had the audience on their side and, in the confidence of this, they walked out.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 68–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actors gained a Royal "licence to perform", thus bypassing Rich's ownership of both the original Duke's and King's Company patents from 1660, and formed their own cooperative company. This unique venture was set up with detailed rules for avoiding arbitrary managerial authority, regulating the ten actors' shares, the conditions of salaried employees, and the sickness and retirement benefits of both categories. The cooperative had the good luck to open in 1695 with the première of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]]'s famous ''Love For Love'' and the skill to make it a huge box-office success.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

London again had two competing companies. Their dash to attract audiences briefly revitalised Restoration drama, but also set it on a fatal downhill slope to the lowest common denominator of public taste. Rich's company notoriously offered [[Bartholomew Fair]]-type attractions – high kickers, jugglers, ropedancers, performing animals – while the co-operating actors, even as they appealed to snobbery by setting themselves up as the only legitimate theatre company in London, were not above retaliating with "prologues recited by boys of five, and epilogues declaimed by ladies on horseback".&lt;ref&gt;Dobrée, xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actors==
===First actresses===
[[File:Nell gwyn peter lely c 1675.jpg|thumb|[[Nell Gwynn]] was one of the first actresses and the mistress of Charles II.]]
Restoration comedy was strongly influenced by the introduction of the first professional actresses. Before [[London theatre closure 1642|the closing of the theatres]], all female roles had been taken by [[boy player]]s, and the predominantly male audiences of the 1660s and 1670s were curious, censorious, and delighted at the novelty of seeing real women engage in risqué repartee and take part in physical seduction scenes. [[Samuel Pepys]] refers many times in his famous diary to visiting the playhouse to watch or re-watch the performance of particular actresses, and to how much he enjoys these experiences.

Daringly suggestive comedy scenes involving women became especially common, although of course Restoration actresses were, just like male actors, expected to do justice to all kinds and moods of plays. (Their role in the development of Restoration tragedy is also important, compare [[She-tragedy]].)

A new speciality introduced almost as early as the actresses was the [[breeches role]], which called for an actress to appear in male clothes (breeches being tight-fitting knee-length pants, the standard male garment of the time), for instance to play a witty heroine who disguises herself as a boy to hide, or to engage in escapades disallowed to girls. A quarter of the plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700 contained breeches roles. Playing these [[cross-dressing]] roles, women behaved with the freedom society allowed to men, and some feminist critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, regard them as subversive of conventional [[gender roles]] and empowering for female members of the audience. Elizabeth Howe has objected that the male disguise, when studied in relation to playtexts, prologues, and epilogues, comes out as "little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object" to male patrons, by showing off her body, normally hidden by a skirt, outlined by the male outfit.&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Antitheatricality#Restoration theatre]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful Restoration actresses included Charles II's mistress [[Nell Gwyn]], the tragedienne [[Elizabeth Barry]] who was famous for her ability to "move the passions" and make whole audiences cry, the 1690s comedian [[Anne Bracegirdle]], and Susanna Mountfort (a.k.a. [[Susanna Verbruggen]]), who had many breeches roles written especially for her in the 1680s and 90s. Letters and memoirs of the period show that both men and women in the audience greatly relished Mountfort's swaggering, roistering impersonations of young women wearing breeches and thereby enjoying the social and sexual freedom of the male [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]].

===First celebrity actors===
[[Image:Thomas Betterton.gif|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Betterton]] played the irresistible Dorimant in [[George Etherege]]'s ''[[Man of Mode]].'' Betterton's acting ability was praised by [[Samuel Pepys]], [[Alexander Pope]], and [[Colley Cibber]].]]
During the Restoration period, both male and female actors on the London stage became for the first time public personalities and [[celebrity|celebrities]]. Documents of the period show audiences being attracted to performances by the talents of particular actors as much as by particular plays, and more than by authors (who seem to have been the least important draw, no performance being advertised by author until 1699). Although the playhouses were built for large audiences—the second Drury Lane theatre from 1674 held 2000 patrons – they were of compact design, and an actor's charisma could be intimately projected from the [[thrust stage]].

With two companies competing for their services from 1660 to 1682, star actors were able to negotiate star deals, comprising company shares and [[Benefit concert|benefit nights]] as well as salaries. This advantageous situation changed when the two companies were amalgamated in 1682, but the way the actors rebelled and took command of a new company in 1695 is in itself an illustration of how far their status and power had developed since 1660.

The greatest fixed stars among Restoration actors were Elizabeth Barry ("Famous Mrs Barry" who "forc 'd Tears from the Eyes of her Auditory") and [[Thomas Betterton]], both of them active in organising the actors' revolt in 1695 and both original patent-holders in the resulting actors' cooperative.

Betterton played every great male part there was from 1660 into the 18th century. After watching ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 1661, Samuel Pepys reports in his diary that the young beginner Betterton "did the prince's part beyond imagination." Betterton's expressive performances seem to have attracted playgoers as magnetically as did the novelty of seeing women on the stage. He was soon established as the leading man of the Duke's Company, and played Dorimant, the seminal irresistible [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]], at the première of [[George Etherege]]'s ''Man of Mode'' (1676). Betterton's position remained unassailable through the 1680s, both as the leading man of the United Company and as its stage manager and ''de facto'' day-to-day leader. He remained loyal to Rich longer than many of his co-workers, but eventually it was he who headed the actors' walkout in 1695, and who became the acting manager of the new company.

==Comedies==
Variety and dizzying fashion changes are typical of Restoration comedy. Even though the "Restoration drama" unit taught to college students is likely to be telescoped in a way that makes the plays all sound contemporary, scholars now have a strong sense of the rapid evolution of English drama over these forty years and of its social and political causes. The influence of theatre company competition and playhouse economics is also acknowledged.

[[File:John Lacy by John Michael Wright 1668-70.png|thumb|upright|[[John Lacy (playwright)|John Lacy]] was the favourite comic of King Charles II.]]
Restoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of [[Aphra Behn]] in the 1680s is to be noted. In the mid-1690s a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are extremely different from each other. An attempt is made below to illustrate the generational taste shift by describing ''The Country Wife'' (1675) and ''The Provoked Wife'' (1697) in some detail. These two plays differ from each other in some typical ways, just as a Hollywood movie of the 1950s differs from one of the 1970s. The plays are not, however, offered as being "typical" of their decades. Indeed, there exist no typical comedies of the 1670s or the 1690s; even within these two short peak-times, comedy types kept mutating and multiplying.

===Aristocratic comedy, 1660–1680===
The drama of the 1660s and 1670s was vitalised by the competition between the two patent companies created at the Restoration, as well as by the personal interest of Charles II, and the comic playwrights rose to the demand for new plays. They stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] plays, and even from [[Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Classics|classical]] comedies, and combined the looted plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized "variety" within as well as between plays. Early Restoration audiences had little enthusiasm for structurally simple, well-shaped comedies such as those of [[Molière]]; they demanded bustling, crowded multi-plot action and fast pace. Even a splash of high heroic drama might be thrown in to enrich the comedy mix, as in [[George Etherege]]'s ''Love in a Tub'' (1664), which has one heroic verse "conflict between love and friendship" plot, one urbane wit comedy plot, and one burlesque pantsing plot. (''See illustration, top right''.) Such incongruities contributed to Restoration comedy being held in low esteem in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, but today the early Restoration total theatre experience is again valued on the stage, as well as by [[postmodern]] academic critics.

The unsentimental or "hard" comedies of [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]], and [[George Etherege]] reflected the atmosphere at Court, and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic [[machismo|macho]] lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous Restoration rake (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). Wycherley's ''[[The Plain Dealer (play)|The Plain Dealer]]'' (1676), a variation on the theme of [[Molière]]'s ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'', was highly regarded for its uncompromising satire and earned Wycherley the appellation "Plain Dealer" Wycherley or "Manly" Wycherley, after the play's main character Manly. The single play that does most to support the charge of [[obscenity]] levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's ''[[The Country Wife]]'' (1675). [[Image:William Wycherley.png|thumb|[[William Wycherley]], ''[[The Country Wife]]'': "O Lord, I'll have some china too. Good Master Horner, don't think to give other people china, and me none. Come in with me too."]]

====Example. William Wycherley, ''The Country Wife'' (1675)====
''[[The Country Wife]]'' has three interlinked but distinct plots, which each project sharply different moods:

1. Horner's [[impotence]] trick provides the main plot and the play's organising principle. The upper-class town rake Horner mounts a campaign for seducing as many respectable ladies as possible, first spreading a false rumour of his own impotence, to be allowed where no complete man may go. The trick is a great success and Horner has sex with many married ladies of virtuous reputation, whose husbands are happy to leave him alone with them. In one famously outrageous scene, the "China scene", sexual intercourse is assumed to take place repeatedly just off stage, where Horner and his mistresses carry on a sustained [[double entendre]] [[dialogue]] purportedly about Horner's china collection. ''The Country Wife'' is driven by a succession of near-discoveries of the truth about Horner's sexual prowess (and thus the truth about the respectable ladies), from which he extricates himself by quick thinking and good luck. Horner never becomes a reformed character, but keeps his secret to the end and is assumed to go on merrily reaping the fruits of his planted misinformation, past the last act and beyond.

2. The married life of Pinchwife and Margery is based on Molière's ''[[School for Wives]]''. Pinchwife is a middle-aged man who has married an ignorant young country girl in the hope that she will not know to cuckold him. However, Horner teaches her, and Margery cuts a swathe through the sophistications of London marriage without even noticing them. She is enthusiastic about the virile handsomeness of town gallants, rakes, and especially theatre actors (such self-referential stage jokes were nourished by the new higher status of actors), and keeps Pinchwife in a state of continual horror with her plain-spokenness and her interest in sex. A running joke is the way Pinchwife's [[pathological jealousy]] always leads him into supplying Margery with the very type of information he wishes her not to have.

3. The courtship of Harcourt and Alithea is a comparatively uplifting love story in which the [[wit]]ty Harcourt wins the hand of Pinchwife's sister Alithea from the hands of the Upper-class town snob Sparkish, to whom she was engaged until discovering he loved her only for her money.

===Decline of comedy, 1678–1690===
When the two companies were amalgamated in 1682 and the London stage became a monopoly, both the number and the variety of new plays being written dropped sharply. There was a swing away from comedy to serious political drama, reflecting preoccupations and divisions following on the [[Popish Plot]] (1678) and the [[Exclusion Crisis]] (1682). The few comedies produced also tended to be political in focus, the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] dramatist [[Thomas Shadwell]] sparring with the [[Tory|Tories]] [[John Dryden]] and [[Aphra Behn]]. Behn's unique achievement as an early professional woman writer has been the subject of much recent study.

===Comedy renaissance, 1690–1700===
During the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the "softer" comedies of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] and [[John Vanbrugh]] reflected mutating cultural perceptions and great social change. The playwrights of the 1690s set out to appeal to more socially mixed audiences with a strong middle-class element, and to female spectators, for instance by moving the war between the sexes from the arena of intrigue into that of marriage. The focus in comedy is less on young lovers outwitting the older generation, more on marital relations after the wedding bells. [[Thomas Southerne]]'s dark ''[[The Wives' Excuse]]'' (1691) is not yet very "soft": it shows a woman miserably married to the [[fop]] Friendall, everybody's friend, whose follies and indiscretions undermine her social worth, since her honour is bound up in his. Mrs Friendall is pursued by a would-be lover, a matter-of-fact rake devoid of all the qualities that made Etherege's Dorimant charming, and she is kept from action and choice by the unattractiveness of all her options. All the humour of this "comedy" is in the subsidiary love-chase and fornication plots, none in the main plot.

In Congreve's ''[[Love for Love]]'' (1695) and ''[[The Way of the World]]'' (1700), the  "wit duels" between lovers typical of 1670s comedy are underplayed. The give-and-take set pieces of couples still testing their attraction for each other have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the famous "Proviso" scene in ''The Way of the World'' (1700). Vanbrugh's ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'' (1697) follows in the footsteps of Southerne's ''Wives' Excuse'', with a lighter touch and more humanly recognisable characters.

====Example. John Vanbrugh, ''The Provoked Wife'' (1697)====
[[Image:John Vanbrugh.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Vanbrugh]], ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'': "These are good times. A woman may have a gallant and a separate maintenance too."]]
''The Provoked Wife'' is something of a Restoration [[problem play]] in its attention to the subordinate legal position of married women and the complexities of "divorce" and separation, issues that had been highlighted in the mid-1690s by some notorious cases before the [[House of Lords]] (see Stone).

Sir John Brute in ''The Provoked Wife'' is tired of matrimony. He comes home drunk every night and is continually rude and insulting to his wife. She is meanwhile being tempted to embark upon an affair with the witty and faithful Constant. Divorce is not an option for either of the Brutes at this time, but forms of legal separation have recently come into existence, and would entail a separate maintenance to the wife. Such an arrangement would not allow remarriage. Still, muses Lady Brute, in one of many discussions with her niece Bellinda, "These are good times. A woman may have a gallant and a separate maintenance too."

Bellinda is at the same time being grumpily courted by Constant's friend Heartfree, who is surprised and dismayed to find himself in love with her. The bad example of the Brutes is a constant warning to Heartfree to not marry.

''The Provoked Wife'' is a talk play, with the focus less on love scenes and more on discussions between female friends (Lady Brute and Bellinda) and male friends (Constant and Heartfree). These exchanges are full of jokes, but are also thoughtful and have a dimension of melancholy and frustration.

After a forged-letter complication, the play ends with marriage between Heartfree and Bellinda and stalemate between the Brutes. Constant continues to pay court to Lady Brute, and she continues to shilly-shally.

===End of comedy===
The tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out at the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did. Interconnected causes for this shift in taste were [[demographic]] change, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, [[William III of England|William]]'s and [[Mary II of England|Mary]]'s dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]] (founded in 1692). When [[Jeremy Collier]] attacked Congreve and Vanbrugh in his ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'' in 1698, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place. At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of ''The Way of the World'', Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by the drama of obvious sentiment and exemplary morality.

==After Restoration comedy==
===Stage history===
During the 18th and 19th centuries, the sexual frankness of Restoration comedy ensured that theatre producers cannibalised it or adapted it with a heavy hand, rather than actually performed it. Today, Restoration comedy is again appreciated on the stage. The classics, Wycherley's ''The Country Wife'' and ''The Plain-Dealer'', Etherege's ''The Man of Mode'', and Congreve's ''Love For Love'' and ''The Way of the World''  have competition not only from Vanbrugh's ''The Relapse'' and ''The Provoked Wife'', but from such dark, unfunny comedies as [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''The Wives Excuse''. Aphra Behn, once considered unstageable, has had a major renaissance, with ''The Rover'' now a repertory favourite.

===Literary criticism===
Distaste for sexual impropriety long kept Restoration comedy not only off the stage but also locked in a critical poison cupboard. Victorian critics like [[William Hazlitt]], although valuing the linguistic energy and "strength" of the [[wiktionary:canon|canonical]] writers Etherege, Wycherley, and Congreve, always found it necessary to temper aesthetic praise with heavy moral condemnation. Aphra Behn received the condemnation without the praise, since outspoken sex comedy was considered particularly offensive coming from a woman author. At the turn of the 20th century, an embattled minority of academic Restoration comedy enthusiasts began to appear, for example the important editor [[Montague Summers]], whose work ensured that the plays of Aphra Behn remained in print.

"Critics remain astonishingly defensive about the masterpieces of this period", wrote Robert D. Hume as late as 1976. It is only over the last few decades that that statement has become untrue, as Restoration comedy has been acknowledged a rewarding subject for high theory analysis and Wycherley's ''[[The Country Wife]]'', long branded the most obscene play in the English language, has become something of an academic favourite. "Minor" comic writers are getting a fair share of attention, especially the post-Aphra Behn generation of women playwrights which appeared just around the turn of the 18th century: [[Delarivier Manley]], [[Mary Pix]], [[Catharine Trotter]], and [[Susannah Centlivre]]. A broad study of the majority of never-reprinted Restoration comedies has been made possible by Internet access (by subscription only) to the first editions at the [[British Library]].

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Ribaldry''', or '''blue comedy''', is [[humor]]ous [[entertainment]] that ranges from bordering on indelicacy to gross [[morality|indecency]]. It is also referred to as "bawdiness", "gaminess" or "bawdy".

Sex is presented in ribald material more for the purpose of poking fun at the foibles and weaknesses that manifest themselves in [[human sexuality]], rather than to present sexual stimulation either excitingly or artistically. Also, ribaldry may use sex as a [[metaphor]] to illustrate some non-sexual concern, in which case ribaldry may verge on the territory of [[satire]].

Like any humour, ribaldry may be read as conventional or [[subversive]]. Ribaldry typically depends on a shared background of sexual conventions and values, and its [[comedy]] generally depends on seeing those conventions broken.

The ritual taboo-breaking that is a usual counterpart of ribaldry underlies its controversial nature and explains why ribaldry is sometimes a subject of [[censorship]]. Ribaldry, whose usual aim is ''not'' "merely" to be sexually stimulating, often does address larger concerns than mere sexual appetite. However, being presented in the form of comedy, these larger concerns may be overlooked by censors.

Ribaldry differs from [[black comedy]] (or gallows humor) in that black comedy deals with topics which would normally considered painful or frightening whereas ribaldry deals with topics that would only be considered offensive.

==Examples==
Ribaldry is present to some degree in every culture and has likely been around for all of human history. Works like ''[[Lysistrata]]'' by [[Aristophanes]], ''[[Menaechmi]]'' by [[Plautus]], ''[[Satyricon|Cena Trimalchionis]]'' by [[Petronius]], and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' of [[Apuleius]] are ribald classics from [[Classical Antiquity|ancient Greece and Rome]]. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|The Miller's Tale]]" from his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' and ''[[The Crabfish]]'', one of the oldest English traditional ballads, are classic examples. The Frenchman [[François Rabelais]] showed himself to be a master of ribaldry (technically called [[grotesque body]]) in his ''[[Gargantua]]'' and other works. ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' by [[Laurence Sterne]] and ''[[The Lady's Dressing Room]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]] are also in this genre; as is [[Mark Twain]]'s long-suppressed ''[[1601 (Mark Twain)|1601]]''.

Another example of ribaldry is "[[De Brevitate Vitae]]", a song which in many [[Europe]]an-influenced universities is both a student beer-drinking song and an anthem sung by official university [[choir]]s at public graduation ceremonies. The private and public versions of the song contain vastly different words. More recent works like ''[[Candy (Southern and Hoffenberg novel)|Candy]]'', ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'', ''[[L'Infermiera]]'', the comedic works of [[Russ Meyer]], ''[[Little Annie Fanny]]'' and [[John Barth]]'s ''[[The Sot-Weed Factor]]'' are probably better classified as ribaldry than as either pornography or erotica.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Bawdy song==&lt;!--[[Bawdy song]] redirects directly here--&gt;
A '''bawdy song''' is a humorous song that emphasises sexual themes and is often rich with [[innuendo]]. Historically these songs tend to be confined to groups of young males, either as students or in an environment where alcohol is flowing freely. An early collection was ''[[Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy]]'', edited by Thomas D'Urfey and published between 1698 and 1720. Selected songs from ''Wit and Mirth'' have been recorded by the [[City Waites]] and other singers. Sailor's songs tend to be quite frank about the exploitative nature of the relationship between men and women. There are many examples of folk songs in which a man encounters a woman in the countryside. This is followed by a short conversation, and then sexual  intercourse, e.g. "The Game of All Fours". Neither side demonstrates any shame or regret. If the woman becomes pregnant, the man will not be there anyway. [[Rugby football|Rugby]] songs are often bawdy. Examples of bawdy folk songs are: "[[Seventeen Come Sunday]]" and "[[The Ballad of Eskimo Nell]]". [[Robert Burns]] compiled ''The Merry Muses of Caledonia'' (the title is not Burns's), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century. In modern times [[Hash House Harriers]] have taken on the role of tradition-bearers for this kind of song. ''The Unexpurgated Folk Songs of Men'' (Arhoolie 4006) is a gramophone record containing a collection of American bawdy songs recorded in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Sandberg, L. &amp; Weissman, D. (1976) ''The Folk Music Sourcebook''. New York: Knopf; p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue comedy==
Blue comedy is comedy that is [[off-color]], [[wiktionary:risqué|risqué]], [[morality|indecent]] or [[profanity|profane]], largely about sex. It often contains [[profanity]] or sexual imagery that may shock and offend some audience members.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

"Working blue" refers to the act of using curse words and discussing things that people do not discuss in "polite society". A "blue comedian" or "blue comic" is a [[comedian]] who usually performs risqué routines layered with curse words. 

There is a common belief that comedian [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]] (1894–1963) coined the phrase, after his stage act which involved telling jokes from either a white book or a blue book, chosen by audience preference (the blue book contained ribald jokes). This is not so, as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' contains earlier references to the use of blue to mean ribald: 1890 ''Sporting Times'' 25 Jan. 1/1 "''Shifter wondered whether the damsel knew any novel blue stories.''" and 1900 ''Bulletin'' (Sydney) 20 Oct. 12/4 "''Let someone propose to celebrate [[Geoffery Chaucer|Chaucer]] by publicly reading some of his bluest productions unexpurgated. The reader would probably be locked up.''"

Private events at show business clubs such as the Bob Saget Club and The Masquers often showed this blue side of otherwise cleancut Bob Saget; a recording survives of one Masquers roast from the 1950s with [[Jack Benny]], [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], [[George Burns]], and [[Art Linkletter]] all using highly risqué material and obscenities. Many comedians who are normally family-friendly might choose to work blue when off-camera or in an adult-oriented environment; [[Bob Saget]] exemplifies this [[dichotomy]]. [[Bill Cosby]]'s 1969 record album [[8:15 12:15]] records both his family-friendly evening standup comedy show, and his blue midnight show, which included a joke about impregnating his wife "right through the old midnight trampoline" (her [[Diaphragm (birth control)|diaphragm]]) and other sexual references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/r234485 |title=Bill Cosby: 8:15 12:15 - Bill Cosby &amp;#124; AllMusic |first=Sean |last=Carruthers |work=allmusic.com |year=2011 |accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some comedians build their careers on blue comedy. Among the best known of these are [[Redd Foxx]], [[Lawanda Page]], and the team of Leroy and Skillet, all of whom later performed on the family-friendly television show [[Sanford and Son]]. Page, Leroy, and Skillet specialized in a particular [[African American]] form of blue spoken word recitation called [[Signifyin'|signifying or toasting]]. [[Dave Attell]] has also been described by his peers as one of the greatest modern-day blue comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MMPC|title=Bill Burr - Christopher Cross / Go See Dave Attell|date=2016-03-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTih1ZnwVs8|accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On [[talk radio]] in the United States, many commentators use blue comedy in their political programs. Examples include [[Neal Boortz]], Eric Von Haessler, [[Phil Hendrie]] and [[Preston and Steve|Steve Morrison]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

[[File:BelorusianSkomorokhs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Belarus]]ian skomorokhs as they appear in a 1555 German etching]]

A '''skomorokh''' (скоморох in [[Russian language|Russian]], скоморохъ in [[Old East Slavic]], скоморaхъ in [[Church Slavonic]]) was a [[medieval]] East Slavic [[harlequin]], or actor, who could also sing, dance, play musical instruments and compose for oral/musical and dramatic performances. The [[etymology]] of the word is not completely clear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fshare%2Fstarling%2Fmorpho&amp;morpho=1&amp;basename=%5Cusr%5Clocal%5Cshare%5Cstarling%5Cmorpho%5Cvasmer%5Cvasmer&amp;first=1&amp;text_word=%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%85&amp;method_word=substring Vasmer's Etymological Dictionary entry for skomorokh]&lt;/ref&gt; There are hypotheses that the word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] σκώμμαρχος (cf. σκῶμμα, "joke"); from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''scaramuccia'' ("joker", cf. [[English language|English]] ''[[scaramouch]]''); from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''masẋara''; and many others.

The skomorokhs appeared in [[Kievan Rus]] no later than the mid-11th century, but [[fresco]] depictions of skomorokh musicians in the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] date to the 11th century.

The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' on skomorokhs concurs with the period. The monk chronicler denounced them as devil servants. Furthermore, the Orthodox Church often railed against them and other elements of popular culture as being irreverent, detracting from the worship of God or being downright diabolical. For example [[Theodosius of Kiev]], one of the co-founders of the Caves Monastery in the 11th century, called the skomorokhs "evils to be shunned by good Christians".&lt;ref&gt;Feodosii Pecherskii, ''Sochinenia'', I. I. (Izmail Ivanovich) Sreznevksii, ed., in ''Ucheniia zapiski vtorogo otdelenie Imperatorskoi Akademii Nauk'', Vol. 2, no. 2, (St. Petersburg: Tipografii Imperatorskoi Akademii Nauk, 1856), 195; See Russell Zguta, "Skomorokhi: The Russian Minstrel-Entertainers", ''Slavic Review'' 31 No. 2 (June 1972), 297&amp;ndash;298; Idem, ''Russian Minstrels: A History of the Skomorokhi'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Their art was related and addressed to the common people and usually opposed the ruling groups, who considered them not just useless but even ideologically detrimental and dangerous by both the feudalists and the clergy.

They were persecuted in the years of the [[Mongol yoke]], when the church strenuously propagated ascetic living. Its art reached its peak in the 15th to the 17th centuries. Their repertoire included mock songs, dramatic and satirical sketches, called ''glumy'' (глумы), performed in masks and skomorokh dresses to the sounds of [[domra]], [[balalaika]], [[gudok]], [[bagpipes]] or [[buben]] (a kind of [[tambourine]]). The appearance of [[Russian puppet theatre]] was directly associated with skomorokh performances.

Skomorokhs performed in the streets and city squares, engaging with the spectators to draw them into their play. Usually, the main character of the skomorokh performance was a fun-loving saucy ''[[muzhik]]'' (мужик) of comic simplicity. In the 16 and 17th centuries, skomorokhs would sometimes combine their efforts and perform in a ''vataga'' (ватага, big crowd) numbering 70 to 100 people. The skomorokhs were often persecuted by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and civilian authorities. 

In 1648 and 1657, [[Tsar]] [[Alexis I of Russia|Alexei Mikhailovich]] issued [[ukase]]s banning skomorokh art as blasphemous, but actors would still occasionally perform during popular celebrations. In the 18th century, skomorokh art gradually died away; passing on some of its traditions to the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|balagans|ru|3=Балаган}}'' (балаган) and ''[[rayok]]s'' (раёк).

In [[literary criticism]], '''stream of unconsciousness''' is a [[narrative mode]] that portrays an individual's point of view by transcribing the author's [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] dialogue or ''[[somniloquy]]'' during sleep, in connection to his or her actions within a [[dream]].&lt;ref&gt;"Episode 5: Recent Sleep Works." ''Glossolalia''. [http://glossolalia-ailalossolg.blogspot.com/2010/05/episode-5.html], Resonance 104.4 FM, London. 17 May 2010. Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream of unconsciousness is characterized by disjointed leaps in ideation and story line, bizarre new word creation, loss of self-censorship, one sided conversations and punctuation that can make the prose both disturbing and difficult to follow.  Despite the name, the stream of unconsciousness occurs more in the form of waves than an actual continuous running stream of dialogue. The stream of unconsciousness is one of several forms of [[dramatic monologue]], where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person. Such monologues are commonly used in [[poetry]] and [[drama]], but with the stream of unconsciousness, the audience or third persons are 'unknowingly' imaginary.  It is primarily a fictional device and often takes the form of a [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;"Razen: The Science of Sleep". [http://www.foxydigitalis.com/foxyd/?p=15396], USA. 04 Aug. 2011 Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was introduced to the field of literary studies from that of the independent music industry, where it was redefined by author and artist [[Bryan Lewis Saunders]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"Stream of Unconconscious on Stand-Up Tragedy" [http://antonmobin.blogspot.com/2011/06/stream-of-unconscious-on-stand-up.html], France. 13 June 2011 Web.&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly a century the term has been both a misnomer and a [[malapropism]] for the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]].

==History==
The audio recordings of [[Dion McGregor]] (1922–1994) can be perceived as one of the precursors of the 'stream of unconsciousness' (narrative mode), although his monlogues and somniloquy were never transcribed and presented as such.  "Dreams" (1995) by contemporary American artist [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]] is a collection of  illustrations and extremely detailed dream descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;"Dreams".[https://www.blumandpoe.com/content/jim-shaw-dreams], Los Angeles. 2008 Web.&lt;/ref&gt; "Experiment with Dreams" by [[Leif Elggren]] and Thomas Liljenberg (Stockholm Feb. 1996) may also be attributed to the formation of this method.&lt;ref&gt;"Experiment with Dreams". [http://web.comhem.se/elggren/experiment.html], Stockholm. Feb. 1996 Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==

Examples of notable works employing the stream of unconsciousness narrative mode are:
*"Le Bobcat" Bryan Lewis Saunders and Raymond Dijkstra. Short Story on Cassette ([[Fragment Factory]] 2010)
*"The Reasons Why I Dream With Knives" Bryan Lewis Saunders. Nonfiction Book (Stand-Up Tragedy 2010)
*"The Confessor" is a book on tape composed of 24 album chapters on 12 audio cassettes.  With each album serving as a chapter, over 24 musicians and experimental sound artists created music for the unconscious epic poem by Bryan Lewis Saunders. "The Confessor" was created from app. 30 nights of somniloquy and dream descriptions. Poem and Book on Tape (Stand-Up Tragedy 2011)
*"Protective Geometry" [[Ed Pinsent]] and Bryan Lewis Saunders. Comic Book. (2012)

      <comment>/* Critical reactions */ Removed irrelevant critical reaction, mind viruses do not necessarily have to be negative, the concept of religions as mind viru is simply an attempt to explain their propagation.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">"'''Viruses of the Mind'''" is an essay by British evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], first published in the book ''Dennett and His Critics: Demystifying Mind'' (1993).  Dawkins originally wrote the essay in 1991 and delivered it as a [[Voltaire Lecture]] on 6 November 1992 at the [[Conway Hall Humanist Centre]].  The essay discusses how religion can be viewed as a [[meme]], an idea previously expressed by Dawkins in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976).  Dawkins analyzes the propagation of religious ideas and behaviors as a memetic virus, analogous to how  [[virus|biological]] and [[computer virus]]es spread.  The essay was later published in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) and its ideas are further explored in the television programme, ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]'' (2006).

==Content==
Dawkins defines the "symptoms" of being infected by the "virus of religion", providing examples for most of them, and tries to define a connection between the elements of religion and its survival value (invoking [[Amotz Zahavi|Zahavi]]'s [[handicap principle]] of [[sexual selection]], applied to believers of a religion). Dawkins also describes religious beliefs as "mind-parasites", and as "gangs &lt;nowiki&gt;[that]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will come to constitute a package, which may be sufficiently stable to deserve a collective name such as Roman Catholicism ... or ... component parts to a single virus".

Dawkins suggests that religious belief in the "faith-sufferer" typically shows the following elements:
* It is impelled by some deep, inner conviction that something is true, or right, or virtuous: a conviction that doesn't seem to owe anything to [[evidence]] or reason, but which, nevertheless, the believer feels as totally compelling and convincing.
* The believer typically makes a positive virtue of faith's being strong and unshakable, despite it not being based upon evidence.
* There is a conviction that "mystery", ''per se'', is a good thing; the belief that it is not a virtue to solve mysteries but to enjoy them and revel in their insolubility.
* There may be intolerant behaviour towards perceived rival faiths, in extreme cases even the killing of opponents or advocating of their deaths. Believers  may be similarly violent in disposition towards [[Apostasy|apostates]] or [[Heresy|heretics]], even if those espouse only a slightly different version of the faith.
* The particular convictions that the believer holds, while having nothing to do with evidence, are likely to resemble those of the believer's parents.
* If the believer is one of the rare exceptions who follows a different religion from his parents, the explanation may be cultural transmission from a charismatic individual.
* The internal sensations of the 'faith-sufferer' may be reminiscent of those more ordinarily associated with sexual love.

Dawkins stresses his claim that religious beliefs do not spread as a result of evidence in their support, but typically by cultural transmission, in most cases from parents or from charismatic individuals. He refers to this as involving "[[epidemiology]], not evidence". Further Dawkins distinguishes this process from the spread of scientific ideas, which, he suggests, is constrained by the requirement to conform with certain virtues of standard methodology: "testability, evidential support, precision, quantifiability, consistency, intersubjectivity, repeatability, universality, progressiveness, independence of cultural milieu, and so on". He points out that faith "spreads despite a total lack of every single one of these virtues".

==Critical reactions==
[[Alister McGrath]], a Christian theologian, has also commented critically on Dawkins' analysis, suggesting that "memes have no place in serious scientific reflection",&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'' p. 125 quoting [[Simon Conway Morris]] is support&lt;/ref&gt; that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p.  126&lt;/ref&gt; that "evolution" of ideas is more [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] than Darwinian,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests there is no evidence that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' (pp. 137–138)&lt;/ref&gt; McGrath also cites a metareview of 100 studies and argues that "If religion is reported as having a positive effect on human well-being by 79% of recent studies in the field, how can it conceivably be regarded as analogous to a virus?"&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p. 136 citing Koenig and Cohen ''The Link between Religion and Health'' OUP 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
