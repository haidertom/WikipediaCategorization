      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20217">'''The 10 Essential Public Health Services''' is a US government document which codifies the responsibilities of [[public health]] agencies and institutions in the United States.&lt;ref name="i"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP): 10 Essential Public Health Services." Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/nphpsp/essentialservices.html. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==
Organized according to the "three fundamental purposes of public health" — assessment, policy development, and assurance — the essential services include the following:

===Assessment===
*Monitor and evaluate health status to identify community health problems.
*Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community.

===Policy development===
*Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues.
*Mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems.
*Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts.

===Assurance===
*Enforce laws and regulations that protect and ensure public health and safety.
*Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable.
*Assure a competent public and personal health care workforce.
*Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of personal and population-based health services.
*Research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems.

==History==
In 1988, the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) released an assessment of the U.S. public health system titled, ''The Future of Public Health''. The report described the network of county, state, and national public health agencies as being in "disarray" and prompted a national discussion about the state of public health in the country. Questioning the ability of existing public health systems to provide essential services, the report sought to establish a comprehensive framework delineating the "three fundamental purposes of public health." These purposes included "assessment, policy development, and assurance."&lt;ref name="iii"&gt;Institute of Medicine. Committee for the Study of the Future of Public Health. (1988). The future of public health. Washington DC: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though health policy academicians identified with and understood the IOM framework, policy makers found its highly conceptual language difficult to apply. Therefore, as part of President Clinton’s 1994 healthcare reform efforts, a federal working-group was tasked with reviewing and supplementing the framework. Under the auspices of both the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s]] (CDC) Public Health Practice Program Office and the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the group sought to
#explain what public health is,
#clarify the role of public health within the larger healthcare system, and
#provide accountability by linking public health performance to health outcomes.

These efforts culminated in the publication of ''The Essential Services of Public Health'' in late 1994.&lt;ref name="iv"&gt;Harrell JA, Baker EL. The essential services of public health. Leadership Public Health. 1994;3(3): 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;
Public Health Units
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/phu/locations.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
The report was well received. Public health agencies and professional organizations began to align guidelines and employ self-assessment tools in support of the ten Essential Services.&lt;ref name="v"&gt;Scutchfield, F. D., Mays, G. P., &amp; Lurie, N. (2009). Applying Health Services Research to Public Health Practice: An Emerging Priority. Health Services Research, 44(5p2), 1775–1787. {{doi|10.1111/j.1475-6773.2009.01007.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC launched a number of research projects aimed at developing strategies for measuring how well public health agencies provided the services. Many of these studies were the first of their kind and ushered in an era of health agency monitoring and assessment.&lt;ref name="vi"&gt;Miller, C. A., K. S. Moore, T. B. Richards, and C. McKaig. 1994. "A Screening Survey to Assess Local Public Health Performance." Public Health Report 109 (5): 659–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vii"&gt;Turnock, B. J., and A. S. Handler. 1997. "From Measuring to Improving Public Health Practice." Annual Review of Public Health 18: 261–282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="viii"&gt;Handler, A. S., B. J. Turnock, W. Hall, S. Potsic, J. Munson, R. Nalluri, and E. H. Vaughn. 1995. "A Strategy for Measuring Local Public Health Practice." American Journal of Preventive Medicine 11 (6 Suppl): 29–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the CDC and several national public health associations launched the [https://www.cdc.gov/nphpsp/ National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP)]. With the goal of developing a consensus-based set of performance standards for state and local public health delivery systems, the NPHPSP adopted the Essential Public Health Services as "the fundamental framework" underpinning its assessment strategy. The NPHPSP consists of three instruments — The State Public Health System Assessment, The Local Public Health System Assessment, and The Local Public Health Governance Assessment — and covers the gamut of public health action as described by the Essential Public Health Services.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

==List of services==

===Monitor and evaluate health status to identify community health problems===
It is essential for public health organizations to monitor and evaluate the health status of populations in order to identify trends and to target health resources. Components of this service include: utilization of appropriate tools to interpret and disseminate data to audiences of interest; collaboration in integrating and managing public health; and accurate and periodic assessment of the community’s health status.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Specifically, public health organizations can monitor and evaluate the health status of their populations by creating a disease reporting system, community health profiles, and health surveys. For example, the Los Angeles Department of Public Health completes a Los Angeles County Health Survey (LACHS) every two to four years to obtain population-based data.&lt;ref name="ix"&gt;County of Los Angeles Public Health. "Frequently Asked Questions About The Los Angeles County Health Survey" Retrieved from http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/ha/LAC HS_FAQs.htm. Accessed on 2/7/13.&lt;/ref&gt; This information is used for public health assessment and planning and for evaluating changes in health over time in Los Angeles County.

===Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community===
In order to appropriately allocate public health resources, it is essential to diagnose and investigate health problems and hazards in the community. Components in this service include: population-based screening of diseases; access to public health laboratories capable of completing rapid screening and high volume testing; and epidemiologic investigations of disease outbreaks and patterns of disease.&lt;ref name="i"/&gt; The Los Angeles County Health and Examination Survey (LA HANES) was piloted in 2011 and aims to establish a profile description of health outcomes of residents of Los Angeles County (e.g. adult obesity and cardiovascular disease is monitored via collection of physical measurements such as blood pressure and body mass index). These survey results will inform public education and chronic disease prevention efforts. Emergency preparedness is also an essential component of public health organizations. Teams must be available and prepared to combat natural disasters, severe weather, outbreaks, [[bioterrorism]], mass casualties and chemical emergencies.

===Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues===
Once public health priorities have been established through monitoring and investigation of health problems in the community, educational activities that promote improved health should be disseminated. Components in this service include: both the availability of health information and educational resources and the presence of health education and health promotion programs.&lt;ref name="i"/&gt; This can be achieved through media advocacy and social marketing. An example of this is the Eat Less, Weigh Less campaign executed by the [[Los Angeles County Department of Public Health]] that aims to increase awareness about appropriate portion sizes using advertisements on buses, billboards and social media.&lt;ref name="x"&gt;Choose Health LA. "Eat Healthy." Retrieved from http://www.choosehealthLA.com/eat-healthy/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217055003/http://www.choosehealthla.com/eat-healthy/ |date=2013-02-17 }}. Accessed on 2/4/13.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also essential to establish health education and health promotion program partnerships with organizations in the community, such as schools, churches and employment facilities.

===Mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems===
Public health organizations on the local, state and national level can mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems. Components of this service include: building coalitions to utilize the full range of available resources; convening and facilitating partnerships that will undertake defined health improvement projects; and provide assistance to partners and communities to solve health problems.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Of particular importance is identification of potential stakeholders who will contribute to or benefit from public health activities. [[First 5 LA]] is a community partner who supports targeted programs that address the needs of Los Angeles County children ages zero to five and their families.&lt;ref name="xi"&gt;[[First 5 LA]]. "Champions of Our Children." Retrieved from http://www.first5la.org/About-Us. Accessed on 2/5/13.&lt;/ref&gt; They work closely with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to improve the physical and emotional health of this population. It is important to note that many of these stakeholders may not be considered to be health-related at first glance. For example, organizations involved in urban planning may be influential in improving the health of its residents. This could include increasing the walkability of a community or the number of parks or bike trails in a neighborhood.

===Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts===
Policies can be effective in modifying human behavior and reducing negative health outcomes. Components in this service include: development of policy to guide the practice of public health; alignment of resources and strategies for community health efforts; and systematic health planning strategies to guide community health improvement.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; In response to increasing rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease, the New York City Board of Health passed a ban on the sale of sodas and other sugary drinks larger than 16&amp;nbsp;ounces at restaurants, street carts and movie theaters.&lt;ref name="xii"&gt;The New York Times. "New York Plans to Ban Sale of Big Sizes of Sugary". Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/nyregion/bloomberg-plans-a-ban-on-large-sugared-drinks.html?pagewanted=all. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to policies that can support health efforts, laws can reduce negative health outcomes. For example, dram shop liability is a law that holds the owner or server at a bar or restaurant where a patron consumed their last alcoholic beverage responsible for injuries or deaths caused as a result of alcohol-related incidents. A systematic review completed by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services, found strong evidence of the effectiveness of this law in reducing alcohol-related harms.&lt;ref name="xiii"&gt;Rammohan, V, et al. "Effects of Dram Shop Liability and Enhanced Overservice Law Enforcement Initiatives on Excessive Alcohol Consumption and Related Harms: Two Community Guide Systematic Reviews." Am J Prev Med 2011;41(3):334 –343.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforce laws and regulations that protect and ensure public health and safety===
It is important that individuals and organizations comply with existing laws and regulations in order to ensure the overall health and safety of the general public. Components of this service include: reviewing, evaluating, and revising laws and regulations put in place to protect the health and safety of the public; educating persons and organizations about these laws and regulations to improve compliance and encourage enforcement of them; and enforcing actions that protect the health of the public (e.g., protection of drinking water; enforcement of clean air standards; enforcement of laws prohibiting the sale of alcoholic and tobacco products to minors, of laws concerning the use of seat belts and child safety seats; mandating childhood immunizations; facilitating timely follow-ups in the event of hazards and outbreaks of exposure-related diseases; monitoring quality of health services; conducting the timely review of new drugs, biologics, and medical devices; ensuring food safety; and enforcing housing and sanitation codes).&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

===Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable===
Having access to care when it is needed is important in helping individuals prevent and avoid unfavorable health outcomes and medical costs. At the local level, components of this service include: identifying populations that face barriers to accessing health services and addressing their personal health needs, assuring the linkage of these populations to appropriate health services by coordinating provider services, and developing and implementing interventions that address the barriers they face in attempting to access care. At the state and governance levels, components of this service include: assessing access to and availability of state health services; partnering with public, private, and non-profit sectors to provide a coordinated system of health care; assuring access to this coordinated health care system by using outreach efforts that link individuals to the health services they need; developing and implementing a continuous improvement process to assure the equitable distribution of resources for those in greatest need of these services.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; The National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) employs this service idea as one of the action steps for achieving increased access to care and improved health outcomes for people living with HIV.&lt;ref name="xiv"&gt;The White House. "Implementing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy: Overview of the Agency Operational Plans." Retrieved from http://aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-operational-plan-overview.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213232017/http://aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-operational-plan-overview.pdf |date=2013-02-13 }}. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assure a competent public and personal health care workforce===
Health care workers and staff who are competent (i.e., skilled in the core principles of public health practice) are more likely to provide care and other services more effectively and efficiently compared to those who are not. Components of this service include: making sure that the workforce meets the health needs of the population, maintaining public health workforce standards by developing and implementing efficient licensure and credentialing processes and incorporating core public health competencies into personnel systems, and adopting continuous quality improvement methods and long-term learning opportunities for public health workforce members.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; In two 2002 reports, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended instituting a certification examination as a way of ensuring minimum competence in public health.&lt;ref name="xv"&gt;Institute of Medicine (IOM). "The Future of the Public’s Health in the 21st Century." Retrieved from http://iom.edu/Reports/2002/The-Future-of-the-Publics-Health-in-the-21st-Century.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811070844/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/The-Future-of-the-Publics-Health-in-the-21st-Century.aspx |date=2010-08-11 }}. Accessed on 2/7/13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xvi"&gt;Institute of Medicine (IOM). "Who Will Keep the Public Healthy: Educating Public Health Professionals for the 21st Century." Retrieved from http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/Who-Will-Keep-the-Public-Healthy-Educating-Public-Health-Professionals-for-the-21st-Century.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131227130612/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/Who-Will-Keep-the-Public-Healthy-Educating-Public-Health-Professionals-for-the-21st-Century.aspx |date=2013-12-27 }}. Accessed on 2/7/13&lt;/ref&gt; Web-based training strategies may be useful in providing the long-term learning opportunities that many current and upcoming public health workers need in order to serve as well-informed advocates of public health and safety.&lt;ref name="xvii"&gt;Ballew, P. et al. "Developing web-based training for public health practitioners: what can we learn from a review of five disciplines?" Health Education Research. 2012;1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of personal and population-based health services ===
Given scarce resources, it is important to keep track of whether or not programs and/or policies end up producing intended outcomes. Components of this service include: assessing the accessibility, quality and effectiveness of services and programs delivered; providing policymakers with the information they need in order to make well-informed decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources; tracking efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of services analyzing data on health status and service utilization; and striving to improve the public health system’s capacity to well serve the population.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Cost-effectiveness analysis has been proposed as one possible strategy for informing policymakers on how best to allocate health care resources.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;Eichler, H, Kong, SX, Gerth, WC, and Mavros, P. "Use of cost-effectiveness analysis in health-care resource allocation decision-making: how are cost-effectiveness thresholds expected to emerge." Value in Health. 2004;7(5): 518-528.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems ===
Through research, the health and health care problems that individuals face can be better understood, and therefore be better and more appropriately addressed given the evidence provided by such research efforts. Components of this service include: fostering the development of a continuum of innovative solutions for health programming in terms of both practical field-based efforts as well as academic efforts, establishing a consortium of research institutions and other institutions of higher learning to encourage more collaborative and cross-cutting efforts, and ensuring the public health system’s capacity to perform timely epidemiological and health policy analyses.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

The 5-SPICE framework was developed by clinicians and researchers from [[Partners In Health]], [[Harvard Medical School]], and [[Brigham and Women’s Hospital]] in Boston, MA.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palazuelos|first=Daniel|author2=Kyla Ellis |author3=Dana DeEun Im |author4=Matthew Peckarsky |author5=Daniel Schwartz|title=5-SPICE: the application of an original framework for community health worker program design, quality improvement and research agenda setting|journal=Global Health Action|date=April 3, 2013|volume=6|doi=10.3402/gha.v6i0.19658|pmid=23561023|pmc=3617878|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework lays out a model for integrating community health workers into public health systems, learning from the experiences Partners In Health and partner organizations at their project sites in resource-poor settings around the world.&lt;ref name="pih"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Health Workers|url=http://www.pih.org/priority-programs/community-health-workers/about|publisher=Partners In Health|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  5-SPICE draws upon experiences from Haiti, Rwanda, Lesotho, Liberia, Nepal, Mali, and elsewhere, where CHWs have been employed to improve patient outcomes and overcome personnel shortages.&lt;ref name="pih_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Work|url=http://www.pih.org/our-work|publisher=Partners In Health|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework allows for all stakeholders in a community health program to participate in discussions and analyses to strengthen the impact of CHWs.

==Background==
5-SPICE allows for all stakeholders in a community health program to participate in discussions and analyses to strengthen the impact of community health workers.

The name 5-SPICE is derived from Chinese cuisine emphasizing the balance between inputs and elements. The five main elements form an acronym:
*Supervision (especially management plans and structures)
*Partners (especially ownership and stewardship)
*Incentives (part of the larger theme of motivation)
*Choice (how CHWs are recruited to work and why they take the job)
*Education (what CHWs bring to their job and how they are trained) &lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

These elements are not a static list, but a way to holistically analyze how core programmatic elements affect each other in the field. In the [[Freire, Paulo|Freirean]] tradition of awareness, the 5-SPICE model emphasizes facilitated discussion and contemplation among stakeholders, particularly CHWs, to maximize program outputs. Ultimately, the 5-SPICE framework allows program implementers to study the relationship between the health system and the local community.

Other CHW program frameworks exist, such as the CHW Assessment and Improvement Matrix (AIM) developed by the USAID-funded Health Care Improvement (HCI) project.&lt;ref name="hciproject"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Health Worker Assessment and Improvement Matrix (CHW AIM): A Toolkit for Improving CHW Programs and Services|url=http://www.hciproject.org/node/2359|publisher=USAID|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  5-SPICE complements these other frameworks by providing an acronym that condenses the many elements discussed in other frameworks into an easy-to-remember heuristic, allowing for more effective and efficient assessments that are exploratory rather than prescriptive.

==Scholarly Dissemination==

The 5-SPICE framework was first formally introduced in an April 2013 publication in [[Global Health Action]], in an article entitled “5-SPICE: the application of an original framework for community health worker program design, quality improvement and research agenda setting.”&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;  The framework was subsequently presented at the 2013 Consortium of Universities for Global Health Conference,&lt;ref name=CUGH&gt;{{cite web|title=5-SPICE: An Original Framework for Community Health Worker Program Design, Quality Improvement and Research Agenda Setting|url=http://cugh.conferencespot.org/APP_TECH.34/APP_TECH.34/1|publisher=Consortium of Universities for Global Health|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the 2013 Swedish Society of Medicine’s annual conference, Global Health—Beyond 2015.&lt;ref name=Sweden&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond 2015|url=http://www.sls.se/GlobalHealth/Om-konferensen/Editorial/|publisher=Swedish Medical Society|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article has also been accepted for presentation at the 2013 Annual Meeting of the  [[American Public Health Association]].&lt;ref name=APHA&gt;{{cite web|title=A unique non-linear chw program framework for quality improvement|url=https://apha.confex.com/apha/141am/webprogram/Paper284734.html|publisher=APHA|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''African Nutrition Leadership Programme (ANLP)''' is a 10 days training course that started in 2002 to assist the development of future leaders in the field of human nutrition in Africa. The emphasis of the programme is on understanding and developing the qualities and skills of leaders, team building, communication and understanding nutrition information in a broader context.  The long-term aim of the ANLP is to meet the demands for leadership in Africa to solve its nutritional challenges.

The programme is designed for individuals who have experience in various fields of nutrition. Preference will be given to candidates with a postgraduate qualification, postdoctoral fellows and candidates with comparable working experience in the broader human nutrition sciences, studying or working in Africa.

==Vision==
The ANLP is a leadership development and networking seminar aimed at assisting the development of future leaders in the field of human nutrition in Africa.  Emphasis is placed on understanding the qualities and skills of leaders, team building, communication and nutrition information in a broader context, and to understanding the role of nutrition science in the world around us.

==Modules==
* [[Leadership]]
* [[Communication]]

'''Age-related mobility disability''' is a self-reported inability to walk due to impairments, limited mobility, [[dexterity]] or [[Endurance|stamina]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ward, Rachel E. et al. “Sensory and Motor Peripheral Nerve Function and Incident Mobility Disability.” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 62.12 (2014): 2273–2279. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found mostly in older adults with decreased strength in lower extremities.&lt;ref name="Guralnik, Jack M. 2000"&gt;Guralnik, Jack M., et al. "Lower extremity function and subsequent disability consistency across studies, predictive models, and value of gait speed alone compared with the Short Physical Performance Battery." The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 55.4 (2000): M221-M231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

According to the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]], the population of older adults is expected to increase in the United States by 2030 due to the aging population of the [[baby boomer]] generation; this will increase the population of mobility [[disabled]] individuals in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Feasley, Jill C., ed. Health outcomes for older people: Questions for the coming decade. National Academies, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This raises the importance of being able to predict disability due to inability to walk at an early stage, which will eventually decrease health care costs. Aging cause a decrease in physical strength and in lower extremities which ultimately leads to decrease in functional mobility,&lt;ref name="Guralnik, Jack M. 2000"/&gt;  in turn leading to disability which is shown to be common in women due to differences in distribution of resources and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Zunzunegui, M. V., et al. "The mobility gap between older men and women: the embodiment of gender." Archives of gerontology and geriatrics 61.2 (2015): 140-148.&lt;/ref&gt; The early detection of mobility disabilities will help clinicians and patients in determining the early management of the conditions which could be associated with the future disability. Mobility disabilites are not restricted to older and [[hospitalized]] individuals; such disabilities have been reported in young and non-hospitalized individuals as well due to decreased functional mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Iezzoni, Lisa I et al. “Mobility Difficulties Are Not Only a Problem of Old Age.” Journal of General Internal Medicine 16.4 (2001): 235–243. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in the rate of disability causes loss of functional independence &lt;ref&gt;Fried, Linda P., and Jack M. Guralnik. "Disability in older adults: evidence regarding significance, etiology, and risk." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 45.1 (1997): 92-100., Hirvensalo, Mirja, Taina Rantanen, and Eino Heikkinen. "Mobility difficulties and physical activity as predictors of mortality and loss of independence in the community‐living older population." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 48.5 (2000): 493-498.&lt;/ref&gt; and increases the risk of future [[chronic diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuben, David B., et al. "Value of functional status as a predictor of mortality: results of a prospective study." The American journal of medicine 93.6 (1992): 663-669., Manton, Kenneth G. "A longitudinal study of functional change and mortality in the United States." Journal of Gerontology 43.5 (1988): S153-S161., Khokhar, Shafiq R., et al. "Persistent mobility deficit in the absence of deficits in activities of daily living: a risk factor for mortality." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 49.11 (2001): 1539-1543.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- As we have come across the importance of early detection of disability due to inability to walk, the question arises, in which conditions a person has decreased functional mobility or is disabled.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} --&gt;

==Definition==

There are many definitions that contribute in providing the meaning of mobility disability, it is stated as the “self-reports of a lot of difficulties or inability to walk a quarter section|quarter of a mile” &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; without sitting and within time limit of fifteen minutes &lt;ref&gt;Fried, Linda P., and Jack M. Guralnik. "Disability in older adults: evidence regarding significance, etiology, and risk." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 45.1 (1997): 92-100., Gill, Thomas M., et al. "The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254., Vestergaard, Sonja et al. “Stopping to Rest during a 400-Meter Walk and Incident Mobility Disability in Older Persons with Functional Limitations.” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 57.2 (2009): 260–265. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017., Marsh, Anthony P. et al. “Muscle Strength and BMI as Predictors of Major Mobility Disability in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Pilot (LIFE-P).” The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 66A.12 (2011): 1376–1383. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to walk within this time frame results in the use of [[mobility aid]] devices such as [[mobility scooter]], [[wheelchair]], [[crutches]] or a [[walker (mobility)|walker]] which will eventually help in the community [[ambulation]]. Another term that is coined to define mobility disabilities based on performance is “performance based mobility disability”.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Noreen et al. “Performance-Based Measures of Physical Function as Mortality Predictors: Incremental Value beyond Self-Reports.” Demographic research 30.7 (2014): 227–252. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the inability to increase your walking speed more than 0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;Tinetti, Mary E., et al. "Shared risk factors for falls, incontinence, and functional dependence: unifying the approach to geriatric syndromes." Jama 273.17 (1995): 1348-1353., Rantanen, Taina, et al. "Coimpairments: strength and balance as predictors of severe walking disability." The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 54.4 (1999): M172-M176., Melzer, David et al. “The Apolipoprotein E e4 Polymorphism Is Strongly Associated With Poor Mobility Performance Test Results But Not Self-Reported Limitation in Older People.” The Journals of Gerontology. Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 60.10 (2005): 1319–1323. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; If an individual is unable to walk at &gt;0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s, he or she is considered severely disabled and would require a [[mobility device]] to walk in community.

==Risk factors==

There are number of factors that could be associated with [[mobility disability]], but according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], “[[stroke]] is found to be the leading cause of [[mobility disability]], in turn reducing functional mobility in more than half of the [[stroke]] survivors above 65 years of age”.&lt;ref&gt;Mozaffarian, Dariush, et al. "Executive summary: Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2016 update: A report from the American Heart Association." Circulation 133.4 (2016): 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==

There are several measurement scales designed to detect mobility disabilities. The measures that can detect mobility disabilities are classified into two categories, [[self-reported]] measures and performance measures. There is a need to differentiate between these measures based on their ability to detect mobility disabilities, such as differences in their reliability and [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Self-reported measures are commonly used to detect mobility disabilities,&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Walter H., et al. "Self‐Reported Causes of Physical Disability in Older People: The Cardiovascular Health Study." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 42.10 (1994): 1035-1044., Odding, E et al. “Association of Locomotor Complaints and Disability in the Rotterdam Study.” Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases 54.9 (1995): 721–725. Print., Leveille, Suzanne G, Linda Fried, and Jack M Guralnik. “Disabling Symptoms: What Do Older Women Report?” Journal of General Internal Medicine 17.10 (2002): 766–773. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017., Keenan, Anne‐maree, et al. "Impact of multiple joint problems on daily living tasks in people in the community over age fifty‐five." Arthritis Care &amp; Research 55.5 (2006): 757-764., Mottram, Sara, et al. "Patterns of pain and mobility limitation in older people: cross-sectional findings from a population survey of 18,497 adults aged 50 years and over." Quality of Life Research 17.4 (2008): 529-539.&lt;/ref&gt; but recently developed performance measures have been shown to be effective in predicting future mobility disabilities in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Thomas M., et al. "The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-reported measures===

Several [[qualitative research]] studies use [[survey (human research)]], [[questionnaires]] and [[self-reported]] scales to detect a decrease in functional mobility or to predict future [[mobility disability]] in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Pruitt, Leslie A. et al. “Use of Accelerometry to Measure Physical Activity in Older Adults at Risk for Mobility Disability.” Journal of aging and physical activity 16.4 (2008): 416–434. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages of these [[qualitative research]] scales are easier [[data acquisition]] and can be performed on the larger population. Although there is difference in [[perception]] of condition between subjects (gender difference), type of [[chronic conditions]] and age-related changes such as memory and reasoning, all of which can affect the information and scores of the individual, still [[self-reported]] measures have been used extensively in behavioral and [[correlation]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;Baranowski, Tom. "Validity and reliability of self-report measures of physical activity: an information-processing perspective." Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport 59.4 (1988): 314-327.&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly used [[self-reported]] measures to detect [[mobility disability]] are [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=934 Stroke Impact scale], [https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/detail.htm;jsessionid=B3230195781CD0E8FB1AD4FBA904F317?category=Disabilities&amp;variable=rosbsum Rosow- Breslau scale], [[Barthel index]], [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=899 Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale]. 
Based on reliability and validity of these scales, [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=934 Stroke Impact scale] has proven to have excellent [[test-retest reliability]] and [[construct validity]], however, if it can predict future mobility disability in older adults is yet to be found. In contrast, [https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/detail.htm;jsessionid=B3230195781CD0E8FB1AD4FBA904F317?category=Disabilities&amp;variable=rosbsum Rosow- Breslau scale], [[Barthel Index]] and [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=899 Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale] proved important to predict future [[mobility disability]] based on the activities involved in these [[questionnaire]] scales.

===Performance-based measures===

Mobility disabilities due to age-related [[musculoskeletal]] pain or increase in [[chronic condition|chronic]] conditions are easier to detect by performance measures.  Some commonly used performance measures to detect mobility disabilities are the 400-meter walking test, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.1790010108/pdf 5-minute walk test ], [[walking speed]],  [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test]. 
Among these measures, [http://www.bu.edu/bostonroc/performance-based-measures-pbm-core/400-meter-walk/ 400-meter walk test] and [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test] has been proven to be strong predictors of [[mobility disability]] in older adults. In addition to prediction, there is moderate to excellent [[correlation]] between these two tests.&lt;ref&gt;Vasunilashorn, Sarinnapha et al. “Use of the Short Physical Performance Battery Score to Predict Loss of Ability to Walk 400 Meters: Analysis From the InCHIANTI Study.” The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 64A.2 (2009): 223–229. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Based on reliability and validity of measurement scales to predict [[mobility disability]], [[self-reported]] measures such as [[Barthel index]], and [[performance]] measures such as [http://www.bu.edu/bostonroc/performance-based-measures-pbm-core/400-meter-walk/ 400 m walk test] and  [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test] are strongly associated with prediction of mobility disability in older adults.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these studies are conducted with a large number of subjects; one involved nearly 80,000 and another 140,000 subjects.

Findings are inconclusive because alcohol itself contains 7 [[calorie]]s per gram, but research suggests that alcohol energy is not efficiently used. Alcohol also appears to increase [[Metabolism|metabolic rate]] significantly, thus causing more calories to be burned rather than stored in the body as [[fat]] (Klesges ''et al.'', 1994). Other research has found consumption of [[sugar]] to decrease as consumption of alcohol increases.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

According to Dr. Kent Bunting, the research results do not necessarily mean that people who wish to lose weight should continue to consume alcohol because consumption is known to have an enhancing effect on appetite. Due to these discrepancies in findings, the relationship between alcohol and weight remains unresolved and requires further research.

Biological and environmental factors are thought to contribute to alcoholism and obesity.&lt;ref name="Alcohol Studies 2003"&gt;UNC Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies. Alcoholism and Obesity: Overlapping Brain Pathways? Center Line. Vol 14, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The physiologic commonalities between excessive eating and excessive alcohol drinking shed light on intervention strategies, such as pharmaceutical compounds that may help those who suffer from both.
Some of the brain signaling proteins that mediate excessive eating and weight gain also mediate uncontrolled alcohol consumption.&lt;ref name="Alcohol Studies 2003"/&gt; Some physiological substrates that underlie food intake and alcohol intake have been identified. Melanocortins, a group of signaling proteins, are found to be involved in both excessive food intake and alcohol intake.&lt;ref&gt;Thiele et al.

Alcohol may contribute to obesity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5861">'''Autoerotic fatalities''' are accidental [[death]]s that occur during [[Autoeroticism|sexual self-stimulation]] when an apparatus, device or prop that is being employed to enhance pleasure causes the death.&lt;ref name="sauvageau2014" /&gt; Researchers only apply the term to unintentional deaths resulting from solitary sexual activity, not [[suicide]] or acts with a partner.&lt;ref name="sauvageau2014" /&gt; The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of autoerotic fatalities in Western countries is around 0.5 per million inhabitants each year.&lt;ref name="sauvageau2014"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sauvageau, A. | year = 2014 | title = Current Reports on Autoerotic Deaths—Five Persistent Myths | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-013-0430-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autoerotic asphyxia]] is the leading cause. 70 to 80% of autoerotic deaths are caused by hanging, while 10 to 30% are attributed to plastic bags or chemical use. Both of these lead to [[autoerotic asphyxia]]. 5 to 10% are related to [[electrocution]], foreign body insertion, overdressing/body wrapping, or another atypical method.&lt;ref name="sauvageau2014" /&gt; Specific causes include the use of chemicals such as [[amyl nitrite]], [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]], or [[nitrous oxide]], and props and tools such as knives, oversized dildos, ligatures or bags for asphyxiation, duct tape, electrical apparatus for shocks, water for self-immersion, fire-making equipment for self-immolation, or sharp, unhygienic or large fetishized objects. Male victims are much more likely to use a variety of devices during autoerotic behaviour than female victims.

The subject has been treated in two books, ''Autoerotic Fatalities'' by Hazelwood et al. (1983) and ''Autoerotic Asphyxiation: Forensic, Medical, and Social Aspects'' by Sheleg et al. (2006).

'''Contraindications to breastfeeding''' are those conditions that could compromise the health of the infant if breast milk from their mother is consumed. One example of this is [[galactosemia]]. This is. If the mother has [[HIV]] or antiviral therapy, untreated active [[tuberculosis]], [[Human T-lymphotropic virus 1]] or [[Human T-lymphotropic virus 2|II]], uses [[illicit drugs]], or mothers undergoing [[chemotherapy]] or [[radiation treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/139/5/e20170647|title=The Breastfeeding-Friendly Pediatric Office Practice|first1=Joan Younger|last1=Meek|first2=Amy J.|last2=Hatcher|first3=Section On|last3=Breastfeeding|date=1 May 2017|publisher=|journal=Pediatrics|volume=139|issue=5|pages=e20170647|accessdate=6 August 2017|via=pediatrics.aappublications.org|doi=10.1542/peds.2017-0647|pmid=28557776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/disease/index.htm|title=Diseases and Conditions  - Breastfeeding - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breastfeeding contradiction is an act of breastfeeding a child while the mother has conditions such as an addiction or disease. Breast milk contains many nutrients that formulas in store shelves do not have which makes breast feeding a healthier and ideal way to feed an infant.[[Breastfeeding contraindications#cite note-3|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Breastfeeding contraindications can occur if a mother does not take medication or seek medical advice prior to breast. The effects of the contradiction can do damage to both the infant and even the mother. It is important to explore the factors that can do damage that way a mother can be informed and well educated on the subject manner.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drugabuse.com/library/cocaine-while-breastfeeding|title=Using Cocaine While Breastfeeding - DrugAbuse.com|website=drugabuse.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{infobox cadmium}}
'''Cadmium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Cd''' and [[atomic number]] 48. This soft, bluish-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in [[group 12 element|group 12]], [[zinc]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Like zinc, it demonstrates [[oxidation state]] +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the [[transition metal]]s in [[group 3 element|groups 3]] through [[group 11 element|11]]. Cadmium and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]] in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled ''d'' or ''f'' electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by [[Friedrich Stromeyer|Stromeyer]] and [[Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann|Hermann]], both in Germany, as an impurity in [[zinc carbonate]].

Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used for a long time as a corrosion-resistant plating on [[steel]], and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow [[cadmium pigments|pigment]]s, to color [[colored glass|glass]], and to stabilize [[plastic]]. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is [[toxicity|toxic]] (it is specifically listed in the European [[ROHS|Restriction of Hazardous Substances]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book

Although cadmium has no known biological function in higher organisms, a cadmium-dependent [[carbonic anhydrase]] has been found in marine [[diatom]]s.

Although cadmium usually has an [[oxidation state]] of +2, it also exists in the +1 state.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous [[cadmium oxide]] (CdO); the [[crystal]]line form of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated, similar to [[zinc oxide]]. [[Hydrochloric acid]], [[sulfuric acid]], and [[nitric acid]] dissolve cadmium by forming [[cadmium chloride]] (CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[cadmium sulfate]] (CdSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), or [[cadmium nitrate]] (Cd(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The oxidation state +1 can be produced by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and [[aluminium chloride]], forming the Cd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cation, which is similar to the Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cation in [[mercury(I) chloride]].&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;

{{Main|Isotopes of cadmium}}
Naturally occurring cadmium is composed of 8 [[isotope]]s. Two of them are [[radionuclide|radioactive]], and three are expected to [[radioactive decay|decay]] but have not done so under laboratory conditions. The two natural radioactive isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;113&lt;/sup&gt;Cd ([[beta decay]], half-life is 7.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; years) and &lt;sup&gt;116&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (two-neutrino [[double beta decay]], half-life is 2.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; years). The other three are &lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, &lt;sup&gt;108&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (both [[double electron capture]]), and &lt;sup&gt;114&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on these half-lives have been determined. At least three isotopes&amp;nbsp;– &lt;sup&gt;110&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, &lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, and &lt;sup&gt;112&lt;/sup&gt;Cd&amp;nbsp;– are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are &lt;sup&gt;109&lt;/sup&gt;Cd with a half-life of 462.6 days, and &lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;Cd with a half-life of 53.46 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 2.5 hours, and the majority have half-lives of less than 5 minutes. Cadmium has 8 known [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;113m&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1⁄2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 14.1 years), &lt;sup&gt;115m&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1⁄2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 44.6 days), and &lt;sup&gt;117m&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1⁄2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 3.36 hours).&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;

The known isotopes of cadmium range in [[atomic mass]] from 94.950 [[atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Cd) to 131.946 u (&lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;Cd). For isotopes lighter than 112 u, the primary [[decay mode]] is [[electron capture]] and the dominant [[decay product]] is element 47 ([[silver]]). Heavier isotopes decay mostly through [[beta emission]] producing element 49 ([[indium]]).&lt;ref name="NUBASE"/&gt;

One isotope of cadmium, &lt;sup&gt;113&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, absorbs neutrons with high selectivity:  With very high probability, neutrons with energy below the ''cadmium cut-off'' will be absorbed; those higher than the ''cut-off will be transmitted''. The cadmium cut-off is about 0.5&amp;nbsp;eV, and neutrons below that level are deemed slow neutrons, distinct from intermediate and fast neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;

Cadmium is created via the [[s-process]] in low- to medium-mass stars with masses of 0.6 to 10 [[Sun|solar masses]], over thousands of years. In that process, a [[silver]] atom captures a [[neutron]] and then undergoes [[beta decay]].&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Friedrich Strohmeyer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Friedrich Stromeyer]]]]
Cadmium ([[Latin]] ''cadmia'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''καδμεία'' meaning "[[Calamine (mineral)|calamine]]", a cadmium-bearing mixture of minerals that was named after the Greek mythological character Κάδμος, [[Cadmus]], the founder of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]]) was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] simultaneously in 1817 by [[Friedrich Stromeyer]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann]], both in [[Germany]], as an impurity in zinc carbonate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Stromeyer found the new element as an impurity in [[zinc carbonate]] (calamine), and, for 100 years, Germany remained the only important producer of the metal. The metal was named after the Latin word for calamine, because it was found in this zinc ore. Stromeyer noted that some impure samples of calamine changed color when heated but pure calamine did not. He was persistent in studying these results and eventually isolated cadmium metal by [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and reducing the [[cadmium sulfide|sulfide]]. The potential for cadmium yellow as pigment was recognized in the 1840s, but the lack of cadmium limited this application.&lt;ref&gt;

Even though cadmium and its compounds are toxic in certain forms and concentrations, the [[British Pharmaceutical Codex]] from 1907 states that [[cadmium iodide]] was used as a [[medication]] to treat "enlarged joints, scrofulous glands, and chilblains".&lt;ref&gt;

In 1907, the [[International Astronomical Union]] defined the international [[ångström]] in terms of a red cadmium spectral line (1 wavelength = 6438.46963&amp;nbsp;Å).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thesciencedictionary.org/international-angstrom/ |title=International Angstrom |website=Science Dictionary |date=2013-09-14 |accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sizes.com/units/angstrom.htm |title=angstrom or ångström |website=Sizes.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was adopted by the 7th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] in 1927.  In 1960, the definitions of both the [[metre]] and ångström were changed to use [[krypton]].&lt;ref&gt;

After the industrial scale production of cadmium started in the 1930s and 1940s, the major application of cadmium was the coating of iron and steel to prevent corrosion; in 1944, 62% and in 1956, 59% of the cadmium in the United States was used for [[plating]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YB1956"&gt;

The stabilizing effect of cadmium chemicals like the carboxylates cadmium laurate and cadmium stearate on [[Pvc|PVC]] led to an increased use of those compounds in the 1970s and 1980s. The demand for cadmium in pigments, coatings, stabilizers, and alloys declined as a result of environmental and health regulations in the 1980s and 1990s; in 2006, only 7% of to total cadmium consumption was used for plating, and only 10% was used for pigments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
At the same time, these decreases in consumption were compensated by a growing demand for cadmium for nickel-cadmium batteries, which accounted for 81% of the cadmium consumption in the United States in 2006.&lt;!-- The overall consumption of cadmium has decreased by more than 90% from the 1970s till 2008.--&gt;&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. The only cadmium [[mineral]] of importance, [[greenockite]] (Cd[[sulfur|S]]), is nearly always associated with [[sphalerite]] (ZnS). This association is caused by geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium, with no geological process likely to separate them. Thus, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct of mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, [[lead]] and [[copper]]. Small amounts of cadmium, about 10% of consumption, are produced from secondary sources, mainly from dust generated by recycling iron and steel scrap. Production in the United States began in 1907,&lt;ref name="Cadold"/&gt; but wide use began after World War I.&lt;ref name="price"&gt;

Titanium embrittlement from cadmium-plated tool residues resulted in banishment of those tools (and the implementation of routine tool testing to detect cadmium contamination) in the A-12/SR-71, U-2, and subsequent aircraft programs that use titanium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-12/breaking-through-technological-barriers.html|title = CIA&amp;nbsp;– Breaking Through Technological Barriers&amp;nbsp;– Finding The Right Metal (A-12 program)|date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear fission===
Cadmium is used in the control rods of nuclear reactors, acting as a very effective "neutron poison" to control [[neutron flux]] in [[nuclear fission]].&lt;ref name="HgCdPb"/&gt; When cadmium rods are inserted in the core of a nuclear reactor, cadmium absorbs neutrons, preventing them from creating additional fission events, thus controlling the amount of reactivity. The [[pressurized water reactor]] designed by [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] uses an alloy consisting of 80% silver, 15% indium, and 5% cadmium.&lt;ref name="HgCdPb"/&gt;

=== Televisions ===
[[Quantum dot display|QLED TVs]] have been starting to include cadmium in construction. Some companies have been looking to reduce the environmental impact of human exposure and pollution of the material in televisions during production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/are-quantum-dot-tvs-and-their-toxic-ingredients-actually-better-for-the-environment-35953|title=Are quantum dot TVs – and their toxic ingredients – actually better for the environment?|last=Maynard|first=Andrew|work=The Conversation|access-date=2017-07-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various cadmium salts are used in paint pigments, with CdS as a [[Cadmium pigments|yellow pigment]] being the most common. [[Cadmium selenide]] is a red pigment, commonly called ''cadmium red''. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — so much so that during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into [[watercolor]]s, [[gouache]]s, [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]], and other paint and pigment formulations.

Cadmium is a component of some compound [[semiconductor]]s, such as cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide, and [[cadmium telluride]], used for light detection and [[solar cell]]s. [[HgCdTe]] is sensitive to [[infrared]]&lt;ref name="HgCdPb"/&gt; light and can be used as an infrared detector, motion detector, or switch in remote control devices.

In molecular biology, cadmium is used to block voltage-dependent calcium channels from fluxing calcium ions, as well as in [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] research to stimulate [[proteasome]]-dependent degradation of [[Hypoxia-inducible factors|Hif-1α]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = European Journal of Biochemistry|volume = 267|issue = 13|pages = 4198–4204|date = 2000|doi = 10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01453.x|title = Cadmium blocks hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1-mediated response to hypoxia by stimulating the proteasome-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha|first = Chun Y.

Cadmium is also an environmental hazard. Human exposure is primarily from fossil fuel combustion, phosphate fertilizers, natural sources, iron and steel production, cement production and related activities, nonferrous metals production, and municipal solid waste incineration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Bread, root crops, and vegetables also contribute to the cadmium in modern populations.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"&gt;Mann, Denise (23 April 2012) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120426102047/http://news.yahoo.com/heavy-metal-foods-cosmetics-spur-breast-cancer-spread-200608223.html Can Heavy Metal in Foods, Cosmetics Spur Breast Cancer Spread?] HealthDayBy via Yahoo&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jinzu River.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jinzū River]] area, which was contaminated with cadmium]]
There have been a few instances of general population poisoning as the result of long-term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water, and research into an estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer is ongoing.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com" /&gt; In the decades leading up to [[World War II]], mining operations contaminated the [[Jinzū River]] in Japan with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, cadmium accumulated in the rice crops along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities consumed the contaminated rice and developed [[itai-itai]] disease and renal abnormalities, including [[proteinuria]] and [[glucosuria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Environmental cadmium exposure, adverse effects, and preventative measures in Japan|first = Koji|last = Nogawa|journal = Biometals|date = 2004|volume = 17|issue = 5|pages =581–587|doi = 10.1023/B:BIOM.0000045742.81440.9c|pmid = 15688869|last2 = Kobayashi|first2 = E.|last3 = Okubo|first3 = Y.|last4 = Suwazono|first4 = Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims of this poisoning were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures in other parts of the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, although cadmium is a major factor in the itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's [[ROHS|Restriction on Hazardous Substances]] (RoHS) directive, which regulates hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Commission Decision of 12 October 2006 amending, for the purposes of adapting to technical progress, the Annex to Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards exemptions for applications of lead and cadmium (notified under document number C(2006) 4790) |date=14 October 2006|publisher=Journal of the European Union|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:283:0048:0049:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans.&lt;ref&gt;IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Volume 58&lt;/ref&gt; Although occupational exposure to cadmium is linked to lung and prostate cancer, there is still a substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low environmental exposure.

The [[tobacco plant]] readily absorbs and accumulates [[heavy metals]], such as cadmium from the surrounding soil into its leaves. These are readily absorbed into the user's body following smoke inhalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914011010952 |pmc=3586865|doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2011.12.027|pmid=23493960|title=Preconcentration and determination of copper in tobacco leaves samples by using a minicolumn of sisal fiber (Agave sisalana) loaded with Alizarin fluorine blue by FAAS|journal=Talanta|volume=89|issue=1|pages=276–279|year=2012|last1=Dias|first1=Fábio de S.|last2=Bonsucesso|first2=Josemário S.|last3=Oliveira|first3=Lucas C.|last4=Dos Santos|first4=Walter N.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco smoking is the most important single source of cadmium exposure in the general population. An estimated 10% of the cadmium content of a cigarette is inhaled through smoking. Absorption of cadmium through the lungs is more effective than through the gut, and as much as 50% of the cadmium inhaled in cigarette smoke may be absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1146/annurev.pu.04.050183.002055|journal = Annual Review of Public Health|volume = 4|pmid = 6860444|pages = 367–73|date = 1983|title = Cadmium|first = L.|last = Friberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On average, cadmium concentrations in the blood of smokers is 4 times 5 times greater and in the kidney, 2–3 times greater than non-smokers. Despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke, there seems to be little exposure to cadmium from [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment and Health|volume = 24|pages = 11–51|date = 1998|title = Health effects of cadmium exposure—a review of the literature and a risk estimate|first = L.|last = Jarup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a non-smoking population, food is the greatest source of exposure. High quantities of cadmium can be found in [[crustacean]]s, [[Mollusca|mollusks]], [[offal]], and [[algae]] products. However, grains, vegetables, and starchy roots and tubers are consumed in much greater quantity in the US, and are the source of the greatest dietary exposure.&lt;ref name="efsa.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2551|title=Cadmium dietary exposure in the European population - European Food Safety Authority|website=www.efsa.europa.eu|date=2012-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most plants bio-accumulate metal toxins like Cd, and when composted to form organic fertilizers yield a product which can often contain high amounts (e.g., over 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg) of metal toxins for every kilo of fertilizer. Fertilizers made from animal dung (e.g., cow dung) or urban waste can contain similar amounts of Cd. The Cd added to the soil from fertilizers (rock phosphates or organic fertilizers) become bio-available and toxic only if the soil pH is low (i.e., acidic soils).  Zinc is chemically similar to cadmium and some evidence indicates the presence of Zn ions reduces cadmium toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://innovareacademics.in/journals/index.php/ijpps/article/view/2305|title=MITIGATING ROLE OF ZINC AND IRON AGAINST CADMIUM INDUCED TOXICITY IN LIVER AND KIDNEY OF MALE ALBINO RAT: A STUDY WITH REFERENCE TO METALLOTHIONEIN QUANTIFICATION|first1=Obaiah|last1=Jamakala|first2=A.

Zinc, Cu, Ca, and Fe ions, and selenium with vitamin C are used to treat Cd intoxication, though it is not easily reversed.&lt;ref name="zn-cd.diseases"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arltma.com/Articles/CadmiumToxDoc.htm|title=ARL : Cadmium Toxicity|website=www.arltma.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulations===
Because of the adverse effects of cadmium on the environment and human health, the supply and use of cadmium is restricted in Europe under the [[REACH Regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/index.htm EUR-Lex]. Eur-lex.europa.eu (18 April 2011). Retrieved on 5 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain specifies that 2.5 μg/kg body weight is a tolerable weekly intake for humans.&lt;ref name="efsa.europa.eu"/&gt; The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has declared 7 μg/kg bw to be the provisional tolerable weekly intake level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jeceval/jec_297.htm|title=JECFA Evaluations-CADMIUM-|website=www.inchem.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) for cadmium at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.005 ppm. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has not set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) and has designated cadmium as a known human carcinogen. The [[IDLH]] (immediately dangerous to life and health) level for cadmium is 9&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{PGCH|0087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4479">The '''Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines''' is an international campaign started by [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF) to increase the availability of [[essential medicines]] in [[developing country|developing countries]]. MSF often has difficulties treating patients because the medicines required are too expensive or are no longer produced. Sometimes, the only drugs available are highly toxic or ineffective, and they often have to resort to inadequate testing methods to diagnose patients.

The lack of research into diseases that affect most of the world’s poor population is known as the [[10-90 gap]] and it occurs because [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] rarely make a profit when developing drugs for these diseases.  Although some countries have created legislation to encourage development of essential but commercially ignored medicines, which are called [[orphan drug]]s in the [[United States]], MSF started this campaign in November 1999 to bring more awareness to the issue, using its prize money from its 1999 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] to fund the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=Christopher|title=Human Rights and the World Trade Organization: The Right to Essential Medicines and the TRIPS Agreement|journal=Journal of International Law &amp; Policy|year=2007|volume=5|pages=1–27|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jil/jilp/articles/5-1_Butler_Christopher.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MSF’s Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines is pushing to lower the prices of existing drugs, vaccines and diagnostic tests, to stimulate research and development into new treatments for diseases that primarily affect the poor, and to overcome other barriers that prevent patients getting the treatment they need.

The Campaign is made up of a team of medical, legal, policy and communications specialists working together to tackle these various issues.

==Conditions==

The Campaign is calling for improvements to the quality of food aid to meet growing children’s nutritional needs. They are also urging a rapid scale-up in the use and production of Ready-to-Use Foods (RUF) to reduce childhood deaths from malnutrition.

It is campaigning for new TB drugs and simple diagnostics to be developed while continuing to call to attention the serious underfunding for TB research.

The Campaign continues to fight to ensure that patients have access to better and improved HIV treatments as well as further scaling up of treatment.

The Campaign supports the use of flexibilities in world trade rules and the creation of a [[patent pool]] &lt;ref&gt;Patent pool, http://www.unitaid.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure that patents don’t get in the way of access to the medicines patients need.

==Research==

The Campaign is working to promote alternative ways of steering and funding medical research to meet the medical needs of people in developing countries, rather than market priorities.

==Policy==
MSF has supported policies that large drugmakers have resisted, in an effort to improve access to essential medicines.&lt;ref name="pmlive"/&gt;

The director of policy advocacy Michelle Childs of MSF said "An important precedent, not just for the people living with HIV within its country, who have been campaigning for this, but also for other developing countries.  As medicines for HIV and hepatitis B are increasingly under patent in developing counties, [[Indonesia]] has shown that countries can and should take action to enable the production of low-cost versions of essential life-saving medicines for their citizens"&lt;ref name="pmlive"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/indonesia_breaks_seven_hiv,_hepatitis_drug_patents_436834#|title=Indonesia breaks seven HIV, hepatitis drug patents

A '''cancer registry''' is a systematic collection of data about [[cancer]] and [[tumor]] diseases. The data are collected by [[National Cancer Registrars Association|Cancer Registrar]]s. Cancer Registrars capture a complete summary of patient history, diagnosis, treatment, and status for every cancer patient in the United States, and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Khatib|first1= O|last2= Aljurf|first2= M|title= Cancer Prevention and Control in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: The Need for a Public Health Approach|journal= Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther|volume= 1|issue= 1|date= Jan–Mar 2008|pages= 44–52|pmid= 20063528|doi=10.1016/s1658-3876(08)50060-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) was established in 1973 as a result of the [[National Cancer Act of 1971]]. The National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) was established by Congress through the Cancer Registries Amendment Act in 1992, and administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/about.htm|title= About the Program|publisher= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date= 2016-04-20|access-date= 2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPCR and SEER together collect cancer data for the entire U.S. population. CDC and NCI, in collaboration with the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, have been publishing annual federal cancer statistics in the United States Cancer Statistics: Incidence and Mortality report. Information maintained in the cancer registry includes: demographic information, medical history, diagnostic findings, cancer therapy and follow up details.&lt;ref name="NCRAUSAInfo"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ncra-usa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3301 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111107205328/http://www.ncra-usa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3301 |title= Cancer Registrar FAQ|publisher= National Cancer Registrars Association|archive-date= 2011-11-07|accessdate= 2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data is used to evaluate patient outcome, quality of life, provide follow-up information, calculate survival rates, analyze referral pattern, allocate resources at regional or state level, report cancer incidence as required under state law, and evaluate efficacy of treatment modalities.&lt;ref name="NCRAUSAInfo" /&gt;

There exist population-based cancer registries, [[hospital]] cancer registries (also called hospital-based cancer registries), and special purpose registries.

== History ==
In 1926, Yale-New Haven Hospital became the first to set up a cancer registry. In 1956, the American College of Surgeons (ACoS) formally adopted a policy to encourage, through their Approvals Program, the development of hospital-based cancer registries. In 1973, The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program of NCI establishes the first national cancer registry program. In 1992, U.S. Public Law 102-515 establishes the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and is administered by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[http://training.seer.cancer.gov/registration/registry/history/dates.html]. By 1993, most states considered cancer a reportable disease.

== Population-based cancer registry ==

Population-based cancer registries monitor the frequency of new cancer cases (so-called [[incident cases]]) every year in well defined populations and over time by collecting case reports from different sources (treatment facilities, clinicians and [[pathologist]]s, and death certificates). The frequency of these incident cases are expected per 100,000 of the mother population. If an unexpected accumulation can be observed, a hypothesis about possible causes is generated. This hypothesis is investigated in a second step by collecting more detailed data. The aim is to recognize and to reduce risks. Population-based registries can also monitor the effects of preventive measures. All population-based central registries in the United States and Canada are members of the [[North American Association of Central Cancer Registries]]. This organization acts as a voice for the registries when dealing with national standard-setting organizations, sets standards for digital cancer record transmission, and certifies the registries for the quality of their data, among other functions.

== Hospital cancer registry ==

Hospital cancer registries aim at the improvement of [[cancer therapy]]. Therefore they have to collect detailed data about diagnosis and therapy. Improvements can be achieved by:

* comparison of therapy - which therapy is the best
* comparison of therapists - which hospital, which physician has the best results under the same conditions ([[quality management]])
* support of treatment - registries can improve information about a patient and help to provide an optimal treatment by planning therapies and generating reminders

== Cooperation of registries ==

Since the data needed by hospital cancer registries usually include those of population-based cancer registries and both use the same [[Medical classification|classifications]], data can be sent from a hospital cancer registry to a population-based registry thus reducing documentation efforts.

== Cancer reporting standards ==

Hospital and population-based cancer registries report their incidence data to national organizations that aggregate and publish the data. The way in which these data are formatted to be submitted to these organizations are determined by standards released by standard-setting organizations. Edits are run on the data to check for inaccuracies and duplicate cases before being submitted electronically. Different organizations have different standards for data reliability and completeness, and some award certifications based on the adherence to these standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.naaccr.org/Certification/WhoisCertified.aspx |title= Who is certified|publisher= North American Association of Central Cancer Registries|access-date= 2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SEER Registries==

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute collects and publish data on cancer incidence and survival throughout the United States. The information from population-based cancer registries covers approximately 28 percent of the US population. This coverage includes 26 percent of African Americans, 41 percent of Hispanics, 43 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives, 54 percent of Asians, and 71 percent of Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders.  The SEER program population-based cancer registries include Arizona Indians, Cherokee Nation, Connecticut, Detroit, Georgia Center for Cancer Statistics (Atlanta, Great Georgia, and Rural Georgia), Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry (San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose-Monterey), Greater California, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Los Angeles, Louisiana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Seattle-Puget Sound, and Utah. Selection of the geographic areas is based on the ability to operate and maintain a high quality population-based cancer reporting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Overview of the SEER Program|url= http://seer.cancer.gov/about/overview.html|publisher= National Cancer Institute|access-date= 2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR)==

The program has state-based cancer registries that collect, analyze and report cancer cases and deaths to a central cancer registry. NPCR was established in 1992 and administered by the CDC.  NPCR supports central cancer registries in 45 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Pacific Island Jurisdictions (covers approximately 96% of the U.S. population). State Cancer Registries monitor cancer trends, determine cancer patterns, direct planning and evaluation of cancer control programs, help set priorities for allocating health resources, promote research, and provide information on cancer incidence.
The data collected helps public health professionals understand and address the cancer burden. The ninth volume of Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, published by International Agency for Research on Cancer, includes cancer incidence data from 32 NPCR-funded registries. NPCR’s future direction is to expand the use of information technology designed to support, improve, and enhance the management and exchange of electronic data in cancer surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= National Program of Cancer Registries|url= https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/about.htm|date= 2016-04-20|access-date= 2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Swedish Cancer Registry==

The Swedish Cancer Registry was established in 1958. The health care providers in Sweden are required to report newly detected cancer cases diagnosed at clinical, morphological, and laboratory examination (as well as those discovered during autopsy) to the registry. Every year, the regional registries send cancer data to the National Cancer Register. The information available in the registry include patient’s personal information (PIN, sex, age and place of residence), medical records (date of diagnosis, site of the tumor, method used for diagnosis, and hospital where the patient is being treated), and follow-up data (date and cause of death or date of migration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Swedish Cancer Registry|url= http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/register/halsodataregister/cancerregistret/inenglish|publisher= [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]]|access-date= 2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox chromium}}
'''Chromium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Cr''' and [[atomic number]] 24. It is the first element in [[Group 6 element|group 6]]. It is a steely-grey, [[Luster (mineralogy)|lustrous]], hard and brittle [[transition metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Brandes|first1 = EA|last2 = Greenaway|first2 = HT|last3 = Stone|first3 = HEN|date = 1956|title = Ductility in Chromium|journal = Nature|volume = 178|issue = 4533|doi = 10.1038/178587a0|page = 587|bibcode = 1956Natur.178..587B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium boasts a high usage rate as a [[metal]] that is able to be highly [[polishing|polished]] while resisting [[tarnish]]ing. Chromium is also the main component of [[stainless steel]], a popular steel alloy due to its uncommonly high [[specular reflection]]. Simple polished chromium reflects almost 70% of the [[visible spectrum]], with almost 90% of [[infrared|infrared light]] waves being reflected.&lt;ref name = "NIST specular reflection"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Coblentz|first1 = WW|last2 = Stair|first2 = R|title = Reflecting power of beryllium, chromium, and several other metals|url = https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/2/jresv2n2p343_A2b.pdf|website = National Institute of Standards and Technology|publisher = NIST Publications|accessdate = 11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the element is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word χρῶμα, ''chrōma'', meaning [[color]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxrw%3Dma χρῶμα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; because many chromium compounds are intensely colored.

[[Ferrochromium]] alloy is commercially produced from [[chromite]] by [[silicothermic]] or [[aluminothermic reaction]]s and chromium metal by [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and [[Leaching (metallurgy)|leaching]] processes followed by reduction with [[carbon]] and then [[aluminium]]. Chromium metal is of high value for its high [[corrosion]] resistance and [[hardness]]. A major development in steel production was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form [[stainless steel]]. Stainless steel and [[chrome plating]] ([[electroplating]] with chromium) together comprise 85% of the commercial use.

In the United States, [[trivalent]] chromium (Cr(III)) [[ion]] is considered an [[essential nutrient]] in humans for [[insulin]], [[sugar]] and [[lipid]] [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name="ods"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Chromium-HealthProfessional/#h2 | title=Chromium | publisher=Office of Dietary Supplements, US National Institutes of Health | date=2016 | accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2014, the [[European Food Safety Authority]], acting for the European Union, concluded that there was not sufficient evidence for chromium to be recognized as essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3845|title = Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for chromium|date = 18 September 2014|accessdate = 20 March 2018|publisher = [[European Food Safety Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While chromium metal and Cr(III) ions are not considered toxic, [[hexavalent chromium]] (Cr(VI)) is both toxic and [[carcinogenic]]. Abandoned chromium production sites often require [[Environmental remediation|environmental cleanup]].

== Physical properties ==
=== Atomic ===
Chromium is the fourth [[transition metal]] found on the periodic table, and has an electron configuration of [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[argon|Ar]]] 3d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; 4s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is also the first element in the periodic table whose ground-state electron configuration violates the [[Aufbau principle]]. This occurs again later in the periodic table with other elements and their electron configurations, such as [[copper]], [[niobium]], and [[molybdenum]].&lt;ref name = "CasaXPS"&gt;{{cite web|title = The Nature of X-Ray Photoelectron Spectra|website= CasaXPS|publisher = Casa Software Ltd.|date = 2005|accessdate = 4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs because electrons in the same orbital repel each other due to their like charges. In the previous elements, the energetic cost of promoting an electron to the next higher energy level is too great to compensate for that released by lessening inter-electronic repulsion. However, in the 3d transition metals, the energy gap between the 3d and the next-higher 4s subshell is very small, and because the 3d subshell is more compact than the 4s subshell, inter-electron repulsion is smaller between 4s electrons than between 3d electrons. This lowers the energetic cost of promotion and increases the energy released by it, so that the promotion becomes energetically feasible and one or even two electrons are always promoted to the 4s subshell. (Similar promotions happen for every transition metal atom but one, [[palladium]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwarz |first1=W. H. Eugen |date=April 2010 |title=The Full Story of the Electron Configurations of the Transition Elements |url=http://www.quimica.ufpr.br/edulsa/cq115/artigos/The_full_story_of_the_electron_configurations_of_the_transition_elements.pdf |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=444–8 |doi=10.1021/ed8001286 |access-date=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromium is the first element in the 3d series where the 3d electrons are starting to sink into the inert core; they thus contribute less to [[metallic bonding]], and hence the melting and boiling points and the [[enthalpy of atomisation]] of chromium are lower than those of the preceding element [[vanadium]].  Chromium(VI) is a strong [[oxidising agent]] in contrast to the [[molybdenum]](VI) and [[tungsten]](VI) oxides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1004&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1004–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromium has an unusually high [[specular reflection]] in comparison to that of other transitional metals. At 425 [[micrometer|μm]], chromium was found to have a relative maximum reflection of about 72% reflectance, before entering a depression in reflectivity, reaching a minimum of 62% reflectance at 750 [[micrometer|μm]] before rising again to reflecting roughly 90% of 4000 [[micrometer|μm]] of [[infrared]] [[light|waves]].&lt;ref name = "NIST specular reflection"/&gt;. When chromium is formed into a [[stainless steel]] alloy and [[polishing|polished]], the specular reflection decreases with the inclusion of additional metals, yet is still rather high in comparison with other alloys. Between 40% and 60% of the visible spectrum is reflected off of polished stainless steel.&lt;ref name = "NIST specular reflection"/&gt; The explanation on why chromium displays such a high turnout of reflected [[photon]] waves in general, especially the 90% of infrared waves that were reflected, can be attributed to chromium's magnetic properties.&lt;ref name="ISU infrared"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Lind|first1 = Michael Acton|title = The infrared reflectivity of chromium and chromium-aluminium alloys|url = https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6216&amp;context=rtd|website = Iowa State University Digital Repository|publisher = Iowa State University|date = 1972|accessdate = 4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium has unique magnetic properties in the sense that chromium is the only elemental solid which shows [[antiferromagnetic]] ordering at room temperature (and below). Above 38&amp;nbsp;°C, its magnetic ordering changes to [[paramagnetic]].&lt;ref name="fawcett"/&gt;. The antiferromagnetic properties, which cause the chromium atoms to temporarily [[ionization|ionize]] and bond with themselves because the body-centric cubic's magnetic properties are disproportionate to the [[Crystal structure|lattice periodicity]]. This is due to the fact that the magnetic moments at the cube's corners and the cube centers are not equal, but still antiparallel.&lt;ref name="ISU infrared"/&gt; From here, the frequency-dependent [[relative permittivity]] of chromium, deriving from [[Maxwell's equations]] in conjunction with its [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetivity]], leave chromium with one of the highest infrared and visible light reflectance out of the known chemical elements.&lt;ref name="ISU optical"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Bos|first1 = Laurence William|title =Optical properties of chromium-manganese alloys|url = https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4816&amp;context=rtd|website = Iowa State University Digital Repository|publisher = Iowa State University|date = 1969|accessdate = 4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulk ===
[[File:Chromium.jpg|thumb|left|Sample of pure chromium metal]]
&lt;!--- Pure lead has a bright, silvery appearance with a hint of blue. It tarnishes on contact with moist air, and takes on a dull appearance, the hue of which depends on the prevailing conditions. Characteristic properties of lead include high [[density]], malleability, ductility, and high resistance to [[corrosion]] due to [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]. ---&gt;
&lt;!--- Lead's close-packed face-centered cubic structure and high atomic weight result in a density of 11.34&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is greater than that of common metals such as [[iron]] (7.87&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), [[copper]] (8.93&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and [[zinc]] (7.14&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Some rarer metals are denser: [[tungsten]] and [[gold]] are both at 19.3&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[osmium]]—the densest metal known—has a density of 22.59&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, almost twice that of lead. ---&gt;
&lt;!--- Lead is a very soft metal with a [[Mohs hardness]] of 1.5; it can be scratched with a fingernail. It is quite malleable and somewhat ductile. The [[bulk modulus]] of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|GPa]]. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2&amp;nbsp;GPa; copper 137.8&amp;nbsp;GPa; and [[mild steel]] 160–169&amp;nbsp;GPa. Lead's [[tensile strength]], at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or [[antimony]]. ---&gt;
&lt;!--- The melting point of lead—at 327.5&amp;nbsp;°C (621.5&amp;nbsp;°F)—is very low compared to most metals.{{sfn|Thornton|Rautiu |Brush|2001|p=6}}{{efn|A (wet) finger can be dipped into molten lead without risk of a burning injury.{{sfn|Willey|1999}}}} Its [[boiling point]] of 1749&amp;nbsp;°C (3180&amp;nbsp;°F){{sfn|Lide|2005|p=12-219}} is the lowest among the carbon group elements. The [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical resistivity]] of lead at 20&amp;nbsp;°C is 192 [[ohm|nanoohm]]-[[meter]]s, almost an [[order of magnitude]] higher than those of other industrial metals (copper at 15.43&amp;nbsp;nΩ·m; gold 20.51&amp;nbsp;nΩ·m; and aluminium at 24.15&amp;nbsp;nΩ·m). Lead is a [[superconductor]] at temperatures lower than 7.19&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]; this is the highest [[critical temperature]] of all [[type-I superconductor]]s and the third highest of the elemental superconductors. ---&gt;

==== Passivation ====
Chromium metal left standing in air is [[passivation (chemistry)|passivated]] by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a [[spinel]] structure only a few molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This is different from the oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant [[rust]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The oxidation of alloys|last = Wallwork|first = GR|date = 1976|journal = Reports on Progress in Physics|volume = 39|pages = 401–485|doi = 10.1088/0034-4885/39/5/001|issue = 5|bibcode = 1976RPPh...39..401W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with [[oxidizing acid]]s like [[nitric acid]]. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong [[reducing agent]] that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.&lt;ref name = "HollemanAF"/&gt;

Chromium, unlike such metals as iron and nickel, does not suffer from [[hydrogen embrittlement]]. However, it does suffer from nitrogen [[embrittlement]], reacting with nitrogen from air and forming brittle nitrides at the high temperatures necessary to work the metal parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=CGMrAAAAYAAJ|title = High-temperature oxidation-resistant coatings: coatings for protection from oxidation of superalloys, refractory metals, and graphite|author = National Research Council (U.S.).

=== Isotopes ===
{{Main|Isotopes of chromium}}
Naturally occurring chromium is composed of three stable [[isotope]]s; &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr and &lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, with &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr being the most abundant (83.789% [[natural abundance]]). 19 [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized, with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;Cr with a [[half-life]] of (more than) 1.8{{e|17}} years, and &lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;Cr with a half-life of 27.7 days. All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than 24 hours and the majority less than 1 minute. This element also has 2 [[meta state]]s.&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Georges|first1 = Audi|last2 = Bersillon|first2 = O|last3 = Blachot|first3 = J| last4 = Wapstra|first4 = AH|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal = Nuclear Physics A|volume = 729|issue = 1|pages = 3–128|date = 2003|doi = 10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|url = http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr is the [[radiogenic]] decay product of &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;[[manganese|Mn]] (half-life = 3.74 million years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/VChartHTML.html|title=Live Chart of Nuclides |last = |first = |date = |website = International Atomic Energy Agency - Nuclear Data Section|access-date = 18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium isotopes are typically collocated (and compounded) with [[manganese]] isotopes. This circumstance is useful in [[isotope geology]].

Variations in &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr/&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites indicate an initial &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn/&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Mn ratio that suggests Mn-Cr isotopic composition must result from in-situ decay of &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn in differentiated planetary bodies.

When a trace amount of {{chem|Cr|3+}} replaces {{chem|Al|3+}} in [[corundum]] (aluminium oxide, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pink sapphire]] or red-colored [[ruby]] is formed, depending on the amount of chromium.

Chromium(III) tends to form [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] complexes.

If water-free green{{cn|date=November 2018}} [[chromium(III) chloride]] is dissolved in water, the green solution turns violet after some time as the chloride in the inner [[coordination sphere]] is replaced by water. This kind of reaction is also observed with solutions of [[chrome alum]] and other water-soluble chromium(III) salts.

[[Chromium(III) hydroxide]] (Cr(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is [[amphoterism|amphoteric]], dissolving in acidic solutions to form [Cr(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and in basic solutions to form {{chem|[Cr(OH)|6|]|3-}}. It is dehydrated by heating to form the green [[chromium(III) oxide]] (Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), a stable oxide with a crystal structure identical to that of [[corundum]].&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

Chromium(VI) halides are known also and include the [[hexafluoride]] [[chromium hexafluoride|CrF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[chromyl chloride]] ({{chem|CrO|2|Cl|2}}).&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 1081–1095|isbn = 978-3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|last1 = Holleman|first1 = Arnold F|last2 = Wiber|first2 = Egon|last3 = Wiberg|first3 = Nils|chapter = Chromium|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chrom(VI)-oxid.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Chromium(VI) oxide]]
[[Sodium chromate]] is produced industrially by the oxidative roasting of [[chromite]] ore with [[calcium carbonate|calcium]] or [[sodium carbonate]]. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange (dichromate), such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of [[potassium chromate]]. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex [[oxyanion]]s of chromium is possible.

Both the [[chromate and dichromate]] anions are strong oxidizing reagents at low pH:&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;
:{{chem|Cr|2|O|7|2-}} + 14 {{chem|H|3|O|+}} + 6 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2 {{chem|Cr|3+}} + 21 {{chem|H|2|O}} (ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.33&amp;nbsp;V)

They are, however, only moderately oxidizing at high pH:&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;
:{{chem|CrO|4|2-}} + 4 {{chem|H|2|O}} + 3 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|Cr(OH)|3}} + 5 {{chem|OH|-}} (ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.13&amp;nbsp;V)

[[File:Chroman sodný.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Sodium chromate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]]
Chromium(VI) compounds in solution can be detected by adding an acidic [[hydrogen peroxide]] solution. The unstable dark blue [[chromium(VI) peroxide]] (CrO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is formed, which can be stabilized as an ether adduct {{chem|CrO|5|·OR|2}}.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

[[Chromic acid]] has the hypothetical formula {{chem|H|2|CrO|4}}. It is a vaguely described chemical, despite many well-defined chromates and dichromates being known.  The dark red [[chromium(VI) oxide]] {{chem|CrO|3}}, the acid [[anhydride]] of chromic acid, is sold industrially as "chromic acid".&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt; It can be produced by mixing sulfuric acid with dichromate, and is a strong oxidizing agent.

=== Other oxidation states ===
==== Chromium(V) and chromium(IV) ====
The oxidation state +5 is only realized in few compounds but are intermediates in many reactions involving oxidations by chromate. The only binary compound is the volatile [[chromium(V) fluoride]] (CrF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;). This red solid has a melting point of 30&amp;nbsp;°C and a boiling point of 117&amp;nbsp;°C. It can be prepared by treating chromium metal with fluorine at 400&amp;nbsp;°C and 200 bar pressure. The peroxochromate(V) is another example of the +5 oxidation state. [[Potassium tetraperoxochromate(V)|Potassium peroxochromate]] (K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[Cr(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]) is made by reacting potassium chromate with hydrogen peroxide at low temperatures. This red brown compound is stable at room temperature but decomposes spontaneously at 150–170&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://dokumentix.ub.uni-siegen.de/opus/volltexte/2006/52/|title = Preparation, Structure and Vibrational Spectroscopy of Tetraperoxo Complexes of Cr&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt;, V&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt;, Nb&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ta&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt;|date= 2003|first = Gentiana|last = Haxhillazi|publisher= PhD thesis, University of Siegen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounds of chromium(IV) (in the +4 oxidation state) are slightly more common than those of chromium(V). The tetrahalides, [[chromium(IV) fluoride|CrF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[chromium(IV) chloride|CrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], and CrBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, can be produced by treating the trihalides ({{chem|CrX|3}}) with the corresponding halogen at elevated temperatures. Such compounds are susceptible to disproportionation reactions and are not stable in water.

==== Chromium(II) ====
Many chromium(II) compounds are known, such as the water-stable [[chromium(II) chloride]] {{chem|CrCl|2}} that can be made by reducing chromium(III) chloride with zinc. The resulting bright blue solution created from dissolving chromium(II) chloride is only stable at neutral [[pH]].&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt; Some other notable chromium(II) compounds include [[chromium(II) oxide]] {{chem|CrO}}, and [[chromium(II) sulfate]] {{chem|CrSO|4}}. Many chromous carboxylates are known as well, the most famous of these being the red [[chromium(II) acetate]] (Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) that features a quadruple bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotton|first1=FA|authorlink1=F.

==== Chromium(I) ====
Most chromium(I) compounds are obtained solely by oxidation of electron-rich, [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] chromium(0) complexes. Other chromium(I) complexes contain [[cyclopentadienyl]] ligands. As verified by [[X-ray diffraction]], a Cr-Cr [[quintuple bond]] (length 183.51(4) &amp;nbsp;pm) has also been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Nguyen|first1 = T|last2 = Sutton|first2 = AD|last3 = Brynda|first3 = M|last4 = Fettinger|first4 = JC|last5 = Long|first5 = GJ|last6 = Power|first6 = PP|title = Synthesis of a stable compound with fivefold bonding between two chromium(I) centers |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5749 |pages=844–847 |date=2005 |pmid = 16179432|doi = 10.1126/science.1116789|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extremely bulky monodentate ligands stabilize this compound by shielding the quintuple bond from further reactions.

==== Chromium(0) ====
{{Main|Organochromium chemistry}}
Many chromium(0) compounds are currently known; however, most of these compounds are derivatives of the compounds [[chromium hexacarbonyl]] or [[bis(benzene)chromium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1 = National Center for Biotechnology Information|title = Chromium carbonyl|url = https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Chromium_hexacarbonyl|website = PubChem|publisher = National Institute for Health|accessdate =1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Ancient uses ===
Chromium was first discovered as an element after it came to the attention of the Western world in the red crystalline mineral [[crocoite]] (which is [[lead(II) chromate]]). This mineral was discovered in 1761 and was initially used as a [[pigment]]; the distinctive color was attributed to the chromium from within the crocoite. In present day, nearly all chromium is commercially extracted from the only viable ore for extensiveness and predicted long term use, being [[chromite]], which is iron chromium oxide (FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;); chromite is now the principal source of chromium for use in pigments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Casteran|first1 = Rene|title = Chromite mining|url = https://oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/chromite_mining/#.W7K-TWhKiyJ|website = Oregon Encyclopedia|publisher = Portland State University and the Oregon Historical Society|accessdate = 1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Terracotta Army weapons ====
Weapons found in burial pits dating from the late 3rd century B.C. [[Qin Dynasty]] of the [[Terracotta Army]] near [[Xi'an]], [[China]], have been analyzed by archaeologists. Although these weapons were presumably buried more than two millennia ago, the ancient [[bronze]] tips of both the swords and [[crossbow]] bolts found at the site showed unexpectedly little corrosion, possibly because the bronze was deliberately coated with a thin layer of chromium oxide.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, Maurice. (2004). ''The Terracotta Warriors: The Secret Codes of the Emperor's Army''. Rochester: Bear and Company. {{ISBN|1-59143-033-X}}. Page 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, this oxide layer that was found on the weapons was not pure chromium metal or chrome plating as it is commonly produced today, but a mere 10-15 [[micrometer|μm]] layer of chromium oxide molecules at up to 2% chromium was discovered, which turned out to be enough to protect the bronze from corroding.&lt;ref name="Lorch2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Lorch|first1 = Mark|title = From chrome plating to nanotubes: the 'modern' chemistry first used in ancient times|url = https://theconversation.com/from-chrome-plating-to-nanotubes-the-modern-chemistry-first-used-in-ancient-times-54009|website = The Conversation|publisher = The Conversation US Inc.|accessdate = 19 October 2018|date = 2 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chromium as pigment ===
Chromium minerals as pigments came to the attention of the west in the 18th century. On 26 July 1761, [[Johann Gottlob Lehmann (scientist)|Johann Gottlob Lehmann]] found an orange-red mineral in the [[Beryozovskoye deposit|Beryozovskoye mines]] in the [[Ural Mountains]] which he named ''Siberian red lead''.&lt;ref name="Meyer 1962 p.

[[File:Cut Ruby.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The red color of rubies is from a trace amount of chromium.]]

In 1794, [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]] received samples of crocoite [[ore]]. He produced [[chromium(VI) oxide|chromium trioxide]] (CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) by mixing crocoite with [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;ref name="ChromiumVI"/&gt; In 1797, Vauquelin discovered that he could isolate metallic chromium by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven, for which he is credited as the one who truly discovered the element.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.com/?id=6dgPAAAAQAAJ|journal =Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts|date = 1798|page = 146–7|volume = 3|title = Memoir on a New Metallic Acid which exists in the Red Lead of Sibiria|first = Louis Nicolas|last = Vauquelin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5gc2AQAAMAAJ|journal = Transactions of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers|year = 1896|page = 482|volume =25|title = Chrome in the Southern Appalachian Region|first = William|last = Glenn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vauquelin was also able to detect traces of chromium in precious [[gemstone]]s, such as [[ruby]] or [[emerald]].&lt;ref name="ChromiumVI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = van der Krogt|first = Peter|title = Chromium|url = http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=Cr|accessdate = 24 Aug 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, chromium was primarily used not only as a component of paints, but in [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] salts as well. For quite some time, the crocoite found in Russia was the main source for such tanning materials. In 1827, a larger chromite deposit was discovered near [[Baltimore]], United States, which quickly met the demand for tanning salts much more adequately than the crocoite that had been used previously. This made the United States the largest producer of chromium products until the year 1848, when larger deposits of chromite were uncovered near the city of [[Bursa]], Turkey.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt;

Chromium is also famous for its reflective, metallic luster when polished. It is used as a protective and decorative coating on car parts, plumbing fixtures, furniture parts and many other items, usually applied by [[electroplating]]. Chromium was used for electroplating as early as 1848, but this use only became widespread with the development of an improved process in 1924.&lt;ref name="Crplating"&gt;{{cite book|title = Nickel and Chromium Plating|publisher = Woodhead Publishing|date = 1993|isbn = 978-1-85573-081-6|pages = 9–12|chapter = History of Chromium Plating|last1 = Dennis|first1 = JK|last2 = Such|first2 = TE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the production of pure chromium, the iron must be separated from the chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of [[calcium carbonate]] and [[sodium carbonate]] in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the [[chromate]]s and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by [[sulfuric acid]] into the dichromate.&lt;ref name="IndMin"/&gt;

The strengthening effect of forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries and the strong increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The [[high speed steel|high-speed tool steels]] contain between 3 and 5% chromium. [[Stainless steel]], the primary corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when chromium is introduced to [[iron]] in sufficient concentrations, usually where the chromium concentration is above 11%.&lt;ref name="Davis 2000 p.

Also, nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, [[Inconel]] 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel [[superalloy]]s, they are used in [[jet engine]]s and [[gas turbine]]s in lieu of common structural materials.&lt;ref name="superal"&gt;{{cite web|title = Nickel-Based Superalloys|first = HK|last = Bhadeshia|url = http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2003/Superalloys/superalloys.html|accessdate = 17 Feb 2009|publisher = University of Cambridge|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060825053006/http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2003/Superalloys/superalloys.html|archivedate = 25 August 2006|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Motorcycle Reflections bw edit.jpg|thumb|left|Decorative chrome plating on a motorcycle.]]

The relative high hardness and corrosion resistance of unalloyed chromium makes chrome a reliable metal for surface coating; it is still the most popular metal concerning sheet coating with its above average durability compared to other coating metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Breitsameter |first1=M |title=Thermal Spraying versus Hard Chrome Plating |url=https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1576 |website=Azo Materials |publisher=AZoNetwork |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A layer of chromium is deposited on pretreated metallic surfaces by [[electroplating]] techniques. There are two deposition methods: thin and thick. Thin deposition involves a layer of chromium below 1&amp;nbsp;µm thickness deposited by [[chrome plating]], and are used for decorative surfaces. Thicker chromium layers are deposited if wear-resistant surfaces are needed. Both methods use acidic chromate or [[dichromate]] solutions. To prevent the energy-consuming change in oxidation state, the use of chromium(III) sulfate is under development; for most applications of chromium, the previously established process is used.&lt;ref name="Crplating"/&gt;

In the [[chromate conversion coating]] process, the strong oxidative properties of chromates are used to deposit a protective oxide layer on metals like aluminium, zinc and cadmium. This [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] and the self-healing properties by the chromate stored in the chromate conversion coating, which is able to migrate to local defects, are the benefits of this coating method.&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{cite book |last = Edwards |first = J |title = Coating and Surface Treatment Systems for Metals |publisher = Finishing Publications Ltd. and ASMy International |date = 1997|pages = 66–71 |isbn = 978-0-904477-16-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of environmental and health regulations on chromates, alternative coating methods are under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Surface and Coatings Technology |volume=140 |issue=1 |date=2001 |doi=10.1016/S0257-8972(01)01003-9 |title=Effects of chromate and chromate conversion coatings on corrosion of aluminum alloy 2024-T3 |vauthors= Zhao J, Xia L, Sehgal A, Lu D, McCreery RL, Frankel GS  |url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/36519/55_FrankelG_EffectsChromateChromateConversion_2001_p51-57.pdf;jsessionid=79F700B63A8774ACE6A18AEFE4D9C4D1?sequence=1 |pages=51–57 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720032734/https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/36519/55_FrankelG_EffectsChromateChromateConversion_2001_p51-57.pdf%3Bjsessionid%3D79F700B63A8774ACE6A18AEFE4D9C4D1?sequence=1 |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all |hdl=1811/36519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromic acid [[anodizing]] (or Type I anodizing) of aluminium is another electrochemical process, which does not lead to the deposition of chromium, but uses [[chromic acid]] as electrolyte in the solution. During anodization, an oxide layer is formed on the aluminium. The use of chromic acid, instead of the normally used sulfuric acid, leads to a slight difference of these oxide layers.&lt;ref name="surface"&gt;{{Cite book| title = ASM Handbook: Surface Engineering|last1 = Cotell|first1 = CM|last2=Sprague|first2 = JA|last3 = Smidt|first3 = FA|url = https://books.google.com/?id=RGtsPjqUwy0C&amp;pg=PA484|accessdate = 17 Feb 2009|publisher = ASM International|isbn = 978-0-87170-384-2|date = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The high toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds, used in the established chromium electroplating process, and the strengthening of safety and environmental regulations demand a search for substitutes for chromium or at least a change to less toxic chromium(III) compounds.&lt;ref name="Crplating"/&gt;

The mineral [[crocoite]] (which is also [[lead chromate]] PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) was used as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, [[chrome yellow]] was, together with [[cadmium yellow]], one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the [[United States]] and for the Postal Service (for example, the [[Deutsche Post]]) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow has since declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or other alternatives that are free from lead and chromium. Other pigments that are based around chromium are, for example, the deep shade of red pigment [[chrome red]], which is simply lead chromate with [[lead(II) hydroxide]] (PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·Pb(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pre-treating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of [[polyvinyl butyral]]. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15&amp;nbsp;µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of [[Prussian blue]] and [[chrome yellow]], while the chrome oxide green is [[chromium(III) oxide]].&lt;ref name="Cryel"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=bdQVgKWl3f4C&amp;pg=PA106|title = Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia|first = Rutherford John|last = Gettens|publisher = Courier Dover Publications|date = 1966|isbn = 978-0-486-21597-6|pages = 105–106|chapter =Chrome yellow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Synthetic ruby and the first laser ====
[[File:5 Maiman Laser Components.jpg|thumb|alt=Components of original ruby laser.|Red crystal of an ruby laser]]
Natural [[ruby|rubies]] are [[corundum]] (aluminum oxide) crystals that are colored red (the rarest type) due to chromium (III) ions (other colors of corundum gems are termed [[sapphire]]s). A red-colored artificial ruby may also be achieved by doping chromium(III) into artificial corundum crystals, thus making chromium a requirement for making synthetic rubies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1524/zkri.1964.120.4-5.359|journal = Zeitschrift für Kristallographie|volume = 120|pages = 359–363|date = 1964|title = The chromium position in ruby|first2 = RE|last2 = Newnham|first = SC|last = Moss|url = http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/zk/vol120/ZK120_359.pdf|issue = 4–5|bibcode = 1964ZK....120..359M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a synthetic ruby crystal was the basis for the first [[laser]], produced in 1960, which relied on [[stimulated emission]] of light from the chromium atoms in such a crystal.

=== Wood preservative ===
Because of their toxicity, chromium(VI) salts are used for the preservation of wood. For example, [[chromated copper arsenate]] (CCA) is used in [[timber treatment]] to protect wood from decay fungi, wood-attacking insects, including [[termites]], and marine borers.&lt;ref name="Hings"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Leaching of chromated copper arsenate wood preservatives: a review|journal = Environmental Pollution|last1 = Hingston|first1 = J|last2 = Collins|first2 = CD|last3 = Murphy|first3 = RJ|last4 = Lester|first4 = JN|volume = 111|issue = 1|pages = 53–66|date = 2001|doi = 10.1016/S0269-7491(00)00030-0 |pmid = 11202715  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The formulations contain chromium based on the oxide CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; between 35.3% and 65.5%.

=== Tanning ===
{{Main|Tanning (leather)}}
Chromium(III) salts, especially [[chrome alum]] and [[chromium(III) sulfate]], are used in the tanning of [[leather]].

=== Refractory material ===
The high heat resistivity and high melting point makes [[chromite]] and chromium(III) oxide a material for high temperature refractory applications, like [[blast furnace]]s, cement [[kiln]]s, molds for the firing of [[brick]]s and as foundry sands for the [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] of metals. In these applications, the refractory materials are made from mixtures of chromite and magnesite.

Chromium content of common foods is generally low (1-13 micrograms per serving).&lt;ref name=ods/&gt;&lt;ref name=database&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Thor|first1 = MY|last2 = Harnack|first2 = L|last3 = King|first3 = D|last4= Jasthi|first4 = B|last5 = Pettit|first5 = J|title = Evaluation of the comprehensiveness and reliability of the chromium composition of foods in the literature|journal=Journal of Food Composition Analysis|date=2011|volume = 24|issue = 8|pages = 1147–1152|doi = 10.1016/j.jfca.2011.04.006|pmid = 23066174|pmc = 3467697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium content of food varies widely due to differences in soil mineral content, growing season, plant [[cultivar]], and contamination during processing.&lt;ref name=database /&gt; In addition, chromium (and [[nickel]]) leach into food cooked in stainless steel, with the effect largest when the cookware is new.

=== Dietary recommendations ===
There is disagreement on chromium's status as an essential nutrient. Governmental departments from Australia, New Zealand, India, Japan and the United States consider chromium essential&lt;ref name=AustraliaNZ /&gt;&lt;ref name=India /&gt;&lt;ref name=Japan /&gt;&lt;ref name=IOM-Chromium/&gt; while the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA), representing the European Union, does not.&lt;ref name=EFSA /&gt;

The [[National Academy of Medicine]] (NAM) updated the [[Dietary Reference Intake#Parameters|Estimated Average Requirements]] (EARs) and the [[Dietary Reference Intake#Parameters|Recommended Dietary Allowances]] (RDAs) for chromium in 2001. For chromium, there was not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so its needs are described as estimates for [[Dietary Reference Intake#Parameters|Adequate Intakes]] (AIs). The current AIs of chromium for women ages 14 through 50 is 25 μg/day, and the AIs for women ages 50 and above is 20 μg/day. The AIs for women who are pregnant are 30 μg/day, and for women who are lactating, the set AIs are 45 μg/day. The AIs for men ages 14 through 50 are 35 μg/day, and the AIs for men ages 50 and above are 30 μg/day. For children ages 1 through 13, the AIs increase with age from 0.2 μg/day up to 25 μg/day. As for safety, the NAM sets [[Dietary Reference Intake#Parameters|Tolerable Upper Intake Levels]] (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when the evidence is sufficient. In the case of chromium, there is not yet enough information and hence no UL has been established. Collectively, the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are the parameters for the nutrition recommendation system known as [[Dietary Reference Intake]] (DRI).&lt;ref name=IOM-Chromium&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222329/ |title=Chromium.

For the [[United States|United States']] food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount of the substance in a serving is expressed as a percent of the [[Reference Daily Intake|Daily Value]] (%DV). For chromium labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 120 μg. As of May 27, 2016, the percentage of daily value was revised to 35 μg to bring the chromium intake into a consensus with the official [[Dietary Reference Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]].&lt;ref name="FedReg"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf|title = Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels.

===Food sources===
Food composition databases such as the those maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture do not contain information on the chromium content of foods.&lt;ref name=USDA-Database&gt;{{cite web|url = https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?home=true|title = USDA Food Composition Databases|last1= |first1= |date = April 2018|website = United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service|access-date = 4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of animal-sourced and vegetable-sourced foods contain chromium.&lt;ref name=IOM-Chromium/&gt; Content per serving is influenced by the chromium content of the soil in which the plants are grown and by feedstuffs fed to animals; also by processing methods, as chromium is leached into foods if processed or cooked in chromium-containing stainless steel equipment.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Supplementation ===
Chromium is an ingredient in [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN) because deficiency can occur after months of intravenous feeding with chromium-free TPN. For this reason, chromium is added to TPN solutions, along with other trace minerals.&lt;ref name=Stehle2016/&gt; It is also in nutritional products for [[preterm infant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid = 25527182|year = February 2015|last1 = Finch|first1 = Carolyn Weiglein|title = Review of trace mineral requirements for preterm infants: What are the current recommendations for clinical practice?|journal=Nutrition in Clinical Practice|volume = 30|issue = 1|pages = 44–58|doi = 10.1177/0884533614563353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the mechanism in biological roles for chromium is unclear, in the United States chromium-containing products are sold as non-prescription dietary supplements in amounts ranging from 50 to 1,000 μg. Lower amounts of chromium are also often incorporated into multi-vitamin/mineral supplements consumed by an estimated 31% of adults in the United States.&lt;ref name=Kantor2016/&gt; Chemical compounds used in dietary supplements include chromium chloride, chromium citrate, [[chromium(III) picolinate]], [[Chromium polynicotinate|chromium(III) polynicotinate]], and other chemical compositions.&lt;ref name=ods/&gt; The benefit of supplements has not been proven.&lt;ref name=ods/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vincent2010&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1039/B920480F|title = Chromium: Celebrating 50 years as an essential element?|date = 2010|last1 = Vincent|first1 = John B|journal = Dalton Transactions|volume = 39|issue = 16|pages = 3787–3794|pmid = 20372701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Approved and disapproved health claims ====
In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved a Qualified Health Claim for chromium picolinate with a requirement for very specific label wording: "One small study suggests that chromium picolinate may reduce the risk of insulin resistance, and therefore possibly may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. FDA concludes, however, that the existence of such a relationship between chromium picolinate and either insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes is highly uncertain." At the same time, in answer to other parts of the petition, the FDA rejected claims for chromium picolinate and cardiovascular disease, retinopathy or kidney disease caused be abnormally high blood sugar levels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20171114183739/https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm073017.htm FDA Qualified Health Claims: Letters of Enforcement Discretion, Letters of Denial] U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Docket #2004Q-0144 (August 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, chromium(III) picolinate was approved by Health Canada to be used in dietary supplements. Approved labeling statements include: a factor in the maintenance of good health, provides support for healthy glucose metabolism, helps the body to metabolize carbohydrates and helps the body to metabolize fats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/monoReq.do?id=65 |title = Monograph: Chromium (from Chromium picolinate)|publisher = Health Canada|date = 9 December 2009|accessdate = 18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) approved claims in 2010 that chromium contributed to normal macronutrient metabolism and maintenance of normal blood glucose concentration, but rejected claims for maintenance or achievement of a normal body weight, or reduction of tiredness or fatigue.&lt;ref name=EFSA2010&gt;[https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1732 Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to chromium and contribution to normal macronutrient metabolism (ID 260, 401, 4665, 4666, 4667), maintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations (ID 262, 4667), contribution to the maintenance or achievement of a normal body weight (ID 339, 4665, 4666), and reduction of tiredness and fatigue (ID 261) pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006] European Food Safety Authority EFSA J 2010;8(10)1732.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chromium(VI) toxicity ===
The acute [[mouth|oral]] [[toxicity]] for [[Hexavalent chromium|chromium(VI)]] ranges between 50 and 150&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name="Katz"/&gt; In the body, chromium(VI) is reduced by several mechanisms to chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the chromate ion is transferred into the cell by a transport mechanism, by which also [[sulfate]] and [[phosphate]] ions enter the cell. The acute toxicity of chromium(VI) is due to its strong [[oxidation]]al properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions. [[Hemolysis]], [[renal]], and liver failure result. Aggressive dialysis can be therapeutic.&lt;ref name="Dayan"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Mechanisms of chromium toxicity, carcinogenicity and allergenicity: Review of the literature from 1985 to 2000 |first = AD|last = Dayan |journal = Human &amp; Experimental Toxicology |volume=20 |issue=9|pages = 439–451 |date=2001 |doi = 10.1191/096032701682693062 |last2 = Paine |first2 = AJ |pmid=11776406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[carcinogenity]] of chromate dust has been known for a long time, and in 1890 the first publication described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = A case of adeno-carcinoma of the left inferior turbinated body, and perforation of thenasal septum, in the person of a worker in chrome pigments |first = D.|last = Newman |journal = Glasgow Medical Journal |volume = 33|pages = 469–470 |date=1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langard"&gt;{{cite journal |title = One Hundred Years of Chromium and Cancer: A Review of Epidemiological Evidence and Selected Case Reports |first = S |last = Langard |journal = American Journal of Industrial Medicine |volume = 17 |issue = 2|pages = 189–214 |date = 1990 |doi = 10.1002/ajim.4700170205 |pmid = 2405656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the [[genotoxicity]] of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive [[hydroxyl radical]]s and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the [[DNA]]. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Mechanisms of chromium carcinogenicity and toxicity |first = MD|last = Cohen|journal = Critical Reviews in Toxicology |volume=23 |issue = 3|pages=255–281 |date=1993 |doi = 10.3109/10408449309105012 |last2 = Kargacin |first2 = B |last3 = Klein |first3 = CB |last4 = Costa |first4 = M |pmid = 8260068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Methods to Develop Inhalation Cancer Risk Estimates for Chromium and Nickel Compounds|date=2011|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Health and Environmental Impacts Division|location=Research Triangle Park, NC|url=https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo56032|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromium salts (chromates) are also the cause of [[allergic reaction]]s in some people. Chromates are often used to manufacture, amongst other things, leather products, paints, cement, mortar and anti-corrosives. Contact with products containing chromates can lead to allergic [[contact dermatitis]] and irritant dermatitis, resulting in ulceration of the skin, sometimes referred to as "chrome ulcers". This condition is often found in workers that have been exposed to strong chromate solutions in electroplating, tanning and chrome-producing manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = DermNet NZ|last = Ngan|first = V|date = 2002|title = Chrome Allergy|url = http://dermnetnz.org/dermatitis/chrome-allergy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Investigation of the threshold for allergic reactivity to chromium|last1 = Basketter|first1 = David|last2 = Horev|first2 = L|last3 = Slodovnik|first3 = D|last4 = Merimes|first4 = S|last5 = Trattner|first5 = A|last6 = Ingber|first6 = A|journal = Contact Dermatitis|volume = 44|issue = 2|pages = 70–74|date = 2000|doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0536.2001.440202.x|pmid = 11205406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental issues ===
Because chromium compounds were used in [[dye]]s, [[paint]]s, and [[leather]] [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] compounds, these compounds are often found in soil and [[groundwater]] at active and abandoned industrial sites, needing [[environmental cleanup]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]]. [[Primer (paint)|Primer paint]] containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for [[aerospace]] and [[automobile]] refinishing applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first = Randall C|last = Baselt|title = Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man|edition = 8th|publisher = Biomedical Publications|date=2008 |pages = 305–307|isbn = 978-0-9626523-7-0|place = Foster City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Environmental Working Group]] studied the drinking water in 35 American cities in the first nationwide study. The study found measurable hexavalent chromium in the tap water of 31 of the cities sampled, with [[Norman, Oklahoma]], at the top of list; 25 cities had levels that exceeded California's proposed limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/healthusenvironmentpollutionwater|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101223164916/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/healthusenvironmentpollutionwater|archivedate = 23 December 2010|publisher = [[Yahoo News]]|title = US water has large amounts of likely carcinogen: study|date = 19 December 2010|accessdate = 19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Complications of pregnancy''' are health problems that are caused by [[pregnancy]]. Complications that occur primarily during [[childbirth]] are termed [[obstetric labor complications]], and problems that occur primarily after childbirth are termed [[puerperal disorders]]. Severe complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the [[Postpartum period|puerperium]] are present in 1.6% of mothers in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/MaternalInfantHealth/SevereMaternalMorbidity.html|title=Severe Maternal Morbidity in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=CDC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629114443/http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/MaternalInfantHealth/SevereMaternalMorbidity.html|archive-date=2015-06-29|deadurl=no|access-date=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1.5% of mothers in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sogc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Morbidity-EN-Final-PDF.pdf|title=Severe Maternal Morbidity in Canda|last=|first=|date=|website=The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309111959/http://sogc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Morbidity-EN-Final-PDF.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-09|deadurl=no|access-date=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the immediate [[postpartum period]] (puerperium), 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem.&lt;ref name="pmid7612509"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glazener CM, Abdalla M, Stroud P, Naji S, Templeton A, Russell IT | title = Postnatal maternal morbidity: extent, causes, prevention and treatment | journal = British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology | volume = 102 | issue = 4 | pages = 282–7 | date = April 1995 | pmid = 7612509 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12051189"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson JF, Roberts CL, Currie M, Ellwood DA | title = Prevalence and persistence of health problems after childbirth: associations with parity and method of birth | journal = Birth (Berkeley, Calif.) | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–94 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12051189 | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-536X.2002.00167.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term health problems (persisting after six months postpartum) are reported by 31% of women.&lt;ref name="Borders 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borders N | title = After the afterbirth: a critical review of postpartum health relative to method of delivery | journal = Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 242–248 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16814217 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmwh.2005.10.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the [[Postpartum period|puerperium]] resulted globally in 230,600 deaths, down from 377,000 deaths in 1990. The most common causes of maternal mortality are [[maternal bleeding]], [[Postpartum infections|maternal sepsis]] and other infections, [[Hypertensive disease of pregnancy|hypertensive diseases of pregnancy]], [[obstructed labor]], and [[:Category:Pregnancy with abortive outcome|pregnancy with abortive outcome]], which includes [[miscarriage]], [[ectopic pregnancy]], and [[Abortion|elective abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Global, regional, and national age-sex specific mortality for 264 causes of death, 1980-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 | journal = Lancet | volume = 390 | issue = 10100 | pages = 1151–1210 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28919116 | pmc = 5605883 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32152-9 | author1 = GBD 2016 Causes of Death Collaborators }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no clear distinction between complications of pregnancy and [[symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy]]. However, the latter do not significantly interfere with [[activities of daily living]] or pose any significant threat to the health of the mother or baby. Still, in some cases the same basic feature can manifest as either a discomfort or a complication depending on the severity. For example, mild [[nausea]] may merely be a discomfort ([[morning sickness]]), but if severe and with vomiting causing [[water-electrolyte imbalance]] it can be classified as a pregnancy complication ([[hyperemesis gravidarum]]).

==Maternal problems==
The following problems originate mainly in the mother.

=== Gestational diabetes ===
[[Gestational diabetes]] is when a woman without [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] develops [[Hyperglycemia|high blood sugar]] levels during [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/youre-pregnant-now-what/pregnancy-complications|title=Pregnancy complications {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hyperemesis gravidarum ===
[[Hyperemesis gravidarum]] is the presence of severe and persistent vomiting, causing dehydration and weight loss. It is more severe than the more common [[morning sickness]] and is estimated to affect 0.5–2.0% of pregnant women.&lt;ref name="Emergency"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Summers A | title = Emergency management of hyperemesis gravidarum | journal = Emergency Nurse | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 24–8 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22876404 | doi = 10.7748/en2012.07.20.4.24.c9206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodwin2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodwin TM | title = Hyperemesis gravidarum | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 401–17, viii | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18760227 | doi = 10.1016/j.ogc.2008.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pelvic girdle pain===
* ''Caused by'': [[Pelvic girdle pain]] (PGP) disorder is [[Chronic pain|pain]] caused by instability and limitation of mobility and functioning in any of the three pelvic joints. PGP can begin [[Childbirth|peri or postpartum]]. For most women, PGP resolves in the weeks after delivery, but for some it can last for years, resulting in a reduced tolerance for weight bearing activities. PGP affects around 45% of women during pregnancy: 25% report serious pain and 8% are severely disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPP), I: Terminology, clinical presentation, and prevalence European Spine Journal Vol 13, No. 7 / Nov. 2004 W. H. Wu, O. G. Meijer, K. Uegaki, J. M. A. Mens, J. H. van Dieën, P. I. J. M. Wuisman, H. C. Östgaard.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Treatment'': The treatment modality is based on the severity. A mild case would require rest, rehabilitation therapy and pain is usually manageable. More severe cases would also include mobility aids, strong [[analgesics]] and sometimes surgery. One of the main factors in helping women cope is with education, information and support. Many treatment options are available.

===High blood pressure===
{{Main|Hypertensive disease of pregnancy}}
Potential severe hypertensive states of pregnancy are mainly:
* [[Preeclampsia]] – gestational hypertension, [[proteinuria]] (&gt;300&amp;nbsp;mg), and [[edema]]. Severe preeclampsia involves a BP over 160/110 (with additional signs). It affects 5-8% of pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Villar J, Say L, Gulmezoglu AM, Meraldi M, Lindheimer MD, Betran AP, Piaggio G; Eclampsia and pre-eclampsia: a health problem for 2000 years. In Pre-eclampsia, Critchly H, MacLean A, Poston L, Walker J, eds. London, RCOG Press, 2003, pp 189-207.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Eclampsia]] – seizures in a pre-eclamptic patient, affect around 1.4% of pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abalos E, Cuesta C, Grosso AL, Chou D, Say L | title = Global and regional estimates of preeclampsia and eclampsia: a systematic review | journal = European Journal of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology | volume = 170 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23746796 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2013.05.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gestational hypertension]] 
* [[HELLP syndrome]] – [[Hemolytic anemia]], elevated [[liver enzyme]]s and a [[Thrombocytopenia|low platelet count]]. Incidence is reported as 0.5-0.9% of all pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Haram-2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haram K, Svendsen E, Abildgaard U | title = The HELLP syndrome: clinical issues and management.

* [[Acute fatty liver of pregnancy]] is sometimes included in the preeclamptic spectrum. It occurs in approximately one in 7,000 to one in 15,000 pregnancies.&lt;ref name=Mjahed&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mjahed K, Charra B, Hamoudi D, Noun M, Barrou L | title = Acute fatty liver of pregnancy | journal = Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics | volume = 274 | issue = 6 | pages = 349–53 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16868757 | doi = 10.1007/s00404-006-0203-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reyes&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reyes H, Sandoval L, Wainstein A, Ribalta J, Donoso S, Smok G, Rosenberg H, Meneses M | title = Acute fatty liver of pregnancy: a clinical study of 12 episodes in 11 patients | journal = Gut | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 101–6 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8307428 | pmc = 1374642 | doi = 10.1136/gut.35.1.101 | url = http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8307428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep vein thrombosis===
[[Deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) has an incidence of 0.5 to 7 per 1,000 pregnancies, and is the second most common cause of [[maternal death]] in developed countries after bleeding.&lt;ref name=uppsala&gt;Venös tromboembolism (VTE) — Guidelines for treatment in C counties. Bengt Wahlström, Emergency department, Uppsala Academic Hospital. January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Caused by'': [[Hypercoagulability in pregnancy|Pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability]] as a physiological response in preparation for the potential bleeding during [[childbirth]].
* ''Treatment'': Prophylactic treatment, e.g. with [[low molecular weight heparin]] may be indicated when there are additional risk factors for deep vein thrombosis.&lt;ref name=uppsala/&gt;

===Anemia===
Levels of [[hemoglobin]] are lower in the third trimesters. According to the [[United Nations]] (UN) estimates, approximately half of pregnant women suffer from anemia worldwide. Anemia prevalences during pregnancy differed from 18% in developed countries to 75% in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Wang S, An L, Cochran SD |chapter=Women |veditors=Detels R, McEwen J, Beaglehole R, Tanaka H |title=Oxford textbook of public health |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |pages=1587–601 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment varies due to the severity of the anaemia, and can be used by increasing iron containing foods, oral iron tablets or by the use of [[parenteral iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/youre-pregnant-now-what/pregnancy-complications|title=Pregnancy complications {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infection===
{{Main|Susceptibility and severity of infections in pregnancy}}
{{See | Neonatal infection}}
A pregnant woman is more susceptible to certain [[infection]]s. This increased risk is caused by an increased [[immune tolerance in pregnancy]] to prevent an immune reaction against the fetus, as well as secondary to [[maternal physiological changes in pregnancy|maternal physiological changes]] including a decrease in [[respiratory volume]]s and [[urinary stasis]] due to an enlarging uterus.&lt;ref name="KourtisRead2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kourtis AP, Read JS, Jamieson DJ | title = Pregnancy and infection | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 370 | issue = 23 | pages = 2211–8 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24897084 | pmc = 4459512 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1213566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pregnant women are more severely affected by, for example, [[influenza]], [[hepatitis E]], [[herpes simplex]] and [[malaria]].&lt;ref name="KourtisRead2014"/&gt; The evidence is more limited for [[coccidioidomycosis]], [[measles]], [[smallpox]], and [[varicella]].&lt;ref name="KourtisRead2014"/&gt; [[Mastitis]], or inflammation of the breast occurs in 20% of lactating women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaufmann R, Foxman B | title = Mastitis among lactating women: occurrence and risk factors | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 701–5 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1957190 | doi = 10.1016/0277-9536(91)90024-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some infections are [[Vertically transmitted infection|vertically transmissible]], meaning that they can affect the child as well.

=== Peripartum cardiomyopathy ===
[[Peripartum cardiomyopathy]] is decrease in heart function which occurs in the last month of pregnancy, or up to six months post-pregnancy. It increases the risk of [[congestive heart failure]], heart [[arrhythmias]], [[thromboembolism]], and [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pearson GD, Veille JC, Rahimtoola S, Hsia J, Oakley CM, Hosenpud JD, Ansari A, Baughman KL | title = Peripartum cardiomyopathy: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Office of Rare Diseases (National Institutes of Health) workshop recommendations and review | journal = JAMA | volume = 283 | issue = 9 | pages = 1183–8 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10703781 | doi = 10.1001/jama.283.9.1183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypothyroidism===
{{Main | Thyroid disease in women}}
Hypothyroidism (also called Hashimoto's disease) is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid in women. This condition can have a profound effect during pregnancy and on the child. The infant may be seriously affected and have a variety of birth defects. Many women with Hashimoto's disease develop an underactive thyroid. The clinician will do an exam and order one or more tests.&lt;ref name=NIH2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Tyroid disease in Women|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/pregnancy-thyroid-disease|publisher = Office on Women's Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|access-date=20 July 2017|date=1 February 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/thyroid-disease|title=Thyroid disease|last=|first=|date=6 February 2017|website=womenshealth.gov|publisher=[[Office on Women's Health]], U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ATA&gt;{{cite web | title =Postpartum Thyroiditis | publisher = American Thyroid Association | access-date = 20 July 2017 | date = 2014| url = http://www.thyroid.org/wp-content/uploads/patients/brochures/Postpartum_Thyroiditis_brochure.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fetal and placental problems==
The following problems occur in the fetus or [[placenta]], but may have serious consequences on the mother as well.

===Ectopic pregnancy===
[[Ectopic pregnancy]] is implantation of the embryo outside the uterus
* ''Caused by'': Unknown, but risk factors include [[Smoking and pregnancy|smoking]], advanced maternal age, and prior surgery or trauma to the [[fallopian tube]]s.
* ''Treatment:'' In most cases, [[Laparoscopic surgery|keyhole surgery]] must be carried out to remove the fetus, along with the fallopian tube. If the pregnancy is very early, it may resolve on its own, or it can be treated with [[Methotrexate#Abortion|methotrexate]], an [[abortifacient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ectopic-pregnancy/pages/treatment.aspx|title=Ectopic pregnancy - Treatment - NHS Choices|last=Choices|first=NHS|website=www.nhs.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miscarriage ===
[[Miscarriage]] is the loss of a pregnancy prior to 20 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-are-pregnant/pregnancy-complications.html |title=Pregnancy complications {{!}} womenshealth.gov |website=www.womenshealth.gov |access-date=2016-11-13 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114002619/https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-are-pregnant/pregnancy-complications.html |archive-date=2016-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, miscarriage is defined as the loss of a pregnancy during the first 23 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Miscarriage/Pages/Introduction.aspx|title=Miscarriage|last=|first=|date=|website=NHS Choice|publisher=NHS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215140413/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Miscarriage/Pages/Introduction.aspx|archive-date=2017-02-15|deadurl=no|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Placental abruption===
[[Placental abruption]] is the separation of the placenta from the uterus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/youre-pregnant-now-what/pregnancy-complications|title=Pregnancy complications {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Caused by'': Various causes; risk factors include maternal [[hypertension]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], and drug use.
* ''Treatment'': Immediate [[birth|delivery]] if the fetus is mature (36 weeks or older), or if a younger fetus or the mother is in distress. In less severe cases with immature fetuses, the situation may be monitored in hospital, with treatment if necessary.

=== Placenta praevia ===
[[Placenta praevia]] is when the placenta fully or partially covers the cervix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/youre-pregnant-now-what/pregnancy-complications|title=Pregnancy complications {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Placenta accreta ===
[[Placenta accreta]] is an abnormal adherence of the placenta to the uterine wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wortman AC, Alexander JM | title = Placenta accreta, increta, and percreta | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 137–54 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23466142 | doi = 10.1016/j.ogc.2012.12.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple pregnancies===
{{Main|Multiple birth}}

Multiples may become [[monochorionic]], sharing the same [[chorion]], with resultant risk of [[twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome]]. Monochorionic multiples may even become [[monoamniotic]], sharing the same [[amniotic sac]], resulting in risk of [[umbilical cord compression]] and [[umbilical cord entanglement|entanglement]]. In very rare cases, there may be [[conjoined twins]], possibly impairing function of internal organs.

===Vertically transmitted infection===
{{Further|Vertically transmitted infection}}
{{Further|Neonatal infection}}
The embryo and fetus have little or no [[immune function]]. They depend on the immune function of their mother. Several [[pathogen]]s can cross the [[placenta]] and cause (perinatal) infection. Often [[microorganism]]s that produce minor [[illness]] in the mother are very dangerous for the developing embryo or fetus. This can result in [[spontaneous abortion]] or major [[developmental disorder]]s. For many infections, the baby is more at risk at particular stages of pregnancy. Problems related to perinatal infection are not always directly noticeable.

The term [[TORCH complex]] refers to a set of several different infections that may be caused by transplacental infection.

Babies can also become infected by their mother during [[Childbirth|birth]]. During birth, babies are exposed to maternal [[blood]] and [[body fluid]]s without the [[placental barrier]] intervening and to the maternal genital tract. Because of this, blood-borne microorganisms ([[hepatitis B]], [[HIV]]), organisms associated with [[sexually transmitted disease]] (e.g., [[Neisseria gonorrhoeae|gonorrhoea]] and [[Chlamydia trachomatis|chlamydia]]), and normal [[fauna]] of the [[genito-urinary tract]] (e.g., [[Candida albicans|Candida]]) are among those commonly seen in infection of newborns.

===Intrauterine bleeding===
There have been rare but known cases of intrauterine bleeding caused by injury inflicted by the fetus with its fingernails or toenails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3109/01443618009067348 | volume=1 | issue=2 | title=Lacerations of the umbilical cord arteries inflicted by the fetus | year=1980 | journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology | pages=73–74 | author=Husemeyer R. P., Helme Sally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General risk factors ==
Factors increasing the risk (to either the woman, the fetus/es, or both) of pregnancy complications beyond the normal level of risk may be present in a woman's medical profile either before she becomes pregnant or during the pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health problems in pregnancy |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/healthproblemsinpregnancy.html |website=Medline Plus |publisher=US National Library of Medicine |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813100208/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/healthproblemsinpregnancy.html |archive-date=2013-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These pre-existing factors may relate to physical or mental health, or to social issues, or a combination of those.&lt;ref name="MMHE"&gt;{{cite web|last=Merck |title=Risk factors present before pregnancy |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/pregnancy_at_high-risk/risk_factors_present_before_pregnancy.html |website=Merck Manual Home Health Handbook |publisher=Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601003348/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/pregnancy_at_high-risk/risk_factors_present_before_pregnancy.html |archive-date=2013-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common risk factors include:

**Ionizing radiation
*Risks arising from previous pregnancies
**Complications experienced during a previous pregnancy are more likely to recur.
**Many previous pregnancies: Women who have had five previous pregnancies face increased risks of very rapid labor and excessive bleeding after delivery.
**Multiple previous fetuses: Women who have had more than one fetus in a previous pregnancy face increased risk of [[placenta previa|mislocated placenta]].&lt;ref name="MMHE" /&gt;
*[[multiple births|Multiple pregnancy]]: Having more than one fetus in a single pregnancy.
*Social and [[socioeconomic]] factors: Generally speaking, unmarried women and those in lower socioeconomic groups experience an increased level of risk in pregnancy, due at least in part to lack of access to appropriate [[prenatal care]].&lt;ref name="MMHE" /&gt;
*[[Unintended pregnancy]]: Unintended pregnancies preclude preconception care and delays prenatal care.  They preclude other preventive care, may disrupt life plans and on average have worse health and psychological outcomes for the mother and, if birth occurs, the child.&lt;ref name=BestIntent &gt;{{cite book | last1 = Eisenberg | first1 = Leon | last2 = Brown | first2 = Sarah Hart | name-list-format = vanc |title=The best intentions: unintended pregnancy and the well-being of children and families |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=1995 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=4903 |pages= |isbn=978-0-309-05230-6 |oclc= |doi= |access-date=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HP2020FP&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Planning - Healthy People 2020 |url=http://healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=13 |access-date=2011-08-18 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228012908/http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=13 |archive-date=2010-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Human height|Height]]: Pregnancy in women whose height is less than 1.5 meters (5&amp;nbsp;feet) correlates with higher incidences of [[preterm birth]] and [[Small for gestational age|underweight babies]]. Also, these women are more likely to have a small [[human pelvis|pelvis]], which can result in such complications during childbirth as [[shoulder dystocia]].&lt;ref name="MMHE" /&gt;
*[[Human weight|Weight]]
**Low weight: Women whose pre-pregnancy weight is less than 45.5 kilograms (100 pounds) are more likely to have [[Small for gestational age|underweight babies]].
**[[Obesity|Obese]] women are more likely to have [[Large for gestational age|very large babies]], potentially increasing difficulties in [[childbirth]]. Obesity also increases the chances of developing [[gestational diabetes]], [[high blood pressure]], [[preeclampsia]], experiencing [[postterm pregnancy]] and requiring a [[cesarean]] delivery.&lt;ref name="MMHE" /&gt;
*[[Intercurrent disease in pregnancy]]: A disease and condition not necessarily directly caused by the pregnancy, such as [[Diabetes mellitus and pregnancy|diabetes mellitus in pregnancy]], [[Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy|SLE in pregnancy]] or [[thyroid disease in pregnancy]].

===High-risk pregnancy===

Some disorders and conditions can mean that pregnancy is considered high-risk (about 6-8% of pregnancies in the USA) and in extreme cases may be [[contraindicated]]. High-risk pregnancies are the main focus of doctors specialising in [[maternal-fetal medicine]].

Serious pre-existing disorders which can reduce a woman's physical ability to survive pregnancy include a range of [[congenital defect]]s (that is, conditions with which the woman herself was born, for example, those of the [[heart defect|heart]] or [[ICD-10 Chapter XVII: Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities#.28Q50–Q56.29 genital organs|reproductive organs]], some of which are listed above) and diseases acquired at any time during the woman's life.

===Low-risk pregnancy===
A Dutch 2010 research paper showed that "low-risk" pregnancy in the Netherlands may actually carry a higher risk of perinatal death than a "high-risk" pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Evers AC, Brouwers HA, Hukkelhoven CW, Nikkels PG, Boon J, van Egmond-Linden A, Hillegersberg J, Snuif YS, Sterken-Hooisma S, Bruinse HW, Kwee A | title = Perinatal mortality and severe morbidity in low and high risk term pregnancies in the Netherlands: prospective cohort study | journal = BMJ | volume = 341 | pages = c5639 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21045050 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c5639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computer-assisted interventions''' (CAI) is a field of research and practice, where [[medical]] interventions are supported by computer-based tools and methodologies. Examples include:
*[[Medical robot|Medical robotics]]
*Surgical and interventional navigation
*Imaging and image processing methods for CAI
*Clinical feasibility studies of computer-enhanced interventions
*Tracked and guided [[Biopsy|biopsies]]
*Alignment of pre-procedure images with the patient during the procedure
*Intraoperative decision supports
*Skill analysis and workflow studies in CAI
*Clinical studies of CAI showing first-in-man or early efficacy results
*[[User interface|User interfaces]] and visualization systems for CAI
*Surgical and interventional systems
*Novel surgical devices and sensors
*User performance studies 
*Validation and evaluation of CAI technology

The basic paradigm of patient-specific interventional medicine is a closed loop process, consisting of 
# combining specific information about the patient with the physician’s general knowledge to determine the patient’s condition; 
# formulating a plan of action; 
# carrying out this plan; and 
# evaluating the results.

The experience gathered over many patients may be combined to improve treatment plans and protocols for future patients. This process has existed since ancient times. Traditionally, all these steps have taken place in the physicians head. The ability of modern computer-based technology to assist humans in processing and acting on complex information will profoundly enhance this process in the 21st Century.

==Surgical Process Modeling and Analysis==
In order to gain an explicit and formal understanding of [[surgery]], the field of analyses and modelling of [[surgical procedures]] has recently emerged. The challenge is to support the [[surgeon]] and the [[surgical procedure]] through the understanding of [[Operating Room]] (OR) activities, with the help of [[sensor]]- or human-based systems. Related surgical models can then be introduced into a new generation of Computer-Assisted Interventions systems to improve the management of complex multimodal information, improve surgical workflows, increase surgical efficiency and the quality of care in the OR. Models created by these different approaches may have a large impact in future surgical innovations, whether for planning, intra-operative or post-operative purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Lalys F, Jannin P. Surgical process modelling: a review. International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery. 2013.DOI 10.1007/s11548-013-0940-5&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea of describing the surgical procedure as a sequence of tasks was first introduced by MacKenzie et al. (2001).&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie CL, Ibbotson AJ, Cao CGL, Lomax A. Hierarchical decomposition of laparoscopic surgery: a human factors approach to investigating the operating room environment. Minim Invasive Ther Allied Technol. 2001; 10(3): 121-8.&lt;/ref&gt;  and formalised in Jannin et al., 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Jannin P, Raimbault M, Morandi X, Seigneuret E and Gibaud B. Design of a neurosurgical gestures model for multimodal image guided surgery. Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery. 2001; 102-107&lt;/ref&gt; The term Surgical Process (SP) has been defined as a set of one or more linked procedures or activities that collectively realise a surgical objective within the context of an organisational structure defining functional roles and relationships.&lt;ref name="neumuth2009"&gt;Neumuth T, Jannin P, Strauss G, Meixensberger J, Burgert O. Validation of Knowledge Acquisition for Surgical Process Models. J AMIA. 2008; 16(1): 72-82.&lt;/ref&gt; This term is generally used to describe the steps involved in a surgical procedure. A Surgical Process Model (SPM) has been defined as a simplified pattern of an SP that reflects a predefined subset of interest of the SP in a formal or semi-formal representation. It relates to the performance of an SP with support from a workflow management system.

Surgical process models are described from observer based acquisition,&lt;ref name="neumuth2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jannin P Morandi X. Surgical models for computer-assisted neurosurgery. Neuroimage. 2007; 37(3): 783-91.&lt;/ref&gt; or sensor-based acquisition (such as signals,&lt;ref&gt;Ahmadi A, Sielhorst T, Stauder R, Horn M, Feussner H, Navab N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8652">'''Cost-effectiveness analysis''' ('''CEA''') is a form of [[economic]] [[financial analysis|analysis]] that compares the relative costs and outcomes (effects) of different courses of action.  Cost-effectiveness analysis is distinct from [[cost–benefit analysis]], which assigns a monetary value to the measure of effect.&lt;ref name=CEAvCBA&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bleichrodt H, Quiggin J |title=Life-cycle preferences over consumption and health: when is cost-effectiveness analysis equivalent to cost-benefit analysis? |journal=J Health Econ |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=681–708 |date=December 1999 |pmid=10847930 |doi= 10.1016/S0167-6296(99)00014-4|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cost-effectiveness analysis is often used in the field of health services, where it may be inappropriate to [[monetize]] health effect.  Typically the CEA is expressed in terms of a ratio where the denominator is a gain in health from a measure (years of life, premature births averted, sight-years gained) and the numerator is the cost associated with the health gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Gold MR | title = Cost-effectiveness in health and medicine | page = xviii|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly used outcome measure is [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALY).&lt;ref name=CEAvCBA/&gt;

[[Cost-utility analysis]] is similar to cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost-effectiveness analyses are often visualized on a plane consisting of [[Quadrant (plane geometry)|four-quadrants]], the cost represented on one axis and the effectiveness on the other axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Black|first=William|title=A Graphical Representation of Cost-Effectiveness.|journal=Med Decis Making|year=1990|volume=10|issue=3|pages=212–214|doi=10.1177/0272989x9001000308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cost-effectiveness analysis focuses on maximising the average level of an outcome, [[distributional cost-effectiveness analysis]] extends the core methods of CEA to incorporate concerns for the distribution of outcomes as well as their average level and make trade-offs between equity and efficiency, these more sophisticated methods are of particular interest when analysing interventions to tackle [[health inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asaria|first1=M|last2=Griffin|first2=S|last3=Cookson|first3=R|title=Distributional Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: A Tutorial.|journal=Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making|date=January 2016|volume=36|issue=1|pages=8–19|pmid=25908564|doi=10.1177/0272989x15583266|pmc=4853814}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asaria|first1=M|last2=Griffin|first2=S|last3=Cookson|first3=R|last4=Whyte|first4=S|last5=Tappenden|first5=P|title=Distributional cost-effectiveness analysis of health care programmes--a methodological case study of the UK Bowel Cancer Screening Programme.|journal=Health economics|date=June 2015|volume=24|issue=6|pages=742–54|pmid=24798212|doi=10.1002/hec.3058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

The concept of cost-effectiveness is applied to the planning and management of many types of organized activity. It is widely used in many aspects of life. In the acquisition of military [[tank]]s, for example, competing designs are compared not only for purchase price, but also for such factors as their operating [[radius]], top speed, [[rate of fire]], armor protection, and caliber and armor [[penetration (weapons)|penetration]] of their guns. If a tank's performance in these areas is equal or even slightly inferior to its competitor, but substantially less expensive and easier to produce, military planners may select it as more cost effective than the competitor.

Conversely, if the difference in price is near zero, but the more costly competitor would convey an enormous battlefield advantage through special ammunition, [[radar]] [[Fire-control system|fire control]] and [[laser]] [[range finding]], enabling it to destroy enemy tanks accurately at extreme ranges, military planners may choose it instead—based on the same cost-effectiveness principle.

===In pharmacoeconomics===

In the context of [[pharmacoeconomics]], the cost-effectiveness of a therapeutic or preventive intervention is the ratio of the cost of the intervention to a relevant measure of its effect. Cost refers to the resource expended for the intervention, usually measured in monetary terms such as [[dollar]]s or [[pound sterling|pounds]]. The measure of effects depends on the intervention being considered. Examples include the number of people cured of a disease, the mm Hg reduction in diastolic [[blood pressure]] and the number of symptom-free days experienced by a patient. The selection of the appropriate effect measure should be based on clinical judgment in the context of the intervention being considered.

A special case of CEA is [[cost–utility analysis]], where the effects are measured in terms of years of full health lived, using a measure such as [[quality-adjusted life year]]s or [[disability-adjusted life year]]s. Cost-effectiveness is typically expressed as an [[incremental cost-effectiveness ratio]] (ICER), the ratio of change in costs to the change in effects. A complete compilation of cost-utility analyses in the peer reviewed medical literature is available from the [[Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry]] website.

A 1995 study of the cost-effectiveness of over 500 life-saving medical interventions found that the median cost per intervention was $42,000 per life-year saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tengs TO, Adams ME, Pliskin JS |title=Five-hundred life-saving interventions and their cost-effectiveness |journal=Risk Anal. |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=369–90 |date=June 1995 |pmid=7604170 |doi= 10.1111/j.1539-6924.1995.tb00330.x|url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 systematic review found that industry-funded studies often concluded with cost effective ratios below $20,000 per QALY and low quality studies and those conducted outside the US and EU were less likely to be below this threshold. While the two conclusions of this article may indicate that industry-funded ICER measures are lower methodological quality than those published by non-industry sources, there is also a possibility that, due to the nature of retrospective or other non-public work, publication bias may exist rather than methodology biases. There may be incentive for an organization not to develop or publish an analysis that does not demonstrate the value of their product. Additionally, peer reviewed journal articles should have a strong and defendable methodology, as that is the expectation of the peer-review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bell CM, Urbach DR, Ray JG |title=Bias in published cost effectiveness studies: systematic review.|journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7543 |pages=699–703 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16495332 |pmc=1410902 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38737.607558.80 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In energy efficiency investments===
CEA has been applied to [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] investments in buildings to calculate the value of energy saved in $/kWh. The energy in such a calculation is virtual in the sense that it was never consumed but rather saved due to some energy efficiency investment being made. Such savings are sometimes called ''[[negawatt]]s''. The benefit of the CEA approach in energy systems is that it avoids the need to guess future energy prices for the purposes of the calculation, thus removing the major source of uncertainty in the appraisal of energy efficiency investments.&lt;ref&gt;Pekka Tuominen, Francesco Reda, Waled Dawoud, Bahaa Elboshy, Ghada Elshafei, Abdelazim Negm: [http://doi.org/10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00195-1 Economic Appraisal of Energy Efficiency in Buildings Using Cost-effectiveness Assessment].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8966">'''Cost–utility analysis''' ('''CUA''') is a form of [[financial analysis]] used to guide procurement decisions.

The most common and well-known application of this analysis is in [[pharmacoeconomics]], especially health [[technology assessment]] (HTA).

== Health economics ==
In health economics the purpose of CUA is to estimate the ratio between the cost of a health-related intervention and the benefit it produces in terms of the number of years lived in full health by the beneficiaries. Hence it can be considered a special case of [[cost-effectiveness analysis]], and the two terms are often used interchangeably.

Cost is measured in monetary units. Benefit needs to be expressed in a way that allows health states that are considered less preferable to full health to be given quantitative values. However, unlike [[cost–benefit analysis]], the benefits do not have to be expressed in monetary terms. In HTAs it is usually expressed in [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs).

If, for example, intervention A allows a patient to live for three additional years than if no intervention had taken place, but only with a quality of life weight of 0.6, then the intervention confers 3 * 0.6 = 1.8 QALYs to the patient. If intervention B confers two extra years of life at a quality of life weight of 0.75, then it confers an additional 1.5 QALYs to the patient. The net benefit of intervention A over intervention B is therefore 1.8 – 1.5 = 0.3 QALYs.

The [[incremental cost-effectiveness ratio]] (ICER) is the ratio between the difference in costs and the difference in benefits of two interventions. The ICER may be stated as (C1 – C0)/(E1 – E0) in a simple example where C0 and E0 represent the cost and gain, respectively, from taking no health intervention action. C1 and E1 would represent the cost and gain, respectively of taking a specific action. So, an example in which the costs and gains, respectively, are $140,000 and 3.5 QALYs, would yield a value of $40,000 per QALY. These values are often used by policy makers and hospital administrators to determine relative priorities when determining treatments for disease conditions. It is important to note that CUA measures relative patient or general population utility of a treatment or [[Pharmacoeconomics|pharmacoeconomic]] intervention. Its results give no absolute indicator of the value of a certain treatment.

The [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) in the UK has been using QALYs to measure the health benefits delivered by various treatment regimens. There is some question as to how well coordinated NICE and NHS are in making decisions about resource allocation. According to a recent study "cost effectiveness often does not appear to be the dominant consideration in decisions about resource allocation made elsewhere in the NHS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shah|first=K.K|title= Is the aim of the health care system to maximise QALYs? An investigation of 'what else matters' in the NHS|url=http://www.ohe.org/news/2011/05/17/qalys-v-other-criteria-in-nhs-decision-making/%5D|work=OHE Research Paper|publisher=Office of Health Economics|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While QALYs are used in the United States, they are not utilized to the same degree as they are in Europe.

In the United Kingdom, in January 2005, the NICE is believed to have a threshold of about £30,000 per QALY – roughly twice the mean income after tax – although a formal figure has never been made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, any health intervention which has an incremental cost of more than £30,000 per additional QALY gained is likely to be rejected and any intervention which has an incremental cost of less than or equal to £30,000 per extra QALY gained is likely to be accepted as cost-effective. This implies a value of a full life of about £2.4 million. For end of life treatments, a higher threshold of £50,000 per additional QALY gained is used by NICE.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In North America, a similar figure of US$50000 per QALY is often suggested as a threshold ICER for a cost-effective intervention.

A complete compilation of cost–utility analyses in the peer reviewed medical literature is available at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060925101826/http://www.tufts-nemc.org/cearegistry/ CEA Registry Website]

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===

On the plus side, CUA allows comparison across different health programs and policies by using a common unit of measure (money/QALYs gained). CUA provides a more complete analysis of total benefits than simple [[cost–benefit analysis]] does. This is because CUA takes into account the quality of life that an individual has, while CBA does not.

However, in CUA, societal benefits and costs are often not taken into account. Furthermore, some economists believe that measuring QALYs is more difficult than measuring the monetary value of life through health improvements, as is done with cost–benefit analysis. This is because in CUA you need to measure the health improvement effects for every remaining year of life after the program is initiated. While for [[Cost-benefit analysis]] (CBA) we have an approximate [[value of life]] ($2 million is one of the estimates), we do not have a QALY estimate for nearly every medical treatment or disease.

In addition, some people believe that life is priceless and there are ethical problems with placing a value on human life.

Also, the weighting of QALYs through [[time-trade-off]], standard gamble, or [[visual analogue scale]] is highly subjective.

=== Criticism of cost-utility analysis ===

There are criticisms of QALY. One involves QALY's lack of usefulness to the healthcare provider in determining the applicability of alternative treatments in the individual patient environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kind|first=P.|author2=Lafata, J. E. |author3=Matuszewski, K. |author4=Raisch, D. |title=The use of QALYs in clinical and patient decision-making: Issues and prospects|journal=Value in Health|date=February 2009|volume=12|issue=S1|pages=S27-S30|doi=10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00519.x|url=http://www.ispor.org/meetings/Invitational/QALY/Paper6.pdf|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the absence of incorporating the patient's willingness to pay (i.e. [[behavioral economics]]) in decisions to finance new treatments.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Another criticism involves age; elderly individuals are assumed to have lower QALYs since they do not have as many years to influence the calculation of the measurement; so comparing a health intervention's impact on a teenager's QALYs to an older individual's QALYs may not be considered "fair" since age is such an important factor. Specific health outcomes may also be difficult to quantify, thus making it difficult to compare all factors that may influence an individual's QALY.
Example: Comparing an intervention's impact on the livelihood of a single woman to a mother of three; QALYs do not take into account the importance that an individual person may have for others' lives.

In the US, the health care reform law ([[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]) has forbidden the use of QALYs "as a threshold to establish what type of health care is cost effective or recommended. Also, "The Secretary shall not utilize such an adjusted life year (or such a similar measure) as a threshold to determine coverage, reimbursement, or incentive programs under title XVIII".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neumann|first=PJ|author2=Weinstein MC|title=Legislating against use of cost-effectiveness information.|journal=N Engl J Med|date=October 2010|issue=16|pages=1495–1497|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1007168|accessdate=24 July 2011|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1007168|pmid=20942664|volume=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Law 111 – 148 – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ148/content-detail.html|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missions abroad==

In 2007, one academic study on Cuban internationalism surveyed the history of the programme, noting its broad sweep: "Since the early 1960s, 28,422 Cuban health workers have worked in 37 Latin American countries, 31,181 in 33 African countries, and 7,986 in 24 Asian countries. Throughout a period of four decades, Cuba sent 67,000 health workers to structural cooperation programs, usually for at least two years, in 94 countries ... an average of 3,350 health workers working abroad every year between 1960 and 2000."&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt;

The programme was initiated in 1963 as part of Cuba's foreign policy of supporting [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonial]] struggles. It began when Cuba sent a small medical brigade to [[Algeria]], which suffered from the mass withdrawal of French medical personnel during the independence war; some wounded soldiers and war orphans were also transported back to Cuba for treatment.&lt;ref name="brouwer09"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/090112brouwer.php | title=The Cuban Revolutionary Doctor: The Ultimate Weapon of Solidarity | first=Steve | last=Brouwer | date=January 2009 | work=[[Monthly Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gleijeses |first= Piero |authorlink= Piero Gleijeses |year= 1996 |title= Cuba's First Venture in Africa: Algeria, 1961-1965 |journal= [[Journal of Latin American Studies]] |volume= 28 |issue= 1 |pages= 159–195 |jstor= 157991 |quote= The Minister of Public Health, Jose Ramón Machado Ventura, led the group, which included 29 doctors, three dentists, 15 nurses and eight medical technicians.

(1985), "Cuba and Nicaragua: a key regional relationship, 1979-1984." ''Cuban Studies'' 15 (2), pp. 73-81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarianism===
However, alongside internationalism driven by foreign policy objectives, humanitarian objectives also played a role, with medical teams despatched to countries governed by ideological foes. For example, in 1960, 1972 and 1990 it dispatched emergency assistance teams to Chile and Nicaragua, and Iran following earthquakes.&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; Similarly, Venezuela's [[Mission Barrio Adentro]] programme grew out of the emergency assistance provided by Cuban doctors in the wake of the December 1999 mudslides in Vargas state, which killed 20,000 people.&lt;ref name=briggsAJPH09&gt;Briggs, Charles, and Mantini-Briggs, Clara (2009), ''American Journal of Public Health'', "Confronting Health Disparities: Latin American Social Medicine in Venezuela", I(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban medical missions were sent to [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Haiti]] following 1998's [[Hurricane Mitch]] and [[Hurricane Georges]], and remained there semi-permanently.&lt;ref name=brouwer09/&gt; This has been part of a dramatic expansion of Cuba’s international cooperation in health since 1998.&lt;ref name=devos08&gt;De Vos et al (2008), "Cuba's health system: Challenges ahead", ''Health Policy and Planning'', 23(4), pg:288-290&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Cuban doctors working abroad jumped from about 5000 in 2003 to more than 25,000 in 2005.&lt;ref name=devos08/&gt;

In Honduras the medical personnel had a substantial impact: "In the areas they served, infant mortality rates were reduced from 30.8 to 10.1 per 1,000 live births and maternal mortality rates from 48.1 to 22.4 per 1,000 live births between 1998 and 2003."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; However, as one academic paper notes, "The idea of a nation saving lives and improving the human condition is alien to traditional statecraft and is therefore discounted as a rationale for the Cuban approach."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; In 2004 the 1700 medical personnel in [[Guatemala]] received the [[Order of the Quetzal]], the country's highest state honour.&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; A 2005 attempt by Honduras to expel the Cuban mission on the basis that it was threatening Honduran jobs was successfully resisted by trade unions and community organisations.&lt;ref name=brouwer09/&gt;

Following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Asian tsunami]], Cuba sent medical assistance to [[Banda Aceh]] and [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=devos07&gt;De Vos et al (2007), "Cuba's International Cooperation in Health: an Overview", ''International Journal of Health Services'', Volume 37, Number 4, Pages 761–776&lt;/ref&gt; In response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], Cuba prepared to send 1500 doctors to the [[New Orleans]]; the offer was refused. Several months later the mission was dispatched to [[Pakistan]] following the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]] there. Ultimately Cuba sent "more than 2,500 disaster response experts, surgeons, family doctors, and other health personnel", who stayed through the winter for more than 6 months.&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, A.S.

===Venezuela===
{{main|Mission Barrio Adentro}}
Cuba's largest and most extensive medical aid effort is with [[Venezuela]]. The [[Mission Barrio Adentro|program]] grew out of the emergency assistance provided by Cuban doctors in the wake of the December 1999 mudslides in Vargas state, which killed 20,000 people. Under this bilateral effort, also known as the "oil for doctors" program, Cuba provides Venezuela with 31,000 Cuban doctors and dentists and provides training for 40,000 Venezuelan medical personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Andrea|date=26 December 2016|title=Cuban President Raul Castro faces deep problems in 2017|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a66f93b0a0df447dbbc5c7bb143d5b42/cuban-president-raul-castro-faces-deep-problems-2017|website=bigstory.ap.org|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=26 December 2016|quote=Venezuela was the prime destination alongside Brazil for Cuban doctors and other professionals whose salaries go directly to the Cuban government, providing another vital source of hard currency believed to be slackening in recent years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange, Venezuela provides Cuba with 100,000 barrels of oil per day. Based on February 2010 prices, the oil is worth $7.5 million per day, or nearly $3 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Affairs'', July/August 2010. page 69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===
Cuba has also sent notable missions to Bolivia (particularly since the 2005 election of [[Evo Morales]]) and [[South Africa]], the latter in particular after a post-[[apartheid]] [[brain drain]] of white doctors.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08&gt;Julie M. Feinsilver (2008), [http://www.nuso.org/upload/articulos/3537_2.pdf "Oil-for-Doctors: Cuban Medical Diplomacy Gets a Little Help From a Venezuelan Friend"], ''Nueva Sociedad'' 216 July–August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995, a co-operation agreement with South Africa has seen hundreds of Cuban doctors practice in South Africa, while South Africa sends medical students to Cuba to study.&lt;ref name="bday"&gt;[http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=172709 "Cuba, SA health deal is in good shape"]. ''Business Day'' (28 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the two governments signed another deal, increasing numbers on both sides. South African can now send 1 000 students to Cuba for training which, South Africa believes, will help train the doctors it so desperately needs for the implementation of its National Health Insurance Scheme.&lt;ref name="bday12"&gt;[http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=172709 "SA signs deal with Cuba for more doctors"]. ''Business Day'' (28 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1999 violence in [[East Timor]], the country of a million people was left with only 35 physicians and 75% of its population displaced. The number later increased to 79 physicians by 2004, and Cuba sent an additional 182 physicians and technicians.&lt;ref name=huishspiegel08&gt;Robert Huish and Jerry Spiegel (2008), "INTEGRATING HEALTH AND HUMAN SECURITY INTO FOREIGN POLICY: CUBA’S SURPRISING SUCCESS", ''The International Journal of Cuban Studies'' Volume 1 Issue 1, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

"From 1963 to 2004, Cuba was involved in the creation of nine medical faculties in Yemen, Guyana, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Uganda, Ghana, Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, and Haiti."&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt;

====Oceania====
In the 2000s, Cuba began establishing or strengthening relations with [[Pacific Island]] countries, and providing medical aid to those countries. Cuba's medical aid to Pacific countries has been two-pronged, consisting in sending doctors to Oceania, and in providing scholarships for Pacific students to study medicine in Cuba at Cuba's expense.

There are currently sixteen doctors providing specialised medical care in [[Kiribati]], with sixteen more scheduled to join them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2007/10/01/six-more-cuban-physicians-to-serve-in-kiribati Pacific Magazine: Six More Cuban Physicians To Serve In Kiribati&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubans have also offered training to I-Kiribati doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=26617 Kiribati discusses medical training with Cuba&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban doctors have reportedly provided a dramatic improvement to the field of medical care in Kiribati, reducing the child mortality rate in that country by 80%,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=33793 Cuban doctors reduce Kiribati infant mortality rate by 80 percent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and winning the proverbial hearts and minds in the Pacific. In response, the [[Solomon Islands]] began recruiting Cuban doctors in July 2007, while [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Fiji]] considered following suit.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

In 2008, Cuba was due to send doctors to the Solomon Islands, [[Vanuatu]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Nauru]] and Papua New Guinea,&lt;ref name="plenglish.com"/&gt; while seventeen medical students from Vanuatu would study in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=41373 "Vanuatu to get six doctors from Cuba"], Radio New Zealand International, August 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that it might also provide training for Fiji doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=38964 "Fiji says Cuban help sought as neighbours turn away"], Radio New Zealand International, April 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2008, fifteen Cuban doctors were serving in Kiribati, sixty-four Pacific students were studying medicine in Cuba, and Cuban authorities were offering "up to 400 scholarships to young people of that region".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubanews.ain.cu/2008/0916amistadislaspacifico.htm "Cuban Foreign Minister Opens Cuba-Pacific Islands Meeting"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090614213049/http://www.cubanews.ain.cu/2008/0916amistadislaspacifico.htm |date=2009-06-14 }}, Cuban News Agency, September 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Among those sixty-four students were twenty-five Solomon Islanders, twenty I-Kiribati, two Nauruans and seventeen ni-Vanuatu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubanews.ain.cu/2008/0929especialnusa.htm "Small Island States and Global Challenges"], Cuban News Agency, September 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Pacific Islanders have been studying in Cuba since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200809/s2366887.htm?tab=latest "Cuba-Pacific ministerial meeting underway in Havana"], ABC Radio Australia, September 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, [[Prensa Latina]] reported that Cuban doctors had "inaugurated a series of new health services in Tuvalu". One Cuban doctor had been serving in Tuvalu since October 2008, and two more since February 2009. They had reportedly "attended 3,496 patients, and saved 53 lives", having "opened ultrasound and abortion services, as well as specialized consultations on hypertension, diabetes, and chronic diseases in children". They had visited all the country's islands, and were training local staff in "primary health care, and how to deal with seriously ill patients, among other subjects".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubaheadlines.com/2009/06/14/17664/cuban_doctors_have_inaugurated_a_series_new_health_services_tuvalu_a_small_island_nation_pacific.html "Cuban doctors have inaugurated a series of new health services in Tuvalu a small island nation in the Pacific"], Prensa Latina, June 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principles===
Missions abroad are intended to provide services at low cost to the host country. "Patients are not charged for services, and the recipient countries are expected to cover only the cost of collective housing, air fare, and limited food and supplies not exceeding $200 a month. While
Cuban doctors are abroad, they continue to receive their salaries as well as a stipend in foreign currency."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; In 2008, the pay for Cuban doctors abroad was 183$ per month, whereas the pay for doctors working domestically was 23$ per month.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08/&gt; 
A new term - "disaster tourism" - has arisen in response to a growing number of large-scale natural disasters.  This phrase refers to individuals, governments and organizations who travel to a disaster area with the primary goal of having an "experience" rather than providing meaningful aid.  Such aid is often short-lived, and may even get in the way of more serious rescue efforts.  Cuban medical internationalism represents a polar opposite to this disaster tourism mentality, with a focus on large-scale, sustained aid targeting the most marginalized and under-served populations across the globe. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirk|first1=John|title=Healthcare Without Borders: Understanding Cuban Medical Internationalism|date=2015|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, FL|isbn=9780813061054|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internationalism at home==
Since 1990, Cuba has provided long-term care for 18,000 victims of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], "offering treatment for hair loss, skin disorders, cancer, leukemia, and other illnesses attributed to radioactivity."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt;

In response to the 1998 [[Hurricane Mitch]], Cuba set up the "Escuela Latinoamericana de Medicina" ("[[Latin American School of Medicine (Cuba)|Latin American School of Medicine]]"; ELAM) outside Havana, converted from a former naval base. It accepts around 1500 students per year.&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07&gt;Robert Huish and John M. Kirk (2007), "Cuban Medical Internationalism and the Development of the Latin American School of Medicine", ''Latin American Perspectives'', 34; 77&lt;/ref&gt; ELAM forms part of a range of medical education and training initiatives; "Cubans, with the help of Venezuela, are currently educating more doctors, about 70,000 in all, than all the medical schools in the United States, which typically have somewhere between 64,000 to 68,000 students enrolled in their programs."&lt;ref name=brouwer09/&gt;

Following the development of cooperation with Venezuela through Mission Barrio Adentro, Mission Milagro / Operación Milagro was set up to provide [[ophthalmology]] services to Cuban, Venezuelan and Latin American patients, both in Cuba and in other countries. "As of August 2007, Cuba had performed over 750,000 eye surgeries, at no cost, including 113,000 surgeries for its own citizens."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt;

==Effects on Cuba==

===Benefits===
Although humanitarian principles figure, ideological factors were prominent in Cuba's "doctor diplomacy", particularly during the [[Cold War]]. Subsequently, its continuation has been seen as a vital means to promote Cuba's image abroad and prevent international isolation. For Cuba's re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Honduras in 2002, Cuba's health missions in that country were "undoubtedly a deciding factor";&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; Guatemala reestablished diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1998.&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt;

At the 2009 [[5th Summit of the Americas]], U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] commented that at the summit he had heard much about the impact of Cuban "soft diplomacy" in the form of its medical internationalism. He said this might be a reminder to the [[United States]] that limiting its interactions with Latin American countries to military and drug interdiction might be limiting its influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/news/4376 "Chavez-Obama Meeting at Summit Relaunches U.S.-Venezuela Relations"] (20 April 2009). venezuelanalysis.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that Cuban medical internationalism promotes exports of Cuban medical technology, and may be a source of hard currency (although the targeting of poor countries reduces the hard currency potential of missions abroad).&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; In 2006 Cuba's earnings from medical services (including export of doctors) amounted to US$2,312m – 28% of total export receipts and net capital payments. This exceeded earnings from both nickel and cobalt exports and from tourism.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08/&gt; These earnings are achieved despite the fact that a substantial part of Cuba's medical internationalism since 1998 has been organised within the framework of the "Integrated Health Program" (Programa Integral de Salud, PIS); this cooperation program is free for the receiving country.&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt; Cuba's co-operation with Venezuela provides Cuba with cheap oil in exchange for its medical support to Mission Barrio Adentro.&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt; Bloomberg reported in March 2014 that Cuban state-controlled media forecasted revenue of $8.2 million that year from the program.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Sabo, Bloomberg.com, Mar 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that the programme has, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, "perform[ed] a critical function in consolidating socialist consciousness" within Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Saney, I. 2009, "Homeland of humanity: Internationalism within the Cuban revolution", ''Latin American Perspectives'' 36 (1), pp. 111-123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===
Although Cuba's large-scale medical training programmes and high doctor-patient ratios give it much latitude, the expansion of doctor diplomacy since 2004, particularly with the Barrio Adentro programme, has been dramatic: the number of Cuban doctors working abroad jumped from about 5000 in 2003 to more than 25,000 in 2005.&lt;ref name=devos08/&gt; This has had some impact on the domestic health system, for example with increased waiting times, particularly with regard to family doctors.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08/&gt; The number of patients per doctor rose from 139 to 179.&lt;ref name=huishspiegel08/&gt; In March 2008 Cuba announced a reorganisation of its domestic family doctor programme for greater efficiency.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08/&gt;

====Defection====
In 2000, two Cuban doctors working in Zimbabwe attempted to defect to Canada. They were prevented from doing so by two Zimbabwean soldiers, who handed them over to Cuban officials.&lt;ref name="vanish"&gt;''Miami Herald'', 6 June 2000, [http://www.cubanet.org/htdocs/CNews/y00/jun00/06e4.htm Cuban doctors vanish in Zimbabwe]&lt;/ref&gt; United Nations officials said Zimbabwe appeared to have violated national and international laws.

In August 2006 the [[United States]] under [[George W. Bush]] created the Cuban Medical Professional Parole program,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. State Dept, [https://www.state.gov/p/wha/rls/fs/2009/115414.htm "Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program"], accessed 4 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; specifically targeting Cuban medical personnel and encouraging them to defect when they are working in a country outside of Cuba.&lt;ref name=brouwer09/&gt; Of an estimated 40,000 eligible medical personnel, over 1000 had entered the United States under the program by October 2007, according to the chief of staff for U.S. Rep. [[Lincoln Diaz-Balart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.coha.org/2007/10/hundreds-of-cuban-medical-workers-defecting-to-us-while-overseas/ | title=Hundreds of Cuban medical workers defecting to U.S. while overseas | first=Tal | last=Abbady | work=South Florida Sun-Sentinel | date=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promised fast-track visa is not always forthcoming, with at least one applicant waiting a year for his visa; although according to Dr. Julio Cesar Alfonso of the Cuban dissident organization "Outside the Barrio," the U.S. government has rejected only a handful of the hundreds of applications for visas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/Article.aspx?id=981 | title=Cuban Doctors Abroad Helped to Defect by New U.S. Visa Policy | first=Mike | last=Ceasar | work=World Politics Review | date=August 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 January 2017, President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] announced the end of the program, saying that both Cuba and the US work to "combat diseases that endanger the health and lives of our people. By providing preferential treatment to Cuban medical personnel, the medical parole program contradicts those efforts, and risks harming the Cuban people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitefield|first1=Mimi|title=Obama ending ‘wet foot, dry foot’ Cuban immigration policy|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article126202999.html|work=Miami Herald|date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2007 paper published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' medical journal, "growing numbers of Cuban doctors sent overseas to work are defecting to the USA", some via Colombia, where they have sought temporary asylum.&lt;ref name="defect"/&gt; In February 2007, at least 38 doctors were requesting asylum in the U.S. embassy in Bogotá after asylum was denied by the Colombian government.&lt;ref&gt;''El Universal'' 3 Feb 2007 {{es icon}} [http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2007/02/03/pol_art_166219.shtml "Cubanos desertores atrapados en Bogotá"].&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban doctors working abroad are reported to be monitored by "minders" and subject to curfew.&lt;ref name="defect"&gt;Ceaser, Michael (2007). "Cuban doctors working abroad defect to the USA". ''The Lancet'', Volume 369, Issue 9569&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Luis Zuñiga, director of human rights for the [[Cuban American National Foundation]], Cuban doctors are "slave workers" who labor for meager wages while bolstering Cuba's image as a donor nation and "the Cuban government exports these doctors as merchandise".&lt;ref name="vanish"/&gt;

==Possible effects of lifting the U.S. embargo against Cuba==
An article by Laurie Garrett in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' warns that lifting of the [[United States embargo against Cuba|United States trade and travel restrictions on Cuba]] could have dire consequences for Cuba's healthcare system, leading to an exodus of thousands of well-trained Cuban healthcare professionals. U.S. companies could also transform the remaining healthcare system into a destination for [[medical tourism]]. Garrett concludes that if politicians do not take great care, lifting of the restrictions would rob Cuba of its greatest triumph.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Affairs'', July/August 2010. page 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Vanderpool''' (born February 18, 1960) is an American medical missionary and the CEO and founder of Live Beyond, which has provided medical, spiritual and logistical support to disaster ridden countries.

Vanderpool's work is unusual in that he combines his medical training with an explicit effort to convert his patients to Christianity.

==Early life and education==
Vanderpool was born in [[Dallas, Texas]], graduated from [[St. Mark's School of Texas]], and received his undergraduate degree from [[Abilene Christian University]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[https://smtexas.myschoolapp.com/ftpimages/73/download/The_Pride_2011_Winter.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended the [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] at [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]]. After medical school, Vanderpool completed two surgical residencies at [[Baylor University Medical Center]] where he trained as a vascular surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmdr.org/Staff.html |title=Staff |publisher=Mmdr.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126081445/http://www.mmdr.org/staff.html |archivedate=2014-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Vanderpool wife, Laurie, is a speaker for Women's Retreats and [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible Studies]], and speaks frequently for Down Syndrome organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Staff.html |title=Staff |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203173807/http://www.livebeyond.org/Staff.html |archivedate=2014-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Vanderpool remained in Texas after residency and practiced as a vascular surgeon before moving to Brentwood, Tennessee in 2001 and opening his private practice Lave MD in 2003.

Dr. Vanderpool created Lave MD to act as both a medical facility and a spa. 
After the establishment of his international organization in 2005, Dr. Vanderpool used much of Lave MD's proceeds to fund the organization's efforts abroad.

==Medical missionary work==
In 2005, after [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit the southeastern part of the United States, Dr. Vanderpool delivered healthcare across the Mississippi Coast out of a trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler |first=Joanne |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20358101,00.html |title=Hope Out of the Rubble |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal was to provide as much free healthcare as possible while the medical infrastructure could recover. Months later, Dr. Vanderpool established his organization, Medical Mobile Disaster Relief, as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with goals to provide disaster relief through medical clinics, clean water projects, and micro-finance projects to areas hit by disasters. 
Vanderpool and the Mobile Medical Disaster Relief team began working in Mozambique in 2006. His goal was to provide healthcare to the indigenous people of the country in addition to enhancing the economy by implementing micro-finance projects among widows living in the communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Mozambique.html |title=Mozambique |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085936/http://www.livebeyond.org/Mozambique.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, Dr. Vanderpool teamed up with the [[Belmont University|Belmont School of Nursing]] to construct a nursing curriculum that could teach the Mozambique women to be self-sufficient in caring for themselves and their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nashville.medicalnewsinc.com/physician-spotlight-david-vanderpool-md-cms-1943 |title=Physician Spotlight: David Vanderpool, MD on Nashville Medical News |publisher=Nashville.medicalnewsinc.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanderpool and his Mobile Medical Disaster Relief partnered with PACODEP (Partners in Community Development) in Ghana in order to provide medical care, educate the locals on water purification and distribute water purifiers. PACODEP works to free enslaved children who are trafficked through Ghana for purposes of fishing work. Dr. Vanderpool has also partnered with local hospitals in Ghana in order to provide free invasive surgeries to these rescued children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Ghana.html |title=Ghana |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110090632/http://www.livebeyond.org/Ghana.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Vanderpool partnered with Mission Lazarus in 2009 to build a sustainable medical clinic in [[Cedeño, Honduras]]. Given sufficient medical supplies and equipment, Vanderpool allowed Mission Lazarus to take over the clinic and provision of healthcare for the people of Cedeño.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Honduras.html |title=Honduras |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085736/http://www.livebeyond.org/Honduras.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live Beyond in Haiti===
Dr. Vanderpool shifted his focus in the aftermath of the [[Haiti earthquake 2010|earthquake]] that devastated the entire country of Haiti in 2010. In 2010, Vanderpool officially changed the name of his organization from Mobile Medical Disaster Relief to Live Beyond with a stated mission to be "an organization that chooses to Live Beyond...ourselves, our culture, our borders and this life so that others can Live Beyond…disease, hunger, poverty and despair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti.html |title=Haiti |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date=2010-01-12 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085813/http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial aid Vanderpool and his team brought to Haiti was primarily mobile medical care to relieve the thousands devastated and injured by the earthquake. Since then however, Vanderpool has grounded his missionary work in Thomazeau, Haiti where his organization began building a base. Vanderpool continued to provide free medical care, establishing a surgical hospital and clinic. In addition, clean water projects, orphanages, and other widow and orphan advocacy projects were begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti-Base.html |title=Haiti Base |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110090459/http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti-Base.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Dr. Vanderpool is a Christian, who combines religion and the spread of his faith with his medical work. In Haiti, he has made it one of his objectives to bring Haiti away from its traditional voodoo culture and provide "spiritual guidance" to the Haitians in the role of Christianity, with the belief that Christianity will lead to a better Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acuoptimist.com/2010/11/alumni-join-fight-against-cholera-in-haiti/ |title=Alumni join fight against Haiti cholera outbreak &amp;#124; The Optimist |publisher=Acuoptimist.com |date=2010-11-04 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085616/http://www.acuoptimist.com/2010/11/alumni-join-fight-against-cholera-in-haiti/ |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to moving to Haiti, each medical outreach trip made by Vanderpool and other Live Beyond participants included prayer and Christian ministry along with healthcare to the voodoo priests, island chiefs, idol worshipers and the sick and dying in Haiti. On the Live Beyond site, Vanderpool's religious impact since being in Haiti has been characterized as leading to the baptism of dozens, the saving of tribes through "Bibles being read in their own languages" and "the Kingdom is being expanded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Our-Mission.html |title=Our-Mission |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085458/http://www.livebeyond.org/Our-Mission.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Dr. Vanderpool promotes religious missionary work in tandem with his medical relief and sustainable development efforts. A worship center is being built in Thomazeau, Haiti and monthly mission trips are promoted and scheduled for Americans to travel to Thomazeau and volunteer.

[[Globalization]], the flow of information, goods, capital, and people across political and geographic boundaries, allows infectious diseases to rapidly spread around the world, while also allowing the alleviation of factors such as hunger and poverty, which are key determinants of global health.&lt;ref name= global&gt;{{cite web |author=Daulaire, N. |title=Globalization and Health |date=July 12, 1999 |work=International RoundtabResponses to Globalization: Rethinking Equity and Health’ jointly organized by the Society for International Development (SID), the World Health Organization (WHO), and The Rockefeller Foundation (RF) |url=http://www.globalhealth.org/assets/html/drmed3.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622194117/http://www.globalhealth.org/assets/html/drmed3.html|archivedate=2011-06-22}} &lt;!-- same as doi:10.1057/palgrave.development.1110077 ? --&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of diseases across wide geographic scales has increased through history.  Early diseases that spread from Asia to Europe were bubonic plague, influenza of various types, and similar infectious diseases.

In the current era of globalization, the world is more interdependent than at any other time.  Efficient and inexpensive transportation has left few places inaccessible, and increased global trade in agricultural products has brought more and more people into contact with animal diseases that have subsequently jumped [[species]] barriers (see [[zoonosis]]).&lt;ref name= Well &gt;http://www.richardwellsresearch.com/richardwells/pdfs%20and%20documents/BJIC%20Oct&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization intensified during the [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]], but trading routes had long been established between Asia and Europe, along which diseases were also transmitted.  An increase in travel has helped spread diseases to natives of lands who had not previously been exposed.  When a [[Indigenous peoples|native]] population is infected with a new disease, where they have not developed [[antibodies]] through generations of previous exposure, the new disease tends to run rampant within the population.

[[Etiology]], the modern branch of [[science]] that deals with the causes of [[infectious disease]], recognizes five major modes of disease transmission: airborne, waterborne, bloodborne, by direct contact, and through [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] ([[insect]]s or other creatures that carry germs from one species to another).&lt;ref name=Altman&gt;{{cite book |first=Linda Jacobs |last=Altman |title=Plague and Pestilence: A History of Infectious Disease |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A8dzZAFnHmQC |year=1998 |publisher=Enslow |isbn=978-0-89490-957-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As humans began traveling over seas and across lands which were previously isolated, research suggests that diseases have been spread by all five transmission modes.

==Travel patterns and globalization==
The [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]] generally refers to the period between the 15th and 17th centuries.  During this time, technological advances in [[shipbuilding]] and navigation made it easier for nations to explore outside previous boundaries.  Globalization has had many benefits, for example, new products to [[European ethnic groups|European]]s were discovered, such as [[tea]], [[silk]] and [[sugar]] when Europeans developed new [[trade routes]] around [[Africa]] to [[India]] and the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], [[Asia]], and eventually running to the [[Americas]].

In addition to trading in goods, many nations began to trade in [[slavery]].  Trading in slaves was another way by which diseases were carried to new locations and peoples, for instance, from sub-Saharan Africa to the Caribbean and the Americas.  During this time, different [[societies]] began to integrate, increasing the concentration of [[human]]s and [[animal]]s in certain places, which led to the emergence of new diseases as some jumped in mutation from animals to humans.

During this time [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]]s' and [[witch doctor]]s' treatment of disease was often focused on [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[religion]], and healing the entire [[Human body|body]] and [[soul]], rather than focusing on a few symptoms like [[modern medicine]].  Early medicine often included the use of [[herbs]] and [[meditation]].  Based on archeological evidence, some prehistoric practitioners in both Europe and South America used [[trephining]], making a hole in the skull to release illness.&lt;ref&gt;"One curious method of providing the disease with means of escape from the body was by making a hole, 2.5 to five centimeters across, in the skull of the victim—the practice of trepanning, or trephining. Trepanned skulls of prehistoric date have been found in Britain, France, and other parts of Europe and in Peru. Many of them show evidence of healing and, presumably, of the patient's survival. The practice still exists among primitive people in parts of Algeria, in Melanesia, and perhaps elsewhere, though it is fast becoming extinct. "Medicine, History of",  (2006), in ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved November 22, 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-35642&lt;/ref&gt;  Severe diseases were often thought of as [[supernatural]] or magical.  The result of the introduction of Eurasian diseases to the Americas was that many more native peoples were killed by disease and [[Microorganism|germs]] than by the colonists' use of guns or other weapons.  Scholars estimate that over a period of four centuries, epidemic diseases wiped out as much as 90 percent of the American indigenous populations.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

In Europe during the age of exploration, diseases such as [[smallpox]], [[measles]] and [[tuberculosis]] (TB) had already been introduced centuries before through trade with Asia and Africa.  People had developed some antibodies to these and other diseases from the Eurasian continent.  When the Europeans traveled to new lands, they carried these diseases with them.  (Note: Scholars believe TB was already endemic in the Americas.)  When such diseases were introduced for the first time to new populations of humans, the effects on the native populations were widespread and deadly. The [[Columbian Exchange]], referring to [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first contact with the native peoples of the [[Caribbean]], began the trade of animals, and plants, and unwittingly began an exchange of diseases.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

It was not until the 1800s that humans began to recognize the existence and role of germs and [[microbes]] in relation to disease.  Although many thinkers had ideas about germs, it was not until [[Louis Pasteur]] spread his [[germ theory|theory about germs]], and the need for washing hands and maintaining [[sanitation]] (particularly in medical practice), that anyone listened.  Many people were quite skeptical, but on May 22, 1881 Pasteur persuasively demonstrated the validity of his germ theory of disease with an early example of [[vaccination]]. The [[anthrax]] vaccine was administered to 25 [[sheep]] while another 25 were used as a control. On May 31, 1881 all of the sheep were exposed to anthrax.  While every sheep in the [[control group]] died, each of the vaccinated sheep survived.&lt;ref name= CDCPT&gt;{{cite journal |author=Trachtman P |title=About the Cover: Experimentation du virus charbonneux: "Le Pelerin," 1922. Homage a Louis Pasteur. Dessin de Damblans. |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=8 |issue=2 |date=February 2002 |doi=10.3201/eid0802.AC0802 |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/8/2/ac-0802_article.htm?s_cid=eid_cover_img |pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur’s experiment would become a milestone in disease prevention.  His findings, in conjunction with other vaccines that followed, changed the way globalization affected the world.

===Effects of globalization on disease in the modern world===
Modern modes of [[transportation]] allow more people and products to [[travel]] around the world at a faster pace; they also open the airways to the transcontinental movement of infectious disease vectors.&lt;ref name=NAP&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/books/0309100984/html/22.html |title=''The Impact of Globalization on Infectious Disease Emergence and Control: Exploring the Consequences and Opportunities,'' Workshop Summary - Forum on Microbial Threats |publisher=Nap.edu |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the [[West Nile Virus]].  It is believed that this disease reached the [[United States]] via “mosquitoes that crossed the ocean by riding in airplane wheel wells and arrived in New York City in 1999.”&lt;ref name=NAP /&gt; With the use of air travel, people are able to go to foreign lands, contract a disease and not have any symptoms of illness until after they get home, and having exposed others to the disease along the way.

As medicine has progressed, many vaccines and cures have been developed for some of the worst diseases (plague, syphilis, typhus, cholera, malaria) which people suffer.  But, because the [[evolution]] of disease [[organisms]] is very rapid, even with vaccines, there is difficulty providing full [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to many diseases.  Finding vaccines at all for some diseases remains extremely difficult.  Without vaccines, the global world remains vulnerable to infectious diseases.

Evolution of disease presents a major threat in modern times.  For example, the current "swine flu" or [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1 virus]] is a new strain of an old form of flu, known for centuries as Asian flu based on its origin on that continent.  From 1918–1920, a post-[[World War I]] [[1918 flu pandemic|global influenza epidemic]] killed an estimated 50–100 million people, including half a million in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/reviews/reviewview.cfm?id=72 Dorothy A. Pettit and Janice Bailie, ''Before There Was Swine Flu''; Anne Sealey, Review: "A Cruel Wind: Pandemic Flu in America, 1918-1920"], eHistory, July Review, 2009; Ohio State University, accessed 26 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  H1N1 is a virus that has evolved from and partially combined with portions of avian, swine, and human flu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacKenzie, Debora |title=Swine flu: The predictable pandemic? |journal=New Scientist |issue=2706 |date=29 April 2009 |doi= |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227063.800-swine-flu-the-predictable-pandemic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization has increased the spread of infectious diseases from South to North, but also the risk of non-communicable diseases by transmission of culture and behavior from North to South. It is important to target and reduce the spread of infectious diseases in developing countries.  However, addressing the risk factors of non-comunicable diseases and lifestyle risks in the South that cause disease, such as use or consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and unhealthy foods, is important as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ollila, Eeva |title=Global Health Priorities-Priorities of the Wealthy? |journal=Globalization and Health |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=6 |year=2005 |doi=10.1186/1744-8603-1-6 |pmid=15847685 |pmc=1143784 |url=http://www.globalizationandhealth.com/content/1/1/6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific diseases==

===Plague===
[[Bubonic plague]] is a variant of the deadly [[flea]]-borne disease [[Yersinia pestis|plague]], which is caused by the [[Enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]] ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', that devastated human populations beginning in the 14th century.  Bubonic plague is primarily spread by fleas that lived on the [[black rat]], an animal that originated in south Asia and spread to Europe by the 6th century.  It became common to cities and villages, traveling by ship with explorers.  A human would become infected after being bitten by an infected flea.  The first sign of an infection of bubonic plague is swelling of the [[lymph nodes]], and the formation of [[buboes]].  These buboes would first appear in the groin or armpit area, and would often ooze [[pus]] or [[blood]].  Eventually infected individuals would become covered with dark splotches caused by bleeding under the skin.  The symptoms would be accompanied by a high [[fever]], and within four to seven days of infection, more than half the victims would die.&lt;ref name= Mariner&gt;http://www.mariner.org/exploration/index.php?page=faq. Retrieved October 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 14th and 15th century, humans did not know that a bacterium was the cause of plague, and efforts to slow the spread of disease were futile.

The first recorded outbreak of plague occurred in [[China]] in the 1330s, a time when China was engaged in substantial trade with western Asia and Europe.  The plague reached Europe in October 1347.  It was thought to have been brought into Europe through the port of [[Messina]], [[Sicily]], by a fleet of Genoese trading ships from [[Caffa|Kaffa]], a seaport on the [[Crimean peninsula]].&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt;  When the ship left port in Kaffa, many of the inhabitants of the town were dying, and the crew was in a hurry to leave.  By the time the fleet reached Messina, all the crew were either dead or dying; the rats that took passage with the ship slipped unnoticed to shore and carried the disease with them and their fleas.&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt;

Within Europe, the plague struck port cities first, then followed people along both sea and land trade routes.  It raged through [[Italy]] into [[France]] and the [[British Isles]].  It was carried over the [[Alps]] into [[Switzerland]], and eastward into [[Hungary]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt; For a time during the 14th and 15th centuries, the plague would recede.  Every ten to twenty years, it would return.  Later [[epidemics]], however, were never as widespread as the earlier outbreaks, when 60% of the population died.

The plague has never died out.  From 1896–1918 the plague swept through India, taking the lives of over 12.5 million people.  Between 1906 and 1914, the Plague Research Commission was created, and published supplements to the ''Journal of Hygiene''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Catanach, I.J. |title=The "Globalization" of Disease? India and the Plague |journal=[[Journal of World History]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=131–153, See p. 131 |date=Spring 2001 |jstor=20078880 |doi=10.1353/jwh.2001.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measles===
[[Measles]] is a highly contagious airborne [[virus]] spread by contact with infected oral and nasal fluids.  When a person with measles coughs or sneezes, he releases microscopic particles into the air.  During the 4- to 12-day [[incubation period]], an infected individual shows no symptoms, but as the disease progresses, the following symptoms appear: runny nose, cough, red eyes, extremely high fever and a rash.

Measles is an [[endemic disease]], meaning that it has been continually present in a community, and many people developed resistance.  In populations that have not been exposed to measles, exposure to the new disease can be devastating.  In 1529, a measles outbreak in [[Cuba]] killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox.  Two years later measles was responsible for the deaths of half the indigenous population of [[Honduras]], and ravaged [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and the [[Inca]] civilization.&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt;

Historically, measles was very prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious.  According to the National Immunization Program, 90% of people were infected with measles by age 15, acquiring immunity to further outbreaks.  Until a vaccine was developed in 1963, measles was considered to be deadlier than smallpox.&lt;ref name=CDCMeasles&gt;{{cite book |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |chapter=Ch. 12: Measles |chapterurl=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html |veditors=Atkinson W, Wolfe S, Hamborsky J |title=Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases |publisher=Public Health Foundation |location=Washington DC |year=2012 |edition=12th |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/table-of-contents.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310044843/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/table-of-contents.html |archivedate=2017-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vaccination reduced the number of reported occurrences by 98%.  Major epidemics have predominantly occurred in unvaccinated populations, particularly among nonwhite [[Hispanic]] and [[African American]] children under 5 years old.&lt;ref name=CDCMeasles /&gt; In 2000 a group of experts determined that measles was no longer endemic in the United States.  The majority of cases that occur are among immigrants from other countries.

===Typhus===
Typhus is caused by ''[[rickettsia]]'', which is transmitted to humans through [[lice]].  The main [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for [[typhus]] is the [[Oriental rat flea|rat flea]].  Flea bites and infected flea feaces in the respiratory tract are the two most common methods of transmission.  In areas where rats are not common, typhus may also be transmitted through [[cat]] and [[opossum]] fleas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parola P, Vogelaers D, Roure C, Janbon F, Raoult D |title=Murine typhus in travelers returning from Indonesia |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=677–80 |year=1998 |pmid=9866749 |pmc=2640266 |doi=10.3201/eid0404.980423}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[incubation period]] of typhus is 7–14 days.  The symptoms start with a [[fever]], then headache, [[rash]], and eventually [[stupor]].  Spontaneous recovery occurs in 80–90% of victims.

The first outbreak of typhus was recorded in 1489.

It was a disease associated with the crowded conditions of urban poverty and [[refugees]] as well.  Finally, during [[World War I]], governments instituted preventative [[delousing]] measures among the armed forces and other groups, and the disease began to decline.&lt;ref name="USAMRMC"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of [[antibiotic]]s has allowed disease to be controlled within two days of taking a 200&amp;nbsp;mg dose of [[tetracycline]].

===Syphilis===
Syphilis is a [[sexually transmitted disease]] that causes open sores, [[delirium]] and rotting skin, and is characterized by [[genital ulcer]]s.  Syphilis can also do damage to the nervous system, brain and heart.  The disease can be transmitted from mother to child.

The origins of [[syphilis]] are unknown, and some historians argue that it descended from a twenty-thousand-year-old African [[zoonosis]].  Other historians place its emergence in the [[New World]], arguing that the crews of Columbus’s ships first brought the disease to [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt; The first recorded case of syphilis occurred in [[Naples]] in 1495, after [[Charles VIII of France|King Charles VIII]] of France besieged the city of Naples, [[Italy]].  The soldiers, and the prostitutes who followed their camps, came from all corners of Europe.  When they went home, they took the disease with them and spread it across the continent.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

=== Smallpox ===
[[Smallpox]] is a highly contagious disease caused by the [[Variola virus]].  There are four variations of smallpox; variola major, variola minor, haemorrhagic, and malignant, with the most common being variola major and variola minor.  Symptoms of the disease including [[hemorrhaging]], [[blindness]], back ache, [[vomiting]], which generally occur shortly after the 12- to 17-day incubation period.  The virus begins to attack [[skin]] cells, and eventually leads to an eruption of pimples that cover the whole body.  As the disease progresses, the [[pimples]] fill up with pus or merge.  This merging results in a sheet that can detach the bottom layer from the top layer of skin.  The disease is easily transmitted through airborne pathways (coughing, sneezing, and breathing), as well as through contaminated bedding, clothing or other fabrics,

It is believed that smallpox first emerged over 3000 years ago, probably in [[India]] or [[Egypt]].  There have been numerous recorded devastating [[epidemic]]s throughout the world, with high losses of life.

Smallpox was a common disease in Eurasia in the 15th century, and was spread by [[Exploration|explorers]] and invaders.  After Columbus landed on the island of [[Hispaniola]] during his second voyage in 1493, local people started to die of a [[virulent]] [[infection]].  Before the smallpox epidemic started, more than one million indigenous people had lived on the [[island]]; afterward, only ten thousand had survived.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

During the 16th century, Spanish soldiers introduced smallpox by contact with natives of the [[Aztec]] capital [[Tenochtitlan]].  A devastating epidemic broke out among the indigenous people, killing thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariner.org/exploration/index.php?type=explorersection&amp;id=200 |title=The Mariners' Museum &amp;#124; EXPLORATION through the AGES |publisher=Mariner.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1617, smallpox reached [[Massachusetts]], probably brought by earlier explorers to [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]].”&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;  By 1638 the disease had broken out among people in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  In 1721 people fled the city after an outbreak, but the residents  spread the disease to others throughout the [[thirteen colonies]].  Smallpox broke out in six separate epidemics in the United States through 1968.

The [[smallpox vaccine]] was developed in 1798 by [[Edward Jenner]]. By 1979 the disease had been completely [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicated]], with no new outbreaks.  The [[WHO]] stopped providing vaccinations and by 1986, vaccination was no longer necessary to anyone in the world except in the event of future outbreak.

=== Leprosy ===
[[Leprosy]], also known as Hansen’s Disease, is caused by a [[bacillus]], ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]''.  It is a [[chronic disease]] with an incubation period of up to five years.  Symptoms often include irritation or erosion of the skin, and effects on the [[peripheral nerves]], mucosa of the [[upper respiratory tract]] and eyes.  The most common sign of leprosy are pale reddish spots on the skin that lack sensation.

Leprosy probably originated in [[India]], more than four thousand years ago.  It was prevalent in ancient societies in [[China]], Egypt and India, and was transmitted throughout the world by various traveling groups, including [[Roman Legion]]naires, [[Crusaders]], Spanish [[conquistador]]s, Asian [[seafarer]]s, European colonists, and Arab, African, and American slave traders.  Some historians believe that [[Alexander the Great]]'s troops brought leprosy from India to Europe during the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Leprosy - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761578788/Leprosy.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwq4ZAH0?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761578788/Leprosy.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of the crusaders and other travelers, leprosy reached [[epidemic]] proportions by the 13th century.

Once detected, leprosy can be cured using multi-drug therapy, composed of two or three antibiotics, depending on the type of leprosy. In 1991 the World Health Assembly began an attempt to eliminate leprosy.  By 2005 116 of 122 countries were reported to be free of leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs_20070129/en/ | title=Western Pacific Regional Leprosy Situation in 2005  Fact sheet 28, January 2007 | publisher=WPRO | year=2007 | accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaria===
On Nov. 6, 1880 [[Alphonse Laveran]] discovered that [[malaria]] (then called "Marsh Fever") was a [[protozoa]]n parasite, and that mosquitoes carry and transmit malaria.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Infectious Diseases, Division of Parasitic Diseases. "Lavaran and the Discovery of the Malaria Parasite" [article online] 2004. Available from https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/laveran.htm. Accessed on Nov. 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Malaria is a [[protozoan]] [[infectious disease]] that is generally transmitted to [[humans]] by mosquitoes between dusk and dawn. The European variety, known as "vivax" after the ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' parasite, causes a relatively mild, yet chronically aggravating disease.  The west African variety is caused by the [[sporozoan]] parasite, ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'', and results in a severely debilitating and deadly disease.

Malaria was common in parts of the world where it has now disappeared, as the vast majority of Europe (disease of African descent are particularly diffused in the Empire romain) and North America . In some parts of England, [[mortality rate|mortality]] due to malaria was comparable to that of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] today. Although [[William Shakespeare]] was born at the beginning of a colder period called the "[[Little Ice Age]]", he knew enough ravages of this disease to include in eight parts. Plasmodium vivax lasted until 1958 in the [[polder]]s of Belgium and the Netherlands.
In the 1500s, it was the European settlers and their slaves who probably brought malaria on the American continent (we know that Columbus was suffering from this disease before his arrival in the new land). The Spanish [[Jesuit missionaries]] saw the Indians bordering on Lake Loxa Peru used the [[Cinchona bark]] powder to treat fevers. However, there is no reference to malaria in the medical literature of the Maya or [[Aztecs]]. The use of the bark of the "fever tree" was introduced into European medicine by Jesuit missionaries whose Barbabe Cobo who experimented in 1632 and also exports, so that the precious powder s' also called "Jesuit powder" . A study in 2012 of thousands of genetic markers for Plasmodium falciparum samples confirmed the African origin of the parasite in South America (Europeans themselves have been affected by this disease through Africa): it borrowed from the mid-sixteenth century and the mid-nineteenth the two main roads of the slave trade, the first leading to the north of South America (Colombia) by the Spanish, the second most leading south (Brazil) by Portugueses.

Parts of the [[Third World]] are more affected by malaria than the rest of the world. For instance, many inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa are affected by recurring attacks of malaria throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Robert D. |chapter=The Coming Anarchy |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLwlnhq01RIC&amp;pg=PA40 |editor=O’Meara, P. |editor2=Mehlinger, H.D. |editor3=Krain, M. |title=Globalization and the Challenges of a New Century: A Reader |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-21355-6 |pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many areas of Africa, there is limited [[running water]].  The residents' use of wells and [[cistern]]s provides many sites for the breeding of mosquitoes and spread of the disease.  Mosquitoes use areas of [[standing water]] like [[marshes]], [[wetlands]], and water drums to breed.

===Tuberculosis===
The [[bacterium]] that causes [[tuberculosis]], ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'',  is generally spread when an infected person [[cough]]s and another person inhales the bacteria. Once inhaled TB frequently grows in the [[lungs]], but can spread to any part of the body.  Although TB is highly contagious, in most cases the human body is able to fend off the bacteria.  But, TB can remain [[dormancy|dormant]] in the body for years, and become active unexpectedly. If and when the disease does become active in the body, it can multiply rapidly, causing the person to develop many symptoms including cough (sometimes with blood), night sweats, fever, chest pains, loss of appetite and loss of weight. This disease can occur in both adults and children and is especially common among those with weak or undeveloped [[immune system]]s.

Tuberculosis (TB) has been one of history’s greatest killers, taking the lives of over 3 million people annually.  It has been called the "white plague". According to the WHO, approximately fifty percent of people infected with TB today live in [[Asia]].  It is the most prevalent, life-threatening infection among [[AIDS]] patients.  It has increased in areas where HIV [[seroprevalence]] is high.&lt;ref name=TBF&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/20120306_tuberculosis/en/index.html | title=Tuberculosis facts. | publisher=WPRO | date=March 2012 | accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air travel]] and the other methods of travel which have made global interaction easier, have increased the spread of TB across different societies. Luckily, the [[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin|BCG vaccine]] was developed, which prevents TB meningitis and [[miliary TB]] in childhood.  But, the vaccine does not provide substantial protection against the more virulent forms of TB found among adults. Most forms of TB can be treated with antibiotics to kill the bacteria. The two antibiotics most commonly used are [[rifampicin]] and [[isoniazid]].  There are dangers, however, of a rise of antibiotic-resistant TB.  The TB treatment regimen is lengthy, and difficult for poor and disorganized people to complete, increasing resistance of bacteria.&lt;ref name=TBF /&gt; Antibiotic-resistant TB is also known as "[[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]]." "Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis" is a pandemic that is on the rise. Patients with MDR-TB are mostly young adults who are not infected with HIV or have other existing illness. Due to the lack of health care infrastructure in underdeveloped countries, there is a debate as to whether treating MDR-TB will be cost effective or not. The reason is the high cost of "second-line" antituberculosis medications. It has been argued that the reason the cost of treating patients with MDR-TB is high is because there has been a shift in focus in the medical field, in particular the rise of AIDS, which is now the world's leading infectious cause of death. Nonetheless, it is still important to put in the effort to help and treat patients with "multidrug-resistant tuberculosis" in poor countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Major Infectious Diseases in the World — To Treat or Not to Treat? | author=Farmer, P. | journal=The New England Journal of Medicine | year=2001 | month=| volume=345 | issue=3|pages=208–210 | doi=10.1056/nejm200107193450310 | pmid=11463018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
[[HIV and AIDS]] are among the newest and deadliest diseases. According to the [[World Health Organization]], it is unknown where the [[HIV]] [[virus]] originated, but it appeared to move from animals to humans.  It may have been isolated within many groups throughout the world.  It is believed that HIV arose from another, less harmful virus, that mutated and became more virulent.  The first two AIDS/HIV cases were detected in 1981.  As of 2013, an estimated 1.3 million persons in the [[United States]] were living with HIV or AIDS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/International-statistics.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210000903/http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/International-statistics.aspx |archivedate=2015-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; almost 110,000 in the UK &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/Latest-UK-statistics/People-with-HIV-in-UK.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212121444/http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/Latest-UK-statistics/People-with-HIV-in-UK.aspx |archivedate=2015-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated 35 million people worldwide are living with HIV”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/hiv/data/epi_core_dec2014.png?ua=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite efforts in numerous countries, awareness and prevention programs have not been effective enough to reduce the numbers of new HIV cases in many parts of the world, where it is associated with high mobility of men, poverty and sexual mores among certain populations.  Uganda has had an effective program, however. Even in countries where the epidemic has a very high impact, such as Swaziland and South Africa, a large proportion of the population do not believe they are at risk of becoming infected. Even in countries such as the UK, there is no significant decline in certain at-risk communities. 2014 saw the greatest number of new diagnoses in gay men, the equivalent of nine being diagnosed a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nat.org.uk/Media-and-Blog/Press-Releases/2014/November/PHE_Stat_Gay_Men_Stats.aspx#sthash.pgSuiy7L.dpuf | title=Press Releases &amp;#124; National AIDS Trust - NAT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, HIV prevention methods focused primarily on preventing the sexual transmission of HIV through behaviour change. The ABC Approach - "Abstinence, Be faithful, Use a Condom". However, by the mid-2000s, it became evident that effective HIV prevention requires more than that and that interventions need to take into account underlying socio-cultural, economic, political, legal and other contextual factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avert.org/hiv-prevention-programmes.htm#sthash.8IYVPGF1.dpuf | title=HIV prevention programmes overview| date=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ebola===
{{main|2014 West Africa Ebola virus outbreak}}
The [[Ebola]] outbreak, which was the 26th outbreak since 1976, started in [[Guinea]] in March 2014. The [[WHO]] warned that the number of [[Ebola]] patients could rise to 20,000, and said that it used $489m (£294m) to contain Ebola within six to nine months.&lt;ref name=guardian2014aug28EO&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/28/ebola-cases-rise-20000-world-health-organisation-west-africa-death-toll Ebola cases in west Africa could rise to 20,000 says WHO] Lisa O'Carroll, Society, theguardian, 28 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak was accelerating. [[Medecins sans Frontieres]] has just opened a new Ebola hospital in [[Monrovia]], and after one week it is already a capacity of 120 patients. It said that the number of patients seeking treatment at its new Monrovia centre was increasing faster than they could handle both in terms of the number of beds and the capacity of the staff, adding that it was struggling to cope with the caseload in the Liberian capital. Lindis Hurum, MSF's emergency coordinator in Monrovia, said that it was humanitarian emergency and they needed a full-scale humanitarian response.&lt;ref name=guardian2014aug28EO /&gt; [[Brice de la Vinge]], MSF director of operations, said that it was not until five months after the declaration of the Ebola outbreak that serious discussions started about international leadership and coordination, and said that it was not acceptable.

===Leptospirosis===
[[Leptospirosis]], also known as '''field fever''' is an infection caused by ''Leptospira''. Symptoms can range from none to mild such as headaches, muscle pains, and fevers; to severe with bleeding from the lungs or meningitis. ''Leptospira'' is transmitted by both wild and domestic animals, most commonly by rodents. It is often transmitted by animal urine or by water or soil containing animal urine coming into contact with breaks in the skin, eyes, mouth, or nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Slack A | year = 2010 | title = Leptospirosis | url = | journal = Australian Family Physician | volume = 39 | issue = 7| pages = 495–8 | pmid = 20628664 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The countries with the highest reported incidence are located in the Asia-Pacific region (Seychelles, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand) with incidence rates over 10 per 1000,000 people s well as in Latin America and the Caribbean (Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, El Salvador, Uruguay, Cuba, Nicaragua and Costa Rica)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pappas G, Papadimitriou P, Siozopoulou V, Christou L, Akritidis N | year = 2008 | title = The globalization of leptospirosis: worldwide incidence trends | url = | journal = Int J Infect Dis | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 351–357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rise in global travel and eco-tourism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Leptospirosis, Challenge Eco | year = 2000 | title = participants | url = | journal = Commun Dis Rep CDR Wkly | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 341 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to dramatic changes in the epidemiology of leptospirosis, and travelers from around the world have become exposed to the threat of leptospirosis. Despite decreasing prevalence of leptospirosis in endemic regions, previously non-endemic countries are now reporting increasing numbers of cases due to recreational exposure &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wasinski B, Dutkiewicz J | year = 2013 | title = Leptospirosis–current risk factors connected with human activity and the environment | url = | journal = Ann Agric Environ Med | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 239–244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International travelers engaged in adventure sports are directly exposed to numerous infectious agents in the environment and now comprise a growing proportion of cases worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bandara Medhani, Ananda Mahesha, Wickramage Kolitha, Berger Elisabeth, Agampodi Suneth | year = 2014 | title = Globalization of leptospirosis through travel and migration | url = | journal = Globalization and Health | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-communicable disease==

[[Globalization]] can benefit people with [[non-communicable diseases]] such as heart problems or mental health problems. Global trade and rules set forth by the [[World Trade Organization]] can actually benefit the health of people by making their incomes higher, allowing them to afford better health care. While it has to be admitted making many non-communicable diseases more likely as well. Also the national income of a country, mostly obtained by trading on the global market, is important because it dictates how much a government spends on health care for its citizens. It also has to be acknowledged that an expansion in the definition of disease often accompanies development, so the net effect is not clearly beneficial due to this and other effects of increased affluence. Metabolic syndrome is one obvious example. Although poorer countries have not yet experienced this and are still suffering from diseases listed above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beaglehole R, Yach D |title=Globalisation and the prevention and control of non-communicable disease: the neglected chronic diseases of adults |journal=Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9387 |pages=903–8 |date=September 2003 |pmid=13678979 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14335-8 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(03)14335-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Latin America]], the [[Central America]]n countries of [[Guatemala]], and [[Honduras]], and the [[Caribbean]] countries of [[Haiti]], and the [[Dominican Republic]] have national [[HIV]] prevalence of over 1%. In these countries, HIV-infected men outnumber HIV-infected women by roughly 3:1. Low prevalence in other countries disguises serious, localized epidemics. In [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]] and [[Argentina]], [[intravenous drug use]] and [[Homosexuality|homosexual activity]] are the main modes of transmission, and there is concern that [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual activity]] may soon become a primary method of spreading the virus.

{{technical|date=March 2013}}
Note: Parts of this article are written from the perspective of aircraft safety analysis techniques and definitions; these may not represent current best practice and the article needs to be updated to represent a more generic description of hazard analysis and discussion of more modern standards and techniques.

A '''hazard analysis''' is used as the first step in a process used to assess [[risk]]. The result of a hazard analysis is the identification of different type of hazards. A [[hazard]] is a potential condition and exists or not (probability is 1 or 0). It may in single existence or in combination with other hazards (sometimes called events) and conditions become an actual Functional Failure or Accident (Mishap). The way this exactly happens in one particular sequence is called a scenario. This scenario has a probability (between 1 and 0) of occurrence. Often a system has many potential failure scenarios. It also is assigned a classification, based on the worst case severity of the end condition. Risk is the combination of probability and severity. Preliminary risk levels can be provided in the hazard analysis. The validation, more precise prediction (verification) and acceptance of risk is determined in the [[Risk assessment]] (analysis). The main goal of both is to provide the best selection of means of controlling or eliminating the risk. The term is used in several engineering specialties, including [[avionics]], [[process engineering|chemical process safety]], [[safety engineering]], [[reliability engineering]] and [[food safety]].[http://www.unisdr.org/eng/library/lib-terminology-eng%20home.htm]

==Hazards and risk==
A hazard is defined as a "Condition, event, or circumstance that could lead to or contribute to an unplanned or undesirable event."  Seldom does a single hazard cause an accident or a functional failure. More often an accident or operational failure occurs as the result of a sequence of causes. A hazard analysis will consider system state, for example operating environment, as well as failures or malfunctions.

While in some cases, safety or reliability risk can be eliminated, in most cases a certain degree of risk must be accepted. In order to quantify expected costs before the fact, the potential consequences and the probability of occurrence must be considered. Assessment of risk is made by combining the severity of consequence with the likelihood of occurrence in a matrix. Risks that fall into the "unacceptable" category (e.g., high severity and high probability) must be mitigated by some means to reduce the level of safety risk.

IEEE STD-1228-1994 Software Safety Plans prescribes industry best practices for conducting software safety hazard analyses to help ensure safety requirements and attributes are defined and specified for inclusion in software that commands, controls or monitors critical functions. When software is involved in a system, the development and design assurance of that software is often governed by [[DO-178B]]. The severity of consequence identified by the hazard analysis establishes the criticality level of the software. Software criticality levels range from A to E, corresponding to the severity of Catastrophic to No Safety Effect. Higher levels of rigor are required for level A and B software and corresponding functional tasks and work products is the system safety domain are used as objective evidence of meeting safety criteria and requirements.

Recently a leading edge commercial standard was promulgated based on decades of proven system safety processes in DoD and NASA. ANSI/GEIA-STD-0010-2009 (Standard Best Practices for System Safety Program Development and Execution) is a demilitarized commercial best practice that uses proven holistic, comprehensive and tailored approaches for hazard prevention, elimination and control. It is centered around the hazard analysis and functional based safety process.

'''Health geography''' is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]].

== Overview ==

The study of health geography has been influenced by repositioning medical geography within the field of [[social geography]] due to a shift towards a social model in health care, rather than a medical model&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. This advocates for the redefinition of health and health care away from prevention and treatment of illness only to one of promoting well-being in general.  Under this model, some previous illnesses (e.g., mental ill health) are recognized as behavior disturbances only, and other types of medicine (e.g., complementary or [[alternative medicine]] and [[traditional medicine]]) are studied by the [[medicine]] researchers, sometimes with the aid of health geographers without [[medical education]]. This shift changes the definition of care, no longer limiting it to spaces such as hospitals or doctor's offices. Also, the social model gives priority to the intimate encounters performed at non-traditional spaces of medicine and healthcare as well as to the individuals as [[health consumerism|health consumers]].&lt;ref name= "Philo2"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Health and Health Care". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.325-326&lt;/ref&gt;

This alternative methodological approach means that medical geography is broadened to incorporate philosophies such as [[Political Economy#Current approaches|Marxian political economy]], [[structuralism]], [[interactionism|social interactionism]], [[humanism]], [[feminism]] and [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name= "Philo"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Medical Geography". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.451-453&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The relationship between space and health dates back to [[Hippocrates]], who stated that "airs, waters, places" all played significant roles impacting human health and history.&lt;ref name= "Philo" /&gt; A classic piece of research in health geography was done in 1854 as [[Broad Street cholera outbreak|a cholera outbreak]] gripped a neighborhood in [[London]]. Death tolls rang around the clock and the people feared that they were being infected by vapors coming from the ground. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] predicted that if he could locate the source of the disease, it could be contained. He drew maps demonstrating the homes of people who had died of cholera and the locations of water pumps. He found that one pump, the public pump on Broad Street, was central to most of the victims. He concluded that infected water from the pump was the culprit.  He instructed the authorities to remove the handle to the pump, making it unusable. As a result, the number of new cholera cases decreased.

==Areas of study==
Health geography is considered to be divided into two distinct elements. The first of which is focused on geographies of disease and ill health, involving [[descriptive research]] quantifying disease frequencies and distributions, and [[Analytic and enumerative statistical studies|analytic research]] concerned with finding what characteristics make an individual or [[population]] susceptible to disease. This requires an understanding of [[epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ocaña-Riola |first=Ricardo |year=2010 |title=Common errors in disease mapping |journal=Geospatial Health |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=139–54 |pmid=20503184 |url=http://www.geospatialhealth.unina.it/fulltext.php?f=pdf&amp;ida=90 |doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second component of health geography is the geography of health care, primarily facility location, accessibility, and utilization.  This requires the use of [[spatial analysis]] and often borrows from [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/1353-8292(95)00002-4 | title=Coming out: exposing social theory in medical geography | journal=Health | date=1995 | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=5–14 | first=Andréa | last=Litva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geographies of disease and ill health ===
Hsenting health risks, from [[natural disaster]]s, to interpersonal [[violence]], [[stress (biology)|stress]], and other potential dangers.&lt;ref name="Philo2" /&gt;

=== Geography of health care provision ===
[[File:Coverage by Type of Health Insurance- 2008 and 2009p25.pdf|thumb]]
Although healthcare is a public good, it is not equally available to all [[individuals]]. Demand for public services is continuously increasing. People need advance knowledge and the latest prediction technology, that health geography offers. The latest example of such technology is Telemedicine. Many people in the United States are not able to access proper healthcare because of inequality in health insurance and the means to afford medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/money-quality-health-care-longer-life/|title=The costs of inequality: Money = quality health care = longer life|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2017-02-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobility and Disease Tracking

With the advent of mobile technology and its spread, it is now possible to track [[individual mobility]]. By correlating the movement of individuals through tracking the devices using access towers or other tracking systems, it is now possible to determine and even control disease spread. While [[privacy law]]s question the legality of tracking individuals, the commercial mobile service providers are using covert techniques or obtaining government waivers to allow permission to track people .

[[File:Free consultation with a Doctor of mobile health team has Madagacar.jpg|thumb|Free consultation with a doctor of mobile health team.]]
Medical centers, dispensaries and hospitals are found throughout the island of [[Madagascar]], although they are concentrated in urban areas and particularly in [[Antananarivo]]. Access to medical care remains beyond the reach of many [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]]. 

In addition to the high expense of medical care relative to the average Malagasy income, the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low. In 2010 Madagascar had an average of three hospital beds per 10,000 people and a total of 3,150 doctors, 5,661 nurses, 385 community health workers, 175 pharmacists and 57 dentists for a population of 22 million. The only hospital with a cancer ward is [[Joseph Ravoahangy Andrianavalona Hospital]]. 14.6 percent of government spending in 2008 was directed toward the health sector. Approximately 70% of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30% originated with international donors and other private sources. The government provides at least one basic health center per commune. Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.

Despite these barriers to access, health services have shown a trend toward improvement over the past twenty years. Child [[immunization]]s against such diseases as [[hepatitis B]], [[diphtheria]] and [[measles]] increased an average of 60% in this period, indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6 children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8% in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth. In 2010 the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup. The infant mortality rate in 2011 was 41 per 1,000 births, with an under-five mortality rate at 61 per 1,000 births. [[Schistosomiasis]], [[malaria]] and sexually transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar, although infection rates of AIDS remain low relative to many countries in mainland Africa, at only 0.2% of the adult population. The malaria mortality rate is also among the lowest in Africa at 8.5 deaths per 100,000 people, in part due to the highest frequency use of [[insecticide]] treated nets in Africa. Adult life expectancy in 2009 was 63 years for men and 67 years for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary health care: back to basics in Madagascar|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/6/08-010608/en/|website=World Health Organisation|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Healthy Development Measurement Tool (HDMT)''', developed by the [[San Francisco Department of Public Health]], provides an approach for evaluating [[land-use planning]] and urban development with regards to the achievement of human health needs.  The HDMT provides a set of baseline data on [[community health]] metrics for [[San Francisco]] and development targets to assess the extent to which urban development projects and plans can improve community health. The HDMT also provides a range of policy and design strategies that can advance health conditions and resources via the development process.

== Background ==
In the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], between the mid- and late- 1990’s, the bustling information economy brought multitudes of young people to the Bay Area and [[Silicon Valley]]’s technology-inspired new economy.&lt;ref name="ENCHIA"&gt;San Francisco Department of Public Health. [http://dphwww.sfdph.org/phes/ENCHIA.htm "Eastern Neighborhoods Community Health Impact Assessment (ENCHIA)."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111204228/http://dphwww.sfdph.org/phes/ENCHIA.htm |date=2007-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Housing was notoriously difficult to find, with vacancy rates at less than 2%.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census Bureau. Washington, D.C. [https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/hvs/annual05/ann05t6a.html "Housing Vacancies and Homeownership - Annual 2005: table 6a."] Accessed 2010-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, average rents increased by 30% and the cost to buy increased dramatically.  Although the economic recession triggered by the [[dot-com bubble]] brought the city’s vacancy rates to pre-boom levels, the Bay Area continued to encounter pressure for new housing development due to extraordinary levels of unmet demand and its high profitability.  This phenomenon occurred elsewhere in California and throughout the country, in both urban and suburban settings.

== Land Use and Health ==
Historically, health inequities were associated with differences in health behaviors and health care access and utilization. Today, however, many believe that these inequities result from differences in access to the social, economic, and environmental resources necessary for health. Increasingly, inter-disciplinary research demonstrates that the root causes of disease and illness, as well as strategies to improve health and well-being are dependent on community design, land use, and transportation.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Green Building Council. Washington, D.C. [http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=148#randt "LEED for Neighborhood Development."] Accessed 2010-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Association of County and City Health Officials. Washington, D.C.[http://www.naccho.org/topics/environmental/landuseplanning/toolbox.cfm "Land Use Planning 101 Resources."] Accessed 2010-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in societal conditions can affect many individuals simultaneously, and have broad and diverse impacts on multiple health outcomes.

The value of this tool is that it focuses on broadening the range of social, economic, and environmental resources needed for health on a population level. It does so by recognizing a range of resources needed for optimal health at the societal level and identifying measurable and actionable ways to meet those needs through urban development. It combines quantitative analysis of health indicators with a qualitative assessment of whether plans and projects meet tool development targets.

SFDPH has recognized that it has a legitimate agency interest in integrating health considerations into land use decision-making.  While SFDPH does not have formal decision-making authority regarding land use and development decisions, a number of drivers brought SFDPH to understand that it has a potentially important role. Drivers include:
* Community organizations’ struggles to limit the negative impacts of development in their communities
* Local experience among SFDPH staff that environmental health outcomes were associated with land use and transportation decisions
* National public health research that “the built environment” was associated with chronic health outcomes
* An international movement to develop tools and methods for HIA’s of public policy
The first driver for SFDPH to be involved in land use was that community groups were struggling with the pace of development in their neighborhoods.  In addition, they were dissatisfied with the responsiveness of the Planning Department to address neighborhood needs and concerns, including displacement of existing residents and jobs, and an overall lack of infrastructure to support a complete neighborhood.  Many groups called for community planning processes and specifically community, social, and economic impact assessments of land use changes to be conducted as part of or complementary to the environmental impact report required by CEQA.&lt;ref&gt;California Natural Resources Agency. Sacramento, CA. [http://ceres.ca.gov/topic/env_law/ceqa/summary.html "California Environmental Quality Act: Summary."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129130447/http://ceres.ca.gov/topic/env_law/ceqa/summary.html |date=2009-01-29 }} 2005-05-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second driver was that SFDPH increasingly recognized that environmental health and justice issues in San Francisco had roots in land use and transportation planning decisions.  For example, SFDPH environmental health inspectors frequently observed that families lived in housing conditions that caused a variety of health outcomes such as asthma and lead poisoning.
However, because of the high costs associated with improving these conditions, landlords often would not take action. In addition, the high cost of housing made it difficult or families to leave their homes and find new places to live.

Cumulatively, SFDPH also observed the disproportionate share of unwanted land uses (such as power plants, sewage treatment facilities, substandard public housing, and poor public infrastructure) in places like Bayview/[[Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco|Hunters Point]] as contributing to significant disparities in life expectancy for residents. Finally, SFDPH also witnessed residential development in historically industrial areas generating [[noise pollution|noise]], [[air pollution|traffic emissions]], and pedestrian hazards for residents and workers in these areas.

Third, on a national scale, the public health and urban planning communities were increasingly calling attention to the connections between the built environment (that is, land use, transportation systems, and community design) and health, particularly focusing on the contribution of the land use patterns (for example, sprawl) to physical inactivity, pedestrian safety, and air quality. Findings illustrated that urban design and land use regulations could accomplish the complementary goals of preventing illness and ensuring environmental quality. For example, creating higher density, mixed-use developments closer to transit and job centers would enhance public safety, prevent motor-vehicle injuries, increase access to goods and services, encourage walking or bicycling, reduce air pollution, and limit global warming.

Finally, on an international scale, public health practitioners were also developing methods and tools for [[Health Impact Assessment]]. The goal of HIA was to bring to light information on how diverse public policy decisions might affect health as well as the social and environmental resources required for good health. While HIA was novel in the United States, it presented a potential way to gain consideration more pro-actively of both root causes of poor health and community needs in the land use development process.

By 2001, SFDPH had already begun using HIA methods to increase the inclusion of health considerations in policy-making. In a study examining the health impacts of increasing the city’s [[living wage]], SFDPH found that adoption of an increased living wage would result in decreases in the risk of premature death by 5% for adults 24–44 years of age in households whose current income was around $20,000. For the offspring of these workers, a living wage would result in an increase of a quarter of a year of completed education, a 34% increase in the odds of high school completion, and a 22% decrease in the risk of early childbirth.

SFDPH also conducted exploratory workshops with community members on the health impacts of housing subsidies, farmers’ markets, and green schoolyards. In 2002, SFDPH began using HIA more specifically in local land use planning, policy making, and project review. For example, SFDPH conducted HIAs of:
* Carpet policy in public housing;
* Housing displacement at Trinity Plaza; and
* Spear / Folsom condominium towers at Rincon Hill.

== ENCHIA Process ==
In response to development pressures, many communities called on public health officials to evaluate the ensuing health impacts and to advocate for healthy environments.&lt;ref name="ENCHIA" /&gt; For this reason, the San Francisco Department of Public Health initiated the Eastern Neighborhoods Community Health Impact Assessment (ENCHIA) to analyze how development affects [[social determinants of health]] within several San Francisco neighborhoods.

The HDMT was created through collaboration among development stakeholders and public agencies in [[San Francisco]] as a result of the ENCHIA. The process was guided by the principles of "health impact assessment" and designed to act on growing scientific understanding that optimal health cannot be achieved by improving health services or individual behavior change alone, but requires advancing healthful neighborhood conditions.  Such conditions include:
* Adequate housing
* Access to public transit
* Schools, parks and public spaces
* Safe routes for pedestrians and bicyclists
* Meaningful and productive employment
* Unpolluted air, soil, and water
* Cooperation, trust, and civic participation

Facilitated and staffed by SFDPH, the eighteen-month ENCHIA process was guided by a multi-stakeholder Community Council of over twenty diverse organizations including: 
* Community planning and design
* Economic and neighborhood development
* Environmental justice
* Homeless
* Open space
* Housing 
* Transportation
* Bicycle
* Food systems
* Child care and childhood development advocates
* Low-wage and union workers
* Non-profit and private developers
* Property-owners
* Architects
* Small businesses

== Components ==
;Voluntary, not regulatory approach 
This tool is not a new form of environmental regulation or a set of enforceable standards. The tool does not mandate the achievement of specific development targets. Similar to tools such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED), this tool is intended to encourage voluntary efforts to improve health-oriented development.

HDMT provides a systematic assessment approach to simultaneously consider effects of development on six overarching domains:
* Environmental stewardship
* Sustainable and safe transportation
* Social cohesion
* Adequate and healthy housing
* Public infrastructure/access to goods and services
* Healthy economy

These six elements are divided into 27 objectives, which themselves are further divided into 107 measurable indicators.  Most indicators are paired with specific, actionable development targets, usually as a benchmark and/or minimum. As of November 1, 2007, fourteen of these indicators are in process.

The San Francisco Planning Department has received and reviewed the HDMT and other ENCHIA products and has committed to using the indicators and development criteria, where possible, in screening the content of its Eastern Neighborhood plans.

This tool comprises a set of metrics to evaluate the extent to which urban development is meeting the needs of human health.  
Measurable indicators and development targets provide information about both the positive and negative ways in which health is impacted by a proposed development project and focuses attention on ways that development can improve population health. By providing measures and criteria for development, it allows those involved in policy- and decision-making to make more informed choices between trade-offs. As a result, the tool may provide an additional means to support greater transparency in development processes.

'''High-altitude adaptation in humans''' is an instance of [[evolutionary adaptation|evolutionary modification]] in certain human populations, including those of [[Tibetan people|Tibet]] in Asia, the [[Andes]] of the Americas, and [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] in Africa, who have acquired the ability to survive at extremely high [[altitudes]]. This adaptation means irreversible, [[adaptive evolution|long-term physiological responses]] to high-altitude environments, associated with heritable [[ethology|behavioural]] and [[mutation|genetic changes]].

While the rest of the human population would suffer serious health consequences, the indigenous inhabitants of these regions thrive well in the highest parts of the world. These people have undergone extensive physiological and genetic changes, particularly in the regulatory systems of oxygen [[respiratory system|respiration]] and blood [[circulatory system|circulation]], when compared to the general lowland population.&lt;ref name=fris&gt;{{cite book|author=Frisancho AR|title=Human Adaptation and Accommodation|year=1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-K_SYHBo42MC&amp;pg|pages=175–301 |isbn =0472095110|publisher=University of Michigan Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Hillary Mayell |title=Three High-Altitude Peoples, Three Adaptations to Thin Air|date=24 February 2004 | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.in/news/2004/02/0224_040225_evolution.html |work=National Geographic News |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists started to notice the extraordinary physical performance of Tibetans since the beginning of Himalayan climbing era in the early 20th century.

In 1990, it was estimated that 4,594,188 Tibetans live on the plateau, with 53% living at an altitude over {{convert|3500|m|ft}}.

The Tibetans, who have been living in this region for 3,000 years, do not exhibit the elevated haemoglobin concentrations to cope with oxygen deficiency as observed in other populations who have moved temporarily or permanently at high altitudes. Instead, the Tibetans inhale more air with each breath and breathe more rapidly than either sea-level populations or Andeans. Tibetans have better [[oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] at birth, enlarged lung volumes throughout life, and a higher capacity for [[physical exercise|exercise]]. They show a sustained increase in [[brain|cerebral]] blood flow, lower haemoglobin concentration, and less susceptibility to [[chronic mountain sickness]] than other populations, due to their longer history of high-altitude habitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moore LG, Niermeyer S, Zamudio S |year=1998

===Andeans===

In contrast to the Tibetans, the Andean highlanders, who have been living at high-altitudes for no more than 11,000 years, show different pattern of haemoglobin adaptation. Their haemoglobin concentration is higher compared to those of lowlander population, which also happens to lowlanders moving to high altitude. When they spend some weeks in the lowland their haemoglobin drops to average of other people. This shows only temporary and reversible acclimatisation. However, in contrast to lowland people, they do have increased oxygen level in their haemoglobin, that is, more oxygen per blood volume than other people. This confers an ability to carry more oxygen in each red blood cell, making a more effective transport of oxygen in their body, while their breathing is essentially at the same rate.&lt;ref name=beall07 /&gt; This enables them to overcome hypoxia and normally reproduce without risk of death for the mother or baby. The Andean highlanders are known from the 16th-century missionaries that their reproduction had always been normal, without any effect in the [[fecundity|giving birth]] or the risk for early pregnancy loss, which are common to hypoxic stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vitzthum |first1=Virginia J. |title=Fifty fertile years: anthropologists' studies of reproduction in high altitude natives |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |year=2013 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=179–189 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.22357 |pmid=23382088}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have developmentally acquired enlarged residual lung volume and its associated increase in [[alveolus|alveolar]] area, which are supplemented with increased tissue thickness and moderate increase in [[red blood cells]].

===Ethiopians===

The peoples of the [[Ethiopian highlands]] also live at extremely high altitudes, around {{convert|3000|m|ft}} to {{convert|3500|m|ft}}.

==Genetic basis==

The underlying [[molecular evolution]] of high-altitude adaptation has been explored and understood fairly recently.&lt;ref name=mue /&gt; Depending on the geographical and environmental pressures, high-altitude adaptation involves different genetic patterns, some of which
have evolved quite recently. For example, Tibetan adaptations became prevalent in the past 3,000 years, a rapid example of [[recent human evolution]]. At the turn of the 21st century, it was reported that the genetic make-up of the respiratory components of the Tibetan and the Ethiopian populations are significantly different.&lt;ref name=bea00 /&gt;

=== Tibetans ===

Substantial evidence in Tibetan highlanders suggests that variation in haemoglobin and [[oxygen saturation|blood-oxygen]] levels are adaptive as [[Fitness (biology)|Darwinian fitness]]. It has been documented that Tibetan women with a high likelihood of possessing one to two [[allele]]s for high blood-oxygen content (which is odd for normal women) had more surviving children; the higher the oxygen capacity, the lower the infant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beall CM, Song K, Elston RC, Goldstein MC |year=2004 |title=Higher offspring survival among Tibetan women with high oxygen saturation genotypes residing at {{convert|4000|m|ft}}| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/39/14300 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=101|issue=39 |pages=14300–14304 |pmid=15353580|pmc=521103 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0405949101|last2=Song |last3=Elston |last4=Goldstein |bibcode=2004PNAS..10114300B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, for the first time, the genes responsible for the unique adaptive traits were identified following genome sequences of 50 Tibetans and 40 [[Han Chinese]] from [[Beijing]]. Initially, the strongest signal of natural selection detected was a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia, called endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (''[[EPAS1]]''). It was found that one [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) at ''EPAS1'' shows a 78% frequency difference between Tibetan and mainland Chinese samples, representing the fastest genetic change observed in any human gene to date. Hence, Tibetan adaptation to high altitude becomes the fastest process of [[phenotype|phenotypically observable]] evolution in humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Native Village Youth |author2=Education news |title=Tibetans evolved at fastest pace ever measured |url=http://www.nativevillage.org/Archives/2011%20Archives/MAY%202011%20News/Tibetans%20Evolved%20at%20Fastest%20Pace%20Ever%20Measured.htm | date=May 2011|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is estimated to occur in less than 3,000 years ago, when the Tibetans split up from the mainland Chinese population.&lt;ref name=yi /&gt; [[Mutations]] in ''EPAS1'', at higher frequency in Tibetans than their Han neighbours, correlate with decreased haemoglobin concentrations among the Tibetans, which is the hallmark of their adaptation to hypoxia. Simultaneously, two genes, egl nine homolog 1 (''[[EGLN1]]'') (which inhibits haemoglobin production under high oxygen concentration) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (''[[PPARA]]''), were also identified to be positively selected in relation to decreased haemoglobin nature in the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simonson TS, Yang Y, Huff CD, Yun H, Qin G, Witherspoon DJ, Bai Z, Lorenzo FR, Xing J, Jorde LB, Prchal JT, Ge R |year=2010 |title=Genetic evidence for high-altitude adaptation in Tibet | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5987/72 |journal=Science |volume=329 |issue=5987|pages=72–75 |pmid=20466884 |doi=10.1126/science.1189406|last2=Yang |last3=Huff |last4=Yun |last5=Qin |last6=Witherspoon |last7=Bai |last8=Lorenzo |last9=Xing |last10=Jorde |last11=Prchal |last12=Ge |bibcode=2010Sci...329...72S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andeans===

The patterns of genetic adaptation among the Andeans are largely distinct from those of the Tibetan, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. However, ''EGLN1'' appears to be the principal signature of evolution, as it shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. Even then, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations.&lt;ref name=bigh /&gt; Among the Andeans, there are no significant associations between ''EPAS1'' or ''EGLN1'' SNP [[genotype]]s and haemoglobin concentration, which has been the characteristic of the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bigham AW, Wilson MJ, Julian CG, Kiyamu M, Vargas E, Leon-Velarde F, Rivera-Chira M, Rodriquez C, Browne VA, Parra E, Brutsaert TD, Moore LG, Shriver MD |year=2013 |title=Andean and Tibetan patterns of adaptation to high altitude | journal=Am J Hum Biol|volume=25|issue=2|pages=190–197|pmid=23348729 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.22358|last2=Wilson |last3=Julian |last4=Kiyamu |last5=Vargas |last6=Leon-Velarde |last7=Rivera-Chira |last8=Rodriquez |last9=Browne |last10=Parra |last11=Brutsaert |last12=Moore |last13=Shriver }}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole genome sequences of 20 Andeans (half of them having chronic mountain sickness) revealed that two genes, SENP1 (an erythropoiesis regulator) and ANP32D (an oncogene) play vital roles in their weak adaptation to hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhou D, Udpa N, Ronen R, Stobdan T, Liang J, Appenzeller O, Zhao HW, Yin Y, Du Y, Guo L, Cao R, Wang Y, Jin X, Huang C, Jia W, Cao D, Guo G, Gamboa JL, Villafuerte F, Callacondo D, Xue J, Liu S, Frazer KA, Li Y, Bafna V, Haddad GG |title=Whole-genome sequencing uncovers the genetic basis of chronic mountain sickness in Andean highlanders |journal=Am J Hum Genet |volume=93|issue=S0002–9297(13)00331–5 | pages=452–62|year=2013 |pmid=23954164 |pmc=3769925 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2013.07.011|last2=Udpa |last3=Ronen |last4=Stobdan |last5=Liang |last6=Appenzeller |last7=Zhao |last8=Yin |last9=Du |last10=Guo |last11=Cao |last12=Wang |last13=Jin |last14=Huang |last15=Jia |last16=Cao |last17=Guo |last18=Gamboa |last19=Villafuerte |last20=Callacondo |last21=Xue |last22=Liu |last23=Frazer |last24=Li |last25=Bafna |last26=Haddad }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopians===

The adaptive mechanism of Ethiopian highlanders is quite different. This is probably because their migration to the highland was relatively early; for example, the [[amhara people|Amhara]] have inhabited altitudes above {{convert|2500|m|ft}} for at least 5,000 years and altitudes around {{convert|2000|m|ft}} to {{convert|2400|m|ft}} for more than 70,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Human technical behavior in the African Middle Stone Age: The lithic assemblange of Porc-Epic Cave (Dire Dawa, Ethiopia)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10437-006-9000-7|journal=African Archaeological Review|volume=22|issue=4|pages=177–197|doi=10.1007/s10437-006-9000-7|pmid=|author=Pleurdeau D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genomic analysis of two ethnic groups, Amhara and [[oromo people|Oromo]], revealed that gene variations associated with haemoglobin difference among Tibetans or other variants at the same [[locus (genetics)|gene location]] do not influence the adaptation in Ethiopians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alkorta-Aranburu G, Beall CM, Witonsky DB, Gebremedhin A, Pritchard JK, Di Rienzo A|year=2012 |title=The genetic architecture of adaptations to high altitude in Ethiopia | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110 |journal=PLOS Genetics |volume=8|issue=12|pages=e1003110|pmid=23236293| pmc=3516565 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110|last2=Beall |last3=Witonsky |last4=Gebremedhin |last5=Pritchard |last6=Di Rienzo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification of specific genes further reveals that several candidate genes are involved in Ethiopians, including ''[[CBARA1]]'', ''[[VAV3]]'', ''[[ARNT2]]'' and ''[[THRB]]''. Two of these genes (''THRB'' and ''ARNT2'') are known to play a role in the [[Hypoxia-inducible factors|HIF-1 pathway]], a pathway implicated in previous work reported in Tibetan and Andean studies. This supports the concept that adaptation to high altitude arose independently among different highlanders as a result of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scheinfeldt LB, Soi S, Thompson S, Ranciaro A, Woldemeskel D, Beggs W, Lambert C, Jarvis JP, Abate D, Belay G, Tishkoff SA|year=2012 |title=Genetic adaptation to high altitude in the Ethiopian highlands | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110 |journal=Genome Biol |volume=13|issue=1|pages=R1 |pmid=22264333| pmc=3334582 |doi=10.1186/gb-2012-13-1-r1|last2=Soi |last3=Thompson |last4=Ranciaro |last5=Woldemeskel |last6=Beggs |last7=Lambert |last8=Jarvis |last9=Abate |last10=Belay |last11=Tishkoff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Isolation (disambiguation)}}

[[File:Tb ward.jpg|thumb|365px|This illustration of a TB ward from [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] demonstrates several aspects of hospital [[infection control]] and '''isolation''': engineer;][;ng controls (dedicated air ductwork), [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] ([[NIOSH air filtration rating|N95 respirators]]), warning signs and labels (controlled entry), dedicated disposal container, and enhanced housekeeping practices.]]

In [[health care facilities]], '''isolation''' represents one of several measures that can be taken to implement [[infection control]]: the prevention of [[contagious disease]]s from being spread from a [[patient]] to other patients, health care workers, and visitors, or from outsiders to a particular patient (reverse isolation). Various forms of isolation exist, in some of which contact procedures are modified, and others in which the patient is kept away from all others. In a system devised, and periodically revised, by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), various levels of patient isolation comprise application of one or more formally described "precaution".

Isolation is most commonly used when a patient is known to have a contagious ([[Transmission (medicine)|transmissible]] person-to-person) [[viral illness|viral]] or [[Bacteria|bacterial illness]].&lt;ref name="LawrenceMay2003a"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence J|author2=May D|title=Infection control in the community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKK2QI8AhTgC&amp;pg=PA136|year=2003|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-443-06406-7|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special equipment is used in the management of patients in the various forms of isolation. These most commonly include items of [[personal protective equipment]] ([[cleanroom suit|gowns]], [[surgical mask|masks]], and [[medical glove|gloves]]) and engineering controls (positive pressure rooms, negative pressure rooms, laminar air flow equipment, and various mechanical and structural barriers).&lt;ref name=Uys249&gt;{{cite book|author=Uys LR|title=Fundamental nursing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LILWN0VQuGQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA249|year=1999|publisher=Pearson South Africa|isbn=978-0-636-04208-7|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dedicated [[isolation ward]]s may be pre-built into hospitals, or isolation units may be temporarily designated in facilities in the midst of an epidemic emergency.

==Definitions==
'''''Isolation''''' is defined as the voluntary or compulsory separation and confinement of those known or suspected to be infected with a contagious disease agent (whether ill or not) to prevent further infections. (In this form of isolation, [[transmission-based precaution]]s are imposed.) In contrast, '''''quarantine''''' is the compulsory separation and confinement, with restriction of movement, of healthy individuals or groups who have potentially been exposed to an agent to prevent further infections should infection occur. '''''Biocontainment''''' refers to laboratory biosafety in microbiology laboratories in which the physical containment (BSL-3, BSL-4) of highly pathogenic organisms is accomplished through built-in engineering controls.

==Types of precautions==

===Universal/standard precautions===
{{main|Universal precautions}}
''Universal precautions''  refer to the practice, in [[medicine]], of avoiding contact with patients' bodily fluids, by means of the wearing of nonporous articles such as [[medical gloves]], [[goggles]], and [[face shield]]s. The practice was widely introduced in 1985–88.&lt;ref&gt;CDC. [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000039.htm Update: universal precautions for prevention of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and other bloodborne pathogens in health-care settings]. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 1988;37(24):377-82, 87–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CDC. [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00033093.htm Recommendations for preventing transmission of infection with human T- lymphotropic virus type III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus in the workplace]. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 1985;34(45):681-6, 91–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the practice of universal precautions was adjusted by a set of rules known as [[body substance isolation]]. In 1996, both practices were replaced by the latest approach known as [[standard precautions (health care)|standard precautions]]. Use of [[personal protective equipment]] is now recommended in all health settings.

===Transmission-based precautions===
{{main|Transmission-based precautions}}

''Transmission-based precautions'' are additional [[infection control]] precautions — over and above universal/standard precautions — and the latest routine infection prevention and control practices applied for patients who are known or suspected to be infected or colonized with infectious agents, including certain [[Epidemiology|epidemiologically]] important [[pathogen]]s. The latter require additional control measures to effectively prevent transmission.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;Siegel JD, Rhinehart E, Jackson M, Chiarello L, and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Infection prevention and control of epidemic- and pandemic-prone acute respiratory diseases in health care, WHO Interim Guidelines.2007 p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of transmission-based precaution:

*'''''Contact precautions''''' are intended to prevent transmission of infectious agents, including epidemiologically important [[microorganism]]s, which are spread by direct or indirect contact with the patient or the patient’s environment.
*'''''Droplet precautions''''' are intended to prevent transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions.
*'''''Airborne precautions''''' prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in the air (e.g., rubeola virus [measles], varicella virus [chickenpox], M. tuberculosis, and possibly SARS-CoV).

==Forms of isolation==

===Strict isolation=== 
'''Strict isolation''' is used for diseases spread through the air and in some cases by contact.&lt;ref name=Uys249/&gt; Patients must be placed in isolation to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.&lt;ref name="WHITE2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=White L|title=Foundations of nursing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSFunA58p8gC&amp;pg=PA757|date=2004|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4018-2692-5|page=757}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are kept in strict isolation are often kept in a special room at the facility designed for that purpose. Such rooms are equipped with a special [[toilet|lavatory]] and caregiving equipment, and a sink and waste disposal are provided for workers upon leaving the area.&lt;ref name="LawrenceMay2003b"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence J|author2=Dee May|title=Infection control in the community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKK2QI8AhTgC&amp;pg=PA136|year=2003|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-443-06406-7|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact isolation===
'''Contact isolation''' is used to prevent the spread of diseases that can be spread through contact with open wounds. Health care workers making contact with a patient on contact isolation are required to wear [[Medical gloves|gloves]], and in some cases, a [[Hospital gown|gown]].

===Respiratory isolation===
'''Respiratory isolation''' is used for diseases that are spread through particles that are [[exhalation|exhaled]].&lt;ref name=Uys249/&gt; Those having contact with or exposure to such a patient are required to wear a mask.

===Reverse isolation===
'''Reverse isolation''' is a way to prevent a patient in a compromised health situation from being contaminated by other people or objects. It often involves the use of laminar air flow and mechanical barriers (to avoid physical contact with others) to isolate the patient from any harmful pathogens present in the external environment.&lt;ref name="titleChildren reared in a reverse isolation environment: effects on cognitive and emotional development"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tamaroff MH, Nir Y, Straker N | year = 1986 | title = Children reared in a reverse isolation environment: effects on cognitive and emotional development | url = | journal = J. Autism Dev. Disord. | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 415–424 | doi=10.1007/bf01531708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High isolation===
[[File:Aeromedical Biological Containment System (ABCS).jpg|thumb|265px|The [[Aeromedical Biological Containment System]] (ABCS) is an air-transportable ''high isolation'' module for movement of highly contagious patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blake|first1=Matthew|title=The private jet NOBODY wants to fly on: Inside the air ambulance used to transport Ebola victims around America|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2796852/the-private-jet-wants-fly-inside-aircraft-used-transport-ebola-victims-america.html|accessdate=26 October 2014|work=Daily Mail (UK)|date=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''High isolation''' is used to prevent the spread of unusually highly contagious, or high consequence, infectious diseases (e.g., smallpox, Ebola virus). It stipulates mandatory use of: (1) gloves (or double gloves if appropriate), (2) protective eyewear (goggles or face shield), (3) a waterproof gown (or total body Tyvek suit, if appropriate), and (4) a [[respirator]] (at least FFP2 or N95 NIOSH equivalent), ''not'' simply a surgical mask.&lt;ref&gt;Puro, Vincenzo (2008), [http://www.newmicrobiologica.org/PUB/allegati_pdf/2008/2/165.pdf “Risk management of febrile respiratory illness in Emergency Departments”]; ''[[New Microbiologica]]'', 31, 165-173.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes [[negative pressure room]]s or [[Respirator#Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)|powered air-purifying respirator]]s (PAPRs) are also used.

==Effects of isolation==
Isolation can have the following negative effects on patients and staff:
*Patient may not be able to receive visitors, and in turn, become lonely
*Patient may be anxious
*Small children may feel their isolation is a punishment&lt;ref name="AtkinsonMurray1985"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Atkinson LD|author2=Murray ME|title=Fundamentals of nursing: a nursing process approach|year=1985|publisher=Macmillan Pub. Co.|page=374|isbn=978-0-02-304590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Staff may need to spend more time with patients
*Patients may not be able to receive certain types of care due to the risk that other patients may become contaminated. This includes forms of care that involve use of equipment common to all patients at the facility, or that involve transporting the patient to an area of the facility common to all patients.

==Diseased workers==
[[File:WHO in PPE.jpg|thumb|265px|Isolation wards may need to be hastily improvised during epidemics such as in this image of [[WHO]] workers in [[Lagos, Nigeria]] managing Ebola patients in 2014.]]

Health care workers who become infected with certain contagious agents may not be permitted to work with patients for a period of time. While facility rules and laws vary from place to place, a common guideline that has been set is 48 hours of removal.&lt;ref name="LawrenceMay2003b"/&gt; Technically, however, this form of infection control is not considered "isolation".

'''Macroorchidism''' is a disorder found in males where a subject has abnormally large [[testes]]. The condition is commonly [[genetics|inherited]] in connection with [[fragile X syndrome]], which is also the second most common genetic cause of [[mental disabilities]]. The opposite side of the spectrum is called [[microorchidism]], which is the condition of abnormally small testes.

Other possible causes of macroorchidism are long-standing primary [[hypothyroidism]], [[adrenal gland|adrenal]] remnants in [[congenital]] [[adrenal hyperplasia]], [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH)-secreting [[pituitary]] [[macroadenoma]]s, local [[tumor]]s, [[lymphomas]], or [[aromatase]] deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1695-4033(06)70015-7 |title=Macroorquidismo: A propósito de un caso |trans-title=Macroorchidism: a case report |language=Spanish |year=2006 |last1=Álvarez-Acevedo García |first1=M. |last2=Molina Rodríguez |first2=M.aA. |last3=González Casado |first3=I. |last4=Nistal Martín De Serrano |first4=M. |last5=Gracia Bouthelier |first5=R. |journal=Anales de Pediatría |volume=64 |pages=89–92 |pmid=16539923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mad Pride''' is a mass movement of the users of [[mental health]] services, former users, and the aligned, and that individuals with mental illness should be proud of their 'mad' identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themighty.com/2017/03/healing-voices-mad-pride/|title=The Power of 'Healing Voices'|publisher=The Mighty|first=Oryx|last=Cohen|date=9 March 2017|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed in 1993 in response to local community prejudices towards people with a psychiatric history living in boarding homes in the Parkdale area of [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, and an event has been held every year since then in the city except for 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csinfo.ca/bulletin.html  |first=Geoffrey |last=Reaume |title=A History of Psychiatric Survivor Pride Day during the 1990s |publisher=The Consumer/Survivor Information Resource Centre Bulletin, No. 374 |date=July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar movement began around the same time in the United Kingdom. By the late 1990s similar events were being organized under the Mad Pride name around the globe, including Australia, Ireland, Portugal, Brazil, Madagascar, South Africa and the United States. Events draw thousands of participants, according to [[MindFreedom International]], a United States mental health advocacy organization that promotes and tracks events spawned by the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html?partner=rssnyt 'Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mad Pride activists seek to reclaim terms such as "[[Insanity|mad]]", "[[nutter (disambiguation)|nutter]]", and "[[psychosis|psycho]]" from misuse, such as in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers and in order to switch it from a negative view into a positive view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html|title=Mad Pride’ Fights a Stigma|publisher=New York Times|first=Gabriell|last=Glaser|date=11 May 2008|accessdate=19 September 2018|deadurl= |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through a series of [[mass media]] campaigns, Mad Pride activists seek to re-educate the general public on such subjects as the causes of [[mental disorder|mental disabilities]], the experiences of those using the mental health system, and the global [[suicide]] pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  One of Mad Pride's founding activists in the UK was [[Pete Shaughnessy]], who later died by suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentalmagazine.co.uk/pete_shaughnessy.htm#petemain Pete Shaughnessy r.i.p.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Roberts, [[Robert Dellar]] (who died in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/activists-mourn-robert-dellar-co-founder-of-mad-pride-and-a-tenacious-force-for-good/|title=Activists mourn Robert Dellar, co-founder of Mad Pride and a ‘tenacious force for good’|date=2016-12-22|work=Disability News Service|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Simon Barnet were among the other founders of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/mad-pride-remembering-the-uks-mental-health-pride-movement&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Mad Pride:  A celebration of mad culture'' records the early Mad Pride movement.&lt;ref name="Mad Pride"&gt;{{cite book |author=Theodore R Curtis |year=1996 |title=Mad Pride |publisher=Spare Change Books |location=Hackney, London |isbn=0-95257-445-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Our Own: Patient-Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System'', published in 1978 by [[Judi Chamberlin]], is a foundational text in the Mad Pride movement, although it was published before the movement was launched.&lt;ref name="TBG"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawrence|first=J.M.|title=Judi Chamberlin, writings took on mental health care|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/arlington/articles/2010/01/20/judi_chamberlin_writings_took_on_mental_health_care/?page=full|accessdate=4 March 2011|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known event, specifically organized as a Pride event by people who identified as [[Psychiatric survivors movement|survivors, consumers or ex-patients of psychiatric practices]], was held on 18 September 1993, when it was called "Psychiatric Survivor Pride Day".

==[[Mad Studies]]==
[[Mad Studies]] grew out of Mad Pride and survivor thinking, and focuses on developing scholarly thinking around "mental health" by academics who self-identify as mad. As noted in ''Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies'' (LeFrançois, Menzies and Reaume, 2013),&lt;ref name="brenda"&gt;Brenda LeFrançois, Robert Menzies and Geoffrey Reaume, editors (2013) ''Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies'', Toronto, Canadian Scholars’ Press Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-55130-534-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mad Studies can be defined in general terms as a project of inquiry, knowledge production, and political action devoted to the critique and transcendence of psy-centred ways of thinking, behaving, relating, and being".&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt;{{rp|13}}  As a book, {{"'}}Mad Matters' offers a critical discussion of mental health and madness in ways that demonstrate the struggles, oppression, resistance, agency and perspectives of Mad people to challenge dominant understandings of ‘mental illness’".&lt;ref name="cas"&gt;Mark Anthony Castrodale (2014) "Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies", ''Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research'', {{doi|10.1080/15017419.2014.895415}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  "''Mad Studies'' is a growing, evolving, multi-voiced and interdisciplinary field of activism, theory, praxis and scholarship."&lt;ref name="cas" /&gt;{{rp|1}}

== History ==
Mad Pride was launched alongside a book of the same name, ''Mad Pride:  A celebration of mad culture'', published in 2000.&lt;ref name="Mad Pride" /&gt;  On May 11, 2008, Gabrielle Glaser documented Mad Pride in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="'Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma"&gt;{{cite news |author=Gabrielle Glaser |title='Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma |work= The New York Times |date= May 11, 2008 | publisher= The New York Times Company |access-date= May 11, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glaser stated, "Just as gay-rights activists reclaimed the word [[queer]] as a [[gay pride|badge of honor]] rather than a slur, these advocates proudly call themselves mad; they say their conditions do not preclude them from productive lives."

=== Early origins ===
[[Elizabeth Packard]] (1816-1897) was deemed insane by her husband as she did not agree with his conservative political views. In Illinois at the time, involuntary admission to an asylum did not require a public hearing so long as it was a husband admitting his wife.&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt; Due to this, Packard was institutionalized though she saw herself to be sane. In Packard’s lifetime to be labeled as ‘mad’ was a form of social disapproval. However, she felt solidarity among Mad people due to her experience in the institution. Though she did not personally identify as Mad and had to identify as ‘sane’ in order to be an activist, it is here that we see early forms of organizing from ex-patients.&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt;

==Mad culture and events==
[[File:2016-05-16-Mad Pride Köln 2016-4988.jpg|thumb|Bed Push at Mad Pride parade in Cologne, Germany, in 2016]]
The Mad Pride movement has spawned recurring cultural events in [[Toronto]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and other cities around the world.  These events often include music, poetry readings, film screenings, and [[street theatre]], such as "bed push" protests, which aim to raise awareness about the poor levels of choice of treatments and the widespread [[Involuntary treatment|use of force]] in [[psychiatric hospital]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedpush.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2 The Great Escape Bed Push]&lt;/ref&gt; Past events have included British journalist [[Jonathan Freedland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/08/health.healthandwellbeing |title=Glad to be 'mad'? |work=The Guardian |first=Jo |last=Brand |date=2007-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104141912/http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/may/08/health.healthandwellbeing |archivedate=November 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and popular novelist Clare Allan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Misplaced pride |work=Guardian Unlimited |first=Clare |last=Allan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,1881476,00.html |date=2006-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109101343/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0%2C%2C1881476%2C00.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mad Pride cultural events take a variety of forms, such as the South London collective Creative Routes, the Chipmunka Publishing enterprise, and the many works of Dolly Sen.&lt;ref&gt;Dolly Sen (October 2002) ''World Is Full of Laughter:  1 Million People Commit Suicide Every Year'', Chipmunka Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-95422-181-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bed push===
[[File:peteshaughnessy.jpg|thumb|A flyer for a 2003 Mad Pride event.]]
A Bed Push is a method of activism employed by multiple mental health agencies and advocates as a method of raising awareness about psychiatric care. Activists wheel a gurney through public spaces to provoke discussion about mental health care. [[Mind Freedom]] has a recipe for a successful Bed Push on their website, urging participants to remain peaceful but also be seen by blowing horns, slightly disrupting traffic and playing music.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfreedom.org/campaign/madpride/other-info/how-to/bed-push-tips&lt;/ref&gt; Often patients in psychiatric care feel silenced and powerless, showing resilience in the face of that and securing visibility is a method of regaining dignity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfreedom.org/campaign/media/mf-journal&lt;/ref&gt;

Mad Pride Week in Toronto is proclaimed as such by the city itself.&lt;ref name="blogto.com"&gt;http://www.blogto.com/city/2009/07/mad_pride_breaks_the_stigma_of_mental_illness/&lt;/ref&gt; The festivities surrounding this week are highlighted by the Mad Pride Bed Push, typically on the 14th of July. The event takes place Toronto’s Queen Street West “to raise public awareness about the use of force and lack of choice for people ensnared in the Ontario mental health system” &lt;ref&gt;Brenda LeFrançois, Robert Menzies and Geoffrey Reaume, editors (2013) Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies, Toronto, Canadian Scholars’ Press Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-55130-534-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This week is officially run by Toronto Mad Pride which partners a number of mental health agencies in the city. In recent years, some advocates have pushed for [[Parkdale, Toronto]] to be renamed MAD! Village, to reclaim pride in its surrounding communities' long history of struggle with mental health and addictions &lt;ref name="blogto.com"/&gt;

A series of bed push events take place around London each year.

=== Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours ===
The Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours take place in Toronto, ON at the CAMH facility on Queen St West. The tours show the patient built walls from the 19th century that are located at present day CAMH. The purpose of the tours is to give a history on the lives of the patients who built the walls, and bring attention to the harsh realities of psychiatry.

Geoffrey Reaume and Heinz Klein first came up with the idea of walking tours as part of a Mad Pride event in 2000. The first wall tour occurred on what is now known as Mad Pride Day, on July 14, 2000, with an attendance of about fifty people. Reaume solely leads the tours, and they have grown from annual events for Mad Pride, to occurring several times throughout the year in all non-winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://activehistory.ca/papers/historypaper-10/|title=Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, 2000 – 2010|date=2011-04-19|work=ActiveHistory.ca|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition --&gt;

[[File:Kwashiorkor 6180.jpg|thumb|Child in the [[United States]] with signs of [[Kwashiorkor]], a dietary protein deficiency.]]
Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, the term malnutrition refers to undernutrition for the remainder of this article. Malnutrition can be divided into two different types, SAM and MAM. SAM refers to children with severe acute malnutrition. MAM refers to moderate acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Sathish Subramanian |author2=Sayeeda Huq |author3=Tanya Yatsunenko |author4=Rashidul Haque |author5=Mustafa Mahfuz |author6=Mohammed A.

===Undernutrition and overnutrition===
Malnutrition is caused by eating a diet in which [[nutrient]]s are ''not enough'' or is ''too much'' such that it causes health problems.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a category of diseases that includes undernutrition and [[overnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO, nutrition experts take action on malnutrition |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/pressnote_action_on_malnutrition/en/|work=World Health Organization |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overnutrition can result in [[obesity]] and being [[overweight]]. In some [[developing countries]], overnutrition in the form of [[obesity]] is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progress For Children: A Report Card On Nutrition|url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Progress_for_Children_-_No._4.pdf|publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term malnutrition is commonly used to refer to undernutrition only.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies particularly to the context of development cooperation. Therefore, "malnutrition" in documents by the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]], [[Save the Children]] or other international [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) usually is equated to undernutrition.

===Protein-energy malnutrition===

Undernutrition is sometimes used as a synonym of [[protein–energy malnutrition]] (PEM).&lt;ref name="Young2012" /&gt; While other include both [[micronutrient deficiencies]] and protein energy malnutrition in its definition.&lt;ref name="Jones2011" /&gt; It differs from [[calorie restriction]] in that calorie restriction may not result in negative health effects. The term hypoalimentation means underfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000051473|hypoalimentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "severe malnutrition" or "severe undernutrition" is often used to refer specifically to [[protein–energy malnutrition|PEM]].&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last3=Walker |editor-first3=W. Allan |editor-first=Christopher |editor-last=Duggan |editor-first2=John B. |editor-last2=Watkins |title=Nutrition in pediatrics: basic science, clinical application|year=2008|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton|isbn=978-1-55009-361-2|pages=127–141|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wSTISCdSIosC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nutrition+in+pediatrics+:+basic+science,+clinical+application#v=onepage&amp;q=Nutrition%20in%20pediatrics%20%3A%20basic%20science%2C%20clinical%20application&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEM is often associated with micronutrient deficiency.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; Two forms of PEM are [[kwashiorkor]] and [[marasmus]], and they commonly coexist.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt;

==== Kwashiorkor ====
[[Kwashiorkor]] is mainly caused by inadequate protein intake.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; The main symptoms are [[edema]], wasting, liver enlargement, hypoalbuminaemia, steatosis, and possibly depigmentation of skin and hair.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Kwashiorkor is further identified by swelling of the belly, which is deceiving of actual nutritional status.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt; The term means ‘displaced child’ and is derived from a Ghana language of West Africa, means "the sickness the older one gets when the next baby is born," as this is when the older child is deprived of breast feeding and weaned to a diet composed largely of carbohydrates.&lt;ref name="listeningga"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Listening to the Ga: Cicely Williams' Discovery of Kwashiorkor on the Gold Coast|author=Stanton J|year=2001|journal=Clio Medica: Studies in the History of Medicine and Health|volume=61|pages=149–71|pmid=11603151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marasmus====
[[Marasmus]] (‘to waste away’) is caused by an inadequate intake of protein and energy. The main symptoms are severe wasting, leaving little or no edema, minimal subcutaneous fat, severe muscle wasting, and non-normal serum albumin levels.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Marasmus can result from a sustained diet of inadequate energy and protein, and the metabolism adapts to prolong survival.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; It is traditionally seen in famine, significant food restriction, or more severe cases of [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]].&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Conditions are characterized by extreme wasting of the muscles and a gaunt expression.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt;

===Undernutrition, hunger===
Undernutrition encompasses [[stunted growth]] (stunting), wasting, and deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals (collectively referred to as micronutrients). The term [[hunger]], which describes a feeling of discomfort from not eating, has been used to describe undernutrition, especially in reference to food insecurity.&lt;ref name="Black2008" /&gt;

===Definition by Gomez===
In 1956, Gómez and Galvan studied factors associated with death in a group of malnourished (undernourished) children in a hospital in Mexico City, Mexico and defined categories of malnutrition: first, second, and third degree.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=R. D.|author2=Conaway, M. R.|title=Weight and Mortality Rates: "Gomez Classification" for Children With Cerebral Palsy?|journal=Pediatrics|date=August 2011|volume=128|issue=2|pages=e436–e437|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-1472|pmid=21768321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degrees were based on weight below a specified percentage of median weight for age.&lt;ref name="Grover 2009" /&gt; The risk of death increases with increasing degree of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011" /&gt; An adaptation of Gomez's original classification is still used today. While it provides a way to compare malnutrition within and between populations, the classification has been criticized for being "arbitrary" and for not considering overweight as a form of malnutrition. Also, height alone may not be the best indicator of malnutrition; children who are born prematurely may be considered short for their age even if they have good nutrition.&lt;ref name="Gueri 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gueri |first1=M.|author2=J. M. Gurney, P. Jutsum|title=The gomez classification.

===Definition by Waterlow===
[[John Waterlow|John Conrad Waterlow]] established a new classification for malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt; Instead of using just weight for age measurements, the classification established by Waterlow combines weight-for-height (indicating acute episodes of malnutrition) with height-for-age to show the stunting that results from chronic malnutrition.&lt;ref name="J. C. Waterlow"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watts|first=Geoff|title=John Conrad Waterlow|journal=The Lancet|date=December 2010|volume=376|issue=9757|pages=1982|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62252-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage of the Waterlow classification over the Gomez classification is that weight for height can be examined even if ages are not known.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt;

Lower energy and impaired function of the brain also represent the downward spiral of malnutrition as victims are less able to perform the tasks they need to in order to acquire food, earn an income, or gain an education.

[[Avitaminosis|Vitamin-deficiency-related diseases]] (such as [[scurvy]] and [[rickets]]).

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can result from a child not eating for 4 to 6 hours. Hypoglycemia should be considered if there is lethargy, limpness, convulsion, or loss of consciousness. If blood sugar can be measured immediately and quickly, perform a finger or heel stick.

Major causes of malnutrition include poverty and food prices, dietary practices and agricultural productivity, with many individual cases being a mixture of several factors.  [[Clinical malnutrition]], such as [[cachexia]], is a major burden also in [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Various scales of analysis also have to be considered in order to determine the sociopolitical causes of malnutrition. For example, the population of a community that is within poor governments, may be at risk if the area lacks health-related services, but on a smaller scale certain households or individuals may be at an even higher risk due to differences in income levels, access to land, or levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fotso | first1 = J.

===Dietary practices===

==== Undernutrition ====
A lack of adequate breastfeeding leads to malnutrition in infants and children, associated with the deaths of an estimated one million children annually. Illegal advertising of breast milk substitutes contributed to malnutrition and continued three decades after its 1981 prohibition under the ''WHO International Code of Marketing Breast Milk Substitutes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |date=June 2012 |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=529–32 |title=Marketing breast milk substitutes: problems and perils throughout the world |author=Brady JP |pmid=22419779 |pmc=3371222 |doi=10.1136/archdischild-2011-301299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal malnutrition can also factor into the poor health or death of a baby. Over 800,000 [[neonatal death]] have occurred because of deficient growth of the fetus in the mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/261533.php|title=Malnutrition Kills Over 3 Million Children Annually Worldwide|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deriving too much of one's diet from a single source, such as eating almost exclusively corn or rice, can cause malnutrition. This may either be from a lack of education about proper nutrition, or from only having access to a single food source.&lt;ref name=Burchi&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Int J Environ Res Public Health |date=February 2011 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=358–73 |title=The role of food and nutrition system approaches in tackling hidden hunger |vauthors=Burchi F, Fanzo J, Frison E |pmid=21556191 |pmc=3084466 |doi=10.3390/ijerph8020358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not just the total amount of calories that matters but specific nutritional deficiencies such as [[vitamin A deficiency]], [[iron deficiency]] or [[zinc deficiency]] can also increase risk of death.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNICEF (2013). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2148 Improving Child Nutrition - The achievable imperative for global progress]. UNICEF&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Overnutrition ====
Overnutrition caused by [[overeating]] is also a form of malnutrition. In the United States, more than half of all adults are now overweight — a condition that, like hunger, increases susceptibility to disease and disability, reduces worker productivity, and lowers life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is much more common in the United States, where for the majority of people, access to food is not an issue. Many parts of the world have access to a surplus of non-nutritious food, in addition to increased sedentary lifestyles. Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell calls this a "[[toxic food environment]]" where fat and sugar laden foods have taken precedence over healthy nutritious foods.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

The issue in these developed countries is choosing the right kind of food. More fast food is consumed per capita in the United States than in any other country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility. Often fast food, low in cost and nutrition, is high in calories and heavily promoted. When these eating habits are combined with increasingly urbanized, automated, and more sedentary lifestyles, it becomes clear why weight gain is difficult to avoid.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Gary|last2=Halweil|first2=Brian|year=2000|title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488|journal=World Watch|volume=13|issue=4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does obesity occur in developed countries, problems are also occurring in developing countries in areas where income is on the rise.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is also a problem in countries where hunger and poverty persist. In China, consumption of high-fat foods has increased while consumption of rice and other goods has decreased.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

Overeating leads to many diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, that may result in death.

===Poverty and food prices===
[[File:Starved child.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A child with extreme malnutrition]]

In Bangladesh, poor socioeconomic position was associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibits purchase of nutritious foods such as milk, meat, poultry, and fruits.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=MM|author2=Kraemer, A|title=Factors associated with being underweight, overweight and obese among ever-married non-pregnant urban women in Bangladesh|journal=Singapore Medical Journal|date=August 2009|volume=50|issue=8|pages=804–13|pmid=19710981}}&lt;/ref&gt; As much as food shortages may be a contributing factor to malnutrition in countries with lack of technology, the [[FAO]] (Food and Agriculture Organization) has estimated that eighty percent of malnourished children living in the developing world live in countries that produce food surpluses.&lt;ref name=Gardner00&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Gary |last2=Halweil |first2=Brian |title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess |journal=World Watch |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=24 |year=2000 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economist [[Amartya Sen]] observed that, in recent decades, famine has always been a problem of food distribution and/or poverty, as there has been sufficient food to feed the whole population of the world. He states that malnutrition and [[famine]] were more related to problems of food distribution and purchasing power.&lt;ref name=Sen81&gt;{{cite book |first=Amartya Kumar |last=Sen |title=Poverty and famines: An essay on entitlement and deprivation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BzU_AwAAQBAJ |year=1981 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-828463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that commodity speculators are increasing the cost of food. As the real estate bubble in the United States was collapsing, it is said that trillions of dollars moved to invest in food and primary commodities, causing the 2007–2008 [[food price crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The role of speculators in the global food crisis |agency= |work= |newspaper=Spiegel Online |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,549187,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[biofuel]]s as a replacement for traditional fuels raises the price of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuel use increasing poverty |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= June 25, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7472532.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] special rapporteur on the right to food, [[Jean Ziegler]] proposes that agricultural waste, such as corn cobs and banana leaves, rather than crops themselves be used as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuels 'crime against humanity' |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= October 27, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7065061.stm |first=Grant |last=Ferrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural productivity===
Local food shortages can be caused by a lack of arable land, adverse weather, lower farming skills such as [[crop rotation]], or by a lack of technology or resources needed for the higher yields found in modern [[agriculture]], such as fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery and storage facilities. As a result of widespread poverty, farmers cannot afford or governments cannot provide the resources necessary to improve local yields. The World Bank and some wealthy donor countries also press nations that depend on aid to cut or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of [[free market]] policies even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 2, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zambia: fertile but hungry |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= February 6, 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4678592.stm |first=Peter |last=Biles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many, if not most, farmers cannot afford fertilizer at market prices, leading to low agricultural production and wages and high, unaffordable food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;
Reasons for the unavailability of fertilizer include moves to stop supplying fertilizer on [[environmental movement|environmental]] grounds, cited as the obstacle to feeding Africa by the [[Green Revolution]] pioneers [[Norman Borlaug]] and Keith Rosenberg.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news |title=Forgotten benefactor of humanity |agency= |work= |newspaper=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future threats===
There are a number of potential disruptions to global food supply that could cause widespread malnutrition.

[[Global warming]] is of importance to food security, with 95 percent of all malnourished peoples living in the relatively stable climate region of the sub-tropics and tropics. According to the latest [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] reports, temperature increases in these regions are "very likely."&lt;ref name=ipcc&gt;{{cite web |title= Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report |date=November 12–17, 2007 |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf |accessdate=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even small changes in temperatures can lead to increased frequency of extreme weather conditions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt; Many of these have great impact on agricultural production and hence nutrition. For example, the 1998–2001 central Asian drought brought about an 80 percent livestock loss and 50 percent reduction in wheat and barley crops in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Battisti, David S. "Climate Change in Developing Countries." University of Washington. Seattle. October 27, 2008.{{vn|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar figures were present in other nations. An increase in extreme weather such as drought in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa would have even greater consequences in terms of malnutrition. Even without an increase of extreme weather events, a simple increase in temperature reduces the productivity of many crop species, also decreasing food security in these regions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Black, Richard |title=Rice yields falling under global warming |agency= |newspaper=BBC News; Science &amp; Environment |date=August 9, 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10918591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colony collapse disorder]] is a phenomenon where bees die in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aginfo.psu.edu/news/2007/1/HoneyBees.htm Honey Bee Die-Off Alarms Beekeepers, Crop growers and researchers]&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[list of crop plants pollinated by bees|many agricultural crops worldwide are pollinated by bees]], this represents a threat to the supply of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vanishing bees threaten US crops |newspaper=BBC News |date= March 11, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6438373.stm |first=Matt |last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food security===

{{Main|Food security}}
The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the West, such as nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides, to Asia, called the [[Green Revolution]], resulted in increased [[food production]] and corresponding decreases in prices and malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing infrastructure and institutions that are in short supply in Africa, such as a system of roads or public seed companies that made seeds available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Africa, prosperity from seeds falls short |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date= October 10, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investments in agriculture, such as subsidized fertilizers and seeds, increases food harvest and reduces food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barclay, Eliza |title=How a Kenyan village tripled its corn harvest |agency= |work= |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=June 18, 2008 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p07s01-woaf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the case of Malawi, almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid. However, after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced against World Bank strictures, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests as production leaped to 3.4 million in 2007 from 1.2 million in 2005, making Malawi a major food exporter.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; This lowered food prices and increased wages for farm workers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; Such investments in agriculture are still needed in other African countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country has one of the highest  prevalence of malnutrition even though it is blessed with great agricultural potential John Ulimwengu explains in his article for D+C.&lt;ref&gt;

In Nigeria, the use of imported Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) has been used to treat malnutrition in the North. ''Soy Kunu'', a locally sourced and prepared blend consisting of peanut, millet and soya beans may also be used.&lt;ref name=Soykunu&gt;{{cite news |title=Severe Malnutrition, A Disturbance in Nigerian Health Sector |agency= |work= Public Health Nigeria|newspaper= |date=October 12, 2018 |url=https://publichealthng.com/severe-malnutrition-a-disturbance-in-nigerian-health-sector/ |first1=Obasi |last1=Chinedu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technology in agricultural production also has great potential to combat undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Jiming, Yeyun Xin and Longping Yuan. (2010). Pushing the Yield Frontier: Hybrid rice in China. In MillionsFed: Proved Success in Agriculture Development. Washington, DC: International Policy Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; By improving agricultural yields, farmers could reduce poverty by increasing income as well as open up area for diversification of crops for household use. The World Bank itself claims to be part of the solution to malnutrition, asserting that the best way for countries to succeed in breaking the cycle of poverty and malnutrition is to build export-led economies that will give them the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market.

===Economics===
There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html|title=UN aid debate: give cash not food?|date=June 4, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN's [[World Food Program]], the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a "revolution" in food aid.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wfp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|title=Cash roll-out to help hunger hot spots|date=December 8, 2008|publisher=World Food Programme|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212124012/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|archivedate=February 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aid agency [[Concern Worldwide]] is piloting a method through a mobile phone operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;

However, for people in a drought living a long way from and with limited access to markets, delivering food may be the most appropriate way to help.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt; [[Fred Cuny]] stated that "the chances of saving lives at the outset of a relief operation are greatly reduced when food is imported. By the time it arrives in the country and gets to people, many will have died."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Natsios (Administrator U.S. Agency for International Development)&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. law, which requires buying food at home rather than where the hungry live, is inefficient because approximately half of what is spent goes for transport.&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients" /&gt; Cuny further pointed out "studies of every recent famine have shown that food was available in-country — though not always in the immediate food deficit area" and "even though by local standards the prices are too high for the poor to purchase it, it would usually be cheaper for a donor to buy the hoarded food at the inflated price than to import it from abroad."&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum to former Representative Steve Solarz (United States, Democratic Party, New York), July 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A soup kitchen in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] in 1931.]]
[[Food bank]]s and [[soup kitchen]]s address malnutrition in places where people lack money to buy food.  A [[basic income]] has been proposed as a way to ensure that everyone has enough money to buy food and other basic needs; it is a form of [[social security]] in which all citizens or residents of a country regularly receive an unconditional sum of money, either from a government or some other public institution, in addition to any income received from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm |title = Improving Social Security in Canada Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper |publisher = Government of Canada |year = 1994 |accessdate = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed method for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2|title=A model of African food aid is now in trouble|date=May 6, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia been pioneering a program, and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5" /&gt;

===World population===

Restricting population size is a proposed solution. [[Thomas Malthus]] argued that population growth could be controlled by natural disasters and voluntary limits through "moral restraint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Thomas Robert |last1=Malthus |authorlink=Thomas Malthus |first2=Philip |last2= Appleman |title=An essay on the principle of population: text, sources and background, criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raGGQgAACAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-09202-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Chapman suggests that an intervention through government policies is a necessary ingredient of curtailing global population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = R. | title = No room at the inn, or why population problems are not all economic | journal = Population and Environment | volume = 21 | pages = 81–97 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/BF02436122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interdependence and complementarity of population growth with poverty and malnutrition (as well as the environment) is also recognised by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/environment/index.shtml|title=Environment - United Nations Population Division {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200 million women worldwide do not have adequate access to family planning services. According to the World Health Organisation, "Family planning is key to slowing unsustainable population growth and the resulting negative impacts on the economy, environment, and national and regional development efforts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/family-planning-contraception|title=Family planning/Contraception|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are many who believe that the world has more than enough resources to sustain its population. Instead, these theorists point to unequal distribution of resources and under- or unutilized arable land as the cause for malnutrition problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlin, G. (1967). Population control and economic development. Paris: Dev Centers, OECD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nielson, K. (1992). Global Justice, Capitalism and the Third World. (R. A. Wilkons, Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Amartya Sen advocates that, "no matter how a famine is caused, methods of breaking it call for a large supply of food in the [[Public Distribution System|public distribution system]]. This applies not only to organizing rationing and control, but also to undertaking work programmes and other methods of increasing purchasing power for those hit by shifts in exchange entitlements in a general inflationary situation."&lt;ref name="Sen81" /&gt; 

===Food sovereignty===

{{Main|Food sovereignty}}
One suggested policy framework to resolve access issues is termed [[food sovereignty]]—the right of peoples to define their own food, agriculture, livestock, and fisheries systems, in contrast to having food largely subjected to international market forces. Food First is one of the primary think tanks working to build support for food sovereignty. Neoliberals advocate for an increasing role of the free market.

===Health facilities===

Another possible long term solution would be to increase access to health facilities to rural parts of the world. These facilities could monitor undernourished children, act as supplemental food distribution centers, and provide education on dietary needs. These types of facilities have already proven very successful in countries such as Peru and Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = H. R. | last2 = Penny | first2 = M.

===Breastfeeding===

As of 2016 is estimated that about 821,000 deaths of children less than five years old could be prevented globally per year through more widespread breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Lancet2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Victora|first1=CG|last2=Bahl|first2=R|last3=Barros|first3=AJ|last4=França|first4=GV|last5=Horton|first5=S|last6=Krasevec|first6=J|last7=Murch|first7=S|last8=Sankar|first8=MJ|last9=Walker|first9=N|date=January 30, 2016|title=Breastfeeding in the 21st century: epidemiology, mechanisms, and lifelong effect.|journal=Lancet|volume=387|issue=10017|pages=475–90|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01024-7|pmid=26869575|last10=Rollins|first10=NC|last11=Lancet Breastfeeding Series|first11=Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to reducing infant death, breast milk feeding provides an important source of micronutrients, clinically proven to bolster the immune system of children, and provide long-term defenses against non-communicable and allergic diseases.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lessen|first=Rachelle|last2=Kavanagh|first2=Katherine|date=2015-03-01|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Promoting and Supporting Breastfeeding|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(14)01876-0/fulltext|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|language=English|volume=115|issue=3|pages=444–449|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2014.12.014|pmid=25721389|issn=2212-2672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breastfeeding has also been shown to improve cognitive abilities in children, with a strong correlation to individual educational achievements.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balogun|first=Olukunmi Omobolanle|last2=Dagvadorj|first2=Amarjagal|last3=Anigo|first3=Kola Mathew|last4=Ota|first4=Erika|last5=Sasaki|first5=Satoshi|date=2015-10-01|title=Factors influencing breastfeeding exclusivity during the first 6 months of life in developing countries: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review|journal=Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=433–451|doi=10.1111/mcn.12180|pmid=25857205|issn=1740-8709}}&lt;/ref&gt; As previously noted, lack of proper breastfeeding is a major factor in child mortality rates, and a primary determinant of disease development for children.

==== Barriers to breastfeeding ====

Breastfeeding is noted as one of the most cost effective medical interventions for providing beneficial child health.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; While there are considerable differences within developed and developing countries: income, employment, social norms, and access to healthcare were found to be universal determinants of whether a mother breast or formula fed their children.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Community based healthcare workers have helped alleviate financial barriers faced by newly made mothers, and provided a viable alternative to traditional and expensive hospital based medical care.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Recent studies based upon surveys conducted from 1995-2010 shows exclusive breastfeeding rates have gone up globally, from 33% to 39%.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Despite the growth rates, medical professionals acknowledge the need for improvement given the importance of exclusive breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===Global initiatives===
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations#Online campaign against hunger campaign|EndingHunger]] campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.

Food security and global malnutrition has long been a topic of international concern, with one of the first official global documents addressing it being the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]](UDHR). Within this document it stated that access to food was part of an adequate right to a standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24|date=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Right to food]] was asserted in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], a [[treaty]] adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 16, 1966. The Right to food is a [[human rights|human right]] for people to feed themselves in dignity, be free from hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.righttofood.org/work-of-jean-ziegler-at-the-un/what-is-the-right-to-food/|title=What is the Right to Food? {{!}} Right to food|website=www.righttofood.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the treaty has been signed by 166 countries, by signing states agreed to take steps to the maximum of their available resources to achieve the right to adequate food.

However, after the 1966 International Covenant the global concern for the access to sufficient food only became more present, leading to the first ever World Food Conference that was held in 1974 in Rome, Italy. The [[Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition]] was a UN resolution adopted November 16, 1974 by all 135 countries that attended the 1974 World Food Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/universal-declaration-on-the-eradication-of-hunger-and-malnutrition.htm|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This non-legally binding document set forth certain aspirations for countries to follow to sufficiently take action on the global food problem. Ultimately this document outline and provided guidance as to how the international community as one could work towards fighting and solving the growing global issue of malnutrition and hunger.

Adoption of the right to food was included in the [[American Convention on Human Rights#Additional Protocols|Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]], this 1978 document was adopted by many countries in the Americas, the purpose of the document is, "to consolidate in this hemisphere, within the framework of democratic institutions, a system of personal liberty and [[social justice]] based on respect for the essential rights of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrcr.org/docs/American_Convention/oashr.html|title=American Convention on Human Rights|website=www.hrcr.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next document in the timeline of global inititaves for malnutrition was the 1996 [[Rome Declaration on World Food Security]], organized by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]. This document reaffirmed the right to have access to safe and nutritous food by everyone, also considering that everyone gets sufficient food, and set the goals for all nations to improve their commitment to food security by halfing their amount of undernourished people by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3613e/w3613e00.htm|title=Rome Declaration and Plan of Action|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the Food and Agriculture Organization adopted the  [[Right to Food Guidelines]], which offered states a framework of how to increase the right to food on a national basis.

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx Outcome of the 2012 Copenhagen Consensus]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], approved through the UN in 2015. In particular Goal 2: Zero hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/ Description and targets for Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership Compact2025, led by [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition. 2015.

In June 2015, the [[European Union]] and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] have launched a partnership to combat undernutrition especially in children. The program will initiatilly be implemented in Bangladesh, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Laos and Niger and will help these countries to improve information and analysis about nutrition so they can develop effective national nutrition policies.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Press release.

Accessed on 1 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the UN has created a partnership that will act through the [[African Union]]'s CAADP framework aiming to end hunger in Africa by 2025. It includes different interventions including support for improved food production, a strengthening of social protection and integration of the right to food into national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2015.

In response to child malnutrition, the [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi government]] recommends ten steps for treating severe malnutrition. They are to prevent or treat [[dehydration]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[hypothermia|low body temperature]], infection, correct electrolyte imbalances and micronutrient deficiencies, start feeding cautiously, achieve catch-up growth, provide psychological support, and prepare for discharge and follow-up after recovery.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

Among those who are hospitalized, nutritional support improves protein, calorie intake and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bally|first1=MR|last2=Blaser Yildirim|first2=PZ|last3=Bounoure|first3=L|last4=Gloy|first4=VL|last5=Mueller|first5=B|last6=Briel|first6=M|last7=Schuetz|first7=P|date=January 1, 2016|title=Nutritional Support and Outcomes in Malnourished Medical Inpatients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=176|issue=1|pages=43–53|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.6587|pmid=26720894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food===
The evidence for benefit of supplementary feeding is poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sguassero|first1=Y|last2=de Onis|first2=M|last3=Bonotti|first3=AM|last4=Carroli|first4=G|date=Jun 13, 2012|title=Community-based supplementary feeding for promoting the growth of children under five years of age in low and middle income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD005039|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005039.pub3|pmid=22696347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the small amount of research done on this treatment.

Specially formulated foods do however appear useful in those from the developing world with moderate acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Lazzer2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lazzerini|first1=M|last2=Rubert|first2=L|last3=Pani|first3=P|date=Jun 21, 2013|title=Specially formulated foods for treating children with moderate acute malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD009584|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009584.pub2|pmid=23794237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In young children with severe acute malnutrition it is unclear if [[ready-to-use therapeutic food]] differs from a normal diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoonees|first1=A|last2=Lombard|first2=M|last3=Musekiwa|first3=A|last4=Nel|first4=E|last5=Volmink|first5=J|date=Jun 6, 2013|title=Ready-to-use therapeutic food for home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children from six months to five years of age.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD009000|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009000.pub2|pmid=23744450}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may have some benefits in humanitarian emergencies as they can be eaten directly from the packet, do not require refrigeration or mixing with clean water, and can be stored for years.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8114750.stm|title=Firms target nutrition for the poor|last=Anderson|first=Tatum|date=June 24, 2009|work=|newspaper=BBC News|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those who are severely malnourished, feeding too much too quickly can result in [[refeeding syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Via2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Viana Lde|first1=A|last2=Burgos|first2=MG|last3=Silva Rde|first3=A|date=Jan–Mar 2012|title=Refeeding syndrome: clinical and nutritional relevance.|journal=Arquivos Brasileiros de Cirurgia Digestiva : ABCD = Brazilian Archives of Digestive Surgery|volume=25|issue=1|pages=56–9|pmid=22569981}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result regardless of route of feeding and can present itself a couple of days after eating with [[heart failure]], [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]]s and confusion that can result in death.&lt;ref name="Via2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boateng|first1=AA|last2=Sriram|first2=K|last3=Meguid|first3=MM|last4=Crook|first4=M|date=Feb 2010|title=Refeeding syndrome: treatment considerations based on collective analysis of literature case reports.|journal=Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)|volume=26|issue=2|pages=156–67|doi=10.1016/j.nut.2009.11.017|pmid=20122539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers are trying to fortify everyday foods with micronutrients that can be sold to consumers such as wheat flour for Beladi bread in Egypt or fish sauce in Vietnam and the iodization of salt.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

For example, flour has been fortified with iron, zinc, folic acid and other B vitamins such as thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin B12.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Micronutrients===
Treating malnutrition, mostly through [[food fortification|fortifying]] foods with micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), improves lives at a lower cost and shorter time than other forms of [[aid]], according to the World Bank.&lt;ref name="IQ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/opinion/04kristof.html|title=Raising the world's IQ|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=December 4, 2008|work=The New York Times|newspaper=|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Copenhagen Consensus]], which look at a variety of development proposals, ranked micronutrient supplements as number one.&lt;ref name="hiddenhunger"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/opinion/24kristof.html|title=The Hidden Hunger|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=May 24, 2009|work=|newspaper=New York Times|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/160075|title=Let them eat micronutrients|work=|newspaper=Newsweek|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those with diarrhea, once an initial four-hour rehydration period is completed, zinc supplementation is recommended. Daily zinc increases the chances of reducing the severity and duration of the diarrhea, and continuing with daily zinc for ten to fourteen days makes diarrhea less likely recur in the next two to three months.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)"&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], World Health Organization, 2005.  See especially Ch. 4 "Management of Acute Diarrhoea (Without Blood)" and Ch. 8 "Management of Diarrhoea With Severe Malnutrition."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, malnourished children need both potassium and magnesium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh], Institute of Public Health Nutrition, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, May 2008, page 18 (19 in PDF) and following pages.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be obtained by following the above recommendations for the dehydrated child to continue eating within two to three hours of starting rehydration,&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; and including foods rich in potassium as above. [[Hypokalemia|Low blood potassium]] is worsened when base (as in Ringer's/Hartmann's) is given to treat acidosis without simultaneously providing potassium.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; As above, available home products such as salted and unsalted cereal water, salted and unsalted vegetable broth can be given early during the course of a child's diarrhea along with continued eating.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;  Vitamin A, potassium, magnesium, and zinc should be added with other vitamins and minerals if available.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

For a malnourished child with diarrhea from any cause, this should include foods rich in potassium such as bananas, green coconut water, and unsweetened fresh fruit juice.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;

===Diarrhea===
[[File:ORT saches.JPG|thumb|Examples of commercially available oral rehydration salts (Nepal on left, Peru on right).]]
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rehydrating a severely undernourished child who has diarrhea relatively slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The preferred method is with fluids by mouth using a drink called [[oral rehydration solution]] (ORS).&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The oral rehydration solution is both slightly [[sweet]] and slightly [[salt]]y and the one recommended in those with severe undernutrition should have half the usual sodium and greater potassium.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; Fluids by [[nasogastric tube]] may be use in those who do not drink.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; [[Intravenous]] fluids are recommended only in those who have [[Shock (circulatory)|significant dehydration]] due to their potential complications.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; These complications include [[congestive heart failure]].&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Over time, ORS developed into [[Oral rehydration therapy|ORT]], or [[oral rehydration therapy]], which focused on increasing fluids by supplying salts, carbohydrates, and water. This switch from type of fluid to amount of fluid was crucial in order to prevent dehydration from diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Victora|first=Cesar|last2=Bryce|first2=Jennifer|date=Jan 2000|title=Reducing deaths from diarrhoea through oral rehydration therapy|url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862000001000010&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=e|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=10|pages=1246–1255|doi=10.1590/S0042-96862000001000010|pmid=|access-date=|doi-broken-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For babies a dropper or syringe without the needle can be used to put small amounts of fluid into the mouth; for children under 2, a teaspoon every one to two minutes; and for older children and adults, frequent sips directly from a cup.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; After the first two hours, rehydration should be continued at the same or slower rate, determined by how much fluid the child wants and any ongoing diarrheal loses. After the first two hours of rehydration it is recommended that to alternate between rehydration and food.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

In 2003, WHO and UNICEF recommended a reduced-[[osmolarity]] ORS which still treats dehydration but also reduced stool volume and vomiting. Reduced-osmolarity ORS is the current standard ORS with reasonably wide availability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4950e/2.4.html WHO Drug Information Vol. 16, No. 2, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rehydrate.org/ors/low-osmolarity-ors.htm Low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS)], Rehydrate Project, updated: April 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For general use, one packet of ORS (glucose sugar, salt, potassium chloride, and trisodium citrate) is added to one liter of water; however, for malnourished children it is recommended that one packet of ORS be added to two liters of water along with an extra 50 grams of sucrose sugar and some stock potassium solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], WHO, 2005.  Specifically, 45 milliliters of potassium chloride solution from a stock solution containing 100g KCl per liter, along with one packet of ORS, ''&lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt;'' liters of water, and 50 grams of sucrose.  And please remember, sucrose has approximately twice the molecular weight of glucose, with one mole of glucose weighing 180 g and one mole of sucrose weighing 342 g.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malnourished children have an excess of body sodium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;  Recommendations for home remedies agree with one liter of water (34 oz.) and 6 teaspoons sugar and disagree regarding whether it is then one teaspoon of salt added or only 1/2, with perhaps most sources recommending 1/2 teaspoon of added salt to one liter water.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241592330.pdf "Guidelines for the control of shigellosis, including epidemics due to Shigella dysenteriae type 1".] World Health Organization, 2005, Annex 12 - Preparation of Home Made Oral Rehydration Solution, page 51 (57 in PDF): "Ingredients: Half a teaspoon of salt (2.5 grams), six level teaspoons of sugar (30 grams) and one litre of safe drinking water".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/basics/treatment/con-20030056 "Dehydration, treatments and drugs."] Mayo Clinic January 7, 2011.

===Low blood sugar===
[[Hypoglycemia]], whether known or suspected, can be treated with a mixture of sugar and water. If the child is conscious, the initial dose of sugar and water can be given by mouth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh] recommends, for initial hypoglycemia, a 50 milliliter bolus of 10% glucose or sucrose.  This can also be achieved by added 1 rounded teaspoon of sugar to 10.5 teaspoons of water (which is 3.5 tablespoons of water).&lt;/ref&gt; If the child is unconscious, give glucose by [[intravenous]] or [[nasogastric tube]]. If seizures occur after despite glucose, rectal [[diazepam]] is recommended. Blood sugar levels should be re-checked on two hour intervals.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

===Hypothermia===
[[Hypothermia]] can occur. To prevent or treat this, the child can be kept warm with covering including of the head or by direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother or father and then covering both parent and child. Prolonged bathing or prolonged medical exams should be avoided. Warming methods are usually most important at night.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

The figures provided in this section on epidemiology all refer to ''undernutrition'' even if the term malnutrition is used which, by definition, could also apply to too much nutrition.

The [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI) is a multidimensional statistical tool used to describe the state of countries’ hunger situation. The GHI measures progress and failures in the global fight against hunger.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8306556.stm |title= Global hunger worsening, warns UN |publisher= BBC (Europe) |date= 14 October 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GHI is updated once a year. The data from the 2015 report shows that Hunger levels have dropped 27% since 2000. Fifty two countries remain at serious or alarming levels. In addition to the latest statistics on Hunger and Food Security, the GHI also features different special topics each year. The 2015 report include an article on conflict and food security.&lt;ref&gt;K. von Grebmer, J. Bernstein, A. de Waal, N. Prasai, S. Yin, Y.

Poor or non-existent breastfeeding causes another 1.4 million. Other deficiencies, such as lack of [[vitamin A]] or [[zinc]], for example, account for 1 million. Malnutrition in the first two years is irreversible. Malnourished children grow up with worse health and lower education achievement. Their own children tend to be smaller. Malnutrition was previously{{when|date=September 2016}} seen as something that exacerbates the problems of diseases such as measles, pneumonia and diarrhea, but malnutrition actually causes diseases, and can be fatal in its own right.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

==History ==
Throughout history, portions of the world's population have often experienced sustained periods of hunger. In many cases, this resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather. For the first few decades after [[World War II]], technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. While progress was uneven, by 2000 the threat of extreme hunger subsided for many of the world's people. According to the WFP some statistics are that, "Some 795 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life. That's about one in nine people on earth. The vast majority of the world's hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 percent of the population is undernourished."&lt;ref name="wfp.org Hunger Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunger Statistics|url=https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats|website=World Food Programme|publisher=wfp.org|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2006, the average international price of food had been largely stable for several decades. In the closing months of 2006, however, prices began to [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|rise rapidly]]. By 2008, rice had tripled in price in some regions, and this severely affected [[developing countries]]. Food prices fell in early 2009, but rose to another record high in 2011, and have since decreased slightly. The [[financial crisis of 2007–2012|2008 worldwide financial crisis]] further increased the number of people suffering from hunger, including dramatic increases even in advanced economies such as [[Great Britain]], the [[Eurozone]] and the [[United States]].

The [[Millennium Development Goals]] included a commitment to a further 50% reduction in the proportion of the world's population who have extreme hunger by 2015. As of 2012, this target appeared difficult to achieve, due in part to persistent inflation in food prices. However, in late 2012 the UN's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) stated it is still possible to hit the target with sufficient effort. In 2013, the ''FAO'' estimated that 842 million people are undernourished (12% of the global population). Malnutrition is a cause of death for more than 3.1 million children under 5 every year. [[UNICEF]] estimates 300 million children go to bed hungry each night; and that 8000 children under the age of 5 are estimated to die of malnutrition every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/rightsite/364_617.htm|author=Ernest C. Madu|title=Investment and Development Will Secure the Rights of the Child}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century and earlier===
Throughout history, the need to aid those suffering from hunger has been commonly, though not universally,&lt;ref&gt;As an example of historical opposition to food aid, during the [[Hungry Forties]], English [[Laissez-faire]] advocates were largely successful in preventing it being deployed by Great Britain to relief the Irish famine; see for example the section on "Ideology and relief"' in Chpt. 2 of ''The Great Irish Famine'' by [[Cormac Ó Gráda]].

For a detailed description of how views opposed to hunger relief became dominant within Great Britain's policy making circles during the 19th century, and also their subsequent displacement, see ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007) by James Vernon, esp. Chpts. 1–3. In 2012, advocates of small government spoke out against the US food stamp programme, saying it discourages people from fending for themselves, in the same way as it is not always a good idea to feed hungry wild animals. ( See [http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/07/14/4099922/food-stamp-debate-brings-out-the.html Food stamp debate brings out the haters] published by the ''Star Telegram''. )&lt;/ref&gt; recognized.

The philosopher [[Simone Weil]] wrote that feeding the hungry when you have resources to do so is the most obvious of all human [[Moral obligation|obligations]]. She says that as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]], many believed that people had to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife. Weil writes that [[Social progress]] is commonly held to be first of all, "...a transition to a state of human society in which people will not suffer from hunger." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Simone Weil]]|title=The Need for Roots|page = 6|year=2002 |orig-year= 1942|isbn=978-0-415-27102-8|publisher = [[Routledge]]|title-link=The Need for Roots}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social historian [[Karl Polanyi]] wrote that before markets became the world's dominant form of economic organization in the 19th century, most human societies would either starve all together or not at all, because communities would invariably share their food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Karl Polanyi]] | title = The Great Transformation | year = 2002 |orig-year=1942 | chapter = chpt. 4  | isbn = 978-0-8070-5643-1  | publisher=Beacon Press | title-link = The Great Transformation (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the first age of globalization, which began in the 19th century, it became more common for people to consider problems like hunger in global terms. However, as early globalization largely coincided with the high peak of influence for [[classical liberalism]], there was relatively little call for politicians to address world hunger.&lt;ref&gt;For further info see [[Hunger in the United Kingdom#Attitudes towards hunger relief]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There were many exceptions. For example, in ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007), James Vernon describes dozens of 18th and 19th century campaigners who spoke in favor of hunger relief.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the view that politicians ought not to intervene against hunger was increasingly challenged by campaigning journalists, with some academics and politicians also calling for or organizing intervention against world hunger, such as U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"&gt;{{cite book |author = James Vernon|title=Hunger: A Modern History |chapter = Chpts. 1-3|year= 2007|isbn=978-0674026780 |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"&gt;{{cite journal|author = David Grigg|title=The historiography of hunger: changing views on the world food problem 1945–1980|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|year= 1981

===Great Depression===
[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|210px|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen in Chicago, 1931|upright=1.15]]
Hunger as an academic and social topic came to prominence during the [[Great Depression]]. As many individuals struggled for food, the same agricultural industries were suddenly producing large surpluses as means of increased production to counter the drop in demand from the European markets. This increased output was meant to ease the growing debt levels, however domestic demand could not keep up with prices. Instead, what is often called "the paradox of want amid plenty," agricultural surpluses and large demand simply did not fit together, causing the Hoover administration to buy large amounts of product, such as grain, to stabilize prices. Initially refusing to further compromise the distressed price levels, political pressure from starving families across the country forced Congress to reconsider. With large deposits of grain already wasting away in government possession, the only political move left was to begin a process of donations to the hungry from the Farm Board, a federal oversight created in 1929 to promote the sale and stabilization of agricultural products. Instead of hunger being a reason for the allocation of large grain surpluses, waste became the eventual driving force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Janet Poppendieck | title = Eating Agendas | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-202-30508-0 | publisher=Aldine Transaction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===
[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mathew Ahmann in a crowd.) - NARA - 542015 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Martin Luther King]] (center), one of many twentieth century political figures who considered it important to fight hunger: "When I die, don't build a monument to me. Don't bestow me degrees from great universities. Just clothe the naked. Say that I tried to house the homeless. Let people say that I tried to feed the hungry." &lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;]]
After World War II, a new international politico-economic order came into being, which was later described as [[Embedded liberalism]].

For at least the first decade after the war, the United States, by far the period's most dominant national actor, was strongly supportive of efforts to tackle world hunger and to promote international development. It heavily funded the United Nation's development programmes, and later the efforts of other multilateral organizations like the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] (WB).&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"&gt;{{cite book |author = John R.

The newly established United Nations became a leading player in co-ordinating the global fight against hunger. The UN has three agencies that work to promote food security and agricultural development: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD). FAO is the world's agricultural knowledge agency, providing policy and technical assistance to developing countries to promote food security, nutrition and sustainable agricultural production, particularly in rural areas.

WFP's key mission is to deliver food into the hands of the hungry poor. The agency steps in during [[emergencies]] and uses food to aid recovery after emergencies. Its longer term approaches to hunger helps the transition from recovery to development. IFAD, with its knowledge of rural poverty and exclusive focus on poor rural people, designs and implements programmes to help those people access the assets, services and opportunities they need to overcome poverty.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

Following successful post WWII reconstruction of Germany and Japan, the IMF and WB began to turn their attention to the developing world. A great many [[NGO|civil society actors]] were also active in trying to combat hunger, especially after the late 1970s when global media began to bring the plight of starving people in places like [[Ethiopia]] to wider attention.  Most significant of all, especially in the late 1960s and 70s, the [[Green revolution]] helped improved agricultural technology propagate throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

The United States began to change its approach to the problem of world hunger from about the mid 1950s. Influential members of the administration became less enthusiastic about methods they saw as promoting an over reliance on the state, as they feared that might assist the spread of communism. Despite this view, during the 1960s postwar era hunger within the United States was overshadowed by hunger in Europe and Asia. John F. Kennedy did in fact use Executive Order to double the amount of commodities available from the surplus commodity program as well as initiated the pilot Food Stamp Program which later became permanent in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Donna|last2=Poppendieck|first2=Janet|title=Eating agendas : food and nutrition as social problems|date=1995|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|location=New York|isbn=9780202305073|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
By the 1980s, the previous consensus in favour of moderate government intervention had been [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displaced across the western world.]] The IMF and World Bank in particular began to promote market-based solutions. In cases where countries became dependent on the IMF, they sometimes forced national governments to prioritize debt repayments and sharply cut public services. This sometimes had a negative effect on efforts to combat hunger.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"/&gt;
[[File:Irrigation1.jpg|thumb|left|Increased use of irrigation played a major role in the [[Green Revolution]].]]
Organizations such as [[Food First]] raised the issue of [[food sovereignty]] and claimed that every country on earth (with the possible minor exceptions of some city-states) has sufficient agricultural capacity to feed its own people, but that the "[[free trade]]" economic order, which from the late 1970s to about 2008 had been associated with such institutions as the IMF and World Bank, had prevented this from happening.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The World Bank itself claimed it was part of the solution to hunger, asserting that the best way for countries to break the cycle of poverty and hunger was to build export-led economies that provide the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market. However, in the early 21st century the World Bank and IMF became less dogmatic about promoting [[free market]] reforms. They increasingly returned to the view that government intervention does have a role to play, and that it can be advisable for governments to support food security with policies favourable to domestic agriculture, even for countries that do not have a [[Comparative advantage]] in that area. As of 2012, the World Bank remains active in helping governments to intervene against hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/07/30/food-price-volatility-growing-concern-world-bank-stands-ready-respond|title=Food Price Volatility a Growing Concern, World Bank Stands Ready to Respond|publisher= [[World Bank]]|date=30 March 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until at least the 1980s—and, to an extent, the 1990s—the dominant academic view concerning world hunger was that it was a problem of demand exceeding supply. Proposed solutions often focused on boosting food production, and sometimes on birth control. There were exceptions to this, even as early as the 1940s, [[John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr|Lord Boyd-Orr]], the first head of the UN's FAO, had perceived hunger as largely a problem of distribution, and drew up comprehensive plans to correct this. Few agreed with him at the time, however, and he resigned after failing to secure support for his plans from the US and Great Britain. In 1998, [[Amartya Sen]] won a [[Nobel Prize]] in part for demonstrating that hunger in modern times is not typically the product of a lack of food. Rather, hunger usually arises from food distribution problems, or from governmental policies in the developed and developing world. It has since been broadly accepted that world hunger results from issues with the distribution as well as the production of food.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"&gt;[[Harry Magdoff#Death|Fred Magdoff]], [https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/twenty-first-century-land-grabs Twenty-First-Century Land Grabs - Accumulation by Agricultural Dispossession], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', 2013, Volume 65, Issue 06 (November)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"&gt;Rahul Goswami, [http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2012/goswami041212.html For Whom Do the FAO and Its Director-General Work?], ''[[Monthly Review|Monthly Review Magazine]]'', 2012.12.04&lt;/ref&gt;  Sen's 1981 essay ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' played a prominent part in forging the new consensus.&lt;ref name="foodAndFamine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= John Baylis, Steve Smith and Patricia Owens |author = Caroline Thomas and Tony Evans|title=The Globalization of World Politics|chapter = "Poverty, development and hunger"|year= 2010|isbn=978-0199569090 |publisher= [[Oxford University press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

In 2007 and 2008, rapidly increasing food prices caused a ''global food crisis'', increasing the numbers suffering from hunger by over a hundred million. [[Food riot]]s erupted in several dozen countries; in at least two cases, [[Haiti]] and [[Madagascar]], this led to the toppling of governments. A second ''global food crisis'' unfolded due to the spike in food prices of late 2010 and early 2011. Fewer food riots occurred, due in part to greater availability of food stock piles for relief. However, several analysts argue the food crisis was one of the causes of the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name="Politics of hunger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="G202012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"&gt;{{cite news|

As of 2008 roughly $300 million of aid went to basic nutrition each year, less than $2 for each child below two in the 20 worst affected countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In contrast, at that time [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]], which caused fewer deaths than child malnutrition, received $2.2 billion—$67 per person with HIV in all countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In 2008 UN estimated that ending world hunger could cost about 30 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/news/04iht-04food.13446176.html|title=UN says solving food crisis could cost $30 billion|first=Elisabeth Rosenthal and Andrew|last=Martin|date=2008-06-04|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]), a member of the [[CGIAR]] consortium, partners with farmers, governments, researchers and NGOs to help farmers grow nutritious crops, such as [[chickpea]], [[groundnut]], [[pigeonpea]], [[millet]] and [[sorghum]]. This helps their communities have more balanced diets and become more resilient to pests and drought. The Harnessing Opportunities for Productivity Enhancement of Sorghum and Millets in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian-Subcontinent (HOPE) project, for example, is increasing yields of [[eleusine coracana|finger millet]] in [[Tanzania]] by encouraging farmers to grow improved varieties. Finger millet is very high in calcium, rich in iron and fiber, and has a better energy content than other cereals. These characteristics make it ideal for feeding to infants and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Alina Paul Bossuet, ''Nourishing Communities Through Holistic Farming'' {{cite web|url=http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123923/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}.

Some organizations have begun working with teachers, policymakers, and managed food service contractors to mandate improved nutritional content and increased nutritional resources in school cafeterias from primary to university-level institutions. Health and nutrition have been proven to have close links with overall educational success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/wbro/11.1.23|jstor=3986477|title=The Impact of Health and Nutrition on Education|author=Jere R.

In the early 21st century, there was relatively little awareness of hunger from leaders of advanced nations such as those that form the [[G8]].&lt;ref name="G202012"/&gt; Prior to 2009, efforts to fight hunger were mainly undertaken by governments of the worst affected countries, by civil society actors, and by multilateral and regional organizations. In 2009, Pope Benedict published his third encyclical, [[Caritas in Veritate]], which emphasised the importance of fighting against hunger. The encyclical was intentionally published immediately before the [[35th G8 summit|July 2009 G8 Summit]] to maximise its influence on that event. At the Summit, which took place at [[L'Aquila]] in central Italy, the ''L'Aquila Food Security Initiative'' was launched, with a total of US$22 billion committed to combat hunger.&lt;ref&gt;

Food prices did fall sharply in 2009 and early 2010, though analysts credit this much more to farmers increasing production in response to the 2008 spike in prices, than to the fruits of enhanced government action. However, since the 2009 G8 summit, the fight against hunger has remained a high-profile issue among the leaders of the worlds major nations, and was a prominent part of the agenda for the [[2012 G-20 Mexico summit|2012 G-20 summit]].&lt;ref name="G202012"&gt;

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome - Copenhagen Consensus Center|website=www.copenhagenconsensus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in May 2012, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] launched a "new alliance for food security and nutrition"—a broad partnership between private sector, governmental and civil society actors—that aimed to "...achieve sustained and inclusive agricultural growth and raise 50 million people out of poverty over the next 10 years."&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"&gt;[http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2343978/uk_aid_is_financing_a_corporate_scramble_for_africa.html UK 'aid' is financing a corporate scramble for Africa], Miriam Ross, ''[[The Ecologist]]'', 2014.04.03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "2012G8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/globalfoodsecurity/190282.htm G8 Action on Food Security and Nutrition] 2012 statement hosted by the US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/18/remarks-president-symposium-global-agriculture-and-food-security Remarks by President concerning the launch of the ''new alliance for food security and nutrition'']&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's prime minister [[David Cameron]] held a [[2012 Olympic hunger summit|hunger summit]] on 12 August, the last day of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="2012G8"/&gt;

The fight against hunger has also been joined by an increased number of regular people. While folk throughout the world had long contributed to efforts to alleviate hunger in the developing world, there has recently been a rapid increase in the numbers involved in tackling domestic hunger even within the economically advanced nations of the [[Global North]].

This had happened much earlier in North America than it did in Europe. In the US, the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration scaled back welfare the early 1980s, leading to a vast increase of charity sector efforts to help Americans unable to buy enough to eat. According to a 1992 survey of 1000 randomly selected US voters, 77% of Americans had contributed to efforts to feed the hungry, either by volunteering for various hunger relief agencies such as [[food banks]] and [[soup kitchen]]s, or by donating cash or food.&lt;ref&gt;

Europe, with its more generous welfare system, had little awareness of domestic hunger until the food price inflation that began in late 2006, and especially as austerity-imposed welfare cuts began to take effect in 2010. Various surveys reported that upwards of 10% of Europe's population had begun to suffer from food insecurity. Especially since 2011, there has been a substantial increase in grass roots efforts to help the hungry by means of food banks, within both the UK and continental Europe.&lt;ref name = "modell"&gt;{{cite news  |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nqcbm |title= Britain's hidden hunger |publisher= [[BBC]] |author= [[David Model (journalist)|David Model]] |date = 30 October 2012 |accessdate= 4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

By July 2012, the [[2012 US drought]] had already caused a rapid increase in the price of grain and soy, with a knock on effect on the price of meat. As well as affecting hungry people in the US, this caused prices to rise on the global markets; the US is the world's biggest exporter of food. This led to much talk of a possible third 21st century global food crisis. The ''Financial Times'' reported that the [[BRICS]] may not be as badly affected as they were in the earlier crises of 2008 and 2011. However, smaller developing countries that must import a substantial portion of their food could be hard hit. The UN and [[G20]] has begun contingency planning so as to be ready to intervene if a third global crisis breaks out.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US drought"&gt;

As underweight children are more vulnerable to almost all infectious diseases, the ''indirect'' disease burden of malnutrition is estimated to be an order of magnitude higher than the disease burden of the ''direct'' effects of malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The combination of direct and indirect deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene ([[WASH]]) practices is estimated to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|''[[Migrant Mother]]'' by [[Dorothea Lange]] (1936).]]
Older sources sometimes claim this phenomenon is unique to developing countries, due to greater sexual inequality. More recent findings suggested that mothers often miss meals in advanced economies too. For example, a 2012 study undertaken by [[Netmums]] in the UK found that one in five mothers sometimes misses out on food to save their children from hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/food-and-hunger/555-million-women-go-hungry-worldwide

In several periods and regions, gender has also been an important factor determining whether or not victims of hunger would make suitable examples for generating enthusiasm for hunger relief efforts. James Vernon, in his ''Hunger: A Modern History'', wrote that in Britain before the 20th century, it was generally only women and children suffering from hunger who could arouse compassion. Men who failed to provide for themselves and their families were often regarded with contempt. This changed after [[World War I]], where thousands of men who had proved their manliness in combat found themselves unable to secure employment. Similarly, female gender could be advantageous for those wishing to advocate for hunger relief, with Vernon writing that being a woman helped [[Emily Hobhouse]] draw the plight of hungry people to wider attention during the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"/&gt;
[[File:Starved_girl.jpg|thumb|183x183px|Starved girl]]

Researchers from the Centre for World Food Studies in 2003 found that the gap between levels of undernutrition in men and women is generally small, but that the gap varies from region to region and from country to country.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; These small-scale studies showed that female undernutrition prevalence rates exceeded male undernutrition prevalence rates in South/Southeast Asia and Latin America and were lower in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Datasets for Ethiopia and Zimbabwe reported undernutrition rates between 1.5 and 2 times higher in men than in women; however, in India and Pakistan, datasets rates of undernutrition were 1.5-2 times higher in women than in men. Intra-country variation also occurs, with frequent high gaps between regional undernutrition rates.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nubé | first1 = M. | last2 = Van Den Boom | first2 = G.

Studies on nutrition concerning gender bias within households look at patterns of food allocation, and one study from 2003 suggested that women often receive a lower share of food requirements than men.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Gender discrimination, gender roles, and social norms affecting women can lead to early marriage and childbearing, close birth spacing, and undernutrition, all of which contribute to malnourished mothers.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh" /&gt;

Within the household, there may be differences in levels of malnutrition between men and women, and these differences have been shown to vary significantly from one region to another, with problem areas showing relative deprivation of women.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Samples of 1000 women in India in 2008 demonstrated that malnutrition in women is associated with poverty, lack of development and awareness, and illiteracy.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; The same study showed that gender discrimination in households can prevent a woman's access to sufficient food and healthcare.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; How socialization affects the health of women in Bangladesh, Najma Rivzi explains in an article about a research program on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Najma Rizvi |publisher=dandc.eu |title=Enduring misery |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/bangladesh-does-not-guarantee-food-security-demanded-its-constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as in parts of Kenya in 2006, rates of malnutrition in pregnant women were even higher than rates in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Rachel Bonham|title=Survey Reveals High Malnutrition Rates Among Pregnant Women in Kenya|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/kenya_33782.html|publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in some societies are traditionally given less food than men since men are perceived to have heavier workloads.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;  Household chores and agricultural tasks can in fact be very arduous and require additional energy and nutrients; however, physical activity, which largely determines energy requirements, is difficult to estimate.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Physiology====
Women have unique nutritional requirements, and in some cases need more nutrients than men; for example, women need twice as much calcium as men.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender and Nutrition 2001|url=https://www.uthfa.com/gender-nutrition-2001/|publisher=Food and Agriculture of the United Nations |accessdate=August 22, 2016|date=July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pregnancy and breastfeeding====
During pregnancy and breastfeeding, women must ingest enough nutrients for themselves and their child, so they need significantly more protein and calories during these periods, as well as more vitamins and minerals (especially iron, iodine, calcium, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, and K).&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; In 2001 the FAO of the UN reported that iron deficiency afflicted 43 percent of women in [[developing countries]] and increased the risk of death during childbirth.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; A 2008 review of interventions estimated that universal supplementation with calcium, iron, and folic acid during pregnancy could prevent 105,000 maternal deaths (23.6 percent of all maternal deaths).&lt;ref name="Bhutta 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhutta | first1 = Z.

Frequent pregnancies with short intervals between them and long periods of breastfeeding add an additional nutritional burden.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Educating children====
According to the FAO, women are often responsible for preparing food and have the chance to educate their children about beneficial food and health habits, giving mothers another chance to improve the nutrition of their children.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;

===Elderly===
[[File:Sea buckthorn seed oil gel.JPEG|thumb|right|[[Essential nutrient]]s are one of the main requirements of [[elderly care]].]]

The administration of drugs to whole populations irrespective of disease status is referred to as '''mass drug administration (MDA)'''.

This article describes the administration of [[antimalarial drugs]] to whole populations an intervention which has been used as a [[malaria]]-control measure for more than 70 years. Recent proposals to eliminate or even to eradicate [[malaria]] have led to a renewed interest in mass drug administrations in areas with very high malaria [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemicity]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Greenwood The use of anti-malarial drugs to prevent malaria in the population of malaria endemic areas; ''Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg.'' '''70(1)''', pp1&amp;ndash;7&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs have been administered either directly as a full therapeutic course of treatment or indirectly through the fortification of salt. Mass drug administrations were generally unsuccessful in interrupting transmission but, in some cases, had a marked effect on [[parasite]] prevalence and on the incidence of clinical malaria. MDAs are likely to encourage the spread of drug-resistant parasites and so have only a limited role in malaria control. They may have a part to play in the management of epidemics and in the control of malaria in areas with a very short transmission season. In order to reduce the risk of spreading drug resistance, MDAs should use more than one drug and, preferably include a drug, such as an [[artemisinin]], which has an effect on [[gametocytes]]. MDAs have low acceptance in areas with low malaria endemicity.

Another example of mass drug administration is [[mass deworming]] of children to remove [[Helminthiasis|helminth infections]] (intestinal worms).

==Background and history==
Reports of attempts to control malaria through mass treatment with antimalarial drugs date back to at least 1932.&lt;ref name="Barber1932"&gt;Barber, M. et al. (1932) Malaria studies on the Firestone rubber plantation in Liberia, West Africa. Am J Hyg 15 (3), 601n = 1 fallacy633&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, the WHO included mass drug administration (MDA) of antimalarial drugs as a tool for malaria eradication ‘in exceptional conditions when conventional control techniques have failed.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. (1951) Technical Report Series #38&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, the WHO expert committee on malaria still recommended MDA in special circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. (1971) Technical Report Series #467&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, MDA was linked to the emergence of [[drug resistance]] and its overall benefit was questioned.&lt;ref name="pmid1364857"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wernsdorfer WH |title=The biological and epidemiological basis of drug resistance in malaria parasites |journal=Southeast Asian J. Trop. Med. Public Health |volume=Suppl 4 |issue= |pages=123–9 |series=23 |date=September 1992 |pmid=1364857 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8525414"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Verdrager J |title=Localized permanent epidemics: the genesis of chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum |journal=Southeast Asian J.

Today (Regul. Ed.) |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=112–5 |date=April 1988 |pmid=15463062 |doi= 10.1016/0169-4758(88)90042-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concomitantly, the goal of [[malaria eradication]] was replaced by one of prevention of malaria morbidity and mortality through the provision of effective treatment. Considering the short lasing benefit of mass drug administration one modification has been to repeat mass drug administrations which has led to the development of [[intermittent preventive therapy]].

==Methods==
Two methods of MDA, direct and indirect, have been used. In direct MDA, also referred to as ‘Mass drug treatment’, a therapeutic dose of the antimalarial drug, usually in the form of tablets, is given to an entire population. In indirect MDA, the antimalarial drug is added to food stuff, usually salt.

===Direct drug administration===
The first, well documented use of direct MDA took place in a rubber plantation in [[Liberia]] in 1931.&lt;ref name="Barber1932"/&gt; Two doses of the 8-[[aminoquinoline]] [[plasmoquine]] were given weekly to workers and their families in two camps. The [[prevalence]]s of malaria parasite infections in humans and anopheline mosquitoes before and after treatment were studied. The authors concluded that ‘the fall in the [[mosquito]] infection rate of the two plasmoquine treated camps was so large as to indicate a local disappearance, or at least a great reduction, in [[gametocyte]] carriers in the treated population’. No long-term follow up data were provided for this study or most of the trials reported subsequently. The next documented use of MDA in sub-Saharan Africa took place in 1948 and 1949 in tea estates in Kericho, [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="pmid15414786"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dixon DS |title=Paludrine (proguanil) as a malarial prophylactic amongst African labour in Kenya |journal=East Afr Med J |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=127–30 |date=March 1950 |pmid=15414786 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten thousand inhabitants of the tea estates received twice weekly proguanil from April to July 1948. The intervention was supplemented with [[DDT]] spraying in March and June of the following year. Before the intervention the mean malaria incidence in July, the peak of the malaria transmission season, was 56 cases per 1000 population. Following the intervention 4 malaria cases were detected in July 1949. The author therefore recommended continuation of twice weekly [[proguanil]] prophylaxis on the estates.

Following the intervention the parasite prevalence dropped from 23% to 2.3%.  The author states that in a control area parasite prevalence rose over the same period  to over 50%. It was felt that the MDA was effective in curbing severe malaria epidemics. In the following three years, 1955 to 1957, pyrimethamine administration was replaced with [[Dieldrin]] spraying to consolidate malaria control, which makes an assessment of the long-term effect of this MDA impossible.

During a pilot programme in [[Uganda]] in 1959 mass administration of [[chloroquine]] / pyrimethamine was combined with spraying of residual insecticides (DDT).&lt;ref name="pmid13720940"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Zulueta J, Kafuko GW, Cullen JR, Pedersen CK |title=The results of the first year of a malaria eradication pilot project in Northern Kigezi (Uganda) |journal=East Afr Med J |volume=38 |issue= |pages=1–26 |date=January 1961 |pmid=13720940 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the pilot programme led to a larger study targeted at a population of 16,000.

After the MDA, the parasite prevalence in children decreased, but the overall parasite prevalence increased slightly, thus failing to deplete the [[reservoir]] of infection.&lt;ref name="pmid4434871"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dola SK |title=Mass drug administration as a supplementary attack measure in malaria eradication programme |journal=East Afr Med J |volume=51 |issue=7 |pages=529–31 |date=July 1974 |pmid=4434871 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two trials in Northern [[Nigeria]] combined multiple rounds of MDA and [[insecticide]] spraying. The first trial, in Kankiya, included 11 rounds of MDA combined with 8 rounds of DDT indoor spraying.&lt;ref&gt;Najera, J.A. et al.

(1967) The potential value of mass treatment in malaria eradication (WHO/MAL/67.615) WHO&lt;/ref&gt; Following MDAs, parasite prevalence dropped from 19% to&amp;nbsp;1%. The investigators did not consider this a success because parasite prevalence increased again after the interventions were stopped. Entomological indices also showed only a temporary reduction in transmission, which was completely reversed after the control measures ceased. Because the investigators felt that the failure of the trial to interrupt transmission was due to operational inadequacies, they recommended a much larger and more sophisticated evaluation of [[insecticide]] spraying combined with MDA. This recommendation helped to launch the Garki project, also in Northern Nigeria, in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Molineaux, L. and Gramiccia, G. (1980) The Garki Project. Research on the Epidemiology and Control of Malaria in the Sudan Savanna of West Africa., WHO&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Garki, Nigeria|Garki]] project, all 164 study villages in the catchment area were sprayed with [[propoxur]], a residual insecticide. In addition, in 60 villages, MDA with [[sulfalene]] / pyrimethamine was given at 10-week intervals for two years. In two small village clusters, house spraying was supplemented with [[larvicide]] and MDA every two weeks. With biweekly MDA, parasite prevalence fell to&amp;nbsp;1% in the dry season and to&amp;nbsp;5% in the rainy season. MDA given every 10 weeks resulted in a parasite prevalence of 2% in the dry season and 28% in the rainy season. Transmission was not interrupted with either MDA regime. The authors concluded that spraying of residual insecticides and MDA did not result in a sustainable interruption of malaria transmission.

In 1999 in [[The Gambia]] residents living in 33 of 42 villages in the catchment area received a single dose of [[sulfadoxine]] / pyrimethamine (SP) combined with artesunate while the residents of nine control villages received placebo.&lt;ref name="pmid14584381"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=von Seidlein L, Walraven G, Milligan PJ, etal |title=The effect of mass administration of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combined with artesunate on malaria incidence: a double-blind, community-randomized, placebo-controlled trial in The Gambia |journal=Trans.

Initially, during July and August, the mean malaria incidence rate in treated villages was significantly lower than in the control villages. In subsequent months, the incidence was slightly higher in the MDA villages. The difference between the two groups was '''not''' statistically significant. Overall no benefit of the mass drug administration was detected over the course of the malaria transmission season.

A mass drug administration campaign using S/P, [[artesunate]] and [[primaquine]] was completed in Moshi district, [[Tanzania]] in 2008. The findings have yet to be published.

Outside of sub-Saharan Africa one of the larger reported malaria-control projects using MDA took place in Nicaragua in 1981 following the overthrow of the [[Somoza]] regime.&lt;ref name="pmid6136655"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Garfield RM, Vermund SH |title=Changes in malaria incidence after mass drug administration in Nicaragua |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8348 |pages=500–3 |date=August 1983 |pmid=6136655 |doi= 10.1016/s0140-6736(83)90523-8|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 70% of Nicaragua’s total population (1.9 million people) received [[chloroquine]] and [[primaquine]] during the peak period of disease transmission (November).

In three malaria-control projects conducted in the Indian states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] in the early 1960s, MDA had an ancillary role and was mentioned only briefly in reports on these interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Lakshmanacharyulu, T. et al.

The incidence of malaria decreased so that, by the end of 1979, the authors considered the intervention to be a success. In 1980, in areas of [[Andhra Pradesh]] State in India, residual spraying was combined with a MDA.&lt;ref name="pmid3915307"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kondrashin AV, Sanyal MC |title=Mass drug administration in Andhra Pradesh in areas under Plasmodium falciparum containment programme |journal=J Commun Dis |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=293–9 |date=December 1985 |pmid=3915307 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of lowest malaria incidence a single dose of [[chloroquine]] plus [[primaquine]] was distributed to the whole population in eight villages. A second dose was given after an interval of 2&amp;ndash;3 months. This project failed to reduce malaria incidence and was considered to be a failure.

In 1984, MDA was added to the distribution of [[insecticide-impregnated bed]] nets ([[ITN]]s) in [[Sabah]] ([[Malaysia]]), but this failed to interrupt malaria transmission.&lt;ref name="pmid2979556"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hii JL, Vun YS, Chin KF, etal |title=The influence of permethrin-impregnated bednets and mass drug administration on the incidence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children in Sabah, Malaysia |journal=Med.

This MDA comprised 300&amp;nbsp;mg [[chloroquine]] base and 45&amp;nbsp;mg pyrimethamine weekly for nine weeks. An additional 300&amp;nbsp;mg [[chloroquine]] and 75&amp;nbsp;mg pyrimethamine plus 1500&amp;nbsp;mg [[sulfadoxine]] was added to this regimen in the first, fifth, and ninth week. Children received an adjusted equivalent of the adult dose. Follow-up consisted of yearly parasite surveillance. During the seven surveillance years following the MDA, no ''P.falciparum'' infections were detected.

MDA is included in the malaria-control policy of the People’s Republic of [[China]]. Following the first malaria-control phase from 1955 to 1962, which was mostly focused on malaria surveys, mass administrations were added to vector control measures and improved case management in 10 of China’s 33 provinces.&lt;ref name="pmid9653729"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yip K |title=Antimalarial work in China: a historical perspective |journal=Parassitologia |volume=40 |issue=1-2 |pages=29–38 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9653729 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drugs used in the administrations, mostly chloroquine and piperaquine, were provided free of charge by the central government. The economic reforms instituted by [[Deng Xiaoping]], which ultimately put an end to the provision of free health care through the central government and the emergence of resistance against the most widely used antimalarials modified the use of mass drug administrations after 1980. MDAs are now targeted at high-risk populations, specifically non-immune migratory workers who receive repeated courses during the high transmission season. According to government guidelines, [[piperaquine]], [[chloroquine]], or [[sulfadoxine]] combined with [[primaquine]] can be used for mass administrations.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry-of-Health.

Malaria burden and control measures are shown in Table 1. Between 1990 and 2000 the malaria prevalence dropped from 10.6 to 1.9 / 100,000, the number of reported malaria cases dropped from 117,359 to 24,088 while the number of reported deaths attributable to malaria remained stable.&lt;ref name="pmid14519583"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=von Seidlein L, Greenwood BM |title=Mass administrations of antimalarial drugs |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=452–60 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14519583 |doi= 10.1016/j.pt.2003.08.003|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These data, reported to the national government, depend on reporting from health care providers and like all data depending on passive surveillance tend to underestimate the true disease burden. However, there is no reason to think that the level of underreporting has changed over the last decade. Therefore, the proportional reduction in malaria disease burden is likely to be true. Malaria-control measures, including MDA, as well as major ecologic changes during the second half of the last century are likely to have been responsible for the more than 100-fold reduction in malaria burden in China since the initial surveys in 1955.&lt;ref name="pmid11775219"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tang L |title=Progress in malaria control in China |journal=Chin.

===Indirect MDA===
A different approach to MDA consists of adding an antimalarial to an essential foodstuff, usually salt. Chloroquinized salt for malaria suppression was introduced by Pinotti in 1952 and gave promising results in a number of field trials and malaria-control programmes in Brazil.&lt;ref name="pmid13089160"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pinotti M |title=[New method for the control of malaria by the use of drugs mixed with kitchen salt in daily diet.] |language=Portuguese |journal=Rev Bras Med |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=241–6 |date=April 1953 |pmid=13089160 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid13186255"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pinotti M |title=[New method of malaria prevention: combination of an antimalarial drug with table salt used daily in food.] |language=Portuguese |journal=Rev Bras Malariol Doencas Trop |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=5–12 |date=January 1954 |pmid=13186255 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18831147"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hochman G |title=From autonomy to partial alignment: national malaria programs in the time of global eradication, Brazil, 1941&amp;ndash;1961 |journal=Can Bull Med Hist |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=161–92 |year=2008 |pmid=18831147 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, the WHO conducted a trial in West New Guinea (later known as [[Irian Jaya]]).&lt;ref name="pmid14208125"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meuwissen JH |title=The use of medicated salt in an antimalaria campaign in West New Guinea |journal=Trop Geogr Med |volume=16 |issue= |pages=245–55 |date=September 1964 |pmid=14208125 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salt crystals were mixed with pyrimethamine so as to provide a 0.07% pyrimethamine salt. As there were no shops in the catchment area, each family unit received fortnightly a quantity of salt from the local teacher or another member of the village community. Within three and a half months of the onset of the campaign, clinically significant levels of [[pyrimethamine]] resistance were reported. It was then decided to mix the remaining stock of pyrimethaminized salt with [[chloroquine]] powder. The chloroquine base content was 0.04% or 140&amp;nbsp;mg per adult per week based on a 5g per day salt consumption. The emergence of [[chloroquine resistance]] was investigated, but this was not detected. The distribution of medicated salts otherwise had no effect and it was concluded that ''‘Pinotti’s method holds no prospect of malaria eradication…’''. The explanation for this finding given by the author is that ''‘the salt consumption by children was too small to reduce significantly the parasite reservoir of the younger age groups’''.

Between 1961 and 1965, the use of chloroquinized salt was made compulsory over an area of 109,000km2 in [[Guyana]], covering a population of 48,500 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Giglioli, G. (1967) Interruption of malaria transmission by chloroquinized salt in Guyana, with observations on a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Bull. WHO 36 (2), 283&amp;ndash;301.&lt;/ref&gt; The chloroquinized salt was prepared at a state salt plant so as to provide a 0.43% [[chloroquine]] concentration. The salt was sold in two pound plastic bags. The state held the monopoly for the salt. The only alternative source was salt smuggled from Brazil. Although the chloroquinized salt was used, its popularity was limited by the occurrence of a photo-allergic [[dermatitis]] popularly called ‘salt itch’ noted in all treatment areas. [[Chloroquine resistance]] was first observed in 1962 in the area with the lowest relative uptake of chloroquinized salt. In the course of the following months, a complete replacement of the susceptible strains with resistant ''P. falciparum'' strains was observed. Following the reintroduction of DDT spraying, the prevalence of ''P. falciparum'' declined.

In Southeast Asia, the medicated salt project at [[Pailin]], on the [[Kampuchea]]-[[Thailand|Thai]] border, demonstrated how drug resistance can develop when a large population of ''P. falciparum'' undergoing high transmission rates is exposed to intense drug pressure.&lt;ref name="pmid3526576"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Verdrager J |title=Epidemiology of emergence and spread of drug-resistant falciparum malaria in Southeast Asia |journal=Southeast Asian J.

Sea salt was mixed with [[pyrimethamine]] at a concentration of 0.05%. Between 1960 and 1961, 77 tons of medicated salt were distributed in the area. After widespread [[pyrimethamine resistance]] was reported, pyrimethamine was replaced by [[chloroquine]]. From 1961 to 1962, 75 tons of chloroquine were distributed.  In two indicator districts, the parasite rates decreased from 40% to 7% and from 27% to 14%.&lt;ref name="pmid14072437"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eyles DE, Hoo CC, Warren M, Sandosham AA |title=Plasmodium falciparum resistant to chloroquine in Cambodia |journal=Am.

The factors leading to the emergence and spread of drug resistance appear to have been the continuous introduction of non-immune migrants, attracted by the promise of quick wealth from mining of precious stones, and prolonged drug pressure resulting from individual drug consumption and mass drug administration. Unrelated to MDAs the emergence of artemisinin resistant ''P.falciparum'' strains was reported in [[Pailin]] in 2008, this may have been related to overuse of artemisinin derivateves including [[counterfeit drugs]] but was not related to programmatic MDAs.&lt;ref name="pmid16930257"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Denis MB, Tsuyuoka R, Poravuth Y, etal |title=Surveillance of the efficacy of artesunate and mefloquine combination for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Cambodia |journal=Trop.

Whether MDAs can be considered successful or not depends on the expectation of what they might achieve; many studies do not define whether their main aim was to interrupt transmission or to control disease. When MDAs were used as part of an attempt to interrupt transmission completely, they almost always failed. Only one project, conducted on [[Aneityum]], a small isolated island in the Pacific, succeeded in permanently interrupting transmission using MDA as one of several malaria-control strategies. However, although unable to interrupt transmission, many MDA projects led to a marked reduction in parasite prevalence and probably had a marked also transient effect on malaria-related [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. Most of the early trials used study designs which would now be considered inadequate to provide a definitive answer on study outcome. For example, before-and-after comparisons were used frequently. Such comparisons are especially unreliable for vector-borne diseases which may show marked variations in incidence from season to season as well as from year to year. Furthermore, in several studies only a single intervention and control area or group were compared despite the fact a single control group cannot provide statistically interpretable results (see [[n = 1 fallacy|''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 fallacy]]).

The deficiencies in the study designs mentioned above reflect the evolution of research methodology over the last 50 years. The evaluation of an intervention such as MDA is complicated by the fact that the effect of the intervention on transmission can only be measured at the community and not at the individual level. [[Trial method]]s which use a community, a village, or a cluster as unit of inference have taken longer to evolve than those used for [[individually randomized trial]]s. There are, with some notable exceptions, few properly designed and analysed [[cluster randomized trial]]s conducted by health care researchers prior to 1978. One major handicap for researchers who need to use the cluster approach, besides the need for a large sample size, is the need to use [[statistical methods]] that differ from the familiar methods used in individually randomized trials. Significant progress has been made in the development of statistical methods for the analysis of [[correlation|correlated data]].

==MDA and drug resistance==
The present unpopularity of MDA is not only due to doubts regarding the health benefit of this intervention but to the fear that MDAs will facilitate the spread of [[drug resistance]]. Concern that MDA would cause [[pyrimethamine]] and later [[chloroquine]] resistance was first raised in the early 1960s. Circumstantial evidence linked the use of [[medicated salts]] to the emergence of chloroquine resistance in the 1980s: Chloroquine resistance emerged first in three foci, namely [[South America]] ([[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Brazil]]), [[Southeast Asia]] ([[Thailand]]/[[Kampuchea]]), and [[Africa]] ([[Tanzania]]/[[Kenya]]). Payne has argued that the one common factor between these three epidemiologically diverse areas was widespread distribution of medicated salts prior to the emergence of chloroquine resistance.&lt;ref name="pmid15463062"/&gt;

In contrast to indirect MDA, emergence of drug resistance has not been linked to the administration of [[therapeutic doses]] of antimalarials through direct MDA programmes. The likely explanation lies in the different [[pharmacokinetic]] profiles that result from these two methods of drug administration. The administration of therapeutically dosed antimalarial drugs results in a single peak drug level which kills all susceptible strains. Only during the [[terminal half life]] of the drug when the concentration drops below the C&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[inhibitory concentration]] which kills the large majority of a parasite population, will new infections with more resistant strains have a [[survival advantage]]. Thus drugs with a very short terminal half-life, including [[artemisinin derivatives]], carry a lower risk of selecting resistant parasites than longer acting drugs. In contrast, the administration of medicated salts is likely to result in drug levels undulating in the sub-lethal range, which reach a [[steady state]] after several doses have been administered. The situation is worse if drugs such as [[chloroquine]] are used which accumulate progressively. This situation, a steady increase in drug concentration, is identical to the experimental design used for the in vitro induction of drug resistance.&lt;ref name="pmid8799803"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bhasin VK, Nair L |title=In vitro selection of Plasmodium falciparum lines resistant to dihydrofolate-reductase inhibitors and cross resistance studies |journal=Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |date=February 1996 |pmid=8799803 |doi= 10.7883/yoken1952.49.1|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medicated salt projects can be considered as large scale ''in vivo'' experiments designed to select resistant parasites.

==MDA and drug toxicity==
The administration of antimalarials to large numbers of individuals with little or no preliminary screening could result in significant [[toxicity]] as nearly all antimalarials in common use can occasionally cause serious adverse events. For example, the widespread use of 8-aminoquinolines in areas where [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] is common carries the risk of precipitating episodes of [[haemolysis]]. Few MDA projects have reported specifically on adverse events. No life-threatening outcomes have been reported as a result of an MDA but a rare serious adverse event such as a blood dyscrasia would probably not have been detected without active surveillance for adverse events which was not reported in any of the studies. There is a theoretical risk that administration of antimalarial drugs during the course of MDAs to women in the first trimester of pregnancy, some of whom may not know that they are pregnant, could lead to foetal abnormalities. The benefit of malaria control has to be weighed against potential problems. Hence MDA is likely to be only used in areas with very high malaria endemicity.

==Public health initiatives for humans==
At the 1990 [[World Summit for Children]], the gathered nations identified deficiencies in two microminerals and one micronutrient – iodine, iron, and [[Vitamin A deficiency|vitamin A]] – as being particularly common and posing public health risks in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, The State of the World’s Children 1998: Fact Sheet. http://www.unicef.org/sowc98/fs03.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Summit set goals for elimination of these deficiencies. The Ottawa-based [[Micronutrient Initiative]] was formed in response to this challenge with the mission to undertake research and fund and implement micronutrient programming.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF Canada, Global Child Survival and Health: A 50-year progress report from UNICEF Canada, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

As programming around these micronutrients grew, new research in the 1990s led to the implementation of [[Folic acid|folate]] and zinc supplementation programmes as well.

Priority programs include supplementation with vitamin A for children 6–59 months, zinc supplementation as a treatment for diarrhoeal disease, iron and folate supplementation for women of child-bearing age, [[salt iodization]], [[staple food]] fortification, multiple micronutrient powders, biofortification of crops and behaviour-centred nutrition education.

===Salt iodization===
[[Salt iodization]] is the recommended strategy for ensuring adequate human iodine intake. To iodize salt, [[potassium iodate]] is added to salt after it is refined and dried and before it is packed. Although large-scale iodization is most efficient, given the proliferation of small scale salt producers in developing countries, technology for small-scale iodization has also been developed. International organizations work with national governments to identify and support small salt producers in adopting iodization activity.

In 1990, less than 20 percent of households in developing countries were consuming iodized salt.&lt;ref name="FlourFortification"&gt;Flour Fortification Initiative, GAIN, Micronutrient Initiative, USAID, The [[World Bank]], UNICEF, Investing in the future: a united call to action on vitamin and mineral deficiencies, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1994, international partnerships had formed in a global campaign for Universal Salt Iodization. By 2008, it was estimated that 72 per cent of households in developing countries were consuming iodized salt&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, The State of the World’s Children 2010, Statistical Tables, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of countries in which iodine deficiency disorders were a public health concern reduced by more than half from 110 to 47 countries.&lt;ref name="FlourFortification" /&gt;

===Vitamin A supplementation===
In 1997, national [[vitamin A]] supplementation programming received a boost when experts met to discuss rapid scale-up of supplementation activity and the Micronutrient Initiative, with support from the Government of Canada, began to ensure [[vitamin A]] supply to [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, Vitamin A Supplementation: a decade of progress, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas with [[vitamin A]] deficiency, it is recommended that children aged 6–59 months receive two doses annually. In many countries, [[vitamin A]] supplementation is combined with immunization and campaign-style health events.

Global [[vitamin A]] supplementation efforts have targeted 103 priority countries. In 1999, 16 per cent of children in these countries received two annual doses of [[vitamin A]]. By 2007, the rate increased to 62 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;Flour Fortification Initiative, GAIN, Micronutrient Initiative, [[USAID]], The World Bank, UNICEF, Investing in the future: a united call to action on vitamin and mineral deficiencies, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Micronutrient Initiative, with funding from the Government of Canada, supplies 75 per cent of the [[vitamin A]] required for supplementation in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Micronutrient Initiative, Annual Report 2009-2010, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double-fortified salt===
Double-fortified salt (DFS) is a public health tool for delivering nutritional iron. DFS is fortified with both iodine and iron. It was developed by Venkatesh Mannar, Executive Director of the [[Micronutrient Initiative]] and [[University of Toronto]] Professor Levente Diosady, who discovered a process for coating iron particles with a vegetable fat to prevent the negative interaction of iodine and iron.&lt;ref&gt;L.L. Diosady and M.G. Venkatesh Mannar, Double Fortification Of Salt With Iron And Iodine, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, Tata Salt Plus, priced at an economical rate of Rs 20 per kg, is an iodine plus iron fortified salt, developed by the [[National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad]] through double fortification technology. This technology was offered to [[Tata Chemicals]] under a long-term [[Memorandum of understanding|MoU]] after due studies on bio-availability across the population strata conducted and published by NIN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tata.com/media/releases/inside.aspx?artid=rBRDxbNl5eM= Tata group | Tata Chemicals | Media releases | India’s first iodine plus iron fortified salt launched by Tata Chemicals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first used in public programming in 2004. In September 2010 DFS was produced in the Indian State of [[Tamil Nadu]] and distributed through a state school feeding program. DFS has also been used to combat Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA) in the Indian state of [[Bihar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/evaluating-impact-anemia-making-double-fortified-salt-available-bihar-india Evaluating the Impact on Anemia of Making Double Fortified Salt Available in Bihar, India | The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, Venkatesh Mannar was named a Laureat of the California-based Tech Awards for his work in developing Double-Fortified Salt.

===Micro-enriched fertilization===
The returns of applying micronutrient-enriched fertilizers could be huge for human health, social and economic development. Research has shown that enriching fertilizers with micronutrients had not only an impact on plant deficiencies but also on humans and animals, through the food chain. A 1994 report by the World Bank estimated that micronutrient malnutrition costs developing economies at least 5 percent of gross domestic product.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank (1994). ''Enriching Lives: Overcoming Vitamin and Mineral Malnutrition in Developing Countries''. Development in Practice Series.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Asian Development Bank]] has summarized the benefits of eliminating [[micronutrient deficiencies]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Along with a growing understanding of the extent and impact of micronutrient malnutrition, several interventions have demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of correction and prevention. Distributing inexpensive capsules, diversifying to include more micronutrient-rich foods, or fortifying commonly consumed foods can make an enormous difference. Correcting iodine, vitamin A, and iron deficiencies can improve the population-wide intelligence quotient by 10-15 points, reduce maternal deaths by one fourth, decrease infant and child mortality by 40 percent, and increase people’s work capacity by almost half. The elimination of these deficiencies will reduce health care and education costs, improve work capacity and productivity, and accelerate equitable economic
growth and national development. Improved nutrition is essential to sustained economic growth. Micronutrient deficiency elimination is as cost effective as the best public health interventions and fortification is the most cost-effective strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Development Bank (October 2000). [www.adb.org/Documents/TARs/REG/tar_oth34014.pdf Regional Initiative to Eliminate Micronutrient Malnutrition in Asia Through Public-Private Partnership]. TAR: OTH 34014. Retrieved on: 2011-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Addressing zinc deficiencies through zinc fertilization===
Experiments show that soil and [[Foliar feeding|foliar]] application of zinc fertilizer can effectively reduce the [[Phytic acid#Food science|phytate]] zinc ratio in grain. People who eat bread prepared from zinc enriched wheat show a significant increase in serum zinc, suggesting that the zinc fertilizer strategy is a promising approach to address [[Zinc deficiency|zinc deficiencies]] in humans.

Where [[Zinc deficiency (plant disorder)|zinc deficiency]] is a [[limiting factor]], zinc fertilization can increase crop yields. Balanced crop nutrition supplying all essential nutrients, including zinc, is a cost effective management strategy. Even with zinc-efficient varieties, zinc fertilizers are needed when the available zinc in the topsoil becomes depleted.

==Micronutrients for plants==
{{Main|Plant nutrition}}
There are about seven nutrients essential to plant growth and health that are only needed in very small quantities. Though these are present in only small quantities, they are all necessary:

*[[Boron]] is believed to be involved in carbohydrate transport in plants; it also assists in metabolic regulation. Boron deficiency will often result in bud dieback.
*[[Chlorine]] is necessary for [[osmosis]] and ionic balance; it also plays a role in [[photosynthesis]].
*[[Copper]] is a component of some enzymes. Symptoms of copper deficiency include browning of leaf tips and chlorosis.
*[[Iron]] is essential for chlorophyll synthesis, which is why an iron deficiency results in [[chlorosis]].
*[[Manganese]] activates some important enzymes involved in [[chlorophyll]] formation. Manganese deficient plants will develop [[chlorosis]] between the veins of its leaves. The availability of manganese is partially dependent on soil pH.
*[[Molybdenum]] is essential to plant health. Molybdenum is used by plants to reduce nitrates into usable forms. Some plants use it for nitrogen fixation, thus it may need to be added to some soils before seeding legumes.
*[[Zinc]]  participates in chlorophyll formation, and also activates many enzymes. Symptoms of [[Zinc deficiency (plant disorder)|zinc deficiency]] include chlorosis and stunted growth.

===Crop biofortification===
[[Micronutrient deficiencies]] are widespread.&lt;ref name=anyas17/&gt; 51% of world cereal soils are deficient in [[zinc]] and 30% of cultivated soils globally are deficient in [[iron]]. Steady growth of crop yields during recent decades (in particular through the [[Green Revolution]]) compounded the problem by progressively depleting soil micronutrient pools.

In general, farmers only apply micronutrients when crops show deficiency symptoms, while micronutrient deficiencies decrease yields before symptoms appear. Some common farming practices (such as liming acid soils) contribute to widespread occurrence of micronutrient deficiencies in crops by decreasing the availability of the micronutrients present in the soil. 

[[Biofortification]] of crop plants &amp;ndash; improvement of vitamin and mineral levels through [[plant biotechnology]] &amp;ndash; is being used in many world regions to address micronutrient deficiencies in regions of poverty and malnutrition.&lt;ref name=anyas17/&gt;

The '''world's most livable cities''' is an informal name given to any [[list of cities]] as they rank on an annual survey of [[standard of living|living conditions]]. Regions with cities commonly ranked in the top 50 include the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Western Europe]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="MercerSurvey2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=2015 quality of living survey | work=Mercer | date=4 March 2015 |url=http://www.uk.mercer.com/newsroom/2015-quality-of-living-survey.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three examples of such surveys are [[Monocle (lifestyle magazine)|Monocle]]'s "Most Liveable Cities Index", the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s "Global Liveability Ranking", and "[[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] Quality of Living Survey". Numbeo has the largest statistics and survey data based on cities and countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/ Numbeo official website]&lt;/ref&gt; Livability rankings may be used by employers assigning hardship allowances as part of job relocation.

==The EIU's Global Liveability Ranking==
[[File:Façade nord château Schönbrunn Vienna.jpg|alt=|thumb|300x300px|Vienna tops the Economist Intelligence Unit Ranking in 2018, replacing Melbourne which held top rank from 2011-2017]]
{{main article|Global Liveability Ranking}}

The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s (EIU) publishes an annual Global Liveability Ranking, which ranks 140 cities for their urban [[quality of life]] based on assessments of their stability, [[healthcare]], culture and environment, [[education]] and [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eiu.com/topic/liveability|title=Global Liveability Ranking 2016|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melbourne]], Australia, had been ranked by the EIU as the world's most livable city for seven years in a row, from 2011 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-16/melbourne-named-worlds-most-liveable-city-for-seventh-year/8812196|title=World's most liveable city: Melbourne takes top spot for seventh year running|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=16 August 2017|author=Stephanie Chalkley-Rhoden|access-date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2004 and 2010, [[Vancouver]], Canada, was ranked the EIU's most livable city, with Melbourne sharing first place in the inaugural 2002 report. Vancouver has ranked third since 2015, while [[Vienna]], Austria, ranked second until 2018 when it ranked first.

The Syrian capital, [[Damascus]], was ranked the least livable city of the 140 assessed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A summary of the liveability ranking and overview|last=Economist Intelligence Unit|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mercer's Quality of Living Ranking==
[[Image:Rathaus Vienna Eistraum 2005 Nightshot.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Vienna]] has been top ranked by the [[Mercer Quality of Living Survey]] since 2009]]
{{main article|Mercer Quality of Living Survey}}

American global [[human resources]] and related [[financial services]] consulting firm [[Mercer Human Resource Consulting|Mercer]] annually releases its [[Mercer Quality of Living Survey]], comparing 221 cities based on 39 criteria. New York City is given a baseline score of 100 and other cities are rated in comparison. Important criteria are [[safety]], [[education]], [[hygiene]], [[health care]], [[culture]], [[Natural environment|environment]], [[recreation]], political-economic stability, [[public transport]] and access to goods and services. The list is intended to help [[multinational companies]] decide where to open offices or plants, and how much to pay employees. For nine consecutive years (2009–2017), Mercer ranked [[Austria]]'s capital [[Vienna]] first in its annual "Quality of Living" survey, a title the city still held in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monocle|title=Quality of Live Survey 2015|url=http://monocle.com/film/affairs/the-monocle-quality-of-life-survey-2015/|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=24 June 2015}}[[Monocle (2007 magazine)|Monocle's]] 2012 "Quality of Life Survey" ranked Vienna fourth on a list of the top 25 cities in the world "to make a base within" (up from sixth in 2011 and eighth in 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality of Life Survey 2012|url=http://www.monocle.com/sections/affairs/Web-Articles/The-Monocle-Quality-of-Life-Survey-2012/|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monocle's top 25 cities for 2011, on businessinsider.com|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/monocle-quality-of-life-2011-6?op=1|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monocle's 2011 "Quality of LIfe" summary|url=http://www.monocle.com/sections/affairs/Web-Articles/Most-liveable-city-Helsinki/|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monocle.com/sections/affairs/Magazine-Articles/08-Vienna/ |title=08 Vienna |publisher=Monocle.com |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stadtbild_München.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Munich]] was ranked highest by ''[[Monocle (lifestyle magazine)|Monocle]]'' in 2018]]

Since 2006, the lifestyle magazine ''[[Monocle (lifestyle magazine)|Monocle]]'' has published an annual list of livable cities. The list in 2008 was named "The Most Liveable Cities Index" and presented 25 top locations for [[quality of life]].

Important criteria in this survey are safety/crime, international connectivity, climate/sunshine, quality of architecture, public transport, tolerance, environmental issues and access to nature, urban design, business conditions, pro-active policy developments and medical care.

The 2018 Monocle Survey determined the world's most livable city was [[Munich]], followed by [[Tokyo]], [[Vienna]] and [[Zurich]]. A total of four [[German cities]] were on the list of the 25 most livable cities, 15 out of the 25 were [[Europe|European]], 3 each from [[Japan]] and [[Australia]], and one from [[North America]] ([[Vancouver]]). No cities from [[South America]], [[South Asia]], or [[Africa]] made it into the list.&lt;ref&gt;[[Forbes|forbes.com]] [https://www.forbes.com/sites/bishopjordan/2018/06/25/monocle-most-livable-city-quality-life-survey-2018-munich/#35c5a3bd6153 Munich Named The Most Livable City In The World] Published: 25 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Farm Safety &amp; Health Week''' is a week of commemoration, recognized annually on the third week of September in the United States.

==Origins==
In 1944, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed the first proclamation for [[Agricultural safety and health|farm safety]] due to the high injury rate in agriculture. Agriculture is one of the most hazardous industries with a death rate of 23.2 deaths per 100,000 workers annually according to U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="extension"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.extension.iastate.edu/article/farm-safety-and-health-week-sept-20-26|title=Farm Safety and Health Week Is Sept. 20-26 {{!}} Iowa State University Extension and Outreach|website=www.extension.iastate.edu|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many injuries are preventable through education. Serious injuries and death can be prevented by cautiously approaching field adjustments or repairs, taking precautions to avoid slips and falls, making smart decisions while assigning tasks to youth, using and maintaining the slow moving vehicle emblem correctly, and retrofitting tractors with rollover structures.&lt;ref name="extension" /&gt;

==History==
In September 2015, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] gave an official proclamation to accentuate the importance of agriculture for our society and economy as well as affirm farm safety and health programs 
"America's farmers and ranchers have played a critical role in shaping our progress and forging a better future for coming generations. Through centuries of hard work, they have supplied our Nation with products and services essential to the economic and physical well-being of our society.
"Across our country, those who work on farms bolster our economy and nourish our people by providing what we need at a most human level, helping to uphold America's founding creed: Out of many, we are one. This week, let us recognize the steadfast dedication and commitment of agricultural producers and their families, and let us reaffirm our resolve to promote their health and safety."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/21/presidential-proclamation-national-farm-safety-and-health-week-2015|title=Presidential Proclamation -- National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2015|date=2015-09-18|newspaper=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the development and dissemination of National Farm Safety &amp; Health Week materials shifted from the [[National Safety Council]] to National Education Center for Ag Safety (NECAS). NECAS is the agricultural partner for the [[National Safety Council]] and has been serving the agricultural family and business community since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agsafety.osu.edu/newsletter/ag-safety-stat/september-2015/announcements/national-farm-safety-and-health-week|title=National Farm Safety and Health Week {{!}} Agricultural Safety &amp; Health Program|website=agsafety.osu.edu|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year they provide farmers with programs and materials to promote farmer safety and health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.necasag.org/aboutnecas/nationalfarmsafetyandhealthweek2016/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Online doctor''' is a term that emerged during the 2000s, used by both the media &lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/health/healthcare/doctorsnurses/2010-11-19-1Ateledoc19_ST_N.htm Are online doctors the best medicine?], ''USA Today'', 20 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and academics, to describe a generation of [[physicians]] and health practitioners who deliver healthcare, including drug prescription, over the internet.

==Emergence of online doctoring==
In the 2000s, many people came to treat the internet as a first, or at least a major, source of information and communication. Health advice is now the second-most popular topic, after pornography, that people search for on the internet.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/jun/04/life1.lifemagazine6?INTCMP=SRCH House call - No appointments, no waiting, speedy diagnosis and prescription - online doctors are flourishing. But are they safe?], ''The Guardian'', 4 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of [[broadband]] and [[videoconferencing]], many individuals have turned to online doctors to receive online consultations and purchase prescription drugs. Use of this technology has many advantages for both the doctor and the patient, including cost savings, convenience, accessibility, and improved privacy and communication.

In the US, a 2006 study found that searching for information on prescription or over-the-counter drugs was the fifth most popular search topic, and a 2004 study found that 4% of Americans had purchased prescription medications online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2006/PIP_Online_Health_2006.pdf.pdf Online health search] S. Fox, 2006. [http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2004/PIP_Prescription_Drugs_Online.pdf.pdf, Prescription drugs online] S. Fox, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 survey conducted by Geneva-based [[Health On the Net Foundation]] found one-in-ten Europeans buys medicines from websites and one-third claim to use online consultation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20585/ Online Patient Safety Climate Survey: Tool Development and Lessons Learned], Lynne M. Connelly and Judy L. Powers, ''U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health''&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, approximately seven million people buy from mail-order pharmacies, and mail-order sales account for approximately 8–10% of total pharmaceutical sales.&lt;ref&gt;Mail-order trade in medicines in Europe: a guide for legislators to protect consumers, NJ Seeberg-Elverfeldt ''[[European Journal of Health Law]]'' 16: 351–66, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain reported that approximately two million people in Great Britain were regularly purchasing pharmaceuticals online (both with a prescription from registered online UK doctors and without prescriptions from other websites).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rpsgb.org/pdfs/pr080110.pdf Millions risk health buying drugs online] ''Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A recent survey commissioned by [[Pfizer]], the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]], [[RPSGB]], the [[Patients Association]] and [[HEART UK]] found that 15% of the British adults asked had bought a prescription-only medicine online.&lt;ref name="RPSGB"&gt;[http://www.rpsgb.org/pdfs/pr091103.pdf Get Real, Get a Prescription’ campaign] ''Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In developed countries, many online doctors prescribe so-called ‘lifestyle drugs’,&lt;ref&gt;Medicalisation: The role of e-pharmacies in iatrogenic harm, N. Glover-Thomas and J. Fanning, ''Medical Law Review'' 18(1): 28–55, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; such as for weight loss, hair loss or erectile dysfunction. The RPSGB has identified the most popular products prescribed online as [[Prozac]] (an antidepressant), [[Viagra]] (for erectile dysfunction), [[Valium]] (a tranquiliser), [[Ritalin]] (a psychostimulant), [[Serostim]] (a synthetic growth hormone) and [[Provigil]] (a psychostimulant).&lt;ref&gt;RPSGB p.12&lt;/ref&gt; A study in the USA has also shown that antibiotics are commonly available online without prescription.&lt;ref&gt;Availability of antibiotics for purchase without a prescription on the internet, AG Mainous, CJ Everett, RE Post, VA Diaz and WJ Hueston, ''Annals of Family Medicine'' 7(5): 431–5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential harm==
Traditionalist critics of online doctors argue that an online doctor cannot provide proper examinations or diagnosis either by email or video call.&lt;ref&gt;[http://specials.ft.com/lifeonthenet/FT3FFJPZLCC.html Consulting Online] ''Financial Times'', 1 September 2000
&lt;/ref&gt; Such consultations, they argue, will always be dangerous, with the potential for serious disease to be missed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/health/healthcare/doctorsnurses/2010-11-19-1Ateledoc19_ST_N.htm Are Online Doctors The Best Medicine?], ''USA Today'' quoting Roland Goertz of the American Academy of Family Physicians, 20 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; There are also concerns that the absence of proximity leads to treatment by unqualified doctors &lt;ref&gt;USA Today&lt;/ref&gt; or patients using false information to secure dangerous drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/feb/13/health.medicineandhealth?INTCMP=SRCH Online doctor put patients at risk, hearing told] ''The Guardian'', 3 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents argue there is little difference between an e-mail consultation and the sort of telephone assessment and advice that doctors regularly make out of hours or in circumstances where doctors cannot physically examine a patient (e.g., jungle medicine).&lt;ref name="The Times"&gt;[http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/general-coffeehouse-chat-514/news-current-affairs-topical-discussion-12/628933-doctor-will-see-you-now-over-internet.html The doctor will see you now . . . over the internet]''The Times'' quoting Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS Medical Director, 29 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurence Buckman, chairman of the [[British Medical Association]]’s GPs’ committee, says that online consultations make life easier for doctors and patients when used properly. "Many GPs will be very happy with it and it could be useful. When it’s a regular patient you know well, it follows on from telephone consulting. Voice is essential, vision is desirable. The problem comes when I don’t know the patient".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Times&lt;/ref&gt;
Niall Dickson, chief executive of the [[General Medical Council]], says: "We trust doctors to use their judgement to decide whether they should see a patient in person. Online consultations will be appropriate for some patients, whereas other patients will need a physical examination or may benefit from seeing their doctor in person".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Past and future developments==
The first medical consulting website in the US was [[WebMD]],&lt;ref name="History of WebMD"&gt;[//www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/WebMD-Corporation-company-History.html Corporate History] History of WebMD&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1996 by [[James H. Clark|Jim Clark]] (one of the founders of [[Netscape]]) and [[Pavan Nigam]] as [[Healthscape]]. Currently, its website carries information regarding health and health care, including a symptom checklist, pharmacy information, drug information, blogs of physicians with specific topics, and a place to store personal medical information. As of February 2011, WebMD’s network of sites reaches an average of 86.4 million visitors per month&lt;ref&gt;History of WebMD&lt;/ref&gt; and is the leading health portal in the United States.&lt;ref name="comScore Media Metrix"&gt;[http://www.sramanamitra.com/2007/08/21/web-30-online-health-part-2/ comScore Media Metrix rating] ''Web 3.0 &amp; Online Health'', comScore Media Metrix rating 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Other popular US healthcare and medical consulting sites include [[NIH.gov]], [[MSN Health]], [[Doctorspring]], [[MdLive]], [[Justdoc]], [[Yahoo! Health]], [[EverydayHealth]], [[WomensHealth.gov]], [[MayoClinic]], [[Doctor Vista]], and many have experienced dramatic growth. ([[Healthline]], launched in 2005, grew by 269% to 2.7 million average monthly unique visitors in Q1 2007 from 0.8 million average monthly unique visitors in Q1 2006).&lt;ref&gt;comScore Media Metrix&lt;/ref&gt; Niche consulting sites are also popular including [[SeniorNet]], which deals with age-related syndromes and [[4collegewomen.org]] and [[GirlsHealth.gov]], which target young women. Several American online doctor companies, including Sherpaa, MDlive, [[Teladoc]], First Stop Health, American Well, WebDoc247, MeMD, and Ringadoc, provide consultations with doctors over the phone or the Internet. Prominent [[San Francisco]]-based venture capital firm [[Founders Fund]] called such services "extraordinarily fast" and predicted that they will "bring relief to thousands of people with immediate medical needs".&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/07/ringadoc-virtually-connects-you-with-a-doctor-anytime-raises-750k-seed-from-founders-funds-ff-angel/] ''TechCrunch'', retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, [[e-med]] was the first online health site to offer both a diagnosis and prescriptions to patients over the Internet. It was established in March 2000 by Dr. [[Jules Eden|Julian Eden]],&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/841031.stm GP treats patients 'over the internet'] ''BBC'',23 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[DrThom]] claimed to have 100,000 patients visit their site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/2010-08-07-british-online-doctors_N.htm British websites are pushing boundaries of online medicine] 'USA Today', 8 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; NHS Direct (currently [http://www.nhs.uk/pages/home.aspx NHS Choices]) is the free health advice and information service provided by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) for residents and visitors in the UK, with advice offered 24 hours a day via telephone and web contact. Over 1.5 million patients visit the website every month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/About/History?name=HistoryOfNHSDirect History of NHS Direct] ''NHS Direct'', retrieved 14 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a number of online doctors have emerged in the country, firms such as Now Healthcare Group, [[Dr Fox Pharmacy]], [[Push Doctor]] and [[Lloyds Pharmacy]] offer consultation and prescriptions via the Internet.

In Australia [[HealthDirect]] is the free health advice and information service provided by the government with advice offered 24 hours a day via telephone. [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] began funding online consultations for specialists on 1 July 2011 which has seen a slow but steady increase in volumes.

New advances in digital information technology mean that in future online doctors and healthcare websites may offer advanced scanning and diagnostic services over the internet. The [[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]] identifies such services as direct-to-consumer body imaging (such as CT and MRI scans) and personal genetic profiling for individual susceptibility to disease.&lt;ref&gt;Nuffield p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Sir [[Bruce Keogh]], the medical director of the UK NHS, is drawing up plans to introduce online consultations via Skype and has said IT will "completely change the way [doctors] deliver medicine". This concept is gaining more importance and there are some companies who started cashing on it, few companies like [[ZocDoc|Zocdoc]] or [[Ziffi.com|Ziffi]] have started providing online doctor booking service.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

One author describes the syndromes of chronic testicular pain thus:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The complaint is of a squeezing deep ache in the testis like the day after you got kicked there, often bilateral or alternating from one side to the other, intermittent, and, most commonly, associated with lower back pain.  Sometimes it feels like the testicle is pinched in the crotch of the underwear but trouser readjustment does not help.  There may also be pain in the [[Inguinal canal|inguinal]] area but no nausea or other symptoms.  Back pain may be concurrent or absent and some patients have a long history of low back pain.  Onset of pain is commonly related to activity that would stress the low back such as lifting heavy objects.  Other stresses that might cause low back pain are imaginative coital positions, jogging, sitting hunched over a computer, long car driving, or other such positions of unsupported seating posture that flattens the normal lumbar [[lordosis]] curve."&lt;ref name=baran&gt;{{Cite book

The '''Oxford Brookes Centre for Nutrition and Health''' is the first research centre in the [[United Kingdom]] dedicated to researching [[functional food]]s.&lt;ref name="nextgenerationfood.com"/&gt;

==History==
The Oxford Brookes Centre for Nutrition and Health opened as the Functional Food Centre at [[Oxford Brookes University]] in early 2009 with a £300,000 grant from the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/healthyeating/5082444/Debunking-food-myths-the-launch-of-the-Functional-Food-Centre.html|title=Debunking food myths: the launch of the Functional Food Centre|author=Rose Prince|date=1 April 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxfordtimes/&gt; It was formerly known as the Nutrition and Food Research Group, which had been in existence since 1984.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.shs.brookes.ac.uk/research/functional-food/about|website=Functional Food Center|publisher=Oxford Brookes University|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founding director, Jeya Henry, is a consultant to the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]] and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations]] on nutrition assessment, food safety and nutrient requirements.&lt;ref name="nextgenerationfood.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nextgenerationfood.com/article/The-best-remedy/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714175414/http://www.nextgenerationfood.com/article/The-best-remedy/|archive-date=14 July 2011 |title=The best remedy|first=Stacey |last=Sheppard|newspaper=Next Generation Food|publisher=GDS Publishing |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Oxford Brookes academic to help set world guidelines on fat consumption |url=https://www.brookes.ac.uk/about-brookes/news/oxford-brookes-academic-to-help-set-world-guidelines-on-fat-consumption/ |location= |publisher=Oxford Brookes University |agency= |date=8 September 2008 |access-date=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre offers research and consultancy services to the food industry, the United Nations and various Government agencies.&lt;ref name=oxfordtimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/features/4205987.Tackling_diseases_of_affluence/|title=Tackling diseases of affluence|author=Reg Little|newspaper=The Oxford Times|date=18 March 2009|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of research==
The Oxford Brookes Centre for Nutrition and Health has the goal of providing scientific information about food and health to consumers, government and the food industry.&lt;ref name=oxfordtimes/&gt; It tests popular claims about food, for example that [[genetically modified crops]] will feed the world, that substances such as [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] in [[fish oil]] will make children more intelligent, or that [[antioxidant]]s can reduce cancer by removing [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; It develops new food products  such as low [[glycemic index]] bread, which reduces [[cholesterol]] and [[blood sugar]] levels and help weight loss.&lt;ref name=oxfordtimes/&gt; It researches lesser-known foods such as [[breadfruit]], [[cassava]], [[sorghum]] and [[millet]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; The health issues that are its research priorities are [[diabetes]], [[obesity]] and the impact of food on age-related problems.&lt;ref name=oxfordtimes/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7245">The '''Patient Reported Outcome Indices for Multiple Sclerosis''' (PRIMUS) is a disease specific [[patient-reported outcome]] [[questionnaire]] which measures the [[quality of life]] (QoL) of patients suffering from [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="mckenna"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doward|first=LC|author2=McKenna, S.P. |author3=Meads, D.M. |author4=Twiss, J |author5= Eckert, BJ |title=The development of patient-reported outcome indices for multiple sclerosis (PRIMUS)|journal=Multiple Sclerosis Journal|year=2009|volume=15|issue=9|pages=1092–1102|doi=10.1177/1352458509106513|url=http://msj.sagepub.com/content/15/9/1092.abstract|accessdate=8 October 2013|pmid=19556315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure contains an assessment of quality of life, activity limitations and symptoms. A higher score on any or all of these scales indicates a lower quality of life due to the disease.&lt;ref name="twiss"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Twiss|first=James|author2=Doward, Lynda C. |author3=McKenna, Stephen P. |author4= Eckert, Benjamin |title=Interpreting scores on multiple sclerosis-specific patient reported outcome measures (the PRIMUS and U-FIS)|journal=Health And Quality Of Life Outcomes|date=11/10/2010|volume=8|issue=117|pages=1–8|doi=10.1186/1477-7525-8-117|url=http://www.hqlo.com/content/8/1/117|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and properties ==
First published in 2009 by Galen Research and funded by [[Novartis Pharmaceuticals]], the PRIMUS was developed in order to provide a more holistic view of the impact of MS on a patient.&lt;ref name="mckenna" /&gt;

The measure has three scales: quality of life, symptoms and activity limitations, which are designed to be used together or as standalone measures.&lt;ref name="twiss" /&gt; The QoL and symptom scales are based on simple statements with [[Dichotomous question|dichotomous]] response options.  Each scale has a total score which ranges from 0 to 22. The activity scale is based on 15 statements describing tasks. Patients are asked to rate their ability to perform these tasks on a scale from 1 to 3. The total score of the activities section ranges from 0 to 30.&lt;ref name="2kenna"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKenna|first=Stephen P. |author2=Doward, Lynda C. |author3=Twiss, James |author4=Hagell, Peter |author5=Oprandi, Nadia C. |author6=Fisk, John |author7=Grand'Maison, Francois |author8=Bhan, Virender |author9=Arbizu, Txomin |author10=Brassat, David |author11=Kohlmann, Thomas |author12=Meads, David M. |author13=Eckert, Benjamin J. |title=International Development of the Patient-Reported Outcome Indices for Multiple Sclerosis (PRIMUS)|journal=Value in Health|date=December 2010|volume=13|issue=8|pages=946–951|doi=10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00767.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00767.x/abstract|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International use ==
Since the development of the PRIMUS, it has been translated into several languages including Canadian English and French, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, US English,&lt;ref name="2kenna" /&gt; Australian and New Zealand English and US Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measures Database|url=http://www.galen-research.com/measures-database/|work=Galen-Research.com|publisher=Galen Research|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has allowed researchers to conduct studies for specific populations, such as Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hernandez|first=M.A.|author2=Mora, S.|title=Use of the PRIMUS scale to assess quality of life in a Spanish population of multiple sclerosis patients.|journal=Neurologia|year=2013|volume=28|issue=6|pages=340–347|doi=10.1016/j.nrleng.2012.06.003|url=http://zl.elsevier.es/en/revista/neurologia-495/articulo/use-of-the-primus-scale-90217987|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karampampa|first=Korinna|author2=Gustavsson, Anders |author3=Miltenburger, Carolin |author4= Eckert, Benjamin |title=Treatment experience, burden and unmet needs (TRIBUNE) in MS study: results from five European countries|journal=Multiple Sclerosis|year=2012|volume=18|issue=2|pages=7–15|doi=10.1177/1352458512441566|url=http://msj.sagepub.com/content/18/2_suppl/7|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical studies ==
The PRIMUS has been utilized in clinical trials which assess the efficacy of a treatment or medication. If a patient’s score on the PRIMUS changes after a trial has taken place, it is inferred that the trial has had an effect on the patient’s quality of life. PRIMUS has been used to assess the efficacy of [[fingolimod]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ziemssen|first=T.|author2=Meergans, M. |author3=Vollmar, P. |author4=Kempcke, R |author5=Tracik, F. |author6= van Lokven, T. |title=Study design and first interim results of a registry study to establish long-term safety and pharmaco-economic data on fingolimod (Gilenya®) in multiple sclerosis patients in Germany (PANGAEA)|journal=Multiple Sclerosis|date=October 2012|volume=18|issue=4|page=222|doi=10.1177/1352458512459019|url=http://msj.sagepub.com/content/18/4_suppl/55.extract|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

== Development ==

The PsAQoL was first published in 2004 by Galen Research. The development of the measure was a joint effort between Galen Research, the [[University of Leeds]] and [[St. Vincent’s University Hospital]] in Dublin. The study was funded by the [[Arthritis Research Campaign]] in the UK.&lt;ref name="mckenna" /&gt;

[[Qualitative research|Qualitative]] interviews were conducted with 48 patients, after which a 51-item questionnaire was created. A follow up survey with 94 patients was then conducted which reduced the items to 35. An additional 286 patients were surveyed and [[Rasch model|Rasch]] analysis was performed, which finalized the PsAQoL to 20 items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mease|first=Philip J.|title=Measures of Psoriatic Arthritis|journal=Arthritis Care &amp; Research|date=November 2011|volume=63|issue=S11|pages=S64–S85|doi=10.1002/acr.20577|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.20577/pdf|accessdate=9 October 2013|pmid=22588772}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high score on the PsAQoL indicates a lower quality of life.

The Psoriatic Arthritis Quality of Life measure has been translated into 30 languages, other than UK English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measures Database|url=http://www.galen-research.com/measures-database/|work=Galen-Research.com|publisher=Galen Research|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These languages include Dutch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wink|first=Freke|author2=Arends, Suzanne |author3=McKenna, Stephen P. |author4=Houtman, Pieternella M. |author5=Brouwer, Elisabeth |author6= Spoorenberg, Anneke |title=Validity and Reliability of the Dutch Adaptation of the Psoriatic Arthritis Quality of Life (PsAQoL) Questionnaire|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2013|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0055912|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0055912|accessdate=9 October 2013|editor1-last=Kuwana|editor1-first=Masataka|pages=e55912|pmid=23418474|pmc=3572180}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Billing|first=E|author2=McKenna, SP |author3=Staun, M |author4= Lindqvist, U |title=Adaptation of the Psoriatic Arthritis Quality of Life (PsAQoL) instrument for Sweden|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Rheumatology|date=May 2010|volume=39|issue=3|pages=223–228|doi=10.3109/03009740903347975|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03009740903347975|accessdate=9 October 2013|pmid=20063984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The PsAQoL has also been utilized in [[clinical research]] studies in order to determine whether a medication or treatment is effective in treating psoriatic arthritis. If the scores on the PsAQoL change after treatment, this means that the given treatment has had an effect on quality of life.

'''Refeeding syndrome''' is a [[syndrome]] consisting of metabolic disturbances that occur as a result of reinstitution of nutrition to patients who are [[starvation|starved]], severely [[malnourishment|malnourished]] or metabolically stressed due to severe illness. When too much food and/or liquid nutrition supplement is consumed during the initial four to seven days of refeeding, this triggers synthesis of [[glycogen]], fat and protein in cells, to the detriment of [[serum (blood)|serum (blood)]] concentrations of potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.&lt;ref name=pmid18583681&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mehanna HM, Moledina J, Travis J |title=Refeeding syndrome: what it is, and how to prevent and treat it |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7659 |pages=1495–8 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18583681 |pmc=2440847 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a301 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18583681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doig|first=GS|last2=Simpson|first2=F|last3=Heighes|first3=|last4=Bellomo|first4=R|last5=Chesher|first5=D|last6=Caterson|first6=ID|last7=Reade|first7=MC|last8=Harrigan|first8=PWJ|date=2015-12-01|title=Restricted versus continued standard caloric intake during the management of refeeding syndrome in critically ill adults: a randomised, parallel-group, multicentre, single-blind controlled trial|journal=The Lancet Respiratory Medicine|volume=3|issue=12|pages=943–952|doi=10.1016/S2213-2600(15)00418-X|issn=2213-2619|pmid=26597128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiac, pulmonary and neurological symptoms can be signs of refeeding syndrome. The low serum minerals, if severe enough, can be fatal.

==Cause==
Any individual who has had negligible nutrient intake for many consecutive days and/or is metabolically stressed from a critical illness or major surgery is at risk of refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome usually occurs within four days of starting to re-feed. Patients can develop fluid and [[electrolyte]] disorders, especially [[hypophosphatemia]], along with neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, and hematologic complications.

During [[fasting]] the body switches its main fuel source from carbohydrates to fat tissue [[fatty acids]] and [[amino acids]] as the main energy sources. The spleen decreases its rate of red blood cell breakdown thus conserving [[red blood cell]]s. Many intracellular minerals become severely depleted during this period, although serum levels remain normal. Importantly, [[insulin]] secretion is suppressed in this fasted state and [[glucagon]] secretion is increased.&lt;ref name=pmid18583681/&gt;

During refeeding, insulin secretion resumes in response to increased [[blood sugar]], resulting in increased glycogen, fat and protein synthesis. This process requires [[phosphate]]s, [[magnesium]] and [[potassium]] which are already depleted and the stores rapidly become used up. Formation of phosphorylated carbohydrate compounds in the liver and skeletal muscle depletes intracellular [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[2,3-diphosphoglycerate]] in [[red blood cells]], leading to cellular dysfunction and inadequate oxygen delivery to the body's organs. Refeeding increases the [[basal metabolic rate]]. Intracellular movement of electrolytes occurs along with a fall in the [[blood serum|serum]] electrolytes, including [[phosphorus]] and [[magnesium]]. Levels of serum glucose may rise and the B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; vitamin [[thiamine]] may fall. [[Arrhythmia|Abnormal heart rhythms]] are the most common cause of death from refeeding syndrome, with other significant risks including confusion, [[coma]] and convulsions and [[cardiac failure]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

This syndrome can occur at the beginning of treatment for [[anorexia nervosa]] when patients have an increase in calorie intake and can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Webb GJ, Smith K, Thursby-Pelham F, Smith T, Stroud MA, Da Silva AN |title=Complications of emergency refeeding in anorexia nervosa: case series and review |journal=Acute Medicine |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=69–76 |year=2011 |pmid=22041604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also occur after the onset of a severe illness or major surgery. The shifting of electrolytes and fluid balance increases cardiac workload and heart rate. This can lead to acute heart failure. Oxygen consumption is also increased which strains the respiratory system and can make weaning from ventilation more difficult.

==Diagnosis==
Refeeding syndrome can be fatal if not recognized and treated properly. An awareness of the condition and a high index of suspicion are required in order to make the diagnosis. The electrolyte disturbances of the refeeding syndrome can occur within the first few days of refeeding.  Close monitoring of blood biochemistry is therefore necessary in the early refeeding period. 

==Treatment==
In critically ill patients admitted to an [[intensive care unit]], if [[phosphate]] drops to below 0.65&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) from a previously normal level within three days of starting enteral or parenteral nutrition, caloric intake should be reduced to 480 kcals per day for at least two days whilst electrolytes are replaced. Prescribing [[thiamine]], [[vitamin B]] complex (strong) and a [[multivitamin|multivitamin and mineral preparation]] is recommended. Biochemistry should be monitored regularly until it is stable. Although clinical trials are lacking in patients other than those admitted to an intensive care, it is commonly recommended that [[Energy balance (biology)|energy intake]] should remain lower than that normally required for the first 3–5 days of treatment of refeeding syndrome.

==History==
A common error, repeated in multiple papers, is that "The syndrome was first 
described after [[World War II]] in Americans who, held by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] as [[prisoners of war#World War II|prisoners of war]], had become malnourished during captivity and who were then released to the care of United States personnel in the [[Philippines]]."&lt;ref name="pmid14847450"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1951|title=A clinical study of malnutrition in Japanese prisoners of war|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=35|issue=1|pages=69–96|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-35-1-69|pmid=14847450|vauthors=Schnitker MA, Mattman PE, Bliss TL|url=https://www.annals.org/article.aspx?volume=35&amp;issue=1&amp;page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, closer inspection of the 1951 paper by Schnitker reveals the prisoners under study were not American POWs but Japanese soldiers who, already malnourished, surrendered in the Philippines during 1945, after the war was over. 

It is difficult to ascertain when the syndrome was first discovered and named, but it is likely the associated electrolyte disturbances were identified well before 1951, perhaps in Holland during the closing months of World War II, before Victory Day in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=BSandstead|first2=HR|last3=Drummond|first3=J|date=1945|title=Starvation in Western Holland: 1945.|journal=Lancet|volume=246|pages=282–83.|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(45)90738-0|last1=Burger|first1=GCE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also anecdotal eyewitness reports from a still earlier time of Polish prisoners in Iran who were freed from Soviet camps in 1941–1942 under an amnesty to form an army under General Anders and were given food whilst in a state of starvation which caused many to die.&lt;ref&gt;Many of these deaths were due to dysentry, typhoid and other diseases but this was largely amongst the civilian evacuees from Poland.  Clear eyewitness reports identify eating too much as a cause.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Historian Flavius [[Josephus]] writing in first century the described classic symptoms of the syndrome among survivors of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|siege of Jerusalem]]. He described the death of those who over indulged in food after famine, whereas those who ate a more restrained pace survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2850/2850-h/2850-h.htm#link52HCH0013|title=The Wars of the Jews by Flavius Josephus|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gutenberg.org|page=book V, chapter XIII, paragraph 4|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 5th century BCE work 'On Fleshes' (De Carnibus), [[Hippocrates]] writes, "if a person goes
seven days without eating or drinking anything, in this period most die; but there are some who survive that time
but still die, and others are persuaded not to starve themselves to death but to eat and drink: however, the cavity
no longer admits anything because the jejunum (nêstis) has grown together in that many days, and these people
too die." Though [[Hippocrates]] misidentifies the exact cause of death, this passage likely represents an early description of Refeeding Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates of Kos. De Carnibus. 5th century BCE.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11147">'''Social quality''' is a way of understanding society which is also relevant for social and public policy. Social quality looks at elements that should constitute a good or decent society. It contributes to the body of work concerned with understanding social progress going beyond [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], taking into account the work of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and the [[European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions]]. Whilst most approaches have concentrated on the [[happiness economics|economics]] or [[Subjective well-being|psychology of well-being]], social quality can help understanding the social conditions that enable human flourishing.&lt;ref name="social quality"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbott |first=Pamela |last2=Wallace |first2=Claire |date=2012 |title=Social Quality: A way to measure the quality of society |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=153–167 |doi=10.1007/s11205-011-9871-0 |pmid=22773884 |pmc=3384781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Social quality.png|400px|right|Social quality diagram]]

There are four elements shown in the diagram on the right. ''Economic security'' refers to the material conditions that enable people to have a long term perspective on their lives, and their confidence for the future. This can include social policies, such as pensions and social security, that ensure this. It also includes economic conditions that enable people to feel secure because they have enough income to cover their basic needs.&lt;ref name="social quality" /&gt; ''Social cohesion'' refers to the bonds that link societies together, deriving from the work of [[Émile Durkheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durkheim |first=Émile |date=1952 |title=Suicide. A Study in Sociology |location=London |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durkheim |first=Émile |date=1952 |title=The Division of Labour in Society|location=New York |publisher=Free Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]]'s work considers the moral and social relationships between members of society and social groups, including factors such as trust in others, trust in social institutions, a sense of identity, a collective consciousness, solidarity  and commitment to the common good of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dragolov |first=Georgi |last2=Ignácz |first2=Zsófia |last3=Lorenz |first3=Jan |last4=Delhey |first4=Jan| last5=Boehnke |first5=Klaus |date=2013 |title=Social Cohesion Radar. Measuring Common Ground. An international Comparison of Social Cohesion|location=Gutersloh |publisher=Bertelsmann }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social inclusion'' refers to the way in which individuals and social groups are included into society, either through employment, networks and family or through access to social support of various kinds, this can come through support from other people or from social policies. Social policies that foster social inclusion, reduce poverty and tackle other forms of social exclusion can be important in this respect.&lt;ref name="social quality" /&gt; ''Social empowerment'' refers to the conditions that enable people to participate in their society, such as having good health, education and democratic opportunities for participation, such as voting and joining civil society. However, it can also mean the feelings of being empowered, being able to take control of one's circumstances. It derives from the work of [[Amartya Sen]], who suggests that people need to have the capability to be able to do the things that they wish to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sen |first=Amartya |editor-last=Nussbaum |editor-first=Martha Craven |editor-last2=Sen |editor-first2=Amartya|title=The Quality of Life |location=London|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=1993 |chapter=Capability and Well-being }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the social quality approach is fundamentally relational. As such, it emphasises a complex field of conditional (i), constitutional (ii) and normative factors (iii). These are (i) Socio-Economic Security, Social Cohesion, Social Inclusion, Social Empowerment; (ii) Person/human security, Social Recognition, Social Responsiveness, Personal/human Capacity; and (iii) Social Justice (Equity), Solidarity, Equal Valuation, Human Dignity. On the one hand this rejects the Durkheimian view on society as an independent social fact sui generis; on the other hand it qualifies Sen's approach as social quality is not primarily focusing on the subjective side and individuals within society but on the constitution of society by way of people producing and reproducing their daily life and with this society.

==Origins and development==
The idea of social quality began as a [[European Union]] project among a group of social scientists, concerned to develop a better way forward for social policies in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Wolfang |last2=van der Maesen |first2=Laurent |last3=Walker |first3=Alan |date=1997 |title=The Social Quality of Europe|location=The Hague |publisher=Kluwer Law International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Wolfang |last2=van der Maesen |first2=Laurent |last3=Walker |first3=Alan |last4=Thomes |first4=Fleur |date=2001 |title=Social Quality: A Vision for Europe|location=The Hague |publisher=Kluwer Law International }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |editor-last=van der Maesen |editor-first=Laurent |editor-last2=Walker |editor-first2=Alan |date=2012 |title=Social Quality. From Theory to Indicators|location=London |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the concept underwent some fundamental development. Empirically it had been developed amongst others by Pamela Abbott, [[Claire Wallace]] and Roger Sapsford, who looked at how the model can be developed empirically in Europe, [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]], China and [[Rwanda]]. They have used a different variation, considering the impact on well being, measured through [[life satisfaction]] and human flourishing in order to understand how social quality might work in fostering the well being of people in society.&lt;ref name="social quality" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Pamela| last2=Wallace| first2=Claire |editor-last=Selin|editor-first=Helaine |editor-last2=Gareth|editor-first2=Gaveth|title=Happiness across Cultures: Views of Happiness and Quality of Life in Non-Western Cultures  |location=London|publisher=Springer Verlag|date=2012 |chapter=Happiness in Post-Conflict Rwanda| pages= 361–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Pamela| last2=Wallace| first2=Claire |editor-last=Selin|editor-first=Helaine |editor-last2=Gareth|editor-first2=Gaveth|title=Happiness across Cultures: Views of Happiness and Quality of Life in Non-Western Cultures  |location=London|publisher=Springer Verlag|date=2012 |chapter=Satisfaction and Societal Quality in Kazakhstan| pages= 107–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbott |first=Pamela |last2=Wallace |first2=Claire |date=2014 |title='Rising economic prosperity and social quality.

This empirical work had been to a large extent emerging from the work undertaken by colleagues in Asia, in particular by Ka Lin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lin |first=Ka |last2=Herrmann |first2=Peter |date=2015 |title=Social Quality Theory. A New Perspective on Social Development|location=New York/Oxford |publisher=Berghahn}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another development is by a marked shift towards questions around 'overall sustainability'. Laurent van der Maesen is the main proponent of this strand contends. In a working paper we read that "international and national (and urban) strategies and policies for development toward 'overall' sustainability not only have to have a strong emphasis on development toward sustainability of cities themselves (internal sustainability) but also – simultaneously – address the development toward sustainability of the cities' surroundings ('Hinterland')".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=International Association of Social Quality  |date=2012 |title=The need for a Comprehensive Conceptual and Methodological Framework for new politics and policies: A social quality perspective; A contribution to the Rio+ 20 Conference on the sustainability of human existence on Earth |journal=IASQ working papers |issue=11 |pages=12 f.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more traditional line is maintained by [[Peter Herrmann (social philosopher)|Peter Herrmann]] who had been since the end of the 1990s advisor of the then European Foundation, later International Association of Social Quality. He claims that 
"[w]e have to reconceptualize ... indicators. They are not measurement instruments sui generis. Rather they are instruments to develop an understanding of complex issues and trends. As such they need to be guided by a sound conceptual reflection of what they are looking for".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herrmann |first=Peter |date=2012 |title=Economic Performance, Social Progress and Social Quality |journal=International Journal of Social Quality |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=41–55 |doi=10.3167/IJSQ.2012.020104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Herrmann is on the one hand reclaiming the methodological and theoretical importance of Social Quality thinking, at least qualifying the empirical orientation. On the other hand, though this does not contradict the orientation on sustainability, Herrmann emphasises the need to reorient debates on "the kind of economy in place" instead of maintaining dichotomies, separations and hierarchies between different areas of societal development. This had been elaborated in a book on defining social policy as matter of producing society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herrmann |first=Peter  |date=2014 |title=Social Policy – Production rather than Distribution. A Rights-Based Approach|location=Bremen |publisher=EHV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The success of [[vaccines]] and [[anti-virus software]] in preventing major outbreaks relies on the mechanism of [[herd immunity]], also known as community immunity, where the immunization of individuals provides protection for not only the individuals, but also the community at large.&lt;ref name=JohnJacob2000&gt;

|pmid=11078115
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In cases of biological contagions such as [[influenza]], [[measles]], and [[chicken pox]], immunizing a [[critical community size]] can provide protection against the disease for members who cannot be vaccinated themselves (infants, pregnant women, and [[immunocompromised]] individuals). Often however these vaccine programmes require the immunization of a large majority of the population to provide herd immunity.&lt;ref name=communityimmunity&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; have been shown to be [[scale-free networks]] and as such exhibit a [[power-law]] distribution for the [[degree distribution]]. In large networks this results in the vast majority of nodes (individuals in [[social networks]]) having few connections or low degree ''k'', while a few "hubs" have many more connections than the average &lt;''k''&gt;.&lt;ref name=BAmodel1999&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This wide variability ([[heterogeneity]]) in degree offers immunization strategies based on targeting members of the network according to their connectivity rather than random immunization of the network. In epidemic modeling on scale-free networks, targeted immunization schemes can considerably lower the vulnerability of a network to epidemic outbreaks over random immunization schemes. Typically these strategies result in the need for far fewer nodes to be immunized in order to provide the same level of protection to the entire network as in random immunization.&lt;ref name=PastorVespignani2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CohenHavlinAvraham2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanaka2014&gt;

'''Examples'''

A common approach for targeted immunization studies in scale-free networks focuses on targeting the highest degree nodes for immunization. These nodes are the most highly connected in the network, making them more likely to spread the contagion if infected. Immunizing this segment of the network can drastically reduce the impact of the disease on the network and requires the immunization of far fewer nodes compared to randomly selecting nodes.&lt;ref name=PastorVespignani2002 /&gt; However, this strategy relies on knowing the global structure of the network, which may not always be practical.&lt;ref name=CohenHavlinAvraham2003 /&gt;

Another strategy, ''acquaintance immunization'',&lt;ref name=CohenHavlinAvraham2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CohenMadar2004&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; tries to target all of the most highly connected nodes for immunization by going through their neighbors without knowing the full [[network topology]]. In this approach a random group of nodes are chosen and then a random set of their neighbors are selected for immunization. The most highly connected nodes are far more likely to be in this group of neighbors so immunizing this group results in targeting the most highly connected but requiring far less information about the network.&lt;ref name=CohenHavlinAvraham2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChristakisFowler2010&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Another variant of this strategy again calls for the random selection of nodes but instead asks for one of their neighbors with a higher degree, or at least more than a given threshold degree and immunizes them.&lt;ref name=GallosLiljeros2007 /&gt; These degree based strategies consistently require fewer nodes to be immunized and as such improve a network's chances against epidemic attacks.&lt;ref name=CohenHavlinAvraham2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CohenMadar2004 /&gt;

A recent centrality measure, Percolation Centrality, introduced by Piraveenan et al.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piraveenan|first=Mahendra|last2=Prokopenko|first2=Mikhail|last3=Hossain|first3=Liaquat|date=2013-01-22|title=Percolation Centrality: Quantifying Graph-Theoretic Impact of Nodes during Percolation in Networks|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053095|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=1|pages=e53095|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053095|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3551907|pmid=23349699|bibcode=2013PLoSO...853095P}}&lt;/ref&gt; is particularly useful in identifying nodes for vaccination based on the network topology. Unlike node degree which depends on topology alone, however, percolation centrality takes into account the topological importance of a node as well as its distance from infected nodes in deciding its overall importance. Piraveenan et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; has shown that percolation centrality-based vaccination is particularly effective when the proportion of people already infected is on the same order of magnitude as the number of people who could be vaccinated before the disease spreads much further. If infection spread is at its infancy, then ring-vaccination surrounding the source of infection is most effective, whereas if the proportion of people already infected is much higher than the number of people that could be vaccinated quickly, then vaccination will only help those who are vaccinated and herd immunity cannot be achieved.&lt;ref name="communityimmunity" /&gt; Percolation centrality-based vaccination is most effective in the critical scenario where the infection has already spread too far to be completely surrounded by ring-vaccination, yet not spread wide enough so that it cannot be contained by strategic vaccination. Nevertheless, Percolation Centrality also needs full network topology to be computed, and thus is more useful in higher levels of abstraction (for example, networks of townships rather than social networks of individuals), where the corresponding network topology can more readily be obtained.

==Increasing immunization coverage==
Millions of children worldwide do not receive all of the routine vaccinations as per their national schedule. As immunization is a powerful public health strategy for improving child survival, it is important to determine what strategies work best to increase coverage. A Cochrane review assessed the effectiveness of intervention strategies to boost and sustain high childhood immunization coverage in low- and middle income countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oyo-Ita|first1=A|last2=Nwachukwu|first2=CE|last3=Oringanje|first3=C|last4=Meremikwu|first4=MM|title=Interventions for improving coverage of child immunization in low- and middle-income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=6 July 2011|issue=7|pages=CD008145|pmid=21735423|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008145.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27394698|date = July 2018}} Fourteen trials were included but most of the evidence was of low quality. Providing parents and other community members with information on immunization, health education at facilities in combination with redesigned immunization reminder cards, regular immunization outreach with and without household incentives, home visits, and integration of immunization with other services may improve childhood immunization coverage in low-and middle income countries.

It is a rare complication of [[testicular trauma]], and can result from blunt or penetrating trauma, though blunt trauma is more likely to cause rupture. Testicular rupture typically results from trauma sustained during a motor vehicle crash or sports play,  mainly affects those from the ages of 10-30. The main symptoms of testicular rupture are scrotal swelling and severe pain, which can make diagnosis difficult.

'''Tony Mills''', is an American [[physician]] who specializes in treatment of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name=POZ&gt;[http://www.poz.com/articles/hiv_croi_mills_761_16580.shtml POZ Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; 
He is one of the leading clinician in the fields of Men's Health and HIV disease. Mills has served as the primary care provider for over 2,000 patients, including approximately half living with HIV. Mills received both his undergraduate and medical degrees from Duke University. He completed an internship in Internal Medicine, a residency in Anesthesiology and a fellowship in Cardiovascular Anesthesiology, all at the [[University of California, San Francisco]]. Mills is a member of many professional societies including; the [[Infectious Disease Society of America]], [[International AIDS Society]], IAS-USA, and the American Academy of HIV Medicine. He is the executive director of SoCal Men's Medical Group, the clinical research director of Mills Clinical Research, and the president of the Men's Health Foundation.

In May 1998, he won the title of [[International Mister Leather]], publicly coming out as HIV-positive one day later.&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;[http://www.poz.com/articles/220_12063.shtml Andrew Sullivan: Dr. Leather Meets Mr. Right]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wound assessment''' is a component of [[wound care|wound management]] that collects information about the patient, and the [[wound]] before a treatment plan is prescribed.

Wound assessment includes observation of the wound, surveying the patient, as well as identifying relevant clinical data from physical examination and patient’s health history.  Clinical data recorded during an initial assessment serves as a baseline for prescribing the appropriate treatment.

To assist clinicians in standardizing the wound assessment and [[wound bed preparation|preparation of wound bed]] for treatment, the TIME framework has been developed in 2002 by a group of wound care experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schultz|first=GS|last2=Sibbald|first2=RG |last3=Falanga|first3=V|last4=Ayello|first4=EA|last5=Dowsett|first5=C|last6=Harding|first6=K|last7=Romanelli|first7=M|last8=Stacey|first8=MC|last9=Teot|first9=L|last10=Vanscheidt|first10=W |date=March 2003 |title= Wound bed preparation: a systematic approach to wound management |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1524-475X.11.s2.1.x/abstract |journal= Wound Repair and Regeneration |volume=11 |issue= s1|pmid=12654015 |doi= 10.1046/j.1524-475X.11.s2.1.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fletcher |first=J |date=April–May 2007 |title= Wound assessment and the TIME framework|journal=British Journal of Nursing |volume=16 |issue=8|pmid= 17551428 |doi= 10.12968/bjon.2007.16.8.23415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The TIME acronym stands for Tissue, Infection/Inflammation, Moisture, and Edge – components that, per the TIME recommendation, should be thoroughly assessed to optimize the treatment. Depending on the clinical findings for each component, TIME recommends certain clinical actions aimed at correcting the issues and facilitating the [[wound healing|healing]].

A recent global anthropological study has prompted clinicians to review the TIME framework&lt;ref name="TWA"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dowsett |first=C | last2=Gronemann | first2=M | last3=Harding | first3=K| date=2015 | title=Taking wound assessment beyond the edge | journal=Wounds International | volume=6 | issue=1 | url=http://www.wintjournal.com/journal-content/view/taking-wound-assessment-beyond-the-edge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in a 2016 development of a new comprehensive tool for wound assessment – the Triangle of Wound Assessment (TWA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dowsett |first=C | last2=Protz | first2=K | last3= Drouard | first3=M|  last4=Harding | first4=K| date=May 2015 | title= Triangle of wound assessment made easy | journal=Wounds International | url= http://www.woundsinternational.com/media/other-resources/_/1189/files/twa-made-easy_web1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the study’s findings, TWA identifies three zones (wound bed, wound edge, and [[periwound]] skin) that must be included in wound assessment to arrive at clinical decisions that will help heal the wound in the most efficient way. TIME framework components are integrated into the assessment of each zone.

The introduction of periwound skin as a component of wound assessment identifies a significant departure from traditional methods; it emphasizes the importance of addressing periwound skin during treatment in the same measure as wound bed and wound edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2009/October/Lawton-Langoen/vulnerable-skin-2-utf8.html |title= Assessing and managing vulnerable periwound skin |last=Lawton |first=S |last2= Langøen |first2=A |date=October 2009 |website= World Wide Wounds |publisher=SMTL |access-date= May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wound assessment is a holistic process that considers the patient’s current state of health, the factors that may impede wound healing, and the cause, duration and state of the wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cornforth |first=A |date=December 2013 |title= Holistic wound assessment in primary care
|journal=British Journal of Community Nursing |volume=18 |issue=12|pmid=24796082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, this process is applicable to any wound.

==Wound assessment components==
===Health history===
Patient’s health history may include disorders that affect the body’s ability to heal itself. These disorders are called [[comorbidity|comorbidities]] and may interfere with circulatory and metabolic body functions, levels of various physiological assessment components (sugar, albumin, etc.), and induce other factors that negatively affect the healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ackermann |first=PW|last2=Hart |first2=DA |date=October 2013 |title= Influence of Comorbidities: Neuropathy, Vasculopathy, and Diabetes on Healing Response Quality |journal= Advances in Wound Care |volume=2|issue=8 |pmid=24688829|doi=10.1089/wound.2012.0437 |pmc=3842870}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common co-morbidities are: [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Chronic venous insufficiency|venous insufficiency]] or [[Peripheral artery disease|peripheral arterial disease]], [[Respiratory disease|respiratory]] and [[Cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular disorders]], [[Cancer|malignancies]] and [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune disorders]].

===Impeding factors===
Among other factors that may impede the healing of a wound are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=K|last2=Hamm |first2=R |date=December 2012 |title=Factors That Impair Wound Healing |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4495737|journal= Advances in Wound Care |volume=4|issue=4 |pmc= 4495737|doi= 10.1016/j.jccw.2014.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Factors"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guo |first=S|last2=Dipietro |first2=LA |date=March 2010 |title= Factors affecting wound healing |journal= Journal of Dental Research |volume=89|issue=3 |pmid= 20139336|doi= 10.1177/0022034509359125|pmc=2903966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wound===
====Wound cause====
If the wound is [[Chronic wound|chronic]], is it the result of: an underlying illness (diabetic, venous and arterial ulcers), poor handling of the patient ([[Pressure ulcer|pressure injuries]], [[Deep Tissue Injury|deep tissue injuries]], wounds with cavities and undermining), poor previous treatment choices that slowed down the healing (untreated infection, inappropriate wound care product choice, lack of necessary procedures).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Frykberg |first=RG|last2= Banks |first2=J |date=September 2015|title= Challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds |journal= Advances in Wound Care|volume=4|issue=9| pmc= 4528992| doi=10.1089/wound.2015.0635}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If the wound is acute, is it the result of: [[Injury|traumatic injury]], [[burn]], or [[surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicks|first=BA|last2=Ayello|first2=EA|last3=Woo|first3=K|last4= Nitzki-George |first4=D|last5= Sibbald |first5=RG |date=December 2010 |title= Acute wound management: revisiting the approach to assessment, irrigation, and closure considerations|journal= International Journal of Emergency Medicine|volume=3 |issue=4|pmc= 3047833|doi=10.1007/s12245-010-0217-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wound duration====
For chronic wounds: time the current wound has been present, is it a recurring wound, how many times it has recurred in the past, how long it took to heal each time.
For acute wounds: when the wound was first acquired before the clinician visit.

====Wound state====
Wound bed, wound edge and periwound skin should be examined before the initial treatment plan is devised. It should also be re-assessed at each visit or each dressing change.

For wound bed, the following parameters are assessed:
* Tissue type; presence and percentage of non-viable tissue covering the wound bed
* Level of [[exudate]]
* Presence of infection

Wound edge must be examined to detect:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benbow |first=M |date=March 2016 |title= Best practice in wound assessment |journal=Nursing Standard |volume=30 |issue=27|pmid=26932649 |doi= 10.7748/ns.30.27.40.s45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maceration
* Desiccation
* Undermining
* Elevation above surrounding tissue (raised edge)
* Epibole (rolled edge)

For periwound skin, the following conditions should be diagnosed or ruled out:&lt;ref name="Challenges"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hollinworth |first=H|date=October 2009 |title= Challenges in protecting peri-wound skin|journal=Nursing Standard |volume=24 |issue=7|pmid=19927560|doi= 10.7748/ns2009.10.24.7.53.c7330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Disorders"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Woo |first=KY |last2=Ayello |first2=EA |last3=Sibbald |first3=G.|date= 2009 |title= The skin and periwound skin disorders and management |url=http://www.woundhealingsa.co.za/index.php/WHSA/article/view/58/79 |journal= Wound Healing Southern Africa |volume=2 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maceration
* Dry, scaly skin
* Desiccation
* Excoriation and skin stripping
* Hypergranulation and hyperkeratosis
* [[Dermatitis|Eczema]]
* Callus build-up and epibole
* Infection and inflammation

Worldwide, there are between 180 and 220 million '''youth with disabilities'''. Eighty percent of disabled youth live in developing countries, and therefore have even less access to education, health care, jobs and general rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth with Disabilities|url=http://undesadspd.org/youth/resourcesandpublications/youthwithdisabilities.aspx|website=Youth Social Policy and Developmental Division|accessdate=December 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127013856/http://undesadspd.org/youth/resourcesandpublications/youthwithdisabilities.aspx |archive-date=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabilities include [[physical disabilities|physical]], [[mental disabilities]] or [[mental illness]].  Many youth live normal and stable lives, however those with disabilities may experience more obstacles than those without due to potential limitations, those created by physical limitations and social limitations. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Disability and education==
===Legal regulations in the United States===
Before the 1970s, there were no major [[federal law]]s that protected the [[civil rights|civil]] or [[constitutional right]]s of [[United States|Americans]] with disabilities. The [[civil rights movement]] started off the "[[disability rights movement]]", which focused on [[social services|social]] and therapeutic services for those with disabilities, and in 1975 the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) was created. This law establishes the rights of children with disabilities to attend [[State school|public schools]], to receive services designed to meet their needs free of charge, and to receive instruction in regular education [[classroom]]s alongside non-disabled children.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laudan |first1=Aron |last2=Loprest |first2=Pamela |title=Disability and the Education System|journal=The Future of Children |date=Spring 2012 |volume=22.1 |publisher=Princeton|location=United Kingdom |pmid=22550687 |pages=97–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IDEA also authorized [[federal grant]]s to [[U.S. state|states]] to cover some of the costs of special education services for youth aged three to twenty-one.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt; Additions to the law focused on improving access to general education and [[curriculum]] (inclusion programs), developing appropriate assessments, implementing appropriate [[punishment|disciplinary]] procedures and alternative placements, and creating transition services for youth leaving the [[education system]]. This transition can be difficult for youth with a disability if it is too sudden- many of these youth struggle with the independence that [[graduation]] allows. In 2004, additions were made to promote better accountability for results, enhance parent involvement, encourage the use of proven practices and materials (increase research on current practices), and reduce administrative burdens for [[teacher]]s, states and local [[school district]]s. Before 1975, only one in five children with identified disabilities attended public school, and many states explicitly excluded children with certain types of disabilities from school; these included children who were [[blindness|blind]] or [[deafness|deaf]], and children labeled "[[Emotional and behavioral disorders|emotionally disturbed]]" or "[[mentally retarded]]".&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt;

===Current special education system===
The current special education system can offer many different supports and services including transportation, speech-language pathology and audiology services, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, therapeutic recreation, counseling services including rehabilitation counseling, orientation, and mobility services, medical services for diagnostic or evaluation purposes, school health services, social work services in school, and parent counseling and training children.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt; Each unique student and their unique symptoms of their disability is going to require different supports from another youth with a disability (even if it is the same disability). Within the classroom, there are many different ways that teachers and administration can adjust their work to meet the needs of the youth in their classroom with disabilities. Just a few of these adaptations are curriculum modification, small-group or individual instruction, and teachers who are especially skilled in motivating students, adapting instructional materials, teaching reading skills and language arts, and managing student behaviors.Specific accommodations might include tutors or aides, more time for students to take tests, alternative tests or assessments, modified grading standards, slower-paced instruction, shorter or different assignments, more frequent feedback, a reader or interpreter, a peer tutor, or special behavior management approaches and programs.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt;

==Challenges and hardships==

===Family effects===
{{Globalize|date=December 2014}}
Being a [[youth]] with a disability can create a financial burden on the individual, as well as to those who provide care and support. Their families also incur extra [[direct cost|direct]] and [[indirect cost]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. Families with disabled yout spend money on [[health care]], [[Therapy|therapeutic]], behavioral, or [[education]]al services; transportation; [[caregiver]]s; and other [[special needs]] services. Indirect costs include reductions in parents' ability to work because of additional time that is required to care for a child with a [[Mental disability (disambiguation)|disability]] combined with high costs or unavailability of adequate [[child care]]. This is a similar problem to one that many families face, but disabled youth may live at home longer require more attention.&lt;ref name=Stabile&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stabile|first1=Mark|title=The Economic Costs of Childhood Disability|pmid=22550686|volume=22|year=2012|pages=65–96|journal=Future Child|doi=10.1353/foc.2012.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These costs alone can decrease the financial stability of a family.  Having a child with disabilities increases the likelihood that the mother (or less often the father) will either curtail hours of work or stop working altogether.&lt;ref name=Stabile /&gt;  One study showed that a decline in employment of 9% for mothers with a disabled child relative to all mothers, with a resultant estimate of approximately $3,150 in lost pay. In addition, mothers who continue to work are estimated to reduce time worked by around two hours a week, with a range of between half an hour and five hours a week.&lt;ref name=Stabile /&gt;

Families with more resources may be able to maintain financial stability, even with the financial strain of having a youth with a disability. These resources may provide treatment, [[affordable housing]], therapy, etc. for a youth with special needs. As a conclusion from the research listed above, these children are more likely to be able to function independently from their family, and live on their own at an earlier age, than those from families that may not be able to afford these extra resources.

===Poverty===
Eighty percent of people with disabilities live in resource-poor societies. They are often considered to be a burden, and carry a very negative [[social stigma]]. Many are unable to contribute to society, attend school, or find [[job|work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manderson|first1=Lenore|title=Disability, Global Legislation and Human Rights|journal=The Politics of Health|date=June 2004|volume=47.2|pages=29–35|doi=10.1057/palgrave.development.1100027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disabled youth in the justice system===
{{globalize|date=December 2014}}
In the justice system, youth are disproportionately male, poor and have significant learning or behavioral disabilities to the extent that they require services listed under the IDEA.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quinn|first1=Mary|last2=Rutherford|first2=Robert|last3=Leone|first3=Peter|last4=Osher|first4=David|last5=Poirer|first5=Jeffery|title=Youth with Disabilities in Juvenile Corrections: A National Survey|journal=Exceptional Children|date=2005|volume=71|issue=3|pages=339–345|doi=10.1177/001440290507100308}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 1345,000 youth incarcerated in the U.S system, and 30%-70% of these individuals are youth with disabilities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
[[Psychiatric disorder]]s occur more often among [[prisoner]]s than among those outside of [[prison]]. Such illnesses relate to at least some of the difficulties former inmates experience after they are released.&lt;ref name="Schnittker"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schnittker |first1=Jason |last2=Massoglia|first2=Michael|last3=Uggen|first3=Christopher|title=Out and Down: Incarceration and Psychiatric Disorders|journal=Journal of Health and Social behavior|date=2012|volume=53.4 |url=http://users.soc.umn.edu/~uggen/Schnittker_Massoglia_Uggen_JHSB_12.pdf |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were diagnosed with a mental disability may have a harder time readjusting to life outside of [[incarceration|prison]] after being released; this often consists of [[recidivism|repetition of crime]], or difficulty maintaining independent stability financially or emotionally.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
