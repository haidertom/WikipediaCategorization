      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2279">'''Biorisk''' generally refers to the risk associated with biological materials and/or infectious agents. The term has been used frequently for various purposes since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Ecotoxicology of Soil Organisms: Conference : Papers By Marianne H. Donker, H. Eijsackers, Fred Heimbach Contributor Marianne H. Donker, H. Eijsackers, Fred Heimbach; CRC Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Parenteral Medications By Kenneth E. Avis, Herbert A. Lieberman, Leon Lachman Contributor Kenneth E. Avis; Informa Health Care, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used by [[Regulatory agency|regulators]], laboratory personnel and industry alike and is used by [[WHO]].&lt;ref&gt;The World Health Organization, Biorisk Management: ''Laboratory Biosecurity Guidance'' September 2006, WHO/CDS/EPR/2006.6
http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/biosafety/WHO_CDS_EPR_2006_6/en/index.html
&lt;/ref&gt; WHO/Europe also provides tools and training courses in biosafety and biosecurity.&lt;ref&gt;The World Health Organization, Biorisk Management: tools and training. http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Health-systems/laboratory-services/biorisk-management&lt;/ref&gt;

An international Laboratory Biorisk Management Standard developed under the auspices of the [[European Committee for Standardization]], defines biorisk as the combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm where the source of harm is a biological agent or toxin.&lt;ref&gt;The European Committee for Standardization, ''Laboratory Biorisk Management Standard'', CWA 15793:2008, p.9, www.cen.eu&lt;/ref&gt; The source of harm may be an unintentional exposure, accidental release or loss, theft, misuse, diversion, unauthorized access or intentional unauthorized release.

In Norway, "Biorisk" is trademarked by the Norwegian [[accredited registrar]] [[DNV]].&lt;ref&gt;The Norwegian Industrial Property Office, ''Norsk varemerketidende'', no. 49, vol. 93, 2003.12.01, p. 36,  http://www.patentstyret.no/upload/filarkiv/tidende/varemerketidende/2003/varemerketidende-nr49-2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Health Archive===
'''''Global Health Archive''''' is a searchable database produced by CABI. It is created from 800,000 records, from six printed abstract journals,  which are collected published scientific research from 1910 to 1972, digitized to form the archive. Global Health Archive is also  indexed in other databases, which also serve as access points. These other databases are ''CAB Direct'', [[Web of Knowledge]], [[EBSCOhost]], [[Ovid Technologies|OvidSP]], and [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]].&lt;ref name=ghArchive/&gt;

When combined with the ''Global Health'' database indexing coverage can be from 1910 to present day. Hence, coverage is made up of past [[epidemics]], from rates and patterns of disease [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]], duration of [[pandemics]], timing of epidemiological peaks, [[geographic distribution]] of diseases, and [[World Health Organization|government preparedness]] and [[quarantine]] provisions.  The following can also be taken  into account:  effects on different age and [[social groups]], severity in developing vs. developed countries, [[symptoms]], causes of [[Human|mortality]] - such as secondary problems like [[pneumonia]] - and mortality rates.&lt;ref name=ghArchive&gt;{{cite web

Reduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the [[United Nations]]' [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. Rapid progress has resulted in a significant decline in preventable child deaths since 1990, with the global under-5 mortality rate declining by over half between 1990 and 2016.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; While in 1990, 12.6 million children under age five died, in 2016 that number fell to 5.6 million children.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; However, despite advances, there are still 15,000 under-five deaths per day from largely preventable causes.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; About 80 per cent of these occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and just 6 countries account for half of all under-five deaths: India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and China.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; 45% of these children died during the first 28 days of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Li|last2=Oza|first2=Shefali|last3=Hogan|first3=Dan|last4=Chu|first4=Yue|last5=Perin|first5=Jamie|last6=Zhu|first6=Jun|last7=Lawn|first7=Joy E|last8=Cousens|first8=Simon|last9=Mathers|first9=Colin|title=Global, regional, and national causes of under-5 mortality in 2000–15: an updated systematic analysis with implications for the Sustainable Development Goals|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673616315938|journal=The Lancet|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(16)31593-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==
Child mortality refers to number of child deaths under the age of 5 per 1000 live births. However, the child mortality could be simplified into more specific terms such as [[Prenatal development|prenatal]], [[Prenatal development|perinatal]], [[Neonatal]], [[Infant|infancy]] and [[Under 5 Infant Mortality|under 5]]. Prenatal: child death before the birth, Perinatal: child death before one week of birth, Neonatal: child death before 28 days of birth, Infancy: child death before 1st birthday, and child mortality under 5 refer to any deaths from birth to the 5th birthday.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/884617656|title=Population : an introduction to concepts and issues|last=1944-|first=Weeks, John Robert,|isbn=9781305094505|edition=Twelfth |location=Boston, MA|oclc=884617656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perinatal mortality rate: Number of child deaths within first week of birth/ total number of birth&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

Neonatal mortality rate: number of child deaths within first 28 days of life/ total number of birth&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

== Causes ==
[[File:Child Mortality vs Fertility Rate.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Child mortality is high in countries where women have many children (high [[Total fertility rate|fertility rates]]). Wealthy countries have lower child mortality rates than poor ones.]]
{{Further|Infant mortality}}
The leading causes of death of children under five include:

* [[Preterm birth]] complications (18%)
* [[Pneumonia]] (16%)
* Interpartum-related events (12%)
*[[Neonatal sepsis]] (7%)
*[[Diarrhea]] (8%)
*[[Malaria]]  (5%)
*[[Malnutrition in children|Malnutrition]] and Under nutrition

There is variation of child mortality around the world; countries that are in the second or third stage of the Demographic Transition Mode ([[Demographic transition model|DTM]]) have higher rates of child mortality than countries in the fourth or fifth state of the DTM. [[Chad]] infant mortality is about 96 per 1,000 live births. And developed country such as Japan [[infant mortality]] is about 2.2 per 1,000 live births.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; In 2010, there were estimated to 7.6 million child deaths around the world and most of it occurred in [[Developing country|less developed countries]] and 4.7&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search-proquest-com.aurarialibrary.idm.oclc.org/docview/1023015914?pq-origsite=summon|title=Global, regional, and national causes of child mortality: an updated systematic analysis for 2010 with time trends since 2000|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; million died from infection and disorder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Child mortality isn’t only caused by infection and disorder, it is also caused by premature birth, birth defect, new born infection, birth complication, and disease like [[malaria]], sepsis, and diarrhea.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldvision.org/health-news-stories/child-mortality-causes-solutions|title=Child mortality: Top causes, best solutions {{!}} World Vision|date=2016-01-13|work=World Vision|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In less developed countries, [[malnutrition]] is the main source of child mortality.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria together are the cause of 1 out of every 3 child deaths before the age of 5 and nearly half of under-five deaths globally are attributable to under nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.unicef.org/child-survival/under-five|title=UNICEF STATISTICS|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==

{{Further|Infant mortality}}

{{More citations needed|date=June 2015}}

Child survival is a field of [[public health]] concerned with reducing child mortality. Child survival 
interventions are designed to address the most common causes of child deaths that occur, which include [[diarrhea]], [[pneumonia]], [[malaria]], and neonatal conditions.  Of the portion of children under the age of 5 alone, an estimated 5.6 million children die each year mostly from such preventable causes.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.data.unicef.org/child-mortality/under-five|title=UNICEF STATISTICS|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The child survival strategies and interventions are in line with the fourth [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) which focused on reducing child mortality by 2/3 of children under five before the year 2015. In 2015, the MDGs were replaced with the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), which aim to end these deaths by 2030. In order to achieve SDG targets, progress must be accelerated in more than 1/4 of all countries (most of which are in sub-Saharan Africa) in order to achieve targets for under-5 mortality, and in 60 countries (many in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia) to achieve targets for neonatal mortality.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org" /&gt; Without accelerated progress, 60 million children under age 5 will die between 2017 and 2030, about half of which would be newborns.

=== Low-cost interventions ===
Two-thirds of child deaths are preventable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/childsurvival/index.html UNICEF - Young child survival and development].&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the children who die each year could be saved by low-tech, evidence-based, cost-effective measures such as [[vaccine]]s, [[antibiotic]]s, micronutrient supplementation, insecticide-treated bed nets, improved family care and [[breastfeeding]] practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/mdg/childmortality.html|title=UNICEF  - Goal: Reduce child mortality|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[oral rehydration therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/release35/en/|title=WHO - New formula for oral rehydration salts will save millions of lives|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empowering women, removing financial and social barriers to accessing basic services, developing innovations that make the supply of critical services more available to the poor and increasing local accountability of health systems are policy interventions that have allowed health systems to improve equity and reduce mortality.&lt;ref name="UN Child Mortality Report 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childinfo.org/files/Child_Mortality_Report_2012.pdf|title=Surveys - UNICEF MICS|website=www.childinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and [[diarrheal diseases]] can be reduced by introducing simple [[Behaviour change (public health)|behavioral changes]], such as [[handwashing]] with soap. This simple action can reduce the rate of mortality from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Val|last2=Cairncross|first2=Sandy|title=Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|date=May 2003|volume=3|issue=5|pages=275–281|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00606-6|pmid=12726975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proven, cost-effective interventions can save the lives of millions of children per year. The UN Vaccine division as of 2014 supported 36% of the world's children in order to best improve their survival chances, yet still, low-cost immunization interventions do not reach 30 million children despite success in reducing polio, tetanus, and measles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-05-01|title=Role of vaccine manufacturers in developing countries towards global healthcare by providing quality vaccines at affordable prices|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14601749|journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection|language=en|volume=20|pages=37–44|doi=10.1111/1469-0691.12568|issn=1198-743X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measles and tetanus still kill more than 1 million children under 5 each year. Vitamin A supplementation costs only $0.02 cents for each capsule and given 2-3 times a year will prevent blindness and death. Although vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality by 12 to 24 per cent, only 70 per cent of targeted children were reached in 2015.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org" /&gt; Between 250,000 and 500,000 children become blind every year, with 70 percent of them dying within 12 months. [[Oral rehydration therapy]] (ORT) is an effective treatment for lost liquids through diarrhea; yet only 4 in 10 (44 per cent) of children ill with diarrhea are treated with ORT.&lt;ref name="data.unicef.org" /&gt;

Essential newborn care - including immunizing mothers against tetanus, ensuring clean delivery practices in a hygienic birthing environment, drying and wrapping the baby immediately after birth, providing necessary warmth, and promoting immediate and continued breastfeeding, immunization, and treatment of infections with antibiotics - could save the lives of 3 million newborns annually. [[Improved sanitation]] and access to clean [[drinking water]] can reduce childhood infections and diarrhea. Over 30% of the world's population does not have access to basic [[sanitation]], and 844 million people use unsafe sources of drinking water.&lt;ref name="UNICEF WASH"&gt;[web=https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/overview/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efforts ===
Agencies promoting and implementing child survival activities worldwide include [[UNICEF]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s; major child survival donors worldwide include the [[World Bank]], the British Government's [[Department for International Development]], the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] and the [[United States Agency for International Development]]. In the United States, most non-governmental child survival agencies belong to the [[CORE Group]], a coalition working, through collaborative action, to save the lives of young children in the world's poorest countries.

== Epidemiology ==
Child mortality has been dropping as each country reaches a high stage of DTM. From 2000 to 2010, child mortality has dropped from 9.6 million to 7.6 million. In order to reduce child mortality rates, there needs to be better education, higher standards of healthcare and more caution in childbearing. Child mortality could be reduced by attendance of professionals at birth and by breastfeeding and through access to clean water, sanitation, and immunization.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; In 2016, the world average was 41 (4.1%), down from 93 (9.3%) in 1990.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; This is equivalent to 5.6 million children less than five years old dying in 2016.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt;

===Variation===

Huge disparities in under-5 mortality rates exist. Globally, the risk of a child dying in the country with the highest under-5 mortality rate is about 60 times higher than in the country with the lowest under-5 mortality rate.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest under-5 mortality rates in the world: All six countries with rates above 100 deaths per 1,000 live births are in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt;

Furthermore, approximately 80% of under-5 deaths occur in only two regions: sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; 6 countries account for half of the global under-5 deaths, namely, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and China.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt; India and Nigeria alone account for almost a third (32 per cent) of the global under-five deaths.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /&gt;

Likewise, there are disparities between wealthy and poor households in developing countries. According to a [[Save the Children]] paper, children from the poorest households in [[India]] are three times more likely to die before their fifth birthday than those from the richest households.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/en/54_12286.htm Inequalities in child survival: looking at wealth and other socio-economic disparities in developing countries] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607200429/http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/en/54_12286.htm |date=June 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The child survival rate of nations varies with factors such as [[fertility rate]] and [[income distribution]]; the change in distribution shows a strong correlation between child survival and income distribution as well as fertility rate, where increasing child survival allows the average income to increase as well as the average fertility rate to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Rosling shows the best stats you've ever seen|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html|work=TED talks|publisher=TED Conferences|accessdate=23 May 2012|date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Complications of pregnancy''' are health problems that are caused by [[pregnancy]]. Complications that occur primarily during [[childbirth]] are termed [[obstetric labor complications]], and problems that occur primarily after childbirth are termed [[puerperal disorders]]. Severe complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the [[Postpartum period|puerperium]] are present in 1.6% of mothers in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/MaternalInfantHealth/SevereMaternalMorbidity.html|title=Severe Maternal Morbidity in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=CDC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629114443/http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/MaternalInfantHealth/SevereMaternalMorbidity.html|archive-date=2015-06-29|deadurl=no|access-date=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1.5% of mothers in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sogc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Morbidity-EN-Final-PDF.pdf|title=Severe Maternal Morbidity in Canda|last=|first=|date=|website=The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309111959/http://sogc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Morbidity-EN-Final-PDF.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-09|deadurl=no|access-date=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the immediate [[postpartum period]] (puerperium), 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem.&lt;ref name="pmid7612509"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glazener CM, Abdalla M, Stroud P, Naji S, Templeton A, Russell IT | title = Postnatal maternal morbidity: extent, causes, prevention and treatment | journal = British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology | volume = 102 | issue = 4 | pages = 282–7 | date = April 1995 | pmid = 7612509 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12051189"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson JF, Roberts CL, Currie M, Ellwood DA | title = Prevalence and persistence of health problems after childbirth: associations with parity and method of birth | journal = Birth (Berkeley, Calif.) | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–94 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12051189 | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-536X.2002.00167.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term health problems (persisting after six months postpartum) are reported by 31% of women.&lt;ref name="Borders 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borders N | title = After the afterbirth: a critical review of postpartum health relative to method of delivery | journal = Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 242–248 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16814217 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmwh.2005.10.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the [[Postpartum period|puerperium]] resulted globally in 230,600 deaths, down from 377,000 deaths in 1990. The most common causes of maternal mortality are [[maternal bleeding]], [[Postpartum infections|maternal sepsis]] and other infections, [[Hypertensive disease of pregnancy|hypertensive diseases of pregnancy]], [[obstructed labor]], and [[:Category:Pregnancy with abortive outcome|pregnancy with abortive outcome]], which includes [[miscarriage]], [[ectopic pregnancy]], and [[Abortion|elective abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Global, regional, and national age-sex specific mortality for 264 causes of death, 1980-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 | journal = Lancet | volume = 390 | issue = 10100 | pages = 1151–1210 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28919116 | pmc = 5605883 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32152-9 | author1 = GBD 2016 Causes of Death Collaborators }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no clear distinction between complications of pregnancy and [[symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy]]. However, the latter do not significantly interfere with [[activities of daily living]] or pose any significant threat to the health of the mother or baby. Still, in some cases the same basic feature can manifest as either a discomfort or a complication depending on the severity. For example, mild [[nausea]] may merely be a discomfort ([[morning sickness]]), but if severe and with vomiting causing [[water-electrolyte imbalance]] it can be classified as a pregnancy complication ([[hyperemesis gravidarum]]).

==Maternal problems==
The following problems originate mainly in the mother.

=== Gestational diabetes ===
[[Gestational diabetes]] is when a woman without [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] develops [[Hyperglycemia|high blood sugar]] levels during [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/youre-pregnant-now-what/pregnancy-complications|title=Pregnancy complications {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hyperemesis gravidarum ===
[[Hyperemesis gravidarum]] is the presence of severe and persistent vomiting, causing dehydration and weight loss. It is more severe than the more common [[morning sickness]] and is estimated to affect 0.5–2.0% of pregnant women.&lt;ref name="Emergency"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Summers A | title = Emergency management of hyperemesis gravidarum | journal = Emergency Nurse | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 24–8 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22876404 | doi = 10.7748/en2012.07.20.4.24.c9206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodwin2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodwin TM | title = Hyperemesis gravidarum | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 401–17, viii | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18760227 | doi = 10.1016/j.ogc.2008.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pelvic girdle pain===
* ''Caused by'': [[Pelvic girdle pain]] (PGP) disorder is [[Chronic pain|pain]] caused by instability and limitation of mobility and functioning in any of the three pelvic joints. PGP can begin [[Childbirth|peri or postpartum]]. For most women, PGP resolves in the weeks after delivery, but for some it can last for years, resulting in a reduced tolerance for weight bearing activities. PGP affects around 45% of women during pregnancy: 25% report serious pain and 8% are severely disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPP), I: Terminology, clinical presentation, and prevalence European Spine Journal Vol 13, No. 7 / Nov. 2004 W. H. Wu, O. G. Meijer, K. Uegaki, J. M. A. Mens, J. H. van Dieën, P. I. J. M. Wuisman, H. C. Östgaard.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Treatment'': The treatment modality is based on the severity. A mild case would require rest, rehabilitation therapy and pain is usually manageable. More severe cases would also include mobility aids, strong [[analgesics]] and sometimes surgery. One of the main factors in helping women cope is with education, information and support. Many treatment options are available.

===High blood pressure===
{{Main|Hypertensive disease of pregnancy}}
Potential severe hypertensive states of pregnancy are mainly:
* [[Preeclampsia]] – gestational hypertension, [[proteinuria]] (&gt;300&amp;nbsp;mg), and [[edema]]. Severe preeclampsia involves a BP over 160/110 (with additional signs). It affects 5-8% of pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Villar J, Say L, Gulmezoglu AM, Meraldi M, Lindheimer MD, Betran AP, Piaggio G; Eclampsia and pre-eclampsia: a health problem for 2000 years. In Pre-eclampsia, Critchly H, MacLean A, Poston L, Walker J, eds. London, RCOG Press, 2003, pp 189-207.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Eclampsia]] – seizures in a pre-eclamptic patient, affect around 1.4% of pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abalos E, Cuesta C, Grosso AL, Chou D, Say L | title = Global and regional estimates of preeclampsia and eclampsia: a systematic review | journal = European Journal of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology | volume = 170 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23746796 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2013.05.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gestational hypertension]] 
* [[HELLP syndrome]] – [[Hemolytic anemia]], elevated [[liver enzyme]]s and a [[Thrombocytopenia|low platelet count]]. Incidence is reported as 0.5-0.9% of all pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Haram-2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haram K, Svendsen E, Abildgaard U | title = The HELLP syndrome: clinical issues and management.

* [[Acute fatty liver of pregnancy]] is sometimes included in the preeclamptic spectrum. It occurs in approximately one in 7,000 to one in 15,000 pregnancies.&lt;ref name=Mjahed&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mjahed K, Charra B, Hamoudi D, Noun M, Barrou L | title = Acute fatty liver of pregnancy | journal = Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics | volume = 274 | issue = 6 | pages = 349–53 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16868757 | doi = 10.1007/s00404-006-0203-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reyes&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reyes H, Sandoval L, Wainstein A, Ribalta J, Donoso S, Smok G, Rosenberg H, Meneses M | title = Acute fatty liver of pregnancy: a clinical study of 12 episodes in 11 patients | journal = Gut | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 101–6 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8307428 | pmc = 1374642 | doi = 10.1136/gut.35.1.101 | url = http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8307428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep vein thrombosis===
[[Deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) has an incidence of 0.5 to 7 per 1,000 pregnancies, and is the second most common cause of [[maternal death]] in developed countries after bleeding.&lt;ref name=uppsala&gt;Venös tromboembolism (VTE) — Guidelines for treatment in C counties. Bengt Wahlström, Emergency department, Uppsala Academic Hospital. January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Caused by'': [[Hypercoagulability in pregnancy|Pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability]] as a physiological response in preparation for the potential bleeding during [[childbirth]].
* ''Treatment'': Prophylactic treatment, e.g. with [[low molecular weight heparin]] may be indicated when there are additional risk factors for deep vein thrombosis.&lt;ref name=uppsala/&gt;

===Anemia===
Levels of [[hemoglobin]] are lower in the third trimesters. According to the [[United Nations]] (UN) estimates, approximately half of pregnant women suffer from anemia worldwide. Anemia prevalences during pregnancy differed from 18% in developed countries to 75% in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Wang S, An L, Cochran SD |chapter=Women |veditors=Detels R, McEwen J, Beaglehole R, Tanaka H |title=Oxford textbook of public health |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |pages=1587–601 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment varies due to the severity of the anaemia, and can be used by increasing iron containing foods, oral iron tablets or by the use of [[parenteral iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/youre-pregnant-now-what/pregnancy-complications|title=Pregnancy complications {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infection===
{{Main|Susceptibility and severity of infections in pregnancy}}
{{See | Neonatal infection}}
A pregnant woman is more susceptible to certain [[infection]]s. This increased risk is caused by an increased [[immune tolerance in pregnancy]] to prevent an immune reaction against the fetus, as well as secondary to [[maternal physiological changes in pregnancy|maternal physiological changes]] including a decrease in [[respiratory volume]]s and [[urinary stasis]] due to an enlarging uterus.&lt;ref name="KourtisRead2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kourtis AP, Read JS, Jamieson DJ | title = Pregnancy and infection | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 370 | issue = 23 | pages = 2211–8 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24897084 | pmc = 4459512 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1213566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pregnant women are more severely affected by, for example, [[influenza]], [[hepatitis E]], [[herpes simplex]] and [[malaria]].&lt;ref name="KourtisRead2014"/&gt; The evidence is more limited for [[coccidioidomycosis]], [[measles]], [[smallpox]], and [[varicella]].&lt;ref name="KourtisRead2014"/&gt; [[Mastitis]], or inflammation of the breast occurs in 20% of lactating women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaufmann R, Foxman B | title = Mastitis among lactating women: occurrence and risk factors | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 701–5 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1957190 | doi = 10.1016/0277-9536(91)90024-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some infections are [[Vertically transmitted infection|vertically transmissible]], meaning that they can affect the child as well.

=== Peripartum cardiomyopathy ===
[[Peripartum cardiomyopathy]] is decrease in heart function which occurs in the last month of pregnancy, or up to six months post-pregnancy. It increases the risk of [[congestive heart failure]], heart [[arrhythmias]], [[thromboembolism]], and [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pearson GD, Veille JC, Rahimtoola S, Hsia J, Oakley CM, Hosenpud JD, Ansari A, Baughman KL | title = Peripartum cardiomyopathy: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Office of Rare Diseases (National Institutes of Health) workshop recommendations and review | journal = JAMA | volume = 283 | issue = 9 | pages = 1183–8 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10703781 | doi = 10.1001/jama.283.9.1183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypothyroidism===
{{Main | Thyroid disease in women}}
Hypothyroidism (also called Hashimoto's disease) is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid in women. This condition can have a profound effect during pregnancy and on the child. The infant may be seriously affected and have a variety of birth defects. Many women with Hashimoto's disease develop an underactive thyroid. The clinician will do an exam and order one or more tests.&lt;ref name=NIH2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Tyroid disease in Women|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/pregnancy-thyroid-disease|publisher = Office on Women's Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|access-date=20 July 2017|date=1 February 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/thyroid-disease|title=Thyroid disease|last=|first=|date=6 February 2017|website=womenshealth.gov|publisher=[[Office on Women's Health]], U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ATA&gt;{{cite web | title =Postpartum Thyroiditis | publisher = American Thyroid Association | access-date = 20 July 2017 | date = 2014| url = http://www.thyroid.org/wp-content/uploads/patients/brochures/Postpartum_Thyroiditis_brochure.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fetal and placental problems==
The following problems occur in the fetus or [[placenta]], but may have serious consequences on the mother as well.

===Ectopic pregnancy===
[[Ectopic pregnancy]] is implantation of the embryo outside the uterus
* ''Caused by'': Unknown, but risk factors include [[Smoking and pregnancy|smoking]], advanced maternal age, and prior surgery or trauma to the [[fallopian tube]]s.
* ''Treatment:'' In most cases, [[Laparoscopic surgery|keyhole surgery]] must be carried out to remove the fetus, along with the fallopian tube. If the pregnancy is very early, it may resolve on its own, or it can be treated with [[Methotrexate#Abortion|methotrexate]], an [[abortifacient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ectopic-pregnancy/pages/treatment.aspx|title=Ectopic pregnancy - Treatment - NHS Choices|last=Choices|first=NHS|website=www.nhs.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miscarriage ===
[[Miscarriage]] is the loss of a pregnancy prior to 20 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-are-pregnant/pregnancy-complications.html |title=Pregnancy complications {{!}} womenshealth.gov |website=www.womenshealth.gov |access-date=2016-11-13 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114002619/https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-are-pregnant/pregnancy-complications.html |archive-date=2016-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, miscarriage is defined as the loss of a pregnancy during the first 23 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Miscarriage/Pages/Introduction.aspx|title=Miscarriage|last=|first=|date=|website=NHS Choice|publisher=NHS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215140413/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Miscarriage/Pages/Introduction.aspx|archive-date=2017-02-15|deadurl=no|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Placental abruption===
[[Placental abruption]] is the separation of the placenta from the uterus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/youre-pregnant-now-what/pregnancy-complications|title=Pregnancy complications {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Caused by'': Various causes; risk factors include maternal [[hypertension]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], and drug use.
* ''Treatment'': Immediate [[birth|delivery]] if the fetus is mature (36 weeks or older), or if a younger fetus or the mother is in distress. In less severe cases with immature fetuses, the situation may be monitored in hospital, with treatment if necessary.

=== Placenta praevia ===
[[Placenta praevia]] is when the placenta fully or partially covers the cervix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/youre-pregnant-now-what/pregnancy-complications|title=Pregnancy complications {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Placenta accreta ===
[[Placenta accreta]] is an abnormal adherence of the placenta to the uterine wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wortman AC, Alexander JM | title = Placenta accreta, increta, and percreta | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 137–54 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23466142 | doi = 10.1016/j.ogc.2012.12.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple pregnancies===
{{Main|Multiple birth}}

Multiples may become [[monochorionic]], sharing the same [[chorion]], with resultant risk of [[twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome]]. Monochorionic multiples may even become [[monoamniotic]], sharing the same [[amniotic sac]], resulting in risk of [[umbilical cord compression]] and [[umbilical cord entanglement|entanglement]]. In very rare cases, there may be [[conjoined twins]], possibly impairing function of internal organs.

===Vertically transmitted infection===
{{Further|Vertically transmitted infection}}
{{Further|Neonatal infection}}
The embryo and fetus have little or no [[immune function]]. They depend on the immune function of their mother. Several [[pathogen]]s can cross the [[placenta]] and cause (perinatal) infection. Often [[microorganism]]s that produce minor [[illness]] in the mother are very dangerous for the developing embryo or fetus. This can result in [[spontaneous abortion]] or major [[developmental disorder]]s. For many infections, the baby is more at risk at particular stages of pregnancy. Problems related to perinatal infection are not always directly noticeable.

The term [[TORCH complex]] refers to a set of several different infections that may be caused by transplacental infection.

Babies can also become infected by their mother during [[Childbirth|birth]]. During birth, babies are exposed to maternal [[blood]] and [[body fluid]]s without the [[placental barrier]] intervening and to the maternal genital tract. Because of this, blood-borne microorganisms ([[hepatitis B]], [[HIV]]), organisms associated with [[sexually transmitted disease]] (e.g., [[Neisseria gonorrhoeae|gonorrhoea]] and [[Chlamydia trachomatis|chlamydia]]), and normal [[fauna]] of the [[genito-urinary tract]] (e.g., [[Candida albicans|Candida]]) are among those commonly seen in infection of newborns.

===Intrauterine bleeding===
There have been rare but known cases of intrauterine bleeding caused by injury inflicted by the fetus with its fingernails or toenails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3109/01443618009067348 | volume=1 | issue=2 | title=Lacerations of the umbilical cord arteries inflicted by the fetus | year=1980 | journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology | pages=73–74 | author=Husemeyer R. P., Helme Sally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General risk factors ==
Factors increasing the risk (to either the woman, the fetus/es, or both) of pregnancy complications beyond the normal level of risk may be present in a woman's medical profile either before she becomes pregnant or during the pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health problems in pregnancy |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/healthproblemsinpregnancy.html |website=Medline Plus |publisher=US National Library of Medicine |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813100208/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/healthproblemsinpregnancy.html |archive-date=2013-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These pre-existing factors may relate to physical or mental health, or to social issues, or a combination of those.&lt;ref name="MMHE"&gt;{{cite web|last=Merck |title=Risk factors present before pregnancy |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/pregnancy_at_high-risk/risk_factors_present_before_pregnancy.html |website=Merck Manual Home Health Handbook |publisher=Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601003348/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/pregnancy_at_high-risk/risk_factors_present_before_pregnancy.html |archive-date=2013-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common risk factors include:
*Age of either parent
**Adolescent parents {{Further|Teenage_pregnancy#Medical_outcomes}}
**Older parents {{Further|Paternal age|Maternal age effect|Pregnancy over age 50}}
*Exposure to [[environmental toxins in pregnancy]]
*Exposure to [[recreational drugs in pregnancy]]

*[[Intercurrent disease in pregnancy]]: A disease and condition not necessarily directly caused by the pregnancy, such as [[Diabetes mellitus and pregnancy|diabetes mellitus in pregnancy]], [[Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy|SLE in pregnancy]] or [[thyroid disease in pregnancy]].

===High-risk pregnancy===

Some disorders and conditions can mean that pregnancy is considered high-risk (about 6-8% of pregnancies in the USA) and in extreme cases may be [[contraindicated]]. High-risk pregnancies are the main focus of doctors specialising in [[maternal-fetal medicine]].

Serious pre-existing disorders which can reduce a woman's physical ability to survive pregnancy include a range of [[congenital defect]]s (that is, conditions with which the woman herself was born, for example, those of the [[heart defect|heart]] or [[ICD-10 Chapter XVII: Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities#.28Q50–Q56.29 genital organs|reproductive organs]], some of which are listed above) and diseases acquired at any time during the woman's life.

===Low-risk pregnancy===
A Dutch 2010 research paper showed that "low-risk" pregnancy in the Netherlands may actually carry a higher risk of perinatal death than a "high-risk" pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Evers AC, Brouwers HA, Hukkelhoven CW, Nikkels PG, Boon J, van Egmond-Linden A, Hillegersberg J, Snuif YS, Sterken-Hooisma S, Bruinse HW, Kwee A | title = Perinatal mortality and severe morbidity in low and high risk term pregnancies in the Netherlands: prospective cohort study | journal = BMJ | volume = 341 | pages = c5639 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21045050 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c5639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22073">'''Computerized physician order entry''' ('''CPOE'''), sometimes referred to as '''computerized provider order entry''' or '''computerized provider order management''' ('''CPOM'''), is a process of electronic entry of medical practitioner instructions for the treatment of patients (particularly [[hospital]]ized patients) under his or her care.

The entered orders are communicated over a [[computer network]] to the medical staff or to the departments ([[pharmacy]], laboratory, or [[radiology]]) responsible for fulfilling the order. CPOE reduces the time it takes to distribute and complete orders, while increasing efficiency by reducing [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] errors including preventing duplicate order entry, while simplifying inventory management and billing. 

CPOE is a form of [[patient management software]].&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2009). http://healthit.ahrq.gov/images/jan09cpoereport/cpoe_issue_paper.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Required data==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}
In a graphical representation of an order sequence, specific data should be presented to CPOE system staff in cleartext, including: 

* identity of the patient
* role of required member of staff
* resources, materials and medication applied
* procedures to be performed
* operational sequence to be obeyed
* feedback to be noted
* case specific documentation to build

Some textual data can be reduced to simple graphics.

==CPOE related terminology==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}
CPOE systems use terminology familiar to medical and nursing staff, but there are different terms used to classify and concatenate orders. The following items are examples of additional terminology that a CPOE system programmer might need to know:

===Filler===
The application responding to, ''i.e.'', performing, a request for services (orders) or producing an observation.  The filler can also originate requests for services (new orders), add additional services to existing orders, replace existing orders, put an order on hold, discontinue an order, release a held order, or cancel existing orders.

===Order===
A request for a service from one application to a second application. In some cases an application is allowed to place orders with itself.

===Order detail segment===
One of several segments that can carry order information. Future ancillary specific segments may be defined in subsequent releases of the Standard if they become necessary.

===Placer===
The application or individual originating a request for services (order).

===Placer order group===
A list of associated orders coming from a single location regarding a single patient.

===Order Set===
A grouping of orders used to standardize and expedite the ordering process for a common clinical scenario. (Typically, these orders are started, modified, and stopped by a licensed physician.)

===Protocol===
A grouping of orders used to standardize and automate a clinical process on behalf of a physician. (Typically, these orders are started, modified, and stopped by a nurse, pharmacist, or other licensed health professional.)

==Features of CPOE systems==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}
Features of the ideal computerized physician order entry system (CPOE) include:
;Ordering :Physician orders are standardized across the organization, yet may be individualized for each doctor or specialty by using order sets. Orders are communicated to all departments and involved caregivers, improving response time and avoiding scheduling problems and conflict with existing orders.
;Patient-centered [[decision support]] :The ordering process includes a display of the patient's medical history and current results and evidence-based [[Guideline (medical)|clinical guidelines]] to support treatment decisions.  Often uses [[medical logic module]] and/or [[Arden syntax]] to facilitate fully integrated [[Clinical decision support system|Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS)]].
;[[Patient safety]] features : The CPOE system allows real-time patient identification, drug dose recommendations, [[adverse drug reaction]] reviews, and checks on allergies and test or treatment conflicts. Physicians and nurses can review orders immediately for confirmation.
;Intuitive [[Human interface]]: The order entry workflow corresponds to familiar "paper-based" ordering to allow efficient use by new or infrequent users.
;Regulatory compliance and security : Access is secure, and a permanent record is created, with [[electronic signature]].
;Portability : The system accepts and manages orders for all departments at the point-of-care, from any location in the health system (physician's office, hospital or home) through a variety of devices, including wireless [[computer|PCs]] and [[tablet computer]]s.
;Management :The system delivers statistical reports online so that managers can analyze patient census and make changes in staffing, replace inventory and audit utilization and productivity throughout the organization. Data is collected for training, planning, and [[root cause analysis]] for [[patient safety]] events.
;Billing :Documentation is improved by linking diagnoses ([[ICD-9-CM]] or [[ICD-10-CM]] codes) to orders at the time of order entry to support appropriate charges.

==Patient safety benefits==
In the past, physicians have traditionally hand-written or verbally communicated orders for patient care, which are then [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] by various individuals (such as unit clerks, [[nurses]], and ancillary staff) before being carried out.  Handwritten reports or notes, manual order entry, non-standard abbreviations and poor legibility lead to errors and injuries to patients, .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Institute of Medicine | year=1999 | url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/1999/To-Err-is-Human-Building-A-Safer-Health-System.aspx | title=To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System (1999) | publisher=The National Academies Press | accessdate=2012-12-08 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909192347/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/1999/To-Err-is-Human-Building-A-Safer-Health-System.aspx | archivedate=2013-09-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow up IOM report in 2001 advised use of electronic medication ordering, with computer- and internet-based information systems to support clinical decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Institute of Medicine | year=2001 | url=http://www.nap.edu/books/0309072808/html | title=Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century | publisher=The National Academies Press | accessdate=2006-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescribing errors are the largest identified source of preventable hospital medical error.

The researchers conducted an analysis over an eight-month period, implementing a CPOE system designed to stop the administration of prophylactic antibacterials. Results showed CPOE significantly improved timely discontinuation of antibacterials from 38.8 percent of surgeries to 55.7 percent in the intervention hospital.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beckersasc.com/asc-quality-infection-control/study-cpoe-systems-improve-prophylactic-antibacterial-use-in-surgical-patients.html&lt;/ref&gt; CPOE/e-Prescribing systems can provide automatic dosing alerts (for example, letting the user know that the dose is too high and thus dangerous) and interaction checking (for example, telling the user that 2 medicines ordered taken together can cause health problems). In this way, specialists in [[pharmacy informatics]] work with the medical and nursing staffs at hospitals to improve the safety and effectiveness of medication use by utilizing CPOE systems.

==Advantages==

Generally, CPOE is advantageous, as it leaves the trails of just better formatting retrospective information, similarly to traditional hospital information systems designs. The key advantage of providing information from the physician in charge of treatment for a single patient to the different roles involved in processing he treatise itself is widely innovative. This makes CPOE the primary tool for information transfer to the performing staff and lesser the tool for collecting action items for the accounting staff. However, the needs of proper accounting get served automatically upon feedback on completion of orders.

CPOE is generally not suitable without reasonable training and tutoring respectively. As with other technical means, the system based communicating of information may be inaccessible or inoperable due to failures. That is not different to making use of an ordinary telephone or with conventional hospital information systems. Beyond, the information conveyed may be faulty or erratic. A concatenated validating of orders must be well organized. Errors lead to liability cases as with all professional treatment of patients.

Prescriber and staff inexperience may cause slower entry of orders at first, use more staff time, and is slower than person-to-person communication in an emergency situation. Physician to nurse communication can worsen if each group works alone at their workstations.

But, in general, the options to reuse order sets anew with new patients lays the basic for substantial enhancement of the processing of services to the patients in the complex distribution of work amongst the roles involved. The basic concepts are defined with the clinical pathway approach. However, success does not occur by itself. The preparatory work has to be budgeted from the very beginning and has to be maintained all the  time. Patterns of proper management from other service industry and from production industry may apply. However, the medical methodologies and nursing procedures do not get affected by the management approaches.

==Risks==

CPOE presents several possible dangers by introducing new types of errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ross Koppel | year = 2005 | title = Role of Computerized Physician Order Entry Systems in Facilitating Medication Errors | journal = JAMA | volume = 293 | pages = 1197–1203 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/293/10/1197 | accessdate = 2006-06-28 | doi = 10.1001/jama.293.10.1197 | format = abstract | pmid = 15755942 | issue = 10 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Lohr  | first = Steve  | title = Doctors' Journal Says Computing Is No Panacea  | publisher = The New York Times  | date = 2005-03-09 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/09/technology/09compute.html?ei=5089&amp;en=402b792e748d99a2&amp;ex=1268110800&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssyahoo&amp;adxnnlx=1150474153-xVix1BcYkvTKJpuLyHStrQ  | accessdate = 2006-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Automation causes a false sense of security, a misconception that when technology suggests a course of action, errors are avoided. These factors contributed to an ''increased'' mortality rate in the Children's Hospital of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]'s Pediatric [[Intensive Care Unit|ICU]] when a CPOE systems was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author1=Yong Y.

CPOE and automated drug dispensing was identified as a cause of error by 84% of over 500 health care facilities participating in a surveillance system by the [[United States Pharmacopoeia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Santell |first=John P |year=2004 |url=http://www.usp.org/pdf/EN/patientSafety/slideShows2004-12-09.pdf |title=Computer Related Errors: What Every Pharmacist Should Know |format=PDF |publisher=United States Pharmacopia |accessdate=2006-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120194519/http://www.usp.org/pdf/EN/patientSafety/slideShows2004-12-09.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Introducing CPOE to a complex medical environment requires ongoing changes in design to cope with unique patients and care settings, close supervision of overrides caused by automatic systems, and training, testing and re-training all users.

==Implementation==
CPOE systems can take years to install and configure. Despite ample evidence of the potential to reduce medication errors, adoption of this technology by doctors and hospitals in the United States has been slowed by resistance to changes in physician's practice patterns, costs and training time involved, and concern with interoperability and compliance with future national standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Kaufman  | first = Marc  | title = Medication Errors Harming Millions, Report Says. Extensive National Study Finds Widespread, Costly Mistakes in Giving and Taking Medicine  | pages = A08  | publisher = The Washington Post   | date = 2005-07-21  | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/20/AR2006072000754.html  | accessdate = 2006-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by RAND Health, the US healthcare system could save more than 81 billion dollars annually, reduce adverse medical events and improve the quality of care if it were to widely adopt CPOE and other [[Health informatics|health information technology]].&lt;ref&gt;RAND Healthcare: [http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9136/index1.html Health Information Technology: Can HIT Lower Costs and Improve Quality?] Retrieved on July 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As more hospitals become aware of the financial benefits of CPOE, and more physicians with a familiarity with [[computer]]s enter practice, increased use of CPOE is predicted. Several high-profile failures of CPOE implementation have occurred,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Connolly  | first = Ceci | title = Cedars-Sinai Doctors Cling to Pen and Paper  | publisher = The Washington Post  | date = 2005-03-21   | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52384-2005Mar20.html|accessdate = 2006-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so a major effort must be focused on [[change management]], including restructuring workflows, dealing with physicians' resistance to change, and creating a collaborative environment.

An early success with CPOE by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) is the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture or [[VistA]]. A [[graphical user interface]] known as the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) allows health care providers to review and update a patient's record at any computer in the VA's over 1,000 healthcare facilities. CPRS includes the ability to place orders by CPOE, including medications, special procedures, x-rays, patient care nursing orders, diets and laboratory tests.

The world's first successful implementation of a CPOE system was at [[El Camino Hospital]] in Mountain View, California in the early 1970s. The Medical Information System (MIS) was originally developed by a software and hardware team at [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] in Sunnyvale, California, which became the TMIS group at Technicon Instruments Corporation. The MIS system used a light pen to allow physicians and nurses to quickly point and click items to be ordered.

{{As of|2005}}, one of the largest projects for a national EHR is by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in the [[United Kingdom]].  The goal of the NHS is to have 60,000,000 patients with a centralized [[electronic health record]] by 2010. The plan involves a gradual roll-out commencing May 2006, providing  [[general practice]]s in England access to the [[National Programme for IT]] (NPfIT). The NHS component, known as the "Connecting for Health Programme",&lt;ref&gt;NHS Connecting for Health: [http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/delivery/ Delivering the National Programme for IT] Retrieved August 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; includes office-based CPOE for medication prescribing and test ordering and retrieval, although some concerns have been raised about [[patient safety]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C J Morris |author2=B S P Savelyich |author3=A J Avery |author4=J A Cantrill |author5=A Sheikh | year = 2005 | title = Patient safety features of clinical computer systems: questionnaire survey of GP views | journal = Quality and Safety in Health Care | volume = 14 | pages = 164–168 | url = http://qhc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/14/3/164 | accessdate = 2006-07-08 | doi = 10.1136/qshc.2004.011866 | pmid = 15933310 | issue = 3 | pmc = 1744017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative and the [[New England Healthcare Institute]] (NEHI) published research showing that 1 in 10 patients admitted to a [[Massachusetts]] community hospital suffered a preventable medication error. The study argued that Massachusetts hospitals could prevent 55,000 adverse drug events per year and save $170 million annually if they fully implemented CPOE. The findings prompted the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to enact legislation requiring all hospitals to implement CPOE by 2012 as a condition of licensure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.todayshospitalist.com/index.php?b=articles_read&amp;cnt=614&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Hospitals Must Have CPOE By 2012 And CCHIT-Certified EHRS By 2015: [http://www.hl7standards.com/blog/2008/08/13/massachusetts-hospitals-must-have-cpoe-by-2012-and-cchit-certified-ehrs-by-2015/] Retrieved April 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Dolan  | first = Pamela L.  | title = Insurer finds EMRs won't pay off for its doctors.  | publisher = American Medical News  | year = 2008  | url = http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2008/03/10/bil20310.htm | accessdate = 2009-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also concludes that it would cost approximately $2.1 million to implement a CPOE system, and a cost of $435,000 to maintain it in the state of Massachusetts while it saves annually about $2.7 million per hospital.  The hospitals will still see payback within 26 months through reducing hospitalizations generated by error.  Despite the advantages and cost savings, the CPOE is still not well adapted by many hospitals in the US.

The Leapfrog’s 2008 Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |  publisher = The Leapfrog Group  | year = 2008  | title = Leapfrog Hospital Survey Results.  | url = http://www.leapfroggroup.org/media/file/leapfrogreportfinal.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that most hospitals are still not complying with having a fully implemented, effective CPOE system.  The CPOE requirement became more challenging to meet in 2008 because the Leapfrog introduced a new requirement: Hospitals must test their CPOE systems with Leapfrog’s CPOE Evaluation Tool.  So the number of hospitals in the survey considered to be fully meeting the standard dropped to 7% in 2008 from 11% the previous year.  Though the adoption rate seems very low in 2008, it is still an improvement from 2002 when only 2% of hospitals met this Leapfrog standard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Condom fatigue''' is a term used by medical professionals and [[safer sex]] educators to refer to the phenomenon of decreased condom use. It can also be used to describe a general weariness of and decreased effectiveness of safer sex messages. This is sometimes called "prevention fatigue".

The term has particularly been used to describe [[men who have sex with men]], though the term applies to people of all [[gender]]s and [[sexual orientation]]s.  Condom fatigue has been partially blamed for an increase in [[HIV]] infection rates, though this has not been substantiated in any study.

Condom fatigue is not a universal phenomenon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">'''Condoms, needles, and negotiation''', also known as the '''CNN approach''', is a [[harm reduction]] approach to reducing the rate of transmission of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s such as [[HIV/AIDS]] by:
* Providing [[condom]]s and teaching [[negotiation]] of [[safer sex]] with partners
* Providing clean needles to reduce transmission from [[drug injection|injection drug use]]

In contrast with the [[abstinence, be faithful, use a condom]], or "ABC" approach to this problem, the "CNN" approach aims primarily at reducing the rate of transmission among high-risk groups such as women in areas where women have low levels of social power, prostitutes and their clients, and intravenous drug users.

==Criticisms==
Pope [[Benedict XVI]] has strongly criticized reduction policies with regards to HIV/AIDS, saying that "it is a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone, that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which even aggravates the problems".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1012144/Condoms-'not-the-answer-to-AIDS':-Pope Condoms 'not the answer to AIDS': Pope]&lt;/ref&gt; This position has been widely criticised for misrepresenting and oversimplifying the role of condoms in preventing infections.&lt;ref&gt;The papal position on condoms and HIV. Douglas Kamerow, BMJ 2009 338: b1217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roehr, B. (2009). Pope claims that condoms exacerbate HIV and AIDS problem. Published 25 March 2009, {{doi|10.1136/bmj.b1206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts, including the Director of Harvard University's AIDS Prevention Research Project, have supported the Pope's position.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5987155.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9540">The '''Demographic and Health Surveys''' (DHS) Program is responsible for collecting and disseminating accurate, nationally representative data on health and population in [[developing countries]]. The project is implemented by [[ICF International]] and is funded by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] ([[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]) with contributions from other donors such as [[Unicef|UNICEF]], [[UNFPA]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], and [[UNAIDS]].

The DHS is highly comparable to the [[Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys]] and the technical teams developing and supporting the surveys are in close collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNICEF|url=http://www.unicef.org/statistics/index_24302.html|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since September 2013, ICF International has been partnering with seven internationally experienced organizations to expand access to and use of the DHS data: Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Communication Programs; Program for Appropriate Technology in Health ([[Program for Appropriate Technology in Health|PATH]]); Avenir Health; Vysnova; Blue Raster; Kimetrica; and EnCompass.

==Overview==
Since 1984, The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program has provided technical assistance to more than 300 demographic and health surveys in over 90 countries. DHS surveys collect information on [[fertility]] and [[Total Fertility Rate|total fertility rate]] (TFR), [[Reproductive Health|reproductive health]], [[maternal health]], child health, [[immunization]] and [[child survival|survival]], [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]; [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]], [[child mortality]], [[malaria]], and nutrition among women and children [[stunted]]. The strategic objective of The DHS Program is to improve and institutionalize the collection and use of data by host countries for program monitoring and evaluation and for policy development decisions.

==Surveys==
The DHS Program supports the following data collection options:
 
* Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS): provide data for monitoring and impact evaluation indicators in the areas of population, health, and nutrition.
* AIDS Indicator Surveys (AIS): provide countries with a standardized tool to obtain indicators for the effective monitoring of national HIV/AIDS programs.
* Service Provision Assessment (SPA) Surveys: provide information about the characteristics of health and family planning services available in a country.
* Malaria Indicators Surveys (MIS): Provide data on bednet ownership and use, prevention of malaria during pregnancy, and prompt and effective treatment of fever in young children. In some cases, biomarker testing for malaria and anemia are also included.
* Key Indicators Survey (KIS): provide monitoring and evaluation data for population and health activities in small areas—regions, districts, catchment areas—that may be targeted by an individual project, although they can be used in nationally representative surveys as well.
* Other Quantitative Data: include Geographic Data Collection, and Benchmarking Surveys.
* [[Biomarker]] Collection: in conjunction with surveys, more than 2 million tests have been conducted for HIV, anemia, malaria, and more than 25 other biomarkers.
* Qualitative Research: provides information outside the purview of standard quantitative approaches.

==Data==
The DHS Program works to provide survey data for program managers, health care providers, policymakers, country leaders, researchers, members of the media, and others who can act to improve public health. The DHS Program distributes unrestricted survey data files for legitimate academic research at no cost.

Online databases include: STATcompiler, STATmapper, HIV/AIDS Survey Indicators Database, HIV Spatial Data Repository, HIVmapper, and Country QuickStats.

==Publications==
The DHS Program produces publications that provide country specific and comparative data on population, health, and nutrition in developing countries. Most publications are available online for download, but if an electronic version of the publication is not available, a hard copy may be available.

==Countries==
The DHS Program has been active in over 90 countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Central Asia]]; [[West Asia]]; and [[Southeast Asia]], [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. A list of the publications for each country is available online at The DHS Program web site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhsprogram.com/countries/ The DHS Program Country List]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special Focus Topics==

===HIV/AIDS===
Since 2001, The DHS Program has worked in over 15 countries in [[AIDS in Africa|Africa]], Asia and Latin America and Caribbean conducting population-based HIV testing. By collecting blood for HIV testing from representative samples of the population of men and women in a country, the DHS Program provides nationally representative estimates of HIV rates. The testing protocol provides for anonymous, informed, and voluntary testing of women and men.

The program also collects data on internationally recognized AIDS indicators. Currently, the main sources of HIV/AIDS indicators in the database are the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the [[Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey]]s (MICS), the Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), the Sexual Behavior Surveys (SBS), and Behavioral Surveillance Surveys (BSS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhi.org/en/topics/bss.htm FHI.org BSS]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually it will cover all countries for which indicators are available. The project also collects data on the capacity of health care facilities to deliver HIV prevention and treatment services.

===Malaria===
Since 2000, DHS (and some AIS) surveys have collected data on ownership and use of mosquito nets, treatment of fever in children, and intermittent preventive treatment of pregnant women. In recent years, additional questions on indoor residual spraying, and biomarker testing for anemia and malaria have been conducted.This has however not changed the trend in malaria infections thereby calling for more interventions by researchers and scientists.

===Gender===
The DHS Program researches and trains for integrating gender into population, health and nutrition programs and HIV/AIDS-related activities in the developing world.

Questions on gender roles and empowerment are integrated into most DHS questionnaires. For countries interested in more in-depth data on gender, modules of questions are available on specific topics such as status of women, [[domestic violence]], and [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dhsprogram.com/What-We-Do/Survey-Types/DHS-Questionnaires.cfm DHS Questionnaire Modules]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth===
The DHS Program has interviewed thousands of young people and gathered information about their education, employment, media exposure, nutrition, sexual activity, fertility, unions, and general reproductive health, including HIV prevalence. 
The Youth Corner on the DHS website presents findings about youth and features profiles of young adults ages 15–24 from more than 30 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhsprogram.com/topics/youth/start.cfm The DHS Program Youth Topics]&lt;/ref&gt; The Youth Corner is part of the broader effort by the Interagency Youth Working Group (IYWG) to help program managers, donors, national and local governments, teachers, religious leaders, and nongovernmental organizations ([[NGO]]s) plan and implement programs to improve the reproductive health of young adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoforhealth.org/youthwg Interagency Youth Working Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographic information===
The DHS Program now analyzes the impact of geographic location using DHS data and [[geographic information systems]] (GIS). The DHS Program routinely collects geographic information in all surveyed countries. Using GIS, researchers can link DHS data with routine health data, health facility locations, local infrastructure such as roads and rivers, and environmental conditions.

===Biomarkers===
Using field-friendly technologies, the DHS Program is able to collect biomarker data relating to conditions and infections. DHS surveys have tested for [[anemia]] (by measuring [[hemoglobin]]), HIV infection, [[sexually transmitted diseases]] such as syphilis and the herpes simplex virus, serum retinol ([[Vitamin A]]), lead exposure, high blood pressure, and immunity from vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and tetanus. Traditionally, much of the data gathered in DHS surveys is self-reported. Biomarkers complement this information by providing an objective profile of a specific disease or health condition in a population. Biomarker data contributes to the understanding of behavioral risk factors and determinants of different illnesses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3642">{{Main|Childhood trauma}}

'''Early childhood trauma''' refers to adversity experienced in [[early childhood]]. Early childhood is defined as conception to age five, the most [[Critical period|critical developmental period]] in human life. Adversity that causes toxic stress and/or trauma experienced in early childhood can lead to a variety of problems in later life, in a critical developmental period in a child’s life spanning from conception to the age of five. Childhood experiences, both positive and negative, have a tremendous impact on future violence victimization and perpetration, and lifelong health and opportunity. As such, early experiences are an important public health issue. Much of the foundational research in this area has been referred to as Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/acestudy/index.html|title=Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
In recent years, there has been a surge of research into early brain development. Neuroimaging technologies, such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), provide increased insight about how the brain develops and how early experiences affect that development.
One area that has been receiving increasing research attention involves the effects of abuse and neglect on the developing brain,
especially during infancy and early childhood. Much of this research is providing biological explanations for what practitioners have long been describing in psychological, emotional, and behavioral terms. There is now scientific evidence of altered brain
functioning as a result of early abuse and neglect. This emerging body of knowledge has many implications for the prevention
and treatment of child abuse and neglect.
--&gt;
New research shows that even witnessing traumatic events can impact the physical development of a child’s brain — potentially leading to lifelong health and social issues.

Development of [[psychological resilience]] is believed to significantly reduce the effects of a childhood trauma on a child’s development.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://developingchild.harvard.edu/science/key-concepts/resilience/|title=Resilience|work=Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University|accessdate=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Emmy E.

In [[demography]] and [[medical geography]], '''epidemiological transition''' is a phase of development witnessed by a sudden and stark increase in population growth rates brought by improved [[food security]] and innovations in [[public health]] and medicine, followed by a re-leveling of population growth due to subsequent declines in [[fertility rates]]. This accounts for the replacement of infectious diseases by chronic diseases over time due to increased life span as a result of improved health care and disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mauck |first=Aaron Pascal |title=Managing Care: History of Diabetes in the Twentieth Century |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/612814971 |publisher=UMI Dissertations |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porta |first=Miquel |year=2014 |title=A dictionary of epidemiology |isbn=9780199976737 |edition=Sixth |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was originally posited by Abdel Omran in 1971.&lt;ref name="Omran"&gt;{{citation |author=Omran, A.

==Theory==
Omran divided the epidemiological transition of mortality into three phases, in the last of which [[chronic diseases]] replace [[infection]] as the primary cause of death.&lt;ref name=Corruccini&amp;Kaul1983&gt;{{citation |year=1983 |author1=Corruccini, Robert S. |author2=Kaul, Samvit S |last-author-amp=yes |title=The epidemiological transition and the anthropology of minor chronic non-infectious diseases |journal=Medical Anthropology |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=36–50 |doi=10.1080/01459740.1983.9987039}}&lt;/ref&gt; These phases are:
# ''The Age of [[Epidemic|Pestilence]] and [[Famine]]'': Mortality is high and fluctuating, precluding sustained population growth, with low and variable [[life expectancy]] vacillating between 20 and 40 years. It is characterized by an increase in infectious diseases, [[malnutrition]] and famine, common during the [[Neolithic age]]. Before the first transition, the [[hominid]] ancestors were [[hunter-gatherers]] and foragers, a lifestyle partly enabled by a small and dispersed population, however unreliable and seasonal food sources put communities at risk for periods of malnutrition. 
# ''The Age of Receding [[Pandemics]]'': Mortality progressively declines, with the rate of decline accelerating as epidemic peaks decrease in frequency. Average life expectancy increases steadily from about 30 to 50 years. Population growth is sustained and begins to be exponential.
# ''The Age of Degenerative and Man-Made Diseases'': Mortality continues to decline and eventually approaches stability at a relatively low level. Mortality is increasingly related to [[degenerative diseases]], [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD), cancer, [[violent death|violence]], [[accidental death|accidents]], and [[substance abuse]], some of these due primarily to human behavior patterns. The average life expectancy at birth rises gradually until it exceeds 50 years. It is during this stage that fertility becomes the crucial factor in population growth.

In 1998 Barrett et al&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.27.1.247 |title=EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES: The Third Epidemiologic Transition |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=27 |pages=247–271 |year=1998 |last1=Barrett |first1=Ronald |last2=Kuzawa |first2=Christopher W |last3=McDade |first3=Thomas |last4=Armelagos |first4=George J}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed two additional phases in which cardiovascular diseases diminish as a cause of mortality due to changes in culture, lifestyle and diet, and diseases associated with aging increase in prevalence. In the final phase, disease is largely controlled for those with access to education and health care, but inequalities persist.

# ''The Age of Declining CVD Mortality, [[Aging]] and [[Emerging infectious disease|Emerging Diseases]]'': Technological advances in medicine stabilize mortality and the birth rate levels off. Emerging diseases become increasingly lethal due to [[antibiotic resistance]], new pathogens like [[Ebola]] or [[Zika]], and mutations that allow old pathogens to overcome human immunity.
# ''The Age of Aspired [[Quality of Life]] with Persistent Inequalities'': The birth rate declines as lifespan is extended, leading to an age-balanced population. Socioeconomic, ethnic, and gender inequalities continue to manifest differences in mortality and fertility.

The epidemiological transition occurs when a country undergoes the process of transitioning from [[developing nation]] to [[developed nation]] status. The developments of modern healthcare and medicine, such as [[antibiotics]], drastically reduce infant mortality rates and extend average life expectancy which, coupled with subsequent declines in fertility rates, reflects a transition to chronic and degenerative diseases as more important causes of death.

The theory of epidemiological transition uses patterns of health and disease as well as their forms of demographic, economical and sociological determinants and outcomes.&lt;ref name="Omran"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Population pyramid forms.svg|right|thumb|Population pyramids of developed and developing nations, showing how increased lifespan and changes in fertility alter the population. Each bar represents an age category and its percent of the total population, with males to the left and females to the right.]]In general human history, Omran's first phase occurs when human population sustains cyclic, low-growth, and mostly linear, up-and-down patterns associated with wars, famine, epidemic outbreaks, as well as small [[golden age]]s, and localized periods of "prosperity". In early pre-agricultural history, [[infant mortality]] rates were high and [[Life expectancy|average life expectancy]] low. Today, life expectancy in developing countries remains relatively low, as in many [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n nations where it typically doesn't exceed 60 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html CIA - The World Factbook -- Rank Order - Life expectancy at birth]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second phase involves improved nutrition as a result of stable food production along with advances in medicine and the development of [[health care|health care systems]]. Mortality in Western Europe and North America was halved during the 19th century due to [[Sanitary sewer|closed sewage systems]] and clean water provided by public utilities, with a particular benefit for children of both sexes and to females in the adolescent and reproductive age periods, probably because the susceptibility of these groups to infectious and deficiency diseases is relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Bates |first1=Victoria M. |title=The Effect of Infrastructure on Water-Related Diseases in Rural African Communities |journal=Vanderbilt Undergraduate Research Journal |date=14 July 2012 |volume=8 |doi=10.15695/vurj.v8i0.3558 |url=http://vurj.vanderbilt.edu/index.php/vurj/article/viewFile/3558/1753}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cutler |first1=D |last2=Miller |first2=G |title=The role of public health improvements in health advances: the twentieth-century United States |journal=Demography |date=February 2005 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=1–22 |pmid=15782893 |doi=10.1353/dem.2005.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; An overall reduction in malnutrition enabled populations to better resist infectious disease. Treatment breakthroughs of importance included the initiation of [[vaccination]] during the early nineteenth century, and the discovery of [[penicillin]] in the mid 20th century, which led respectively to a widespread and dramatic decline in death rates from previously serious diseases such as [[smallpox]] and [[sepsis]]. Population growth rates surged in the 1950s, 1960's and 1970's to 1.8% per year and higher, with the world gaining 2 billion people between 1950 and the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} A decline in mortality without a corresponding decline in fertility leads to a population pyramid assuming the shape of a bullet or a barrel, as young and middle-age groups comprise equivalent percentages of the population.

Omran's third phase occurs when human birth rates drastically decline from highly positive [[replacement rates]] to stable replacement numbers. In several European nations replacement rates have even become negative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/zero.htm Negative Population Growth] About.com&lt;/ref&gt; This transition generally represents the net effect of individual choices on family size and the ability to implement those choices. Omran gives three possible factors tending to encourage reduced fertility rates:&lt;ref name="Omran"/&gt;
# ''Bio-physiologic factors'', associated with reduced infant mortality and the expectation of longer life in parents;
# ''Socioeconomic factors'', associated with childhood survival and the economic challenges of large family size; and
# ''Psychological or emotional factors'', where society as a whole changes its rationale and opinion on family size and parental energies are redirected to qualitative aspects of child-raising.

===Impact on fertility===
Improvements in female and childhood survival that occur with the shift in health and disease patterns discussed above have distinct and seemingly contradictory effects on fertility. While better health and greater longevity enjoyed by females of reproductive age tend to enhance fertility, the reduced risks to infants and young children that occurs in the later stages of the transition tends to have the opposite effect: prolonged [[breastfeeding]] associated with reduced mortality among infants and toddlers, together with parental recognition of improved childhood survival, tend to lengthen [[birth spacing|birth interval]]s and depress overall reproductive rates.&lt;ref name="Omran"/&gt;

===Economic impact===

The transition may also be associated with [[Urbanization|demographic movements to urban areas]], and a shift from agriculture and labor-based production output to technological and [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service-sector]]-based economies. This shift in demographic and disease profiles is currently under way in most developing nations, however every country is unique and transition speed is based on numerous geographical and sociopolitical factors. Whether the transition is due to socioeconomic improvements (as in developed countries) or by modern public health programs (as has been the case in many developing countries), the lowering of mortality and of infectious disease tends to increase economic productivity through better functioning of adult members of the labor force and through an increase in the proportion of children who survive and mature into productive members of society.&lt;ref name="Omran"/&gt;

==Models of transition==
[[File:Demographic-Transition-5-countries.png|thumb|upright=2.75|Demographic change in Germany, Sweden, Chile, Mauritius, China from 1820 to 2010.&lt;br /&gt;Pink line: crude [[death rate]] (CDR), green line: (crude) [[birth rate]] (CBR), yellow line: population.]]
Omran developed three models to explain the epidemiological transition.&lt;ref name="Omran"/&gt;

#''Classical/Western model'': (England, Wales, and Sweden) Countries in Western Europe typically experienced a transition that began in the late eighteenth century and lasted over 150 years to the post-World War II era. The lengthy transition allowed fertility to decline at virtually the same rate that mortality also declined. Germany might be considered another example of this model.
#''Accelerated model'': (Japan) Japan experienced a rapid transition as a result of a few decades of intensive war-driven industrialization followed by postwar occupation. The accelerated transition follows a pattern similar to the Classical/Western Model except that it occurs within a much shorter time span. China might be considered another example of this model.
#''Contemporary/Delayed model'': (Chile, [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]) Due to slow economic development, Chile and Ceylon (Sri Lanka) experienced delayed transitions that have lasted into the 21st century. Medical and public health improvements have reduced mortality, while the birth rate continues to remain high. Cultural traditions combined with political and economic instability and food insecurity mean that mortality for women and children fluctuates more than for men. [[Mauritius]] might be considered another example of this model.

==Determinants of disease==

#''Ecobiological:'' changing patterns of [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], vectors (such as the [[black rat]] partially responsible for spreading [[bubonic plague]] in Europe), and the movement of pathogenic organisms. These alter the frequency of epidemic infectious diseases as well as chronic infections and other illnesses that affect fertility and infant mortality.
#''Socioeconomic:'' political and cultural determinants, including standards of living, health habits, [[hygiene]] and nutrition. Hygiene and nutrition are included here, rather than under medical determinants, because their improvement in western countries was largely a byproduct of [[social change]] rather than a result of medical design.
#''Medical/Public health:'' specific preventive and curative measures used to combat disease, including improved [[public sanitation]], [[immunization]] and the development of decisive therapies. Medical and public health factors came into play late in the western transition, but have an influence early in certain accelerated and contemporary transitions.&lt;ref name="Omran"/&gt;

==Other perspectives==

[[File:Chile-GBD-Compare.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Leading causes of DALYs and percentage change between 1990-2013, Chile]] McMichael, Preston, and Murray offer a more nuanced view of the epidemiological transition, highlighting macro trends and emphasizing that there is a change from infectious to [[non-communicable disease]], but arguing that it happens differently in different contexts.

One of the first to refine the idea of the epidemiological transition was Preston, who in 1976 proposed the first comprehensive [[statistical model]] relating mortality and cause-specific mortality. Preston used life tables from 43 national populations, including both developed countries such as United States and England and developing countries such as Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemal, México, Panama, Taiwan, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. He used [[multiple linear regression]] to analyze the cause-specific-age-standardized death rates by sex. The estimated slopes represented the proportional contribution of each cause to a unit change in the total mortality rate. With the exception of [[neoplasm]]s in both sexes and cardiovascular disease in males, all of the estimated slopes were positive and [[statistically significant]]. This demonstrated that the mortality rates from each specific cause were expected to decline as total mortality declined. The major causes accounting for the decline were all infectious and [[parasitic diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Preston |first1=S.H. |title=Mortality patterns in national populations: With special reference to recorded causes of death |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMichael et al. argue (2004) that the epidemiological transition has not taken place homogeneously in all countries. Countries have varied in the speed with which they go through the transition as well as what stage of the transition they are in. The global burden of disease website provides visual comparisons of the disease burdens of countries and the changes over time.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The epidemiological transition correlates with changes in life expectancy. Worldwide, mortality rates have decreased as both technological and medical advancements have led to a tremendous decrease in infectious diseases. With fewer people dying from infectious diseases, there is a rising prevalence of chronic and/or degenerative diseases in the older surviving population.

McMichael et al. describe life expectancy trends as grouped into three categories, as suggested by Casselli et al.:

#'''Rapid gains''' among countries such as Chile, Mexico and Tunisia that have strong economic and technical relationships with developed countries 
#'''Slower plateauing gains''' mostly among developed countries with slower increases in life expectancy (for example, France)
#'''Frank reversals''' occurring mostly in developing countries where the HIV epidemic led to a significant decline in life expectancy, and countries in the former Soviet Union, afflicted by social upheavals, heavy alcohol consumption and institutional inadequacy (for example, Zimbabwe and Botswana)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mortality trends and setbacks: global convergence or divergence? |journal=The Lancet |year=2004 |last=McMichael |first=A |last2=McKee |first2=M |last3=Shkolnikov |first3=V |last4=Valkonen |first4=T. |volume=363 |issue=9415 |pages=1155–1159 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(04)15902-3 |pmid=15064037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray and Lopez (1996) offered one of the most important cause-of-death models as part of the 1990 [[Global Burden of Disease Study]]. Their "cause of death" patterns sought to describe the fraction of deaths attributed to a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive causes. They divided diseases into three cause groups and made several important observations:

#'''Group 1 - communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional:''' These causes of death decline much faster than overall mortality and comprise a small fraction of deaths in wealthier countries. 
#'''Group 2 - non-communicable diseases:''' These causes of death are a major challenge for countries that have completed or nearly completed the epidemiological transition.
#'''Group 3 - injuries:''' This cause of death is most variable within and across different countries and is less predictive of all-cause mortality.

The regression approach underlying the Global Burden of Disease received some critique in light of real-world violations of the model's "mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive" cause attribution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation |title=The Epidemiological Transition Revisited: New Compositional Models for Causes of Death by Age and Sex |url=https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/390/2012/10/Salomon_EpidemiologicTransition_PDR2002.pdf |year=2000 |author1=Salomon, Joshua A. |author2=Murray, Christopher J.L. |last-author-amp=yes |series=The Global Burden of Disease 2000 in Aging Populations |volume=Research paper No.01.17 |accessdate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the existing body of evidence, Salomon and Murray (2002), further add nuances to the traditional theory of epidemiological transition by disintegrating it based on disease categories and different age-sex groups, positing that the epidemiological transition entails a real transition in the cause composition of age-specific mortality, as opposed to just a transition in the age structure. Using Global Burden of Disease data from 1990, they disintegrate the transition across three cause groups: communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases and injuries, seeking to explain the variation in all-cause mortality as a function of cause-specific mortality in 58 countries from 1950 to 1998. This analysis validates the underlying premise of the classic epidemiological transition theory: as total mortality declines and income rises, communicable diseases cause less and less mortality compared to non-communicable diseases and injuries. Decomposing this overall impact by age-sex groups, they find that for males, when overall mortality decreases, the importance of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) increases relative to the other causes with an age-specific impact on the role of injuries, whereas for women, both NCDs and injuries gain a more significant share with mortality decreases. For children over one year, they find that there is a gradual transition from communicable to non-communicable diseases, with injuries remaining significant in males. For young adults, the epidemiological transition is particularly different: for males, there is a shift from injuries to NCDs in lower income settings, and the opposite in higher-income settings; for females, rising income also signifies a shift from NCDs to injuries, but the role of injuries becomes more significant over time compared to males. Finally, for both males and females over 50, there is no epidemiological transition impact on the cause composition of mortality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Current evidence==

The majority of the literature on the epidemiological transition that was published since these seminal papers confirms the context-specific nature of the epidemiological transition: while there is an overall all-cause mortality decline, the nature of cause-specific mortality declines differs across contexts. Increasing obesity rates in high-income countries are further confirming the epidemiological transition theory as the epidemic leads to an increase in NCDs. The picture is more nuanced in low- and middle-income countries, where there are signs of a protracted transition with the double burden of communicable and noncommunicable disease. A recent review of cause-specific mortality rates from 12 low- and middle-income countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa by Santosa and Byass (2016) shows that broadly, low- and middle-income countries are rapidly transitioning to lower total mortality and lower infectious disease mortality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A more macro-level analysis from the Global Burden of Disease data conducted by Murray and others (2015) finds that while there is a global trend towards decreasing mortality and increasing NCD prevalence, this global trend is being driven by country-specific effects as opposed to a broader transition; further, there are varying patterns within and between countries, which makes it difficult to have a single unified theory of epidemiological transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 306 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 188 countries, 1990–2013: quantifying the epidemiological transition |journal=The Lancet |year=2015 |last=Murray |first=CJL |volume=286 |issue=10009 |pages=2145–2191 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61340-X |pmid=26321261 |pmc=4673910}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A theory of epidemiological transition aimed at explaining not just describing changes in population disease and mortality profiles would need to encompass the role in different morbid conditions of infectious diseases contracted over the life course. The concept of linear transition from infectious diseases to other conditions referred to as degenerative or non-communicable, was based on a false dichotomy as common microorganisms have now been confirmed as causal agents in several conditions recorded as the underlying cause of many deaths. A revised transition model might focus more on disease aetiology and the determinants of cause-specific mortality change, while encompassing the possibility that infectious causation may be established for other morbid conditions through the vast amount of ongoing research into associations with infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |year=2014 |author=Mercer, Alexander |title=Infections, Chronic Disease, and the Epidemiological Transition.

The [[Flynn effect]] has been often cited as an example of euthenics. Another example is the steady increase in body size in industrialized countries since the beginning of the 20th century.

Euthenics is not normally interpreted to have anything to do with changing the composition of the human gene pool by definition, although everything that affects society has some effect on who reproduces and who does not.&lt;ref name="definitionsnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.definitions.net/definition/Euthenics|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Definitions for Euthenics|website=definitions.net|year=|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Ellen Swallow Richards]], the first female student and instructor at MIT.]]
The term was derived in the late 19th century from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb ''eutheneo'', εὐθηνέω (''eu'', well; the, root of τίθημι ''tithemi'', to cause).

(To be in a flourishing state, to abound in, to prosper.—''[[Demosthenes]]''. To be strong or vigorous.—''[[Herodotus]]''. To be vigorous in body.—''[[Aristotle]]''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;)

Also from the Greek [[Euthenia]], Εὐθηνία. Good state of the body: prosperity, good fortune, abundance.—''Herodotus''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;

The opposite of Euthenia is [[Penia]], Πενία ("deficiency" or "[[poverty]]") the personification of poverty and need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Penia.html Theoi Project - Penia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Ellen Swallow Richards|Ellen H. Swallow Richards]] (1842&amp;ndash;1911; Vassar Class of '70) was one of the first writers to use the term, in ''The Cost of Shelter'' (1905), with the meaning "the science of better living".&lt;ref name="askdefine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnKGrandy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grandy | first = John K. | authorlink = John K. Grandy | editor-last = Birx | editor-first = H.J. | title = Euthenics | series = Encyclopedia of Anthropology | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | volume = 5 Vols. | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781412952453 | doi = 10.4135/9781412952453 | url =http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/anthropology/n312.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if (and probably unlikely that) any of the study programs of euthenics ever completely embraced Richards' multidisciplinary concept, though several nuances remain today, especially that of [[interdisciplinarity]].

===Vassar College Institute of Euthenics===
[[File:Julia Clifford Lathrop first chief US Childrens Bureau.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Julia Clifford Lathrop as the first chief of the U.S. Children's Bureau.]]
After Richards' death in 1911, [[Julia Lathrop]] (1858&amp;ndash;1932; VC '80)—one of Vassar's most distinguished alumnae—continued to promote the development of an interdisciplinary program in euthenics at the college.  Lathrop soon teamed with alumna [[Minnie Cumnock Blodgett]] (1862–1931; VC '84), who with her husband, [[John W. Blodgett|John Wood Blodgett]], offered financial support to create a program of euthenics at [[Vassar College]]. Curriculum planning, suggested by Vassar president [[Henry Noble MacCracken]] in 1922, began in earnest by 1923, under the direction of Professor Annie Louise Macleod (Chemistry; First woman PhD, McGill University, 1910).&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory" /&gt;

According to Vassar's chronology entry for March 17, 1924, "the faculty recognized euthenics as a satisfactory field for sequential study (major). A Division of Euthenics was authorized to offer a [[Interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary program]] [radical at the time] focusing the techniques and disciplines of the arts, sciences and social sciences on the life experiences and relationships of women. Students in euthenics could take courses in horticulture, food chemistry, sociology and statistics, education, child study, economics, economic geography, physiology, hygiene, public health, psychology and domestic architecture and furniture. With the new division came the first major in child study at an American liberal arts college."&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1924/1924-03-17-euthenics.html |title= A Division of Euthenics was authorized to offer a multidisciplinary program focusing the techniques and disciplines of the arts, sciences and social sciences on the life experiences and relationships of women. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a typical major in child study in euthenics includes introductory psychology, laboratory psychology, applied psychology, child study and social psychology in the Department of Psychology; the three courses offered in the Department of Child Study; beginning economics, programs of social reorganization and the family in Economics; and in the Department of Physiology, human physiology, child hygiene, principles of public health.&lt;ref name="Lockwood"&gt;*{{cite book | last = Lockwood | first = Helen Drusilla | authorlink = Helen Drusilla Lockwood | title = The Meaning of Euthenics; An Essay on Action as a Tool of Knowledge. | publisher = [[Vassar College]] | location = [[Poughkeepsie, NY]] | year = 1929 | isbn = | url = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015019910382;view=1up;seq=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vassar [[Summer Institute of Euthenics]] accepted its first students in June 1926. Created to supplement the controversial euthenics major which began February 21, 1925, it was also located in the new Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics ([[York &amp; Sawyer]], architects; ground broke October 25, 1925). Some Vassar faculty members (perhaps emotionally upset with being displaced on campus to make way, or otherwise politically motivated) contentiously "believed the entire concept of euthenics was vague and counter-productive to women's progress."&lt;ref name="SummerInstitute"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/organizations-events-activities/the-vassar-summer-institute.html |title= The Vassar Summer Institute |author= Vassar Historian |date=  |website= vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher=  |accessdate= 26 August 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120304011536/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/organizations-events-activities/the-vassar-summer-institute.html |archivedate= 4 March 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having overcome a lukewarm reception, Vassar College officially opened its Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics in 1929.&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |title=The Disappointing First Thrust of Euthenics |author=Vassar Historian |date= |website=vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127020842/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |archivedate=27 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ruth Wheeler (Physiology and Nutrition – VC '99) took over as director of euthenics studies in 1924. Wheeler remained director until [[Mary Shattuck Fisher Langmuir]] (VC '20) succeeded her in 1944, until 1951.&lt;ref name="SummerInstitute" /&gt;

The college continued for the 1934–35 academic year its successful cooperative housing experiment in three residence halls.  Intended to help students meet their college costs by working in their residences. For example, in Main, students earned $40 a year by doing relatively light work such as cleaning their rooms.&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle1934"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1934/1934-03-10-coops.html |title= The college announced the trustees' decision to continue for the 1934-35 academic year this year's successful cooperative housing experiment in three residence halls. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Katharine Blodgett Hadley (VC '20) donated $400,000, through the [[Rubicon Foundation]], to Vassar to help fund operating deficits in the current and succeeding years and to improve faculty salaries.&lt;ref name="VassarChronicleMay1951"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1951/1951-05-23-blodgett-gift.html |title= President Blanding announced a $400,000 gift to the college from the chair of the board of trustees, Katharine Blodgett Hadley '20, through the Rubicon Foundation. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elmira College===
[[Elmira College]] is noted as the oldest college still in existence which (as a [[Timeline of women's colleges in the United States#First and oldest|college for women]]) granted degrees to women which were the equivalent of those given to men (the first to do so was the now-defunct [[Mary Sharp College]]).&lt;ref name="WomensCollegesUS"&gt;{{cite book

|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elmira College became coeducational in all of its programs in 1969.

A special article was written in the December 12, 1937 ''[[New York Times]]'', quoting recent graduates of Elmira College, urging for courses in colleges for men on the care of children. Reporting that "preparation for the greatest of all professions, that of motherhood and child-training, is being given the students at Elmira College in the Nursery School which is Conducted as part of the Department of Euthenics."&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

Elmira College was one of the first of the liberal arts colleges to recognize the fact that women should have some special training, integrated with the so-called liberal studies, which would prepare them to carry on, with less effort and fewer mistakes, a successful family life. Courses in nutrition, household economics, clothing selection, principles of foods and meal planning, child psychology, and education in family relations are a part of the curriculum.&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst"&gt;{{cite web

The Elmira College nursery school for fifteen children between the ages of two and five years was opened primarily as a laboratory for college students, but it had become so popular with parents in the community that there was always a long waiting list.&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

The ''New York Times'' article notes how the nursery had become one of the essential laboratories of the college, where recent mothers testified to the value of the training they received while in college. "Today," one graduate said, "when it is often necessary for young women to continue professional work outside the home after marriage, it is important that young fathers, who must share in the actual care and training of the children, should have some knowledge of correct methods."&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

===Today===
Many factors led to the movement never getting the funding it needed to remain relevant, including: vigorous debate about the exact meaning of euthenics, a strong [[antifeminism]] movement paralleling even stronger [[women's rights]] movements, confusion with the term eugenics, the economic impact of the [[Great Depression]] and two world wars. These factors also prevented the discipline from gaining the attention it needed to put together a lasting, vastly [[interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary]] curriculum. Therefore, it split off into separate disciplines. Child Study is one such curriculum.

Martin Heggestad of the Mann Library notes that "Starting around 1920, however, home economists tended to move into other fields, such as nutrition and textiles, that offered more career opportunities, while health issues were dealt with more in the hard sciences and in the professions of nursing and public health. Also, improvements in public sanitation (for example, the wider availability of sewage systems and of food inspection) led to a decline in infectious diseases and thus a decreasing need for the largely household-based measures taught by home economists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/h/hearth/hygiene.html HEARTH Library-Cornell University]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the end of euthenics as originally defined by Ellen Swallow Richards ensued.

==Relationship with eugenics==
According to Ellen Richards, in her book ''Euthenics: the science of controllable environment'' (1910):&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;
{{quote|The betterment of living conditions, through conscious endeavor, for the purpose of securing efficient human beings, is what the author means by Euthenics.

"Human vitality depends upon two primary conditions—[[heredity]] and [[hygiene]]—or conditions preceding birth and conditions during life."

[[Eugenics]] deals with race improvement through heredity.

Euthenics deals with race improvement through environment.

Eugenics is hygiene for the future generations.

Euthenics is hygiene for the present generation.

Eugenics must await careful investigation.

Euthenics has immediate opportunity.

Euthenics precedes eugenics, developing better men now, and thus inevitably creating a better race of men in the future. Euthenics is the term proposed for the preliminary science on which Eugenics must be based.}}

==Debate, misconceptions and opposition==
[[File:ЛестерФВорд.jpeg|200px|left|thumb|[[Lester Frank Ward]]]][[Image:aflexner21.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|[[Abraham Flexner]], c. 1895.]]
[[File:MargaretSanger-Underwood.LOC.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Margaret Sanger]], 1922]]
[[File:Charles Benedict Davenport.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Charles Benedict Davenport]], ca. 1929]]
Debate over misconceptions about the movement started almost from the beginning. In his comparison "Eugenics, Euthenics, And Eudemics", ([[American Journal of Sociology]], Vol. 18, No. 6, May 1913), [[Lester Frank Ward|Lester F. Ward]] of [[Brown University]] opens the second section regarding euthenics lamenting: 
{{quote|Is there, then, nothing to do? Are we to accept that modem scientific fatalism known as [[laissez faire]], which enjoins the folding of the arms? Are we to preach a gospel of inaction? I for one certainly am not content to do so, and I believe that nothing I have thus far said [about eugenics] is inconsistent with the most vigorous action, and that in the direction of the betterment of the human race. The end and aim of the eugenists cannot be reproached. The race is far from perfect. Its condition is deplorable. Its improvement is entirely feasible, and in the highest degree desirable. Nor do I refer merely to economic conditions, to the poverty and misery of the disinherited classes. The intellectual state of the world is deplorable, and its improvement is clearly within the reach of society itself. It is therefore a question of method rather than of principle that concerns us.}}

Ward later noted about the organic environment that:
{{quote|[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] has taught us that the chief barrier to the advance of any species of plants or animals is its competition with other plants and animals that contest the same ground. And therefore the fiercest opponents of any species are the members of the same species which demand the same elements of subsistence. Hence the chief form of relief in the organic world consists in the thinning-out of competitors. Any species of animals or plants left free to propagate at its normal rate would overrun the earth in a short time and leave no room for any other species. Any species that is sufficiently vigorous to resist its organic environment will crowd out all others and monopolize the earth. If nature permitted this there could be no variety, but only one monotonous aspect devoid of interest or beauty. Whatever we may think of the harsh method by which this is prevented, we cannot regret that it is prevented, and that we have a world of variety, interest, and aesthetic attractiveness.}}

Vassar historians note that "critics faulted the new program as a weakening of science and a slide into vocationalism.  The influential educator and historian of education, [[Abraham Flexner]]—one of the founders of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study—attacked the program, along with other “ad hoc” innovations like intercollegiate athletics and student governments, in Universities, American, English, German (1930)."&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle" /&gt;{{cquote|
"Well, what is euthenics?  Euthenics is the 'science of efficient living;' and the 'science' is artificially pieced together of bits of mental hygiene, child guidance, nutrition, speech development and correction, family problems, wealth consumption, food preparation, household technology, and horticulture....  The institute is actually justified in an official publication by the profound question of a girl student who is reported as asking, 'What is the connection of Shakespeare with having a baby?'  The Vassar Institute of Euthenics bridges this gap!"}}

In the summer of 1926, [[Margaret Sanger]] created a stir when she gave a radio address, called "Racial Betterment", in the first Euthenics Institute, where she praised attempts to "close our gates to the so-called 'undesirables'" and proposed efforts to "discourage or cut down on the rapid multiplication of the unfit and undesirable at home", by government-subsidized voluntary sterilization.  (from ''The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger'', vol. 1 (2003), Esther Katz, ed.)

Eugenicist, [[Charles Benedict Davenport]], noted in his article "Euthenics and Eugenics," found reprinted in the ''Popular Science Monthly'' of January 1911, page 18, 20:&lt;ref name="CharlesBenedictDavenport"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davenport | first = Charles Benedict | authorlink = Charles Benedict Davenport | title = Euthenics and Eugenics | journal = [[Popular Science Monthly]] | volume = 78 | location = New York |date=January 1911 | pages =16–20 | url = https://archive.org/stream/popularsciencemo78newyuoft#page/2/mode/2up | accessdate=September 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thus the two schools of euthenics and eugenics stand opposed, each viewing the other unkindly.  Against eugenics it is urged that it is a fatalistic doctrine and deprives life of the stimulus toward effort.  Against euthenics the other side urges that it demands an endless amount of money to patch up conditions in the vain effort to get greater efficiency.  Which of the two doctrines is true?

The thoughtful mind must concede that, as is so often the case where doctrines are opposed, each view is partial, incomplete and really false.  The truth does not exactly lie between the doctrines; it comprehends them both. What a child becomes is always the resultant of two sets of forces acting from the moment the fertilized egg begins its development—one is the set of internal tendencies and the other is the set of external influences.  What the result of an external influence—a particular environmental condition—shall be depends only in part upon the nature of the influence; it depends also upon the internal nature of the reacting [[protoplasm]].

Incest, cousin marriage, the marriage of defectives and tuberculous persons, are, in wide circles, taboo.  This fact affords the basis for the hope that, when the method of securing strong offspring, even from partially defective stock—and where is the strain without any defect?—is widely known, the teachings of science in respect even to marriage matings will be widely regarded and that in the generations to come the teachings and practice of euthenics will yield greater result because of the previous practice of the principles of eugenics.}}

{{cquote|From intensive study we realize the importance of eugenics—the right of birth, and also the subject of euthenics—the right to environment. Too little credit is given to environment when we speak of children having hereditary traits as "Like father, like son," or "Chip off the old block." Such phrases have their origin from the study of eugenics.  No one has ever taken an [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Edwards]] baby and reared it in a [[Jukes family|Jukes]] environment.}}

'''''Femalia''''' is a book of 32 full-color photographs of human [[vulva]]s, edited by [[Joani Blank]] and first published by [[Down There Press]] in 1993.{{r|Femalia-1993}} A [[reprint]] [[Edition (book)|edition]] was published by [[Last Gasp]] in 2011.{{r|Femalia-2011}} The photographs were taken by [[Tee Corinne]], Michael Perry, [[Jill Posener]], and Michael A. Rosen. The photographs are presented without commentary, except for Blank's brief introduction to the volume as a whole.{{r|Plemons-2015|p=431}}

== History ==

The word used as the book's title, ''[[Wiktionary:femalia|femalia]]'', was taken from the novel ''[[Vox (Nicholson Baker novel)|Vox]]'' by [[Nicholson Baker]].{{r|Femalia-1993}}{{r|Baker-1992|p=143}} The photographs by Corinne and Perry had been taken years before the book's original publication in 1993; those by Posener and Rosen were taken specifically for inclusion in the first edition of ''Femalia''.{{r|Femalia-1993}}

''Femalia'' grew out of Blank's long-term work as a feminist sex educator. She felt that medical and pornographic images of the female genitals were inadequate to her purposes.{{r|Plemons-2015|p=430}} In her introduction to the first edition, Blank lamented the absence of readily available photographic representations of the vulva other than heavily edited images in male-oriented pornography, and the resulting feeling on the part of a majority of women that "in one way or another, their genitals are not quite ‘normal’".{{r|Femalia-1993}}{{r|Plemons-2015|p=430}}

== Feminist response ==

Feminist authors have sharply contrasted the portrayals of vulvas in ''Femalia'' with those in typical male-oriented [[pornography]] and in biomedical sources.{{r|Duncan-2005}} ''Femalia'''s portrayals are characterized as accurate, honest, open, and truthful, as exhibiting "stark reality";{{r|Duncan-2005|p=86–87,362}}{{r|Iglesia-2014}}{{r|Lloyd-Crouch-Minto-et-al-2005}} as promoting a positive view of the vulva;{{r|Mullinax-Herbenick-Schick-et-al-2015}} as emphasizing the diversity of the vulva in different women,{{r|Duncan-2005|p=166,202,360,379}}{{r|Iglesia-2014}}{{r|Lloyd-Crouch-Minto-et-al-2005}}{{r|Green-2005|p=181}}{{r|Braun-2000|p=36}}{{r|Braun-and-Kitzinger-2001|p=264}} as well as the diversity of opinions and perspectives about the vulva on the part of both men and women;{{r|Mullinax-Herbenick-Schick-et-al-2015|p=13}} and as emphasizing female autonomy.{{r|Duncan-2005|p=222}}{{r|Braun-2000|p=36}}{{r|Braun-and-Wilkinson-2001|p=25}} By contrast, portrayals of the vulva in pornography and in biomedical science are characterized as stylized and uniform, excluding women whose genitalia do not match their models.{{r|Duncan-2005|p=86–87,360}}{{r|Iglesia-2014}} Pornographic portrayals are further characterized as commodified,{{r|Duncan-2005|p=202}} and medical portrayals as sterile.{{r|Duncan-2005|p=86–87}} Feminist sex educators have advocated perusal of the images in ''Femalia'' as an exercise to help women to regard their genitals in a more positive light.{{r|Mullinax-Herbenick-Schick-et-al-2015|p=13}}{{r|Savage-2014-12-03}}{{r|Warburton-2007|p=69}}

== Civil liberties ==

Librarian [[Sanford Berman]] has cited ''Femalia'' as an example to illustrate his thesis that libraries engage in inappropriate [[self-censorship]], often motivated by concerns about controversial sexual content, in deciding which books to stock.{{r|Berman-2000-04-16}}{{r|Berman-2001}} Berman comments, "A detailed, artistic picture of a seashell adorns the cover. Were the contents strictly shell photos, the book might make it into at least some libraries. Shells, yes. Vulvas, no."{{r|Berman-2001|p=51}}

== Science and medicine ==

=== Research on depiction and perception of female genitals ===

In a study of systematic differences in the depiction of female genitals in online pornography, anatomy textbooks, and feminist publications, ''Femalia'' was used as one of three sources of sample depictions in the feminist-publications category.{{r|Howarth-Sommer-and-Jordan-2010|p=76}} This study found a statistically significant difference between online pornography and feminist publications in depicted protuberance of the [[labia minora]], with greater mean protuberance shown in the feminist publications.{{r|Howarth-Sommer-and-Jordan-2010|p=77}} It also found greater variation in measured genital proportions shown in the feminist publications than in the other two categories of sources.{{r|Howarth-Sommer-and-Jordan-2010|p=77–78}}

''Femalia'' was used as one of two sources of sample depictions of female genitals (the other was [[Penthouse (magazine)|''Penthouse'']]) in a psychological study of the relationship between women's aesthetic perceptions of female genitals and their attitudes toward [[Gynaecology|gynecological]] examinations.{{r|Schick-2010|p=21}} More specifically, the examinations in question were [[Pap test|Pap smears]], and the relevant attitudes were anxiety, embarrassment, and likelihood of making or keeping an appointment for a [[Pap test|Pap smear]].{{r|Schick-2010|p=22–24}}

=== Educational role in clinical practice ===

The [[Royal Australian College of General Practitioners]] (RACGP) has published a guideline document, authored by Dr. Magdalena Simonis under authority of the RACGP, intended to inform healthcare professionals about female genital cosmetic surgery (FGCS), such as [[labiaplasty]], and to advise them about management of patient requests for FGCS.{{r|Simonis-2015-07}} In this document, Dr. Simonis identifies lack of appreciation of female genital diversity, not only on the part of the public but also on the part of healthcare professionals, as a contributing factor to the demand for FGCS.{{r|Simonis-2015-07|p=2–6}} She advocates the use of ''Femalia'' as a tool for patient education about genital diversity,{{r|Simonis-2015-07|p=9,13}} in part because it depicts female genitals without digital enhancement.{{r|Simonis-2015-07|p=9}} Dr. Simonis has further referenced this educational use of ''Femalia'' in slide and poster presentations intended to promote better management of the demand for FGCS on the part of healthcare professionals.{{r|Simonis-2015-09-23}}{{r|Simonis-2015-09-13-16}}

Medical anthropologist Eric Plemons has stated that:
:The feminist commitment to ostensibly unmediated representation of ‘natural’ female genitals is one whose value has also been recognized by medical experts; ''Femalia'' has had an unanticipated life in clinical literature.{{r|Plemons-2015|p=431}}
Plemons documents the use of ''Femalia'' as a resource to demonstrate the existence of female genital diversity, and to educate both clinicians and patients as to the range of normal vulval appearance. He attributes its widespread use by healthcare professionals to their belief that "it is one of very few photographic collections of ‘normal’ vulvas that exists".{{r|Plemons-2015|p=431}}

=== Transsexual genital cosmesis ===

''Femalia'' has been used as a way of assessing preferences for [[Perineum|perineal]] and genital cosmetic appearance, to improve [[cosmesis]] in male-to-female [[transsexual]]s ([[Trans woman|transwomen]]) undergoing genital [[sex reassignment surgery]] (GSRS).{{r|Plemons-2015}}{{r|Wilson-2002}} Beginning in the year 2000, surgeon Neal Wilson began showing photographs from ''Femalia'' to his prospective GSRS patients and asking them to indicate which vulvas they found most aesthetically pleasing, as well as which ones they would choose for themselves. Dr. Wilson attempted to approximate through surgery the appearance of the photographs from ''Femalia'' selected by his prospective patients, even though he held that they set "impossible standards" because of the limitations of early 21st-century surgical technique.{{r|Plemons-2015|p=429}}{{r|Wilson-2002}} Dr. Wilson has republished, in an online journal article, the three photographs most often selected by his patients. He has also provided summary statistics concerning his patients′ choices of vulval photographs from ''Femalia'', as well as a short narrative summary of the specific anatomical features that he believed to be characteristic of the most popular photographs.{{r|Wilson-2002}}

In the United States for instance, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] has described food as being in from 4 to 11 different groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nestle, Marion|authorlink=Marion Nestle|title=Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health|year=2013|origyear=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27596-6|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The most common food groups==
* '''[[Dairy product|Dairy]]''', also called '''milk products''' and sometimes categorized with [[:Category:Milk substitutes|milk alternatives]] or meat, is typically a smaller category in [[nutrition guides]],&lt;ref name=AU&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating - Enjoy a Variety of Foods Every Day |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm |work=Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing |accessdate=3 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319033600/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-guide-guide2.htm |archivedate=March 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UK&gt;{{cite web|title=The eatwell plate|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/eatwell-plate.aspx|work=National Health Service|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA's MyPlate|url=http://www.choosemyplate.gov/|work=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; if present at all, and is sometimes listed apart from other food groups.&lt;ref name="AU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UK" /&gt; Examples of dairy products include milk, butter, ghee, [[yogurt]], [[cheese]], cream and ice cream. The categorization of dairy as a food group with recommended daily servings has been criticized by, for example, the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] who point out that "research has shown little benefit, and considerable potential for harm, of such high dairy intakes. Moderate consumption of milk or other dairy products—one to two servings a day—is fine, and likely has some benefits for children. But it’s not essential for adults, for a host of reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate-questions/|title=Healthy Eating Plate &amp; Healthy Eating Pyramid|date=18 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Fruits]]''', sometimes categorized with vegetables, include [[apple]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[banana]]s, [[berry|berries]] and [[lemon]]s. Fruits contain carbohydrates, mostly in the form of sugar as well as important vitamins and minerals.
* '''[[Cereal|Grains, beans and legumes]]''', sometimes categorized as '''cereals''', is often the largest category in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[oat]]s, [[barley]], [[bread]] and [[pasta]]. An example of beans would be baked beans and soy beans, while an example of legumes would be lentils and chickpeas. Grains are a good source of [[starch]] and are often categorized with other starchy food such as potatoes. 
* '''[[Meat]]''', sometimes labelled '''[[protein]]''' and occasionally inclusive of [[legume]]s and beans, [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[meat analogue]]s and/or dairy, is typically a medium- to smaller-sized category in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[chicken (food)|chicken]], [[fish (food)|fish]], [[turkey (food)|turkey]], [[pork]] and [[beef]].
* '''[[confectionery|Confections]]''', also called '''[[confectionery|sugary foods]]''' and sometimes categorized with [[fat]]s and [[oils]], is typically a very small category in nutrition guides, if present at all, and is sometimes listed apart from other food groups.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt; Examples include [[candy]], [[soft drinks]], and chocolate. 
* '''[[Vegetable]]s''', sometimes categorized with fruit and occasionally inclusive of [[legumes]], is typically a large category second only to [[Food grain|grain]]s, or sometimes equal or superior to grains, in nutrition guides.&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=UK/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Examples include [[spinach]], [[carrot]]s, [[onion]]s, and [[broccoli]].
* '''[[Drinking water|Water]]''' is treated in very different ways by different food guides. Some exclude the category,&lt;ref name=US/&gt; others list it separately from other food groups,&lt;ref name=AU/&gt; and yet others make it the center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eine runde Sache: Der neue DGE-Ernährungskreis|url=http://www.dge.de/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=219|work=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; or foundation&lt;ref name=UM&gt;{{cite web|title=Healing Foods Pyramid™ 2010|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/umim/food-pyramid/|work=University of Michigan Health System|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the guide. Water is sometimes categorized with [[tea]], [[fruit juice]], [[vegetable juice]] and even [[soup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recommendations for healthy, tasty eating and drinking for adults|url=http://www.sge-ssn.ch/fileadmin/pdf/100-ernaehrungsthemen/10-gesundes_essen_trinken/Food_Pyramid.pdf|work=Swiss Society for Nutrition|accessdate=12 June 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is typically recommended in plentiful amounts.

==Uncommon food groups==
The number of "common" food groups varies depending on who is defining them. [[Canada's Food Guide]], which has been in continual publication since 1942 and is the second most requested government document (after the income tax form) in [[Canada]], recognizes only four official food groups, listing the remainder of foods as "another". Some of these "others" include:
* '''[[Alcoholic beverage|Alcohol]]''' is listed apart from other food groups and recommended only for certain people in moderation by [[Harvard School of Public Health|Harvard]]'s Healthy Eating Pyramid and the [[University of Michigan]]'s Healing Foods Pyramid,&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Eating Pyramid|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate/|work=Harvard School of Public Health|accessdate=23 August 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UM"/&gt; while [[Italy]]'s food pyramid includes a half-serving of wine and beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piramide Alimentare Italiana|url=http://www.piramidealimentare.it/|work=Istituto di Scienza dell'Alimentazione|publisher=Università di Roma|accessdate=11 June 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chile's food labelling and advertising law''', formally titled ''Ley 20.606, sobre la composición de los alimentos y su publicidad'' (“Law 20.606, on the nutritional composition of foods and their advertising”) establishes a regulatory framework on food security and healthy food with the intention of guiding consumers towards behaviour patterns that promote public health. After the 2012 law was enacted, its accompanying regulations came into full force on June 27, 2016. Andrew Jacobs, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', has characterized this measure as "the world’s most ambitious attempt to remake a country’s food culture" and suggests it "could be a model for how to turn the tide on a global [[obesity]] epidemic that researchers say contributes to four million premature deaths a year."&lt;ref name="nyt-feb2018"&gt;Andrew Jacobs, “[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/health/obesity-chile-sugar-regulations.html In Sweeping War on Obesity, Chile Slays Tony the Tiger]”, 7 Feb. 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]''. Accessed 3 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chile]], the law — often referred to by less cumbersome names such as ''ley de etiquetado de alimentos'' (“food labelling law”), ''ley del Súper Ocho'' (“Super Eight law”), or simply ''ley de alimentos'' (“food law”) — specifically regulates the delivery of nutritional information on foods high in [[Health effects of salt|sodium]], [[Saturated fat#Dietary recommendations|saturated fat]]s, [[Sugar#Recommended dietary intake|sugar]]s or [[Food energy#Recommended daily intake|calorie]]s. The standard also prohibits the sale of such foods in educational institutions, and limits the [[Advertising to children|advertising of these products to children]] under fourteen.

==History==
===Background===
According to a 2010 national health survey, more than 60 percent of Chile’s population suffers from excessive weight. The problem begins early in childhood, with more than 10 percent of children under six, more than 15 percent of preschoolers and more than 25 percent of first-grade children presenting with obesity. When the overweight and the obese children are considered as a group, more than 50 percent of them, according to the Chilean Ministry of Health, are found to suffer from malnutrition, which is considered the main public health problem in the country.&lt;ref name="eval-report-es"&gt;''[http://web.minsal.cl/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Informe-Implementaci%C3%B3n-Ley-20606-junio-2017-PDF.pdf Informe de evaluación de la implementación de la ley sobre composición nutricional de los alimentos y su publicidad]'' (“Evaluation report on the implementation of the law on the nutritional composition of foods and their advertising”), June 2017, Subsecretaría de Salud Pública, Departamento de Nutrición y Alimentos (Public Health subsecretariat, Department of Nutrition and Food, Ministry of Health, Government of Chile), 97 pp. Accessed 3 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation and regulations==
===Law 20.606===
The law has eleven articles; its stipulations establish: 

* The responsibility of manufacturers, importers or producers of food for human consumption to have specific labels on the nature of the product, with full and truthful information, and their responsibility to ensure that good practices guaranteeing food safety are followed in their production chain. 

* A duty of manufacturers, producers, distributors and importers of food to inform, on their containers or on their labels, as to the ingredients contained, including all additives and their [[nutritional information]], to follow food health regulations in which the characteristics and content of said food will determine the labelling, and especially to ensure that the information is sufficiently visible and comprehensible.

* A prohibition against [[adulterant|adulterating ingredients and prepared foods]] with anything that in some way may create an erroneous impression regarding their true nature, composition or quality, or that may cause damage to health, as determined by the Ministry of Health.

* A duty of preschool, elementary and secondary schools to include educational materials and exercise in order to promote healthy eating habits and physical activity, and the mandated requirement for the Education and Health ministries to have a nutritional monitoring system for students in preschool, elementary and secondary school.

* The requirement for the Ministry of Health to determine foods whose nutritional composition has high amounts of calories, fats, sugars or salt (or other ingredients, as determined by regulation), setting permitted maximums and ensuring compliance through the public health system.

* A prohibition against commercial sale or distribution in preschool, elementary and secondary schools of food products labelled as high in the regulated nutrients or calories, as well as the free delivery or advertising of such products to children under 14, including commercial tie-ins designed to appeal to children, such as toys, accessories, adhesives or similar products.

* A prohibition against labelling baby formulas and breast-milk substitutes in any way that may discourage [[breastfeeding]].

* An obligation that any food product marketed in Chile that contains among its ingredients — or that has used, in the course of its preparation — soy, milk, [[peanut]]s, eggs, seafood, fish, [[gluten]] or nuts must indicate this on its package or label.

===Regulatory regime===
Health ministry decree No. 13 (April 16, 2015), amended the government's processed foods regulation to adapt it to the provisions of Law 20.606 and specifying maximum calories, sodium, sugars and saturated fats in food; the values were set to diminish by progressive stages after the regulation's entry into force.&lt;ref name="gazette-977"&gt;''[http://www.minsal.cl/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/decreto_etiquetado_alimentos_2015.pdf Modifica Decreto Supremo N° 977 de 1996, Reglamento Sanitario de los Alimentos]'' (“Amendment to Supreme Decree No. 977 of 1996, Food Health Regulation.”), ''Diario Oficial de la República de Chile'' (“Official Gazette of the Republic of Chile”). Accessed 4 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The limits stipulated by law are:

|}

The regulation also detailed the foods that are exempted from the labelling obligation, which includes foods without added sugars, honey or syrups; without added sodium and without saturated fats; those sold in bulk or portioned out, divided and prepared at the request of the public (even if they are packaged at the time of sale); [[infant formula]]; commercially prepared minced [[baby food]], unless they contain added sugar; food prepared for medical use; food for [[weight management|weight control regimens]]; [[dietary supplement]]s and certain [[bodybuilding supplement|foods for athletes]]; and table-top [[sugar substitute]]s.&lt;ref name="gazette-977"/&gt;

==Compliance and impact==
===International impact===
Several countries have expressed interest in the Chilean standards and have considered their content in developing their own countries' labelling regulations, including [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[El Salvador]] and [[Uruguay]].

In addition, international organizations — including the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), the [[Pan American Health Organization]],&lt;ref name="ops"&gt;''[https://www.paho.org/chi/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=845:opsoms-celebra-ley-de-alimentos-en-chile-como-ejemplo-para-el-resto-de-los-paises-de-las-americas&amp;Itemid=1005 OPS/OMS celebra Ley de Alimentos en Chile como ejemplo para el resto de los países de Las Américas]'' (“PAHO/WHO celebrates Chile's food law as an example for the rest of the countries of the Americas”), 22 Dec. 2016, Organización Panamericana de Salud. Accessed 3 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Nations|UN]]'s [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] and [[World Health Organization]], the [[Union of South American Nations]] and the [[OECD]] — have expressed support for the Chilean food labelling and advertising law and regulations and have facilitated bilateral cooperation, [[Memorandum of understanding|memoranda of understanding]] and the establishment of international networks. [[Codex Alimentarius]] has urged member countries to revise regulations on labelling, while the [[World Trade Organization]] has established international discussion panels on food labelling, at which Chile has been a prominent speaker.&lt;ref name="eval-report-es"/&gt;

In addition, during [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] negotiations, the governments of Mexico and Canada have advocated for nutritional warnings on foods, inspired by the Chilean experience, but the current [[United States]] government has supported efforts of the commercial food and beverage industry to prevent the adoption of laws similar to Chile's by demanding [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] clauses forbidding the enactment of such consumer safety laws in Canada, Mexico and the United States.” Lora Verheecke, a researcher at the [[Corporate Europe Observatory]], a non-profit group tracking corporate lobbying, has declared that once such pro-industry and anti-consumer rules are enshrined into international trade agreements, it becomes extremely difficult to overturn them in the laws of trade-pact member states: “It kind of kills a law before it can be written, and once you put it into one trade agreement, it can become the precedent for all future deals with future countries.”&lt;ref name="nyt-mar2018"&gt;Azam Ahmed, Matt Richtel and Andrew Jacobs, “[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/world/americas/nafta-food-labels-obesity.html In NAFTA Talks, U.S. Tries to Limit Junk Food Warning Labels]”, 7 Feb. 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]''.

A '''functional beverage''' is a drink typically intended to convey a health benefit. Some include ingredients like herbs, vitamins, minerals, nootropics, [[amino acid]]s, or additional raw fruit or vegetables.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Examples of functional beverages include [[sports drinks|sports]] and performance drinks, [[energy drink]]s, ready to drink (RTD) teas, smart drinks (shine+), enhanced fruit drinks, [[soy beverage]]s, and [[enhanced water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flex-news-food.com/pages/16777/Beverages/Ingredients/USA/us-functional-beverages-market-young-market-growing-popularity.html U.S. Functional Beverages Market: A Young Market with Growing Popularity]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popularity ==
Functional beverages have become popular among people who want specific health benefits from their foods and beverages. Both convenience and health have been identified as important factors in consumers' decision-making about food and beverage purchases. Functional drinks are advertised as having various health benefits. For example, some claim to improve heart health, [[immune system|immunity]], [[digestion]], and [[joint]] health, while others promote themselves as [[satiety|satiating]] and energy-boosting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition_16066_ENU_HTML.htm American Dietetic Association: Functional Beverages]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
The functional beverage industry is a subsector of the [[functional food]] and non-alcoholic beverage industry. It is the fastest-growing sector of the industry, partially due to the maturity of the carbonated [[soft drink]] sector and heavy investments by major food and beverage companies.&lt;ref name="scholan"&gt;Scholan, I. "Functional Beverages-- where next? Innovation in functional beverages market is set to continue." ''International Food Ingredients'' December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the industry's growth may be the consumer-oriented market scheme whereby innovative ideas come from consumers. By 2008, in the U.S., the market share of functional beverages accounted for 48.9% of the non-alcoholic industry, which is worth $118.3 billion.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;Roberts, W. "Benefiting Beverages." ''Prepared Foods'' August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, functional beverage consumption [[per capita]]{{where|date=October 2015}} rose to 66.4 gallons, while the carbonated soft drink sector saw a decline{{when|date=October 2015}} in per-capita consumption to 50.4 gallons (decreased from an average per-capita consumption of 192.5 gallons in 2006).&lt;ref name="Functional Beverages" /&gt;

Functional beverage industry players are generally categorized into four types:&lt;ref name="packaged2009"&gt;"Functional Foods and Beverages in US. MaryLand." ''Packaged Facts.'' May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Traditional non-alcoholic beverage companies, like [[PepsiCo]], [[Fuze Beverage]], and [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. 
# Major food companies, such as [[Nestlé]], [[Altria]], [[Kraft Foods]], [[General Mills]], and the [[Campbell Soup Company]].
# Smaller-scaled private companies, like SALOMED GmbH&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.salomed.com/functional-beverages&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Austria]], and specialized companies like Traditional Medicinals and [[POM Wonderful]].
# [[Agricultural cooperative]]s, such as [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]] and [[Sunsweet Growers]].

== Product trends ==
The functional beverage industry encompasses a wide range of varieties targeting different health-related concerns.&lt;ref name="scholan" /&gt; One trend has been toward hybrid drinks, which are marketed as having benefits like thirst-quenching ability, with daily dosages of vitamins or other nutrients.&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt; Another trend is the rise of [[probiotics]], exemplified by [[Activia]] yogurt, marketed for intestinal and immune health. Other beverages, like [[Function Drinks#Function: BRAINIAC|Function: BRAINIAC]], a [[carambola]] punch energy drink in the [[Function Drinks]] line, advertise improved memory and mental sharpness. Functional drinks marketed to children have also been developed, and received attention with Nestlé's [[Boost (beverage)|Boost]].

A 2005 trend toward single-serve functional beverages was fueled by consumers' demands for convenience.{{vague|date=October 2015}} According to Campbell's director of single-serve beverages, "People know they will be seen when they are drinking single-serving beverages, so the package is critical." &lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Bob "Sweet Revenge." ''Progressive Grocer'' 2005 84(5): 34-36, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 29 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Drinks marketed toward weight loss, health, and beauty (like Nova the Essential Drink) account for a considerable [[market share]]. Lastly, "energy-boosting" functional beverage products, such as [[Red Bull]] and [[5-Hour Energy]], have been rated fastest{{when|date=January 2015}} in growth in the functional beverage market.

== Market ==

The functional beverage industry generally competes using four primary strategies:&lt;ref name="packaged2009" /&gt;
# Promote their own products as healthy and unique, by clearly distinguishing their health claims from similar products, and by specifying naturally healthy ingredients.
# Consider extensions of existing brand lines. For example, Nestle extended their Boost product line by adding Kids Essentials to the line, thereby extending the adult-focused Boost line to a new market (children).
# Larger companies compete for market share by [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquiring]] smaller companies that may own a particular market sector.&lt;ref name="packaged2009" /&gt; For example, Coca-Cola purchased Glaceau from [[Energy Brands]], and [[Odwalla]] and [[Fuze Beverage]] from their respective founders, in order to increase Coca-Cola's market share.
# Explore new functional brands by identifying new markets and demands.

Market segments of the functional beverage industry are divided mainly into four parts.&lt;ref name="scholan" /&gt; Those include hydration; energy/rejuvenation; health and wellness; and weight management.&lt;ref name="scholan" /&gt; Each segment has its own [[target market]] and consumers. Overlapping of target consumers does occur—not because of undefined market needs, but due to consumer acceptance of functional beverages.&lt;ref name="packaged2009" /&gt;

=== Hydration ===
Recently,{{when|date=October 2015}} there has been an increase in the promotion of [[hydrational fluid|hydration]] drinks.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Fowhich it marketed as an exclusive hydration drink, sold only in [[Neiman Marcus]] stores. Among the drink's ingredient list were [[antioxidant]] vitamins and fruit extracts, which the company claims "hydrate the inner and outer layer of the skin" and protect drinkers from [[free radical]]s.&lt;ref name="Benefiting Beverages"&gt;Benefiting Beverages. ''Prepared Foods'' 2009 178(8): 13-24, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 30 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gatorade]] has also created several drinks marketed as hydration beverages with various health benefits. Its "Thirst Quencher" drinks, according to advertisements, each contain an "excellent source" of various vitamins:&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt;
* 25% of the [[Reference Daily Intake|RDI]] of B vitamins (including vitamins [[vitamin B3|B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[vitamin B5|B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[vitamin B6|B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]);
* 20% of the RDI of the [[antioxidant]] [[vitamin E]]; and,
* 20% of the RDI of [[vitamin C]].

In tandem with these adjustments, a low-calorie version called G2 was also reformulated. According to Gatorade, G2 now also provides:&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt;
* an "excellent source" (25% of the RDI) of B vitamins (including vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;); and,
* a "good source" (10% of the RDI) of vitamins [[Vitamin C|C]] and [[vitamin E|E]].

Gatorade's new products are a good example of the first major strategy of competition, listed in the "Market" section above. By reformulating its products, Gatorade's goals were to promote their own new products as healthier, and to emphasize the healthy ingredients in the drinks.

=== Energy and stimulation ===
Highly caffeinated, often highly sweetened "energy drinks" have become popular on the beverage market in the United States, as well as globally, in the past decade. Consumer demand has helped generate a new generation of "energy drink" brands containing similar amounts of caffeine, calories, and sugar.&lt;ref name="bogue 2006" /&gt;

Various stimulants found in energy drinks include [[taurine]], [[glucoronolactone]], [[caffeine]], [[B vitamins]], [[guarana]], [[ginseng]], [[ginkgo biloba]], [[L-carnitine]], [[sugars]], antioxidants, [[yerba maté]], [[creatine]], and [[milk thistle]].&lt;ref name="sharon"&gt;Sharon Palmer. "Functional Beverages" http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition_16066_ENU_HTML.htm. Accessed Dec 3 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these ingredients have been approved by the [[FDA]], health experts still recommend that consumers read their energy drinks' labels, as these ingredients may not improve health.&lt;ref name="sharon" /&gt;

=== Health and wellness ===
"Health-conscious" individuals are among the target consumers of many functional beverage companies. To target these individuals, many companies have introduced functional beverages which contain less sugar, and therefore less calories.{{synthesis inline|date=October 2015}} For example, [[VitaminWater]] 10 contains only 10 calories per serving (25 calories for a 351mL bottle, with 7.5&amp;nbsp;grams of sugar). An entire bottle also contains 250% of the RDI of vitamin C,&lt;ref name="rebecca"&gt;Rebecca Wright. "Functional Beverages: Surviving or Thriving?" http://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/articles/2009/07/functional-beverages-thriving-or-surviving. Retrieved December 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and 25% of the RDI of vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt; VitaminWater 10 lowered its calorie content by using an all-natural sweetener ([[stevia]]) extracted from the ''[[Stevia rebaudiana]]'' plant. This also makes it possible for the company to advertise VitaminWater 10 as "natural".&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt;

=== Weight management ===
With increased worries about [[obesity]] and its implications on health, combined with consumer demand for convenience goods, consumer demand has increased for easy weight loss methods that can be easily integrated into daily lifestyles.&lt;ref name="william" /&gt; Functional beverages are striving to market themselves as such, by adding ingredients that are claimed to promote weight loss.&lt;ref name="william"&gt;"Benefiting Beverages." ''Prepared Foods.'' 1 August 2009. Assessed 3 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:
* Nestlé and The Coca-Cola Company have partnered to produce [[Enviga]], which they describe as a "calorie-burning beverage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/healthy-weight-commitment Coca-Cola – Press Center – New Products – Enviga Accessed 2 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Skinny Water (owned by Skinny Nutritional Corp.) and [[Nutrisoda]]'s Slenderized (owned by PepsiCo) have both used a [[polyphenol]] called [[epigallocatechin gallate]] (EGCG) in their products for their "{{Sic|metabolize boosting}} effect". 
* A tea extract called "Blue California", which has a 95% EGCG content, is now on the market.&lt;ref&gt;Landi, Heather "Tea Revolution." ''Beverage World'' 2009 128(10): 78, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 1 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Some investigators report slimming actions induced by [[chlorogenic acid]]s from [[green coffee]], but further investigations need to be performed.&lt;!-- Need to list the risks here --&gt;

===Sales===
As of 2008, based on dollar sales, the most popular functional beverages, in order, were:&lt;ref name="Functional Beverages"&gt;Functional Beverages. ''Beverage World'' 2008 127(3): 14, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 29 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
# Health and wellness drinks, with 62.2% of dollar sales
# Hydration drinks (28%)
# Energy/Rejuvenation drinks (8.4%)
# Weight Management drinks (1.2%)

== Consumer demographic ==
According to a 2006 article, the functional beverage market's [[consumer group]] is characterized as well-educated females aged 35–55, belonging to the upper middle, middle, and lower middle classes.&lt;ref name="bogue 2006" /&gt; This is thought to result from this group's perceptions that functional drinks produce positive health beliefs, as well as their relatively high [[disposable income]].&lt;ref name="bogue 2006"&gt;Bogue, J., Seymour, C. and Sorenson, D. "Market-oriented new product development of meal replacement and meal complement beverages." ''Journal of Food Products Marketing’’, 2006 12(3): 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 article stated that within the energy and stimulant drink sector, young adults aged 18 to 34 are considered to be the main target market, as evidenced by high consumption rates.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, C. and Emerton, V. "Food and Drinks through the Lifecycle." ''Surrey:Leatherhead International’’. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to constant changes in attitudes about different types of functional beverages, these target markets could change.&lt;ref name="Van"&gt;Van Trijp, H.C.M. and Van Der Lans, I.A. (2007). "Consumer perceptions of nutrition and health claims." ''Appetite’’. 2007 48(3):305–324&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health concerns ==
Health experts are concerned about the increased consumption and popularity of functional beverages. Although these beverages may serve to hydrate the individual, they may not mitigate or even address today's major health issues, such as [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], and [[cancer]]. Most functional beverages are sweetened, and consumption of sweetened beverages is associated with higher levels of obesity and heart disease.&lt;ref name="ADA, Functionaldrinks"&gt;http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition_16066_ENU_HTML.htm American Dietetic Association – Functional Beverages Accessed 2 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these drinks contain significant amounts of [[sugars]] and hence calories, which would add to discretionary and total [[caloric]] intake. As such, these ingredients pose health risks because of what they contain (sugar and caffeine) or what they replace in the diet (vitamin and mineral-rich foods).

Another set of concerns is that some functional beverages contain ingredients that have not been sufficiently studied for health benefits, safety, and dosage. At the same time, many functional beverages have higher levels of a certain ingredient, like caffeine—which, when consumed in large amounts, is associated with heart disease and cancer.&lt;!-- need citation --&gt; &lt;ref name="ADA, Functionaldrinks" /&gt;

=== Sugar content ===
Many functional drinks have high levels of sugar, even if they have other "healthy" ingredients. For example, a 20oz bottle of [[Glacéau]]'s [[VitaminWater]] has been reported to contain approximately 33 g of sugar, which is similar to the sugar content of a can of [[Coca-Cola]]. This prompted [[The Coca-Cola Company]] to be sued for claiming that VitaminWater was a healthy beverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cspinet.org/new/200901151.html  [[Coca-Cola]] was sued for Fraudulent Claims on Obesity-Promoting "Vitaminwater" Accessed 2 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Given their sugar content, many functional beverages may not be as healthy an alternative as other commonly consumed beverages. In addition, the sugar content of such beverages promotes dental cavities amongst frequent users.

=== Energy drinks ===
{{Main article|Energy drink}}
In some functional beverages, particularly energy drinks, the caffeine content can be up to 141 milligrams per serving, more than an average 8-ounce cup of coffee containing 133&amp;nbsp;mg of caffeine. There have been reports to Health Canada of adverse reactions involving energy drinks.&lt;ref name="Health Canada"&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/iyh-vsv/prod/energy-energie-eng.php#he It's Your Health – Safe Use of Energy Drinks. Accessed 2 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{coi|date=September 2018}}
'''Guardian24''' Ltd are a UK based [[solution]] provider for the safety of lone workers throughout the UK and Ireland. The company was founded in Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guardian24.co.uk/guardian24s-history-and-vision/|date=2015-09-03 |accessdate=2015-09-28|title= Guardian24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==
In 2000, Guardian24 developed the UK’s first lone worker support solution with a sole focus on protecting those who work alone from injury or attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guardian24.co.uk/guardian24s-history-and-vision/|date=2015-09-03 |accessdate=2015-09-28|title= Guardian24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having begun trading in Ireland in 1998, the company was acquired by the [[Send for Help Group]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sendforhelp.co.uk/?p=24|date=2015-02-03 |accessdate=2015-09-28|title= Send for Help}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professionalsecurity.co.uk/products/guarding/guardian24-acquired/|date=2015-04-20 |accessdate=2015-09-28|title= Professional Security News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthandsafetyatwork.com/hsw/products-services/lone-worker-co-acquires-guardian24|date=2015-04-10 |accessdate=2015-09-28|title= Health and Safety at Work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Send For Help was announced as one of Britain’s fastest growing companies for a second consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fasttrack.co.uk/company_profile/send-for-help-2/&lt;/ref&gt; The Fast Track 100 list, which is published annually in [[The Sunday Times]], ranks Britain’s top 100 private companies with the fastest growing sales over their latest three years. The company ranks at no. 47 in 2016 and no. 80 in the 2017 league table.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fasttrack.co.uk/league-tables/fast-track-100/league-table/|title=League table - Fast Track|last=TWK|work=Fast Track|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service==
Guardian24’s lone worker safety service consists of a physical safety alarm, known as the MicroGuard device &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.yudu.com/web/1jybr/0A1vxp9/THSIssue18April2015/flash/resources/39.htm |accessdate=2015-09-28|title= Tomorrow's Health and Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as smartphone, tablet and mobile phone applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ee.co.uk/business-edge-corporate/ee-for-the-public-sector/articles/keep-colleagues-connected-and-safe-with-lone-worker|date=2015-04-10 |accessdate=2015-09-28|title= EE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guardian24 has a 24/7 Alarm Receiving Centre (ARC) where trained controllers deal with emergency calls on a daily basis.

==Awards and Accreditations==
In 2016, Guardian24 were awarded the '''National Security Inspectorate (NSI) Guarding Gold'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.org.uk/our-services/certification/|date=2015-01-10 |accessdate=2015-09-28|title= NSI}}&lt;/ref&gt; This certifies that the company have met the requirements of BS 8484:2016, along with ISO 9001,  recognising British Standards for Lone Worker Security.

Guardian24 were awarded ''''Secured by Design'''' status for the MicroGuard personal safety device. 'Secured by Design' is the official UK Police initiative that supports 'designing out crime' through the use of high quality products and processes.

[[periodontitis|Apical periodontitis]] is typically the body’s defense response to the threat of microbial invasion from the [[root canal]].&lt;ref name="Lopez-Marcos, JF. Aetiology pages 58-62"&gt;Lopez-Marcos, JF. Aetiology, classification and pathogenesis of pulp and periapical disease, ''Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal'' 2004 9:Suppl pages 58-62, 52-7.&lt;/ref&gt;   Primary among the members of the host defense mechanism is the polymorphonuclear [[leukocyte]], otherwise known as the [[neutrophil]].  The task of the neutrophil is to locate and destroy [[microbe]]s that intrude into the [[human anatomy|body]] – anywhere in the body – and they represent the hallmark of acute [[inflammation]].&lt;ref&gt;Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The body's response to microbial invasion==
[[File:Chronic apical periodontitis (with arrows).jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tooth #5, the upper right first premolar, after extraction.  The two single-headed arrows point to the [[Cementoenamel junction|CEJ]], which is the line separating the [[crown (tooth)|crown]] (in this case, heavily decayed) and the roots.  The double headed arrow (bottom right) shows the extent of the abscess that surrounds the apex of the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|palatal]] root.]]
In response to tissue [[injury]], neutrophils leave the [[circulatory system]] in great numbers and gather at the site of tissue injury.  They are drawn to the site by [[chemotaxis]], following a [[concentration gradient]] of chemotactic [[molecule]]s until they reach the site of greatest concentration: the site of injury and microbial presence.  Once there, the [[antimicrobial]] action of [[superoxide]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]], derived from the [[metabolism|metabolic processes]] of the neutrophils, act to combat the microbial invasion.  While primarily mobilized to kill the invading [[microorganism]]s, the neutrophils actually cause a significant amount of host tissue damage as well.  Although the neutrophils themselves rarely remain alive for more than a few days, the excessive accumulation of dead neutrophils and the [[enzyme]]s they released is a major cause of tissue breakdown in the acute phases of apical [[periodontitis]].&lt;ref name="Raven, PH 1999"&gt;Raven, PH, Johnson, GB. ''Biology'', 5th Edition. Boston: McGraw-Hill Companies, 1999. page 1072.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after inflammation has been initiated, [[macrophage]]s enter the scene and, if not controlled by the initial ambush of neutrophils and their tactics, the microbial invasion is faced with a second strike consisting of these [[leukocyte]]s, along with [[lymphocyte]]s.  Together, the cells of this second strike compose the bulk of the apical periodontitis lesion and serve an important role in the subsequent chronic phase of inflammation of apical periodontitis, as they can live for many months.&lt;ref name="Raven, PH 1999"/&gt;   Some researchers posit that it must not be macrophages that are involved, as they could not appropriately discriminate between the varied array of [[opson]]ized entities as necessary, and that, in reality, the properties ascribed to the macrophage in the initiation phase of the inflammatory response actually belong to the lymphatic [[dendritic cell]].  It is unclear, however, if the latter is a distinct population of cells or if it is merely a particularly specialized strain of macrophage.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, MH, ''Histology: A Text and Atlas'', 3rd Edition. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 1995. page 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[infection]]s such as these occur elsewhere in the body, the [[immune system|host defense system]], able to travel the body via the circulatory system, is, more often than not, capable of appropriately gaining access to the site of infection in order to mount a proper and successful retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, MH, ''Histology: A Text and Atlas'', 3rd Edition. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 1995. page 315.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dental pulp]], which is a richly [[blood supply|vascularized]] and [[nerve|innervated]] tissue, is enclosed by tissues, such as [[dentin]], which are incapable of expanding. It has terminal blood flow and possesses only small-gauge circulatory access at the [[apical foramen]]. All of these characteristics severely constrain the defensive capacity of the pulp tissue when faced with the different aggressions to which it may be subjected.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez-Marcos, JF. Aetiology, classification and pathogenesis of pulp and periapical disease, ''Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal'' 2004, 9:Suppl, 58-62, 52-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Castellucci, A page 160"&gt;Castellucci, A, Blumenkranz, U: Periapical Disease.  In Castellucci, A, editor: ''Endodontics'', Volume 1, Las Vegas: Las Vegas Institute, page 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, [[necrosis|necrotic tissue]] located within the pulp chamber and canals provide nutrients for [[pathology|pathogenic]] [[bacteria]] to grow and form a periapical lesion;&lt;ref&gt;Fidel, RAS. Complicated crown fracture: a case report, ''Braz Dent J'' 2006 17:1 pages 83-86.&lt;/ref&gt;  the infected tooth serves as a biochemically and physiologically ideal location for bacterial growth and maturation, and, in essence, acts as a [[Safety|refuge]] from which bacterial reinforcements can mobilize to the periapical lesion.&lt;ref name="Baumgarten, JC 2002. page 501"&gt;Baumgarten, JC, Hutter, JW: Endodontic Microbiology and Treatment of Infections.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 501.&lt;/ref&gt;   It is this concept that serves as the basis for conventional [[endodontic therapy]]; both chemical and mechanical [[debridement]] procedures are essential in effectively disrupting and removing the microbial [[ecosystem]] that is associated with the [[disease]] process.&lt;ref name="Baumgarten, JC 2002. page 501"/&gt;   Thus, whenever a pulp is removed and the canal treated and filled in a manner that is compatible with or favorable to a [[physiology|physiologic]] reaction, we may expect a satisfactory percentage of [[endodontics|endodontic]] success.&lt;ref&gt;Blayney, JR: JADA 15:1217-1221, 1928, quoted by Lovdahl, PE, Gutmann, JL: Problems in Nonsurgical Root Canal Retreatment.  In Gutmann, JL, editor: ''Problem Solving in Endodontics'', 3rd Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 1997, page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breakthrough in [[bacteriology]]==
In 1890, W.D. Miller, considered the father of oral [[microbiology]], was the first to associate pulpal disease with the presence of [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;Sgan-Cohen, H.D. Oral hygiene: past history and future recommendations. ''Int J Dent Hyg'' 2005 3:2 pages 54–58.&lt;/ref&gt;   This was confirmed by Kakehashi, who, in 1965, proved that bacteria were the cause of pulpal and periradicular disease in studies using [[animal model]]s; pulpal exposures were initiated in both normal and [[Asepsis|germ-free]] [[rat]]s, and while no pathologic changes were exhibited in the [[mouth]]s of the germ-free rats, introduction of the normal oral microbial [[flora]] produced pulpal [[necrosis]] and led to periradicular [[lesion]] formation in the normal rats.&lt;ref name="Kak"&gt;Kakehashi, S.  The effects of surgical exposures of dental pulps in germ-free and conventional laboratory rats. ''Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol'' 1965 Sep 20 pages 340-349.&lt;/ref&gt;   The germ-free rats healed regardless of the severity of pulpal exposure, demonstrating that the presence or absence of bacteria was the determinant for pulpal and periapical disease.&lt;ref name="Kak"/&gt;

Moreover, it has since been discovered that endodontic infections are polymicrobial.  In fact, the bacteria present within endodontic infections are thoroughly similar to the bacteria that are involved in [[periodontal disease]].  It has also been shown that certain [[enzyme]]s produced by bacteria are detrimental to the host, and can work in concert with the destructive capability of the enzymes released by dying neutrophils.  Recent studies have revealed that the gene for [[collagenase]]s could be detected in stains of ''[[Porphyromonas gingivalis]]'', one of the many endodontic infective agents that are also involved in periodontal disease.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgarten, JC, Hutter, JW: Endodontic Microbiology and Treatment of Infections.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it has been proven that a positive correlation exists between the number of bacteria in an infected [[root canal]] and the size of the resultant periradicular [[radiodensity|radiolucency]].&lt;ref&gt;Baumgarten, JC, Hutter, JW: Endodontic Microbiology and Treatment of Infections.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 503.&lt;/ref&gt;

In attempting to resolve a periapical lesion of endodontic origin, it is essential to be conscious of these principles in order to effectively combat the infection.  Without proper consideration for the causes, the pulpal and periapical infection cannot be suitably treated, for effective patient management requires the correct [[diagnosis]] and removal of the cause of the infection of endodontic origin to correct the associated periapical lesion.  Because periapical disease is almost inevitably preceded by pulp disease,&lt;ref name="Lopez-Marcos, JF. Aetiology pages 58-62"/&gt; proper chemomechanical debridement of the infected root canals, together with [[incision and drainage]] of associated periradicular swellings, will usually allow for rapid improvement in patient [[signs and symptoms]].&lt;ref name="Baumgarten, JC 2002. page 511"&gt;Baumgarten, JC, Hutter, JW: Endodontic Microbiology and Treatment of Infections.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 511.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same end can be accomplished by [[dental extraction|extracting]] the involved [[tooth]].&lt;ref name="Castellucci, A page 160"/&gt;

==Source of infection==
Although periapical changes will be in response to pulpal changes the majority of the time, it is still important to determine the disease process sequence.  When the disease process is of pulpal origin, the pulpal infection and necrosis may drain not only through the apical foramen, but also through an accessory canal, which may present radiographically as a periradicular or [[Furcation defect|furcation radiolucency]].  This may further lead to furcal involvement through loss of clinical attachment and [[alveolar bone]].  A cursory clinical examination and radiographic analysis can easily lead the [[clinician]] off the right course and pulpal involvement might be overlooked when the tooth is asymptomatic.  Similarly, a [[Abscesses of the periodontium|periodontal abscess]] may very well appear to be pulpal in origin, when in fact it is not.  Notwithstanding the tissue of origin, though, when it is determined that there is a pulpal involvement to the periodontal lesion, the endodontic infection should be controlled prior to beginning definitive management of the periodontal lesion, especially when regenerative or [[bone graft|bone grafting techniques]] are planned.&lt;ref&gt;Novak, J: Classification of Diseases and Conditions Affecting the Periodontium.  In Newman, MG, editor: ''Carranza’s Clinical Periodontology'', 9th Edition. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Company, 2002. page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focusing on proper procedure==
To achieve [[healing]] of the periapical lesion, one must obtain and maintain a [[Sterilization (microbiology)|decontaminated]] [[root canal|root canal system]].  ''System'' is to be emphasized, because the root canal system does not merely consist of tapering cone-shaped canals from [[Body orifice|orifice]] to [[wikt:apex|apex]], but rather, can and often is an intricate [[labyrinth]] of canals that diverge and weave to form an elaborate web of anastomosing passages.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, JL, Witherspoon DE: Obturation of the Cleaned and Shaped Root Canal System.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. pages 296, 332 and 349.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is precisely because of this reality that “it is important to appreciate that files produce shape, but it is essential to understand that irrigants clean [the] root canal system.&lt;ref&gt;Ruddle, CJ: Cleaning and Shaping the Root Canal System.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 235.&lt;/ref&gt;  Copious amounts of [[sodium hypochlorite]] are necessary to utterly dissolve all remnants of pulp tissue as well as completely destroy all [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ruddle, CJ: Cleaning and Shaping the Root Canal System.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 258.&lt;/ref&gt; The tooth stability does not undergo major changes after surgery comparated with the initial value which was determined before establishing any kind of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Conventional therapy===
Many authoritative clinicians and [[research]]ers advise&lt;ref name="Baumgarten, JC 2002. page 511"/&gt; completing [[endodontic therapy]] as soon as possible, especially in situations necessitating incision and drainage, in order to remove the cause of infection without delay.  Recent studies have shown, however, that intracanal application of certain [[medicament]]s prior to the completion of endodontic therapy may produce highly favorable results when followed by conventional therapy, even when the periapical area is very large. The use of [[chlorhexidine gluconate]] and [[calcium hydroxide]] for [[infection control]] was shown to lead to substantial healing of a large periapical lesion.&lt;ref&gt;Öztan, M.D. Endodontic treatment of teeth associated with a large periapical lesion, ''Int Endo J'' Jan 2002 35:1 pages 73-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional thought that it is necessary to complete endodontic therapy as quickly as possible may be related only to the initial steps of therapy, namely, a thorough instrumentation, thus ensuring a proper biomechanical preparation.  While completion of the procedure with immediate obturation might secure the decontaminated root canal system, delaying this step in order to allow for application of medicaments has been shown to be beneficial.  Periodic application and renewal of calcium hydroxide over a year’s time (four applications over a 12-month period), has been shown to represent a nonsurgical approach to resolving even extensive inflammatory periapical lesions.&lt;ref&gt;Soares, J. Nonsurgical treatment of extensive cyst-like periapical lesion of endodontic origin, ''Int Endo J'' Jul 2006 39:7 pages 566-575.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antibiotic coverage===
The use of adjunctive [[antibiotics]] is usually uncalled for when proper debridement procedures can be executed in a conventional periapical lesion of endodontic origin; however, they can be centrally important to the treatment of a progressive or persistent infection.&lt;ref name="Baumgarten, JC 2002. page 511"/&gt;  It has been proposed, however, that disinfection of the root canal by means of an antibacterial agent, such as [[propolis]]&lt;ref&gt;Hajdaragic-Ibricevic, H. The effects of propolis on the reparative processes of the pulp and histological analysis of the pulp 28 days after artificial exposure and covering with propolis, ''Stomatol Vjesn'' 1983 12:3-4 pages 111-114.&lt;/ref&gt;  or [[otosporin]], can lead to improved healing by reducing and controlling pulpal and periapical inflammatory reactions.  This would, in turn, promote the healing process as well as provide for better control, prevention and reduction of post-treatment [[pain]] and discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;da Silva, Fabiane B. Natural medicaments in endodontics - a comparative study of the anti-inflammatory action, ''Braz Oral Res'' June 2004 18:2 pages 174-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biologic mediators==
There are a number of active biologic mediators that have been implicated in promoting apical resorption.  [[Matrix metalloproteinase]]s (MMPs), which are [[endogenous]] zinc-dependent [[catabolism|catabolic]] [[enzyme]]s, are primarily responsible for the degradation of much of the tissue matrices built on such architecturally important substances as [[collagen]] and [[proteoglycan]] core proteins.  Their biologic activities have been extensively researched and reviewed, and their importance in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis is obvious.  Furthermore, concentrations of IgG [[antibodies]] have been found to be nearly five times higher in lesions of apical periodontitis than in uninflamed [[oral mucosa]].&lt;ref name="Nair, PNR 2002. page 470"&gt;Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 470.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prostaglandins]], specifically PGE2 and PGI2, are important in [[inflammation]] and have been implicated in promoting apical resorption.  This is because [[neutrophil]]s, which are rich sources of PGE2, are present when the majority of rapid bone loss occurs during the initial stages of apical periodontitis.  It has been illustrated clinically that [[parenteral]] administration of [[indomethacin]], an inhibitor of [[cyclooxygenase]], can act to suppress resorption of apical hard tissue.&lt;ref name="Nair, PNR 2002. page 470"/&gt;

The predominant mechanism of bone resorption in a periapical lesion, as in the rest of the body, is the performed by [[osteoclast]]s.  In the periapical lesion, mediators that are normally produced primarily only by [[osteoblast]]s are released by many other cells as well, overstimulating proosteoclasts.  As a result, these begin to proliferate and several cells fuse to form [[multinucleated giant cell]]s capable of spreading over the infected, injured site and cause resorption of the periapical [[alveolar bone]].&lt;ref&gt;Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 468.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endodontic success and failure==
[[Image:-30partialendo.JPG|280px|thumb|right|Tooth #30, the lower right first molar, with incomplete endodontic therapy: the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|mesial]] roots were left untreated, as can be evidences by the lack of [[gutta percha]] in the canals.  This tooth requires retreatment to prevent a future infection from the non-treated canals.]]
It is possible that after conventional [[endodontic therapy]] has been completed, little to no resolution of the periapical lesion occurs over a considerable amount of time; there is a great deal of current research that discusses the possible reasons for this outcome and suggests possible treatment options.  For example, it has been demonstrated that there is an association between nonresolving apical periodontitis lesions and the presence of [[cholesterol cleft]]s within the periapical lesion; in fact, an incidence of up to 44% has been reported!  It was shown that [[macrophage]]s joined to form multinucleated giant cells and then produced a well-circumscribed area of tissue reaction, not unlike the [[granuloma|granulomatous tissue reactions]] of a typical [[Foreign body granuloma|foreign body reaction]], and persisted for up to 8 months.&lt;ref&gt;Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 482.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, endodontic materials as well as food debris may also be the cause of persistent periapical lesions.  It was once shown that contaminated [[gutta percha]] resulted in a persistent periapical lesion for more than a [[decade]]!&lt;ref&gt;Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 486.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-surgical endodontic retreatment therapy==
For retreatment of a non-healing lesion, there is really no magical method that can be employed; the course of action is merely to achieve what was supposed to have been achieved the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Lovdahl, PE, Gutmann, JL: Problems in Nonsurgical Root Canal Retreatment.  In Gutmann, JL, editor: ''Problem Solving in Endodontics'', 3rd Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 1997, page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;  Keeping in mind the notion that endodontic retreatment is a problem-solving exploit will substantially increase its success.

After endodontic therapy has been executed, or re-executed, successfully, and the canals can no longer provide a nutrient-rich [[habitat]] for [[microbe]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Fidel, Rivail A.S., Complicated crown fracture: a case report, ''Braz Dent J'' 2006 17:1 pages 83-86.&lt;/ref&gt; the issue of bone healing comes into focus.  Ostensibly, then, for [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] to occur, the root canal system must have been decontaminated and further access to microbial invasion must be prohibited.   Regeneration of the bone has been demonstrated to occur, on average, at a rate of 3.2&amp;nbsp;mm² per month, and studies suggest that 71% of lesions have achieved complete resolution one year post-operatively.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, WK, Healing of periapical radiolucencies after nonsurgical endodontic therapy, ''Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol'' 1991 May;71(5):620-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Situations in which a surgical form of retreatment had been selected and in which apical resolution has still not occurred may still benefit from additional [[surgery|surgical intervention]].  A comparison of the outcome of periradicular surgery in [[teeth]] that had previously undergone surgical treatment versus teeth that were undergoing a surgical procedure for the first time showed that, after 5 years, 86% of surgically treated teeth healed with complete bone filling of the surgical cavity while only 59% of resurgically treated teeth healed with complete bone filling.  It has thus been demonstrated that surgical retreatment of teeth previously treated with surgery is a valid alternative to extraction.&lt;ref&gt;Gagliani, M. Periapical resurgery versus periapical surgery: a 5-year longitudinal comparison. ''Int Endo J'' May 2005 38:5 pages 320-327.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a combination of three antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline) in a paste has been used successfully to treat these lesions non-surgically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US National Library of Medicine: Nonsurgical healing of large periradicular lesions using a triple antibiotic paste|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3220065/|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set''' ('''HEDIS''') is a widely used set of [[Performance measurement|performance measures]] in the [[managed care]] industry, developed and maintained by the [[National Committee for Quality Assurance]] (NCQA).

HEDIS was designed to allow consumers to compare health plan performance to other plans and to national or regional benchmarks. Although not originally intended for trending, HEDIS results are increasingly used to track year-to-year performance. HEDIS is one component of NCQA's [[Professional certification|accreditation]] process, although some plans submit HEDIS data without seeking accreditation. An incentive for many health plans to collect HEDIS data is a [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) requirement that [[health maintenance organization]]s (HMOs) submit [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] HEDIS data in order to provide HMO services for Medicare enrollees under a program called [[Medicare (United States)#Part C: Medicare Advantage plans|Medicare Advantage]].

HEDIS was originally titled the "[[HMO]] Employer Data and Information Set" as of version 1.0 of 1991.&lt;ref name=Mainous1998&gt;Mainous AG 3rd, Talbert J. [http://archfami.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/7/5/410.pdf Assessing quality of care via HEDIS 3.0. Is there a better way?] Arch Fam Med 1998 Sep-Oct;7(5):410-3. Accessed 2009 Apr 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993, Version 2.0 of HEDIS was known as the "Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set".&lt;ref&gt;Schauffler HH, Rodriguez T. [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/15/1/73.pdf Exercising purchasing power for preventive care.] Health Aff (Millwood) 1996 Spring;15(1):73-85. Accessed 2009 Apr 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Version 3.0 of HEDIS was released in 1997.&lt;ref name=Mainous1998/&gt; In July 2007, NCQA announced that the meaning of "HEDIS" would be changed to "Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncqa.org/tabid/517/Default.aspx Measures assessing resource use highlight HEDIS 2008] (news release). Washington, D.C.: National Committee for Quality Assurance, 2007 Jul 11. Accessed 2009 Apr 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In current usage, the "reporting year" after the term "HEDIS" is one year following the year reflected in the data; for example, the "HEDIS 2009" reports, available in June 2009, contain analyses of data collected from "measurement year" January–December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/PublicComment/HEDIS2010/NCQA_HEDIS_2010_Public_Comment_Overview.pdf HEDIS 2010 public comment overview.] Washington, D.C.: National Committee for Quality Assurance, 2009. Accessed 2009 Apr 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The 83 HEDIS measures are divided into five "domains of care":&lt;ref&gt;http://blackboard.fresnocitycollege.edu/courses/1/HIT-12-26552-2013SP/content/_1882003_1/HIT%2012%20article%20C4%20MCO%20Data.PDF&gt;WhatIsHEDIS&gt;[http://www.ncqa.org/tabid/187/Default.aspx What is HEDIS?] Washington, D.C.: National Committee for Quality Assurance.

Accessed 2009 Apr 25.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Effectiveness of Care
*Access/Availability of Care
*Experience of Care
*Utilization and Relative Resource Use
*Health Plan Descriptive Information

Measures are added, deleted, and revised annually. For example, a measure for the length of stay after giving birth was deleted after legislation mandating minimum length of stay rendered this measure nearly useless. Increased attention to medical care for seniors prompted the addition of measures related to [[glaucoma]] screening and [[osteoporosis]] treatment for older adults. Other health care concerns covered by HEDIS are [[Immunization (medicine)|immunizations]], [[cancer]] screenings, treatment after [[heart attacks]], [[diabetes]], [[asthma]], [[flu vaccine|flu shots]], access to services, [[dentistry|dental care]], alcohol and drug dependence treatment, timeliness of handling phone calls, prenatal and postpartum care, [[mental health]] care, well-care or preventive visits, inpatient utilization, drug utilization, and distribution of members by age, sex, and product lines.

New measures in HEDIS 2013 are “Asthma Medication Ratio,”  “Diabetes Screening for People With Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder Who Are Using Antipsychotic Medications,” “Diabetes Monitoring for People With Diabetes and Schizophrenia,” “Cardiovascular Monitoring for People With Cardiovascular Disease and Schizophrenia,” and “Adherence to Antipsychotic Medications for Individuals With Schizophrenia.”{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Data collection==
HEDIS data are collected through [[Statistical survey|surveys]], [[medical record|medical charts]] and [[insurance claim]]s for hospitalizations, medical office visits and procedures. Survey measures must be conducted by an NCQA-approved external survey organization. Clinical measures use the '''administrative''' or '''hybrid''' data collection methodology, as specified by NCQA. '''Administrative''' data are electronic records of services, including insurance claims and registration systems from hospitals, clinics, medical offices, pharmacies and labs.  For example, a measure titled Childhood Immunization Status requires health plans to identify 2 year old children who have been enrolled for at least a year. The plans report the percentage of children who received specified immunizations.  Plans may collect data for this measure by reviewing insurance claims or automated immunization records, but this method will not include immunizations received at community clinics that do not submit insurance claims. For this measure, plans are allowed to select a random sample of the population and supplement claims data with data from medical records. By doing so, plans may identify additional immunizations and report more favorable and accurate rates. However, the hybrid method is more costly, time-consuming and requires [[nurses]] or medical record reviewers who are authorized to review confidential medical records.

==Reporting==
HEDIS results must be audited by an NCQA-approved auditing firm for public reporting. NCQA has an on-line reporting tool called Quality Compass that is available for a fee of several thousand dollars. It provides detailed data on all measures and is intended for employers, consultants and insurance brokers who purchase health insurance for groups. NCQA's web site includes a summary of HEDIS results by health plan. NCQA also collaborates annually with U.S. News &amp; World Report to rank HMOs using an index that combines many HEDIS measures and accreditation status. The "Best Health Plans" list is published in the magazine in October and is available on the magazine's web site. Other local business organizations, governmental agencies and media report HEDIS results, usually when they are released in the fall.

===Advantages===
Proponents cite the following advantages of HEDIS measures:

* HEDIS measures undergo a selection process that has been described as "rigorous"&lt;ref name=IOM2001&gt;Institute of Medicine.

Accessed 2009 May 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;205)&lt;/sup&gt;. Steps in the process include assessment of a measure's "importance, scientific soundness and feasibility"; field testing; public comment; a one-year trial period in which results are not reported publicly; and evaluation of publicly reported measures by "statistical analysis, review of audit results and user comments".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncqa.org/tabid/425/Default.aspx HEDIS life cycle.] Washington, D.C.: National Committee for Quality Assurance.

Accessed 2009 Apr 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In some studies, attainment of HEDIS measures is associated with cost-effective practices or with better health outcomes.

* HEDIS measures are "widely known and accepted"&lt;ref name=IOM2001/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;205)&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Disadvantages OF HEDIS===
HEDIS was described in 1995 as "very controversial".&lt;ref name=Epstein1995&gt;Epstein A. [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/333/1/57 Performance reports on quality--prototypes, problems, and prospects.] N Engl J Med. 1995 Jul 6;333(1):57-61. Accessed 2009 Apr 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms of HEDIS measures have included:

* HEDIS measures do not account for many important aspects of health care quality.  They count only a select set of healthcare interventions, for specific at risk patient populations, that can imply that institutions and Providers are giving adequate care.  Its purpose is to verify a minimally acceptable level of care is given to specific At Risk Populations.
** In 1998, HEDIS measures were said to "offer little insight into... [a health] plan’s ability to treat serious illnesses".&lt;ref&gt;Mainous AG 3rd, Talbert J. [http://archfami.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/7/5/410 Assessing quality of care via HEDIS 3.0. Is there a better way?] Arch Fam Med 1998 Sep-Oct;7(5):410-3. Accessed 2009 May 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  But, no current studies or evidence can be offered to support this and HEDIS compliance measures are updated yearly to reflect best Practices in healthcare.
**A 2002 study found "there are numerous non-HEDIS interventions with some evidence of cost effectiveness, particularly interventions to promote healthy behaviors".&lt;ref name=Neumann2002/&gt;  This may speak more to the specificity of defined healthcare Best Practices interventions to At Risk Populations than to anecdotal interventions with "some evidence".  Measures are revised every year to include newer and even more effective Best Practice Guidelines.
** According to a 2005 study, HEDIS-Medicaid 3.0 measures covered only 22% of the services recommended by the second [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF).&lt;ref&gt;Levine RS, Briggs NC, Husaini BA, Foster I, Hull PC, Pamies RJ, Tropez-Sims S, Emerson JS.

Accessed 2009 May 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Though without studies, without expressing what interventions and without reporting what "harm", some groups believe attempts by health care providers to improve their HEDIS measures may cause harm to patients.  They have not offered any solutions.
** As of 2001, there was concern that the asthma HEDIS measure may "encourag[e] more casual prescribing of controller medications" and may place emphasis "on the prescribing of a controller medication rather than on its actual use".&lt;ref&gt;Glauber JH.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2377">'''Hegar sign''' is a non-sensitive indication of [[pregnancy]] in women — its absence does not exclude pregnancy. It pertains to the features of the [[cervix]] and the [[uterine isthmus]]. It is demonstrated as a softening in the consistency of the uterus, and the uterus and [[cervix]] seem to be two separate regions.&lt;ref name="ChongW.M.2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chong|author2=W.M.|title=Cardiology A Socratic Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iipd0GIpw4cC&amp;pg=PA36|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-1887-2|pages=36–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign is usually present from 4–6 weeks&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Gary|title=Williams obstetrics: Chapter 8, Prenatal Care|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0071497015|url=http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=6052072|edition=23rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the 12th week of pregnancy. Hegar's sign is more difficult to recognize in [[multiparous]] women.
 
Interpretation : On bimanual examination, (two fingers in the anterior fornix and two fingers below the uterus per abdomen) the abdominal and vaginal fingers seem to oppose below the body of uterus (examination must be gentle to avoid abortion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=D.C.DUTTA'S Textbook of Obstetrics|publisher=New central book Agency Ltd|author=D.C.Dutta|location=India|page=65|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sign was repeatedly demonstrated and described by [[Ernst Ludwig Alfred Hegar]], a [[Germany|German]] [[gynecologist]], in 1895. Hegar credited Reinl, one of his assistants, who originally described this sign in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Notable names in Medicine &amp; Surgery|publisher=H. K. Lewis &amp; Co.

'''Identification of Medicinal Products''' (IDMP) is a set of five [[ISO]] norms which has been developed in response to a worldwide demand for internationally harmonized specifications for medicinal products. IDMP provides the basis for the unique identification of medicinal products, it facilitates the activities of medicines regulatory agencies worldwide by [[jurisdiction]] for a variety of regulatory activities (development, registration and life cycle management of medicinal products; [[pharmacovigilance]] and risk management). IDMP is the base for the [[Marketing authorization]] of medicinal products in [[Europe]]. It requires the five ISO Norms being implemented in the [[Marketing Authorization Application]] process.

Messaging specifications are included as an integral part of the IDMP standards. They describe and protect the integrity of the interactions for the submission of regulated medicinal product information in the context of the unique product identification; they include acknowledgement of receipt including the validation of transmitted information. [[Health Level 7|Health level Seven (HL7)]] Message Exchange are normative within the IDMP Standards.

IDMP Standards are designed to allow unambiguous identification of products across regions to improve the robustness of pharmacovigilance and regulatory activities. They can also be applied to Investigational Medicinal Products.

IDMP Standards are completed with Implementation Guides which are currently in development (2017).

The standards can be found from [[ISO TC 215]]´s deliveries

== The five ISO IDMP standards ==

=== ISO 11238 ===
Regulated information on substances

Defines substances and specified substances by their main general characteristics, and their roles in medicinal products (e.g. active, adjuvant). In addition specified substances are listed more granular with specific descriptions (e.g. including manufacturing information, grade of purity etc.).

=== ISO 11239 ===
Regulated Information on pharmaceutical dose forms, units of presentation, routes of administration and packaging

Identifies and defines concepts for each of the above. For example, in dose forms: “injection solution”, “injection suspension” (or a less granular regional term linked to these)

=== ISO 11615 ===
Regulated medicinal product information

Defines, characterises and uniquely identifies regulated medicinal products during their entire life cycle (development, authorisation, post-Marketing and renewal or withdrawal from the market) by describing the detailed data elements and their structural relationships

=== ISO 11616 ===
Regulated pharmaceutical product information

Pharmaceutical Product Identification (PhPID) uniquely identifies a generic (pharmaceutical) representation of a medicinal product at Levels Substance(s)/Strength(s) – Strength Units /Reference Strengths per Administrable Dose Form

=== ISO 11240 ===
Units of measurement

Specifies rules for the usage of units of measurement for IDMP;
defines requirements for [[traceability]] to metrological standards; establishes reference code system for units; provides structure and rules for mapping between different unit vocabularies and language translations.

'''Kazutaka Kogi''' (born 1933) is a Japanese academic known for his contributions to simple, low-cost [[Organization development#OD interventions|interventions]] in small manufacturing enterprises that improve the [[working conditions]] for the employees and at the same time also improve the overall [[productivity]] of the workforce.  The interventions are based on simple and low-cost modifications, on local solutions to highly specific local problems and specifically on the collaboration between the shopfloor and the managerial level.  This collaborative or participatory approach is possible because the intervention is presented as a [[win-win game|win-win situation]] for both parties.  Kazutaka Kogi and his colleague [[Kageyo Noro]] are considered to have founded the concept of [[participatory ergonomics]] in Singapore in 1983&lt;ref&gt;Karwowski and Maras (1999) p1422&lt;/ref&gt;

He has worked extensively for the [[International Labour Organization]] and held the Vice-Presidency for [[ICOH]] in 2006-2009.

==Functions==
[[Cholesterol]] is a [[sterol]], a [[steroid]]-like lipid made by animals, including humans.  The human body makes one-eighth to one-fourth [[teaspoon]]s of pure [[cholesterol]] daily.  A cholesterol level of 5.5 millimoles per litre or below is recommended for an adult.  The rise of cholesterol in the body can give a condition in which excessive cholesterol is deposited in artery walls called [[atherosclerosis]]. This condition blocks the blood flow to vital organs which can result in high blood pressure or stroke. 
Cholesterol is not always bad.  It's a vital part of the cell wall and a precursor to substances such as brain matter and some sex hormones.  There are some types of cholesterol which are beneficial to the heart and blood vessels.  [[High-density lipoprotein]] is commonly called "good" cholesterol.  These lipoproteins help in the removal of cholesterol from the cells, which is then transported back to the liver where it is disintegrated and excreted as waste or broken down into parts.&lt;ref&gt;CholesterolAdvice.net [http://www.cholesteroladvice.net/understanding-cholesterol/ ''Understanding Cholesterol: What is Cholesterol and What Causes High Cholesterol?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Low-threshold programs may be contrasted with "high-threshold" programs, which require the user to accept a certain level of control and which demand that the patient accept counselling.&lt;ref name=Waal2000&gt;{{cite web|last=Waal|first=Helge|title=Risk reduction as a component of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to drug abuse problems |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/pompidou/Source/AboutUs/TasksStructure/Sintra/SintraWaal_en.pdf |publisher=The Pompidou Group |accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low-threshold treatment programs are not to be confused with simple [[needle exchange program]]s, and may include comprehensive healthcare and counseling services.&lt;ref name="IslamDay2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rogers2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rogers | first1 = S.

According to that Editorial, low-threshold services for drug users can be defined as those which offer services to drug users; do not impose abstinence from drug use as a condition of service access; and endeavour to reduce other documented barriers to service access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM, Topp, L, Conigrave, KM, and Day, C |title= Defining a service for people who use drugs as ‘low-threshold’: What should be the criteria? |journal=International Journal of Drug Policy |volume=24 |pages=220–222 |year=2013 |pmid= 23567101 |doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2013.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Drug injection|Injection drug]] users (IDUs) are at risk of a wide range of health problems arising from non-sterile injecting practices, complications of the drug itself or of the lifestyle associated with drug use and dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Latt|first=N.; Conigrave, K.; Marshall, J.; Saunders, J.; Marshall, J.; Nutt, D.|title=Addiction Medicine|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199539338|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/PsychiatryPsychology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199539338|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604154155/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/PsychiatryPsychology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199539338|archivedate=2011-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, unrelated health problems, such as [[diabetes]], may be neglected because of [[substance dependence|drug dependence]]. However, despite their increased health care needs, IDUs do not have the required access to care or may be reluctant to use conventional services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McCoy | first1 = C. B. | last2 = Metsch | first2 = L. R. | last3 = Chitwood | first3 = D. D. | last4 = Miles | first4 = C. | title = Drug use and barriers to use of health care services | journal = Substance Use &amp; Misuse | volume = 36 | issue = 6–7 | pages = 789–806 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11697611 | doi=10.1081/ja-100104091}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, their health may deteriorate to a point at which emergency treatment is required,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McDonald, P |title=From streets to sidewalks: developments in primary care services for injecting drug users |journal=Australian Journal of Primary Health |volume=8 |pages=65–69 |year=2002|doi=10.1071/PY02010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with considerable costs to both the IDUs and the health system. Accordingly, harm reduction based health care centers, also known as ''targeted health care outlet'' or ''low-threshold health care outlet'' for IDUs have been established across a range of settings utilising a variety of models.&lt;ref name="IslamDay2010"/&gt;  These targeted outlets provide integrated, low-threshold services within a harm-reduction framework targeting IDUs, and sometimes include social and/or other services. Where a particular service is not provided, referral and assistance with access is available. In 2007, for example, 33% of all US needle-syringe programs (NSPs) provided on-site medical care, and 7% provided [[buprenorphine]] treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Des Jarlais | first1 = D. C. | last2 = McKnight | first2 = C. | last3 = Goldblatt | first3 = C. | last4 = Purchase | first4 = D. | title = Doing harm reduction better: Syringe exchange in the United States | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02465.x | journal = Addiction | volume = 104 | issue = 9 | pages = 1441–1446 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19215605 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in many European countries NSP outlets serve as low-threshold primary health care centers targeting primarily IDUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index5778EN.html |title=Low-threshold services |publisher=The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health care models==
These targeted outlets vary widely and may be either "distributive", providing basic harm reduction services and simple healthcare with facilitated referrals to specialist services, or "one-stop-shops" where a range of services including specialist services are provided onsite. The services being offered by these outlets range from simple needle and syringe provision, to expanded services including basic and preventive primary healthcare, [[hepatitis B]]&amp;nbsp;[[hepatitis A|and&amp;nbsp;A]] vaccinations, [[hepatitis&amp;nbsp;C]] testing, counselling, [[tuberculosis]] screening and sometimes opioid maintenance therapy. Some centers offer hepatitis, HIV treatment and dental care.&lt;ref name=CDC2010&gt;{{Cite journal | author1 = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | title = Syringe exchange programs --- United States, 2008 | journal = Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | volume = 59 | issue = 45 | pages = 1488–1491 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21085091}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of these outlets is to provide: (1) opportunistic health care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Islam, MM, Reid, SE, White, A, Grummett, S, Conigrave, KM and Haber, PS |title=Opportunistic and continuing health care for injecting drug users from a nurse-run needle syringe program-based primary health-care clinic |journal=Drug Alcohol Rev. |volume=31 |pages=114–115 |year=2012 |pmid=22145983 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-3362.2011.00390.x/pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1465-3362.2011.00390.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) increased temporal and spatial availability of health care, (3) trustworthy services of health care, (4) cost-effective mode of health care, (5) targeted and tailored services.&lt;ref name=Islam2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Islam | first1 = M. M. | title = Needle Syringe Program-Based Primary HealthCare Centers: Advantages and Disadvantages | doi = 10.1177/2150131910369684 | journal = Journal of Primary Care &amp; Community Health | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 100–103 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States as of 2011, 211 NSPs were known to be operating in 32 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the [[Native Americans in the United States#Current legal status|Indian Nations]].&lt;ref name=amFar2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Syringe Exchange Programs in the United States 2011|url=http://www.amfar.org/uploadedFiles/On_The_Hill/SEPS.pdf?n=3826)|publisher=amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bulk of funding has come from state and local governments,&lt;ref name=CDC2010/&gt; since for most of the last several decades, federal funding for needle exchange programs has been specifically banned.&lt;ref name=HuffPost2012&gt;{{cite news|title=Needle Exchange Programs Lose Federal Funding: Local AIDS Programs Brace For Cuts|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/04/needle-exchange-programs-san-francisco_n_1184420.html|accessdate=25 March 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post - San Francisco|first=Robin|last=Wilkey|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, as of 2008, at least 77 countries and territories offer NSPs with varying structures, aims and goals. Some countries use needle exchange services as part of integrated programs to contain drug use, while others aim simply to contain HIV infection as their top priority, considering reduction in incidence of drug use as a much lower priority.&lt;ref name=Cahill2009&gt;{{cite web|title=Syringe exchange programs around the world: The global context|url=http://www.gmhc.org/files/editor/file/gmhc_intl_seps.pdf|publisher=Gay Men's Health Crisis|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acceptance of NSPs vary widely from country to country.

Authors from the 1997 Vancouver study have, in multiple publications, issued disclaimers against the misuse of their work by opponents of NSPs.  They point out that frequent attendees of the program tended to be young and often indulged in extreme high-risk behaviors.  The 1997 results were hence of a statistically biased sampling.&lt;ref name=Schechter1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wood2007/&gt; They have emphasized that the correct message to be derived from their 1997 study can be read in the title of their work: "Needle exchange is not enough".&lt;ref name=Strathdee1997/&gt;  This is the same message presented by many other articles since.&lt;ref name=CDC2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=DesJarlais2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Falster2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Falster | first1 = K. | last2 = Kaldor | first2 = J.

But whether or not it experiences a full-blown crisis will depend largely on unpredictable events, like a sudden outbreak of flu or norovirus. What is clear is that, seven years into [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity]], the pressure on the system is immense, making the health service much less resilient to these kinds of events than is comfortable.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/10/theresa-may-tells-nhs-boss-he-will-be-accountable-for-nhs-winter-performance Theresa May tells NHS boss he will be accountable for winter performance] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''nipple''' is a raised region of tissue on the surface of the [[breast]] from which, in females, [[breast milk|milk]] leaves the breast through the [[lactiferous duct]]s to feed an infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nipple|title=nipple|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2017|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Hansen|2010|p=80}} The milk can flow through the nipple passively or it can be ejected by [[smooth muscles|smooth]] [[muscular contraction|muscle contractions]] that occur along the ductal system. The nipple is surrounded by the [[areola]] which is often a darker color than the surrounding skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tabers.com/tabersonline/view/Tabers-Dictionary/762857/1/nipple&amp;ti=0|title=nipple - Taber's Online|website=www.tabers.com|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often called a '''teat''' when referring to non-humans. Teat can also be used to describe the flexible mouthpiece of a [[baby bottle]]. In humans, nipples of both males and females can be stimulated as part of sexual arousal. In many cultures, human female nipples are [[sexualize]]d,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sociologytoolbox.com/social-construction-of-the-body/|title=Social Construction of the Body: The Nipple|publisher=sociologytoolbox.com|author=Todd Beer|date=2015-05-12|accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "...regarded as sex objects and evaluated in terms of their physical characteristics and sexiness."&lt;ref name=Dewar&gt;{{cite web | last = Dewar | first = Gwen | title = The sexualization of girls: Is the popular culture harming our kids? | url = http://www.parentingscience.com/sexualization-of-girls.html | website = parentingscience.com | publisher = Parenting Science | date = October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy==
[[File:Breast anatomy normal scheme.png|thumb|300px|The breast: cross-section scheme of the [[mammary gland]]: {{ordered list |[[Thoracic wall|Chest wall]] |[[Pectoralis major muscle|Pectoralis muscle]]s |[[Lobe (anatomy)|Lobules]] |'''Nipple''' |[[Areola]] |[[Lactiferous duct|Milk duct]] |[[Adipose tissue|Fatty tissue]] |[[Human skin|Skin]]}}]]

In [[mammal]]s, a nipple (also called mammary papilla or [[teat]]) is a small projection of [[skin]] containing the outlets for 15–20 [[lactiferous duct]]s arranged cylindrically around the tip. [[Marsupial]]s and [[Eutheria|eutherian mammals]] typically have an even number of nipples arranged bilaterally, from as few as two to as many as 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthlife.net/mammals/milk.html |title=The Wonder of Milk |publisher=Earthlife.net |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Sensation--&gt;The skin of the nipple is rich in a supply of special [[nerve]]s that are sensitive to certain stimuli: these are slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting [[integumentary|cutaneous]] [[mechanoreceptor]]s. Mechanoreceptors are identified respectively by Type I slowly-adapting with multiple [[Merkel corpuscle end-organ]]s and Type II slowly-adapting with single [[Ruffini corpuscle end-organ]]s, as well as Type I rapidly-adapting with multiple [[Meissner corpuscle end-organ]]s and Type II rapidly-adapting with single [[Pacinian corpuscle end-organs]]. The dominant nerve supply to the nipple comes from the lateral cutaneous branches of fourth [[intercostal nerve]].&lt;ref&gt;Grabb &amp; Smith's Plastic Surgery 6th edition. Chapter 59 page 593&lt;/ref&gt; The nipple is also used as an anatomical landmark. It marks the T4 (fourth thoracic vertebra) [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]] and rests over the approximate level of the diaphram.{{sfn|Hansen|2010|p=73}}

&lt;!--Blood and lymphatic supply--&gt;The arterial supply to the nipple and breast originates from the anterior intercostal branches of the internal thoracic (mammary) arteries; lateral thoracic artery; and thoracodorsal arteries. The venous vessels parallel the arteries.{{sfn|Hansen|2010|p=80}} The lymphatic ducts that drain the nipple are the same for the breast.{{sfn|Hansen|2010|p=80}} The axillary nodes are the apical axillary nodes, the lateral group and the anterior group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Imwold | first = Denise | title = Anatomica's body atlas | publisher = Laurel Glen | location = San Diego, CA | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781571459237 |pages = 286–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 75% of the lymph is drained through the axillary lymph nodes located near the armpit. The rest of the drainage leaves the nipple and breast through infroclavicular, pectoral, or parasternal nodes.

Since nipples change throughout the life span in men and women, the anatomy of the nipple can change and this change may be expected and considered normal.

[[File:Human nipple.jpg|thumb|right|A human male nipple]]
Almost all [[mammals]] have nipples. Why males have nipples has been the subject of scientific research.  Differences among the sexes (called [[sexual dimorphism]]) within a given species are considered by [[evolutionary biologist]]s to be mostly the result of [[sexual selection]], directly or indirectly. For traits where there is no difference among the sexes, evolutionary biologists assume that there has been no advantage to one of the sexes losing the trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Eleanor|title=Why do men have nipples?|journal=Nature News|date=5 August 1999|doi=10.1038/news990805-1|url=http://www.nature.com/news/1999/990805/full/news990805-1.html|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Anna|title=Do Male Dogs Have Nipples?|url=http://www.akc.org/content/dog-care/articles/do-male-dogs-have-nipples/|website=American Kennel Club|language=en|date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simons|first1=Andrew M.|title=Why do men have nipples?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-men-have-nipples/|work=Scientific American|date=January 13, 2003|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function==
{{main|Breast feeding}}
The physiological purpose of nipples is to deliver [[milk]] to the infant, produced in the female [[mammary gland]]s during [[lactation]]. During breastfeeding, nipple stimulation by an [[infant]] will simulate the release of [[oxytocin]] from the [[hypothalamus]]. Oxytocin is a [[hormone]] that increases during pregnancy and acts on the breast to help produce the [[milk-ejection reflex]]. Oxytocin release from the nipple stimulation of the infant causes the uterus to contract even after childbirth.{{sfn|Henry|2016|p=117}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/glossary/#o|title=Glossary - womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|accessdate=12 August 2017|date=2017-01-10}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong uterine contractions that are caused by the stimulation of the mother's nipples help the uterus contract to clamp down the uterine arteries. These contractions are necessary to prevent [[post-partum hemorrhage]].&lt;ref name=Abedi2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abedi|first1=P|last2=Jahanfar|first2=S|last3=Namvar|first3=F|last4=Lee|first4=J|title=Breastfeeding or nipple stimulation for reducing postpartum haemorrhage in the third stage of labour|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=27 January 2016|volume=1|issue=1|pages=CD010845|pmid=26816300|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010845.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the baby suckles or stimulates the nipple, oxytocin levels rise and small muscles in the breast contract and move the milk through the milk ducts. The result of nipple stimulation by the newborn helps to move breast milk out through the ducts and to the nipple. This contraction of milk is called the “let-down reflex.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/files/documents/your-guide-to-breastfeeding.pdf |title=Guide to breastfeeding |website=www.womenshealth.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latching on refers to the baby fastening onto the nipple to breastfeeding. A good attachment is when the bottom of the areola (the area around the nipple) is in the baby's mouth and the nipple is drawn back inside his or her mouth. A poor latch results in insufficient nipple stimulation to create the let down reflex. The nipple is poorly stimulated when the baby latches on too close to the tip of the nipple. This poor attachment can cause sore and cracked nipples and a reluctance of the mother to continue to breastfeed.&lt;ref name = whgov&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/itsonlynatural/overcoming-challenges/breastfeeding-checklist-how-to-get-good-latch.html|title=Breastfeeding checklist: How to get a good latch | publisher = WomensHealth.gov | accessdate=4 August 2017|date=2017-06-09 }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = whgov2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/itsonlynatural/overcoming-challenges/common-questions-about-breastfeeding-pain.html|title=Common questions about breastfeeding and pain | publisher = womenshealth.gov|accessdate=4 August 2017|date=2017-06-09 }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the birth of the infant, the milk supply increases based upon the continuous and increasing stimulation of the nipple by the infant. If the baby increases nursing time at the nipple, the mammary glands respond to this stimulation by increasing milk production.

==Clinical significance==
===Pain===
Nipple pain can be a disincentive for breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/world_breastfeeding_week_20130730/en/|title=WHO - Breastfeeding: Only 1 in 5 countries fully implement WHO's infant formula Code|website=www.who.int|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sore nipples that progress to cracked nipples is of concern since many woman cease breastfeeding due to the pain. In some instances an ulcer will form on the nipple.&lt;ref name="Sant2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santos|first1=Kamila Juliana da Silva|last2=Santana|first2=Géssica Silva|last3=Vieira|first3=Tatiana de Oliveira|last4=Santos|first4=Carlos Antônio de Souza Teles|last5=Giugliani|first5=Elsa Regina Justo|last6=Vieira|first6=Graciete Oliveira|title=Prevalence and factors associated with cracked nipples in the first month postpartum|journal=BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth|volume=16|issue=1|pages=209|year=2016|issn=1471-2393|doi=10.1186/s12884-016-0999-4|pmid=27496088|pmc=4975913}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the development of cracked and sore nipples is the incorrect latching-on of the infant to the nipple. If a nipple appears to be wedge-shaped, white and flattened, this may indicates that the attachment of the infant is not good and there is a potential of developing cracked nipples.&lt;ref name = nhs2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/sore-cracked-nipples-breastfeeding.aspx|title=Sore or cracked nipples when breastfeeding, Pregnancy and baby guide |publisher = National Health Services (UK)|website=www.nhs.uk|accessdate=4 August 2017|date=2017-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Herpes infection of the nipple is painful.{{sfn|Walker|2011|p=533}} Nipple pain can also be caused by excessive [[friction]] of clothing against the nipple that causes a [[Fissure of the nipple|
fissure]].

===Discharge===
Nipple discharge refers to any fluid that seeps out of the nipple of the breast. Discharge from the nipple does not occur in lactating women. And discharge in non-pregnant women or women who are not breasfeeding may not cause concern. Men that have discharge from their nipples are not typical. Discharge from the nipples of men or boys may indicate a problem.  Discharge from the nipples can appear without squeezing or may only be noticeable if the nipples are squeezed. One nipple can have discharge while the other does not. The discharge can be clear, green, bloody, brown or straw-colored. The consistency ct can be thick, thin, sticky or watery.&lt;ref name = medline1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/nipple-discharge/basics/definition/sym-20050946|title=Nipple discharge|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases of nipple discharge will clear on their own without treatment. Nipple discharge is most often not cancer (benign), but rarely, it can be a sign of breast cancer. It is important to find out what is causing it and to get treatment. Here are some reasons for nipple discharge:&lt;ref name = medline1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001515.htm|title=Nipple discharge: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=12 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Pregnancy
* Recent breastfeeding
* Rubbing on the area from a bra or T-shirt
* Injury to the breast
* Infection
* Inflammation and clogging of the breast ducts
* Noncancerous pituitary tumors
* Small growth in the breast that is usually not cancer
* Severe underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
* Fibrocystic breast (normal lumpiness in the breast)
* Use of certain medicines
* Use of certain herbs, such as anise and fennel
* Widening of the milk ducts&lt;ref name = medline1/&gt;

Sometimes, babies can have nipple discharge. This is caused by hormones from the mother before birth. It usually goes away in 2 weeks. Cancers such as Paget disease (a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple) can also cause nipple discharge.&lt;ref name = medline1/&gt;

Nipple discharge that is not normal is bloody, comes from only one nipple, or comes out on its own without squeezing or touching the nipple. Nipple discharge is more likely to be normal if it comes out of both nipples or happens when the nipple is squeezed your nipples. Squeezing the nipple to check for discharge can make it worse. Leaving the nipple alone may make the discharge stop.&lt;ref name = medline1/&gt;

Any nipple discharge in a male usually is of more concern. Most of the time a mammogram and an examination of the fluid is done. Oftentimes a biopsy is performed A fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy can be fast and least painful. A very thin, hollow needle and slight suction will be used to remove a small sample from under the nipple. Using a local anesthetic to numb the skin may not be necessary since a thin needle is used for the biopsy. Receiving an injection to prevent pain from the biopsy may be more painful than the biopsy itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer-in-men/detection-diagnosis-staging/how-diagnosed.html|title=How Is Breast Cancer in Men Diagnosed?|website=www.cancer.org|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some genetically-males develop a condition known as [[gynecomastia]], in which the breast tissue under the nipple develops and grows. Discharge from the nipple can occur. The nipple may swell in some genetically-males possibly due to increased levels of estrogen.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Appearance===
Changes in appearance may be normal or related to disease.
* Inverted nipples - This is normal if the nipples have always been indented inward and can easily point out when touched. If the nipples are pointing in and this is new, this is an unexpected change.
* Skin puckering of the nipple - This can be caused by scar tissue from surgery or an infection. Often, scar tissue forms for no reason. Most of the time this issue does not need treatment. This is an unexpected change. This change can be of concern since puckering of the nipple, or retraction of the nipple can indicate an underlying change in breast tissue that can be cancerous.{{sfn|Hansen|2010|p=83}}
* Nipple is warm to the touch, red or painful - This can be an infection. It is rarely due to breast cancer. 
* Scaly, flaking, itchy nipple - This is most often due to eczema or a bacterial or fungal infection. This change is not expected. flaking, scaly, itchy nipples can be a sign of Paget disease. This is a rare form of breast cancer involving the nipple.
* Thickened skin with large pores - This is called peau d'orange because the skin looks like an orange peel. An infection in the breast or inflammatory breast cancer can cause this problem. This not an expected change.
* Retracted nipples  -  The nipple was raised above the surface but changes begins to pull inward and does not come out when stimulated. This is an expected change it did not exist before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000622.htm|title=Breast skin and nipple changes: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=12 August 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The average projection and size of human female nipples is slightly more than {{convert|3/8|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hussain, L. Rynn, C. Riordan and P. J. Regan, "Nipple-areola reconstruction: outcome assessment"; ''European Journal of Plastic Surgery'', Vol. 26, Num. 7, December, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breast cancer===
Symptoms of [[breast cancer]] can often be seen first by changes of the nipple and areola, although not all women have the same symptoms, and some people do not have any signs or symptoms at all. A person may find out they have breast cancer after a routine [[mammogram]].
Warning signs can be:&lt;ref name = cdcbc/&gt;&lt;ref name = cdc2bc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/resources/features/breastcanceryoungwomen/index.htm|title=Breast Cancer in Young Women|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017|date=October 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* New lump in the nipple, or breast or armpit.
* Thickening or swelling of part of the breast, areola or nipple.
* Irritation or dimpling of breast skin.
* Redness or flaky skin in the nipple area or the breast.
* Pulling in of the nipple or pain in the nipple area.
* Nipple discharge other than breast milk, including blood.
* Any change in the size or the shape of the breast or nipple.
* Pain in any area of the breast.&lt;ref name = cdcbc/&gt;&lt;ref name = cdc2bc/&gt;

Changes in the nipple are not necessarily symptoms or signs of breast cancer. Other conditions of the nipple can mimic the signs and symptoms of breast cancer.&lt;ref name = cdcbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/young_women/bringyourbrave/breast_cancer_young_women/symptoms.htm|title=CDC - Bring Your Brave Campaign - Symptoms of Breast Cancer|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=12 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vertical transmission===
Some infections are transmitted through the nipple, especially if irritation or injury to the nipple has occurred. In these circumstances, the nipple itself can become infected with Candida that is present in the mouth of the breastfeeding infant. The infant will transmit the infection to the mother. Most of the time, this infection is localized to the area of the nipple. In some cases the infection can can progress to become a full-blown case of mastitis or breast infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/nepal_art.pdf?ua=1 |title=Nepal art |website=www.who.int |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, if the mother has an infection with no nipple cracks or ulcerations, it is still safe to breastfeed the infant.

Herpes infection of the nipple can go unnoticed because the lesions are small but usually are quite painful. Herpes in the newborn is a serious and sometimes fatal infection.{{sfn|Walker|2011|p=533}} Transmission of Hepatitis C and B to the infant can occur if the nipples are cracked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000803.htm|title=Breastfeeding vs. Formula Feeding: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other infections can be transmitted through a break of the skin of the nipple and can infect the infant.

===Surgery===
A nipple-sparing/[[Subcutis|subcutaneous]] mastectomy is a surgical procedure where breast tissue is removed, but the nipple and areola is preserved. This procedure was historically done only prophylactically or with mastectomy for benign disease over fear of increased cancer development in retained areolar ductal tissue. Recent series suggest that it may be an oncologically sound procedure for tumors not in the subareolar position.&lt;ref name="pmid12832974"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Gerber B, Krause A, Reimer T, etal |title=Skin-sparing mastectomy with conservation of the nipple-areola complex and autologous reconstruction is an oncologically safe procedure |journal=Ann.

===Exposure===
The culture tendency to hide the female nipple under clothing has existed in Western culture since the 1800s.&lt;ref name = bbc1&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30052071|title=Toplessness - the one Victorian taboo that won't go away|date=15 November 2014|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2017|via=www.bbc.com|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dewar/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; As female nipples are often perceived an [[intimate part]], covering them might originate as a Victorian taboo just as was riding side saddle.

Leder, ''The Body in Medical Thought and Practice'', page 223, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-7923-1657-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A case in Erie, Pennsylvania concerning the exposure of breasts and nipple proceeded to the Supreme Court in the US.&lt;ref name="SC_Erie"&gt;{{cite web|title=Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000)|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/529/277/case.html|website=Justia Law|publisher=Justia|accessdate=15 February 2018|language=en|date=March 2000|quote=Nudity cannot be considered an inherent form of expression.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Erie ordinance was regulating the nipple in public as an act that is committed when a person "'... knowingly or intentionally, ... appears in a state of nudity commits Public Indecency.'" Later in the statute, nudity is further described as an uncovered female nipple. But nipple exposure of a man was not regulated. A commentator expressed this opinion on the statute by noting: "Ponder the significance of that. A man walks around bare-chested and the worst that happens is he won't get served in restaurants. But a woman who goes topless is legally in the same boat as if she'd had sex in public. That may seem crazy, but in the U.S. it's a permissible law. — Cecil Adams"&lt;ref name="citypaper"/&gt;

The legality around the exposure of nipples are inconsistently  regulated throughout the US. Some states do not allow the visualization of any part of the breast. Other jurisdictions prohibit any female chest anatomy by banning anatomical structures that lie below the top of the areola or nipple. Such is the case in West Virginia and Massachusetts. West Virginia's regulation is very specific and is not likely to be misinterpreted and states: "[The] display of 'any portion of the cleavage of the human female breast exhibited by a dress, blouse, skirt, leotard, bathing suit, or other wearing apparel provided the areola is not exposed, in whole or in part.'"&lt;ref name="citypaper"/&gt;

[[Instagram]] has a 'no nipples' policy with exceptions: material that is not allowed includes "...some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too".&lt;ref name="Instagram_Help"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Guidelines|url=https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119|website=help.instagram.com|publisher=Instagram|accessdate=15 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Instagram had removed images of nursing mothers. Instagram removed images of [[Rihanna]] and had her account cancelled when she posted selfies with nipples. This was incentive for the Twitter campaign #FreeTheNipple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/instagram-clarifies-its-no-nipple-policy/|title=Instagram Clarifies Its No-Nipple Policy|date=17 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent development is the Instagram page that invites users to post images of nipples from both&lt;!--aren't there more than two?--&gt; sexes.

===In business===
Some companies and non-profit organisations have used the word ''nipple'' or images of nipples to draw attention to their product or cause.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bedfordandbowery.com/2014/08/this-new-bushwick-bar-is-the-most-literal-boobie-trap-weve-ever-seen/|title=This New Bushwick Bar Is The Most Literal Boobie Trap We've Ever Seen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "nipple" most likely originates as a [[diminutive]] of ''neb'', an [[Old English]] word meaning "beak", "nose", or "face", and which is of [[Proto-Germanic|Germanic origin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''' PEROSH''' (Partnership for European Research in Occupational Safety and Health) is a federation of currently thirteen European occupational safety and health [[Occupational safety and health|(OSH)]] institutes in twelve member states. The cooperation of PEROSH is based on its statute.

== History ==
The consortium was established in [[Rome]] on 7 November 2003 to foster research on important fields in OSH.

In [[Dublin]] on 7 November 2008 the articles of association were revised and broadened to facilitate the collaboration within the institutes. The most important regulations imply that each partner institute bears the costs of its activities and that the partnership employs its own Manager International Affairs. He has been representing PEROSH since 2009.

The partnership was renewed and extended in [[Paris]] in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dguv.de/ifa/networks/research-network-perosh/index.jsp Partnership for European Research in Occupational Safety and Health – Strain and hazards respect no borders]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
* Austria (AUVA) 
* Denmark (NFA) 
* Finland ([[Finnish Institute of Occupational Health|FIOH]]) 
* France ([[Institut national de la recherche scientifique|INRS]]) 
* Germany ([[Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|BAuA]] and [[Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance|IFA]])
* Italy ([[Istituto nazionale per l'assicurazione contro gli infortuni sul lavoro|INAIL]]) 
* Norway ([[National Institute of Occupational Health|STAMI]]) 
* Poland (CIOP-PIB) 
* Spain (INSST) 
* Switzerland (IST) 
* United Kingdom ([[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]]) 
* The Netherlands ([[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]])

== Aims ==
The PEROSH partners aim to improve the quality and effectiveness of European research and the [[European Union|EU]]-wide dissemination of results in the field of occupational safety and health. Therefore, PEROSH partners are committed to maintain a proactive dialogue with the EU and other national and international OSH-partners.

Joint interdisciplinary research projects within PEROSH aim to create a close cooperation within the network. This saves resources, creates synergies and fosters the mutual exchange of scientific personnel.

At the same time, the members of PEROSH intend to accomplish EU-research projects, also in smaller consortiums, and to pool their interest in OSH research towards European institutions.

== Activities ==
Usually there are up to ten joint research projects with more than 80 researchers involved. These research projects address prevailing OSH topics, e. g.:

* [[Dose–response relationship|Dose-Response Relationships]] (DRR) for selected chemical substances
* indirIR-UV – Exposure of workers to indirect IR- and UV-radiation emitted by arcs, flames and thermal radiators
* Well being and work
* Nano Exposure and Contextual Information Database (NECID)
* Health Impact Assessment for Occupational Respiratory Diseases

The list of ongoing and completed projects can be found on the website of PEROSH.

PEROSH identifies upcoming trends and risks in the working world to precociously adjust its research activities.

Exchanges of experts between the member institutes and technical seminars promote the transfer of knowledge and harmonisation.

PEROSH also carries on research in the field of standardisation, especially the determination of workplace-related safety factors for protective equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kan.de/en/publications/kanbrief/from-research-to-standardization/perosh-collaboration-for-improving-the-quality-of-osh-research/ PEROSH: collaboration for improving the quality of OSH research]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018 the general directors of the member institutes met in Bonn (Germany) on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of PEROSH. They signed the new PEROSH agreement for the period 2018-2022 and elected two new chairpersons as of January 2019. 

== Organisation ==
Two boards structure the work of PEROSH: the Steering Committee (SC) and the Scientific Steering Group (SSG).

The Steering Committee consists of the general directors of the member institutes and is responsible for the strategic management of PEROSH. The SC discusses the inclusion of new members, the appointment of the chairperson and the vice-chairperson of the SC, the establishment and mandate of the SSG and working groups. They agree on the annual budget and approve the annual account of revenue and expenditures.

The Scientific Steering Group consists of the research/scientific directors of the member institutes of PEROSH. The SSG meets twice a year to coordinate ongoing research projects and to determine new research topics and collaboration options.

The Manager International Affairs represents PEROSH towards the bodies of the [[European Union]] (EU). He promotes European activities in OSH, prepares joint statements to EU queries, reacts to EU requests for tender, and organises workshops and conferences. He is responsible for the homepage and publishes a [[newsletter]] on relevant OSH aspects three times a year.

'''Pharmacoeconomics''' refers to the scientific discipline that compares the value of one pharmaceutical drug or drug therapy to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mueller|first=C|author2=Shur, C. |author3=O'Connell, J. |title=Prescription Drug Spending: The Impact of Age and Chronic Disease Status.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|year=1997|volume=87|issue=10|pages=1626–29|doi=10.2105/ajph.87.10.1626|pmc=1381124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2165/11537580-000000000-00000|pmid=20513161|pages=609–613|title=Time for Cooperation in Health Economics among the Modelling Community|journal=PharmacoEconomics|volume=28|issue=8|year=2010|last1=Arnold|first1=Renée J.G.|last2=Ekins|first2=Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a sub-discipline of [[health economics]]. A pharmacoeconomic study evaluates the cost (expressed in monetary terms) and effects (expressed in terms of monetary value, efficacy or enhanced [[quality of life]]) of a pharmaceutical product. Pharmacoeconomic studies serve to guide optimal healthcare resource allocation, in a standardized and scientifically grounded manner.

== Economic evaluation ==
Pharmacoeconomics centers on the [[economic evaluation]] of [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]], and can use [[cost-minimization analysis]], [[cost-benefit analysis]], [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] or [[cost-utility analysis]]. [[Quality-adjusted life year]]s have become the dominant outcome of interest in pharmacoeconomic evaluations, and many studies employ a cost-per-QALY analysis. Economic evaluations are carried out alongside [[randomized controlled trial]]s and using methods of decision-analytic modeling. Pharmacoeconomics is a useful method of economic evaluation of various treatment options. As more expensive drugs are being developed and licensed it has become imperative especially in context of developing countries where resources are scarce to apply the principles of pharmacoeconomics for various drugs and treatment options so that maximum improvement in quality of life can be achieved in minimum cost.&lt;ref&gt;Deepak Bhosle, Asif sayyed*, Shaikh Huzaif, Alimuddin Shaikh, Vasundhara Bhople, Ayman Ali Khan.PHARMACOECONOMICS IN INDIAN CONTEXT. International journal of current pharmceutical and clinical research vol 7 issue 1 -2017 11-14 http://ijcpcr.com/download.php?id=262&amp;f=1482469439(ijcpcr).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== In policy ==
In 1993, [[Australia]] became the first nation to use pharmacoeconomic analysis as part of the process for deciding whether new drugs should be subsidized by the [[Federation of Australia|Federal Government]]. The [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee]] (PBAC) advises Federal Government ministers on whether new drugs should be placed on a list for of drugs that consumers can then purchase from pharmacies at a subsidized price. Since 1993, this approach to evaluating costs and benefits is used in Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the UK.

'''Population Impact Measures (PIMs)''' are [[biostatistics |biostatistical]] measures of risk and benefit used in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] and [[public health]] research. They are used to describe the impact of health risks and benefits in a population, to inform health policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heller |first1=R.

Frequently used measures of risk and benefit identified by Jerkel, Katz and Elmore, &lt;ref&gt;Jekel JF, Katz DL, Elmore JG Epidemiology, biostatistics, and preventive medicine: Chapter 6 Assessment of risk and benefit in epidemiologic studies Elsevier Health Sciences, 2001{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; describe measures of risk difference (attributable risk), rate difference (often expressed as the [[odds ratio]] or [[relative risk]]), [[attributable risk|Population Attributable Risk (PAR)]], and the [[relative risk reduction]], which can be recalculated into a measure of ''absolute benefit'', called the [[Number needed to treat]]. Population Impact Measures are an extension of these statistics, as they are measures of absolute risk at the population level, which are calculations of number of people in the population who are at risk to be harmed, or who will benefit from Public Health interventions. 

They are measures of absolute risk and benefit, producing numbers of people who will benefit from an intervention or be at risk from a [[risk factor]] within a particular local or national population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torun |first1=P. |last2=Heller |first2=R.

They may have special relevance for local policy-making. They depend on the ability to obtain and use local data, and by being explicit about the data required may have the added benefit of encouraging the collection of such data.

==The measures==
To describe the impact of preventive and treatment interventions, the Number of Events Prevented in a Population (NEPP) is defined as ''"the number of events prevented by the intervention in your population over a defined time period"''. NEPP extends the well-known measure [[Number needed to treat]] (NNT) beyond the individual patient to the population. To describe the impact of a risk factor on causing ill health and disease the Population Impact Number of Eliminating a Risk factor (PIN-ER-t) is defined as ''"the potential number of disease events prevented in a population over the next t years by eliminating a risk factor"''. The PIN-ER-t extends the well-known [[Attributable risk|Population Attributable Risk]] (PAR) to a particular population and relates it to disease incidence, converting the PAR from a measure of relative to absolute risk.

The components for the calculations are as follows: Population denominator (size of the population); Proportion of the population with the disease; Proportion of the population exposed to the risk factor or the incremental proportion of the diseased population eligible for the proposed intervention (the latter requires the actual or estimated proportion who are currently receiving the interventions ‘subtracted’ from best practice goal from guidelines or targets, adjusted for likely compliance with the intervention); Baseline risk – the probability of the outcome of interest in this or similar populations; and Relative Risk of outcome given exposure to a risk factor or Relative Risk Reduction associated with the intervention.

==Number of Events Prevented in your Population; NEPP==
The formula is: NEPP=N*Pd*Pe*ru*RRR where: N = population size, Pd = prevalence of the disease, Pe = proportion eligible for treatment, ru = risk of the event of interest in the untreated group or baseline risk over appropriate time period (can be multiplied by life expectancy to produce life-years), RRR = relative risk reduction associated with treatment.

In order to reflect the incremental effect of changing from current to ‘best’ practice, and to adjust for levels of compliance, the proportion eligible for treatment, Pe, is (Pb-Pt)*Pc, where Pt is the proportion currently treated, Pb is the proportion that would be treated if best practice was adopted, and Pc is the proportion of the population who are compliant with the intervention.

You can calculate the NEPP and its confidence intervals [https://www.webcitation.org/5UvTU5t4v?url=http://www.phsim.man.ac.uk/nepp/ at this web site] from the [https://www.webcitation.org/5LeSrLsVX?url=http://www.phsim.man.ac.uk/ Population Health Decision Support &amp; Simulation site].

[Note: Number Needed to Treat (NNT): 1/(Baseline risk x Relative Risk Reduction)]

==Population Impact Number of Eliminating a Risk Factor; PIN-ER-t==
The formula is: PIN-ER-t = N*Ip*PAR Where: N is the number of people in the population; Ip the baseline risk of the outcome of interest in the population as a whole; t is the time period over which the outcome is measured.

The PAR/F, Population Attributable Risk (or Fraction), is calculated for two or multiple strata. The basic formula to compute the PAR for dichotomous variables is PAR = Pe*(RR-1)/1+ Pe*(RR-1). Where: Pe is the prevalence of the population within each income stratum as the exposure, and RR is the prevalence of risk factors in each stratum relative to the highest income fifth. This is modified where there are multiple strata to: PAR = [Pe1(RR1-1)+Pe2(RR2-1)+Pe3(RR3-1)…]/[1+Pe1(RR1-1)+Pe2(RR2-1)+ Pe3(RR3-1)...].
You can calculate the PIN-ER-t and its confidence intervals [https://archive.is/20121223091849/http://www.phsim.man.ac.uk/pinert/ at this web site] from the [https://www.webcitation.org/5LeSrLsVX?url=http://www.phsim.man.ac.uk/ Population Health Decision Support &amp; Simulation site].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11459">The field of '''population informatics''' is the systematic study of populations via secondary analysis of massive data collections (termed "[[big data]]") about people.  Scientists in the field refer to this massive data collection as the [[social genome]], denoting the collective [[digital footprint]] of our society.  Population informatics applies [[data science]] to social genome data to answer fundamental questions about human society and population health much like [[bioinformatics]] applies data science to [[human genome]] data to answer questions about individual health. It is an emerging research area at the intersection of SBEH (Social, Behavioral, Economic, &amp; Health) sciences, computer science, and statistics in which quantitative methods and computational tools are used to answer fundamental questions about our society.

== Introduction ==

=== History ===
The term was first used in August 2012 when the [http://research.tamhsc.edu/pinformatics/about-us/#history Population Informatics Research Group] was founded at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The term was first defined in a peer reviewed article in 2013&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Privacy-by-Design: Understanding Data Access Models for Secondary Data|journal = AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings AMIA Summit on Translational Science|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 2153-4063|pmc = 3845756|pmid = 24303251|pages = 126–130|volume = 2013|first = Hye-Chung|last = Kum|first2 = Stanley|last2 = Ahalt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further elaborated on in another article in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Genome: Putting Big Data to Work for Population Informatics|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6678338&amp;url=http%253A%252F%252Fieeexplore.ieee.org%252Fiel7%252F2%252F5306045%252F06678338.pdf%253Farnumber%253D6678338|journal = Computer|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 0018-9162|pages = 56–63|volume = 47|issue = 1|doi = 10.1109/MC.2013.405|first = Hye-Chung|last = Kum|first2 = A.|last2 = Krishnamurthy|first3 = A.|last3 = Machanavajjhala|first4 = S.C.|last4 = Ahalt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [http://dmm.anu.edu.au/popinfo2015/ Workshop on Population Informatics for Big Data] was held at the ACM SIGKDD conference in Sydney, Australia, in August 2015.

=== Goals ===
To study social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences using the massive data collections, aka [[social genome]] data, about people.  The primary goal of population informatics is to increase the understanding of social processes by developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to the [[social genome]] data.

Some of the important sub-disciplines are :
* [[Business analytics]]
* [[Social computing]]: social network data analysis
* Policy informatics
* [[Public health informatics]] 
* [[Computational journalism]]
* [[Computational transportation science]]
* [[Computational epidemiology]]
* [[Computational economics]]
* [[Computational sociology]]
* [[Computational social science]]

=== Approaches ===
[[Record linkage|Record Linkage]], the task of finding records in a dataset that refer to the same entity across different data sources, is a major activity in the population informatics field because most of the digital traces about people are fragmented in many heterogeneous databases that need to be linked before analysis can be done.

Once relevant datasets are linked, the next task is usually to develop valid meaningful measures  to answer the research question.  Often developing measures involves iterating between inductive and deductive approaches with the data and research question until usable measures are developed because the data were collected for other purposes with no intended use to answer the question at hand.  Developing meaningful and useful measures from existing data is a major challenge in many research projects.  In computation fields, these measures are often called features.

Finally, with the datasets linked and required measures developed, the analytic dataset is ready for analysis.  Common analysis methods include traditional hypothesis driven research as well more inductive approaches such as [[data science]] and [[predictive analytics]].

=== Relation to other fields ===
[[Computational social science]] refers to the academic sub-disciplines concerned with computational approaches to the social sciences. This means that computers are used to model, simulate, and analyze social phenomena. Fields include [[computational economics]] and [[computational sociology]].  The seminal article on computational social science is by Lazer et al. 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Life in the network: the coming age of computational social science|journal = Science |date = 2009-02-06|issn = 0036-8075|pmc = 2745217|pmid = 19197046|pages = 721–723|volume = 323|issue = 5915|doi = 10.1126/science.1167742|first = David|last = Lazer|first2 = Alex (Sandy)|last2 = Pentland|first3 = Lada|last3 = Adamic|first4 = Sinan|last4 = Aral|first5 = Albert Laszlo|last5 = Barabasi|first6 = Devon|last6 = Brewer|first7 = Nicholas|last7 = Christakis|first8 = Noshir|last8 = Contractor|first9 = James|last9 = Fowler}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a summary of a workshop held at Harvard with the same title.  However, the article does not define the term computational social science precisely.

In general, computational social science is a broader field and encompasses population informatics.  Besides population informatics, it also includes complex [[simulation]]s of social phenomena.  Often complex simulation models use results from population informatics to configure with real world parameters.

Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) is another similar field coming about.  But again, DSSG is a bigger field applying data science to any social problem that includes study of human populations but also many problems that do not use any data about people.

Population reconstruction is the multi-disciplinary field to reconstruct specific (historical) populations by linking data from diverse sources, leading to rich novel resources for study by social scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Population Reconstruction - Springer|url = https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-19884-2|doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-19884-2|last = Bloothooft|first = G.|last2 = Christen|first2 = P.|last3 = Mandemakers|first3 = K.|last4 = Schraagen|first4 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Related groups and workshops ===
The first [https://dmm.anu.edu.au/popinfo2015/ Workshop on Population Informatics for Big Data] was held at the ACM SIGKDD conference in Sydney, Australia, in 2015. The workshop brought together computer science researchers, as well as public health practitioners and researchers.  This Wikipedia page started at the workshop.

The [http://www.ipdln.org/ International Population Data Linkage Network (IPDLN)] facilitates communication between centres that specialize in data linkage and users of the linked data. The producers and users alike are committed to the systematic application of data linkage to produce community benefit in the population and health-related domains.

=== Challenges ===
Three major challenges specific to population informatics are: 
# Preserving privacy of the subjects of the data – due to increasing concerns of privacy and confidentiality sharing or exchanging sensitive data about the subjects across different organizations is often not allowed. Therefore, population informatics need to be applied on encrypted data or in a privacy-preserving setting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dinusha Vatsalan, Peter Christen, and Vassilios S.

# Scalability – databases are continuously growing in size which makes population informatics computationally expensive in terms of the size and number of data sources.&lt;ref&gt;Thilina Ranbaduge, Dinusha Vatsalan, and Peter Christen.

A '''portable hyperbaric bag''', of which one brand is the '''Gamow bag''' (pronounced Gam-Off) is an inflatable pressure bag large enough to accommodate a person inside. A person can be placed inside the bag which is sealed and inflated with a foot pump. Within minutes, the effective altitude can be decreased by 1000 to as much as 3000 meters (3281 to 9743 feet) depending on the elevation. The bag is pressurised to 105-220 [[Millimeter of mercury|mmHg]], pressure gradient is regulated by pop-off valves set to the target pressure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Altitude Illness - Pulmonary Syndromes Treatment &amp; Management: Prehospital Care, Emergency Department Care, Consultations|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/773065-treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily used for treating severe cases of [[altitude sickness]],&lt;ref name=MedicalProblems&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cymerman, A |author2=Rock, PB |title=Medical Problems in High Mountain Environments.

Patients typically are treated in 1-hour increments and then are reevaluated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
The Gamow bag was named after its inventor, Dr. [[Igor Gamow]], son of [[George Gamow]]. Dr. Gamow originally designed a predecessor to the gamow bag called "The Bubble" to study the effect of [[high altitude]] on stamina and performance in athletes. Dr. Gamow later re-designed 'The Bubble' into a bag that could be used in the high-altitude wilderness.

Implementing '''[https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/what-is-positive-psychology-definition/ positive psychology in the workplace]''' means creating an environment that is relatively enjoyable and productive. This also means creating a work schedule that does not lead to emotional and physical distress.

== Overview ==
Positive psychology in the workplace is about shifting attention away from negative aspects such as work violence, stress, burnout, and job insecurity.  Through the employment of positive psychology, a working environment with a goal of promoting positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]] in its employees can be created.

Fun should not be looked at as something that cannot be achieved during work but rather as a motivation factor for the staff. Along this line, it is important to examine the role of: helping behaviors, team building exercises, job resources, job security and work support.

The emerging field of positive psychology also helps to creatively manage organizational behaviors and to increase productivity in the workplace through applying positive organizational forces.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Martin,"The Role of Positive Psychology in Enhancing Satisfaction, Motivation, and Productivity in the Workplace", ''University of Western Sydney'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [https://ac.els-cdn.com/S2212567115005249/1-s2.0-S2212567115005249-main.pdf?_tid=28d0c67c-0fed-4ac8-9427-7922223a1bf2&amp;acdnat=1528124041_9f693294307226eb549b3cd6894ad089 Recent researches on job satisfaction] and [[employee retention]] have created a great need to focus on implementing positive psychology in the workplace.

==Background==
According to the [[United States Department of Labor]], “In 2009 employed persons worked an average of 7.5 hours on the days they worked, which were mostly weekdays. [In addition to that], 84 percent of employed persons did some or all of their work at their workplace.[1]” &lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Labor Bureau of Statistics.”American Time Use Survey”. June 2010. http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that majority of the population spend their waking hours at work, outside their homes. Therefore, employers must do their best to create a low stress and inspiring work environment to yield greater productivity.

Michelle T. Iaffaldano and Paul M. Muchinsky were among the first people to ignite interest in the connection between [[job satisfaction]] and job performance. The meta-analytic research of these individuals impacted the way in which later research on the topic was conducted, especially regarding sample sizes.&lt;ref&gt;Iaffaldano M.T., &amp; Muchinsky P.M (1985). Job satisfaction and job performance: A meta-analysis. Psychological Bulletin, 97, 251-273&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major theoretical approaches ==
[[Martin E.P. Seligman]] and [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] are noted frontrunners in the area of positive psychology as a field of study. They state that “psychology has become a science largely about healing. Therefore its concentration on healing largely neglects the fulfilled individual and thriving community”.&lt;ref name="Seligman_and_Csikszentmihalyi"&gt;Seligman, M. E. P., &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, M. (2000). Positive psychology: An introduction. ''American Psychologist'', 55, 5–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi further stress that, “the aim of positive psychology is to begin to catalyze a change in the focus of psychology from preoccupation only with repairing the worst things in life to also building positive qualities.”&lt;ref name="Seligman_and_Csikszentmihalyi" /&gt;

[[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Carl Rogers]] developed [[Humanistic Psychology]] that focuses on the positive potential of people and on helping people reach their full potential.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, D. L., Gilbert, D. T., &amp; Wegner, D. M. (2009). Psychology: The evolution of a science. Psychology (p. 1.10). New York: Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Warr]] is noted for his early work on work well being. “Proponents of the well-being perspective argue that the presence of positive emotional states and positive appraisals of the worker and his or her relationships within the workplace accentuate worker performance and quality of life”.&lt;ref&gt;Harter, J., Schmidt, F., &amp; Keyes, C. 2003. Well-being in the workplace and its relationship to business outcomes: A review of the Gallup studies. In C. Keyes &amp; J. Haidt (eds.), Flourishing:
Positive psychology and the life well-lived: 205-224. Washington, DC: American Psychological
Association.&lt;/ref&gt; A common idea in work environment theories is that demands match or slightly exceed the resources. With regards to research concerning positive outcomes within the employment setting, several models have been established like ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952960/ Demand Control]'', ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4628698/ Job Demands-Resources]'', and ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4306429/ Job Characteristics]''.

===Demand control model===
Robert A. Karasek is credited with this particular work design model. In Karasek’s model, workplace stress is in indicator of how taxing a worker's job is and how much control, authority, discretion, and decision latitude the worker has over his/her tasks and duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stress: Myth, theory and research|last=Jones|first=F.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2001|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates four kinds of jobs—passive, active, low strain and high strain  [http://paei.wikidot.com/karasek-demand-control-model-of-job-stress The Demand Control Model] (DCM) has been used by researchers to design jobs that enhance the psychological and physical well-being.&lt;ref name="Turner N. 2002 pp. 715"&gt;Turner N., Barling J., &amp; Zacharatos A. (2002). Positive psychology at work. In C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 715–728). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This model promotes a work design that proposes high demand and high control, fostering an environment that encourages learning and simultaneously offers autonomy.

This model is based on the assumption that “workers with active jobs are more likely to seek challenging situations that promote mastery, thereby encouraging skill and knowledge acquisition”.&lt;ref&gt;Turner N., Barling J., &amp; Zacharatos A. (2002). Positive psychology at work. In C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), ''Handbook of positive psychology'' (pp. 715–728). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It also points out the role of social support, referring to the quality interactions between colleagues and managers.&lt;ref&gt;Ruckenbiel J. (2013).Gesundheit, Arbeit und Zusammenhalt (pp. 93-122).Freiburg: Centaurus Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is some controversy over this model because some researchers &lt;ref&gt;Toon W. Taris (2006). Bricks without clay: On urban myths in occupational health psychology. Work &amp; Stress Vol. 20, Iss. 2..&lt;/ref&gt; believe it lacks evidence for the interaction between demand and control.

The DCM is commonly criticized for its inability to consistently replicate findings to support its basic assumption. The DCM has been criticized{{By whom|date=June 2012}} for “its simplicity, inability to capture the complexity of work environments.However, there is evidence supporting the idea that “high amounts of [[Job control (workplace)|job control]] is associated with increases in job satisfaction and decreased depression, however, high demands with out adequate control may lead to increase anxiety”.&lt;ref name="Turner N. 2002 pp. 715" /&gt;

===Job demands-resources===
The [[Job Demands-Resources model|job demands-resources model]] (JD-R) is an expansion of the DCM and is founded on the same principle that high job demands and high job resources produce employees with more positive work attitudes. The difference between the JD-R and DCM is that the JD-R expounds upon the differentiation between demand and resources, as well as encompasses a broader view of resources. This model refers to demands as “ those physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that require sustained physical and/or psychological effort.&lt;ref name="Bakker, A. 2010"&gt;Bakker, A. (2010). Psychosocial safety climate as a precursor to conducive work environments, psychological health problems, and employee engagement.  Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 83(3), 795-814.&lt;/ref&gt; This may refer to jobs that require contact with customers. Resources are regarded as “those physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that are either/or: (1) functional in achieving work goals; (2) reduce job demands and the associated physiological and psychological costs; and (3) stimulate personal growth, learning, and development”.&lt;ref name="Bakker, A. 2010"/&gt; Another difference between these two theories is that the JD-R postulates that resources can be predictors of motivation and learning related outcomes. The findings by Bakker and colleagues supports their hypothesis that many resources may be linked to job well-being. They also found that “task enjoyment and organizational commitment are the result of combinations of many different job demands and job resources. Enjoyment and commitment were high when employees were confronted with challenging and stimulating tasks, and simultaneously had sufficient resources at their disposal”.&lt;ref name="Bakker, A. 2010"/&gt;

===Job characteristics model===
The [[job characteristics model]] (JCM) is “an influential theory of work design developed by Hackman and Oldham. It is based upon five characteristics - skill variety, task identity, task significance, task autonomy, and task feedback - which are used to identify the general content and structure of jobs”.&lt;ref name="Turner N. 2002 pp. 715"/&gt; This model argues that employees with a personal need for growth and development, as well as knowledge and skill, will display more positive work outcomes. These include things such as: job satisfaction, lower absenteeism, and better work turnover. This model is based upon an idea that high task control and feedback are two essential elements for maximizing work potential. Stronger experiences of these five traits is said to lead to greater job satisfaction and better performance.&lt;ref name="Turner N. 2002 pp. 715"/&gt;

==Empirical evidence==

===Safety===

In order to protect the physical and mental health of workers, the demands of the job must be balanced by easily accessible job resources in order to prevent [[Occupational burnout|burnout]] in employees yet encourage [[employee engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;Nahrgang, J.D., Morgeson, F.P., &amp; Hofman, D.A. (2011). Safety at work: A meta-analytic investigation of the link between job demands, job resources, burnout, engagement, and safety outcomes. Journal of Applied Psychology, 96(1), 71-94&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between the demand and resources within a job determines employee engagement or burnout. Engagement signifies a positive employee who is committed to the safety within the workplace for self and others. In contrast, burnout represents a negative employee possessing elements of anxiety, depression, and work-related stress. Engagement increases as job resources like knowledge of safety are present. On the other hand, burnout increases when more job demands are present without the buffering effects of job resources.

Hazards in the workplace can be seen as a combination of the physical demands of the work and the complexity of the work. Job resources provide a buffering effect that protects the employees from job demands like high work pressure, an unfavorable physical environment, and emotionally demanding interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Nahrgang, J.D., Morgeson, F.P., &amp; Hofman, D.A. (2011). Safety at work: A meta-analytic investigation of the link between job demands, job resources, burnout, engagement, and safety outcomes. Journal of Applied Psychology, 96(1), 71-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Employees are better equipped to handle changes in their work environment when resources are readily available.&lt;ref&gt;Wanberg, C. R., &amp; Banas, J. T. (2000). Predictors and outcomes of openness to changes in a reorganizing workplace. Journal of Applied Psychology, 85: 132-142.&lt;/ref&gt; The resources a job can provide include [[autonomy]], support, and knowledge of safety. Autonomy allows employees the freedom to decide how to execute their work. Support can originate directly from a supervisor or from other workers in the environment. And lastly, employees must have knowledge about safety procedures and policies. When the employee is able to work in a safe environment, workers are more satisfied with their jobs. A safe environment provides support and resources that promote healthy employees.

===Emotion, attitude and mood===

[[Emotional intelligence]] is the ability to recognize, and interpret emotions that can be used to regulate emotions and assist cognitive processes which promote emotional and intellectual growth.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J. D., Salovey, P., &amp; Caruso, D. R. (2004). Emotional intelligence: Theory, findings, and implications. Psychological Inquiry, 15, 197–215.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional intelligence has been researched by Carmelli (2003) in order to see its effect on employees work performance.&lt;ref&gt;Carmelli, A. (2003). The relationship between emotional intelligence and work attitudes, behavior and outcomes. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 18, 788–813.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the social nature of the interactions of the employees, emotional intelligence is essential in order to work well with co-workers. When employees work well together their task performance improves and as a result the business benefits. With emotional intelligence, employees are better able to perceive others needing help and are more willing to help for intrinsic benefits.

Isen &amp; Reeve (2005) proposed that positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]] led to positive intrinsic [[motivation]] for completing a task.&lt;ref&gt;Isen, A. M., &amp; Reeve, J. (2005). The influence of positive affect on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation: Facilitating enjoyment of play, responsible work behavior, and self-control. Motivation and Emotion, 29, 295–323.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the intrinsic motivation, the employees enjoyed the task more and were more optimistic when having to complete more uninteresting task. The combination of having the freedom to choose tasks and maintaining positive affect results in better task performance. Positive affect promotes self-control to remain focused on any task and forward-looking thinking that motivates workers to look-forward to more enjoyable tasks.

Concepts of [[positive psychology]] like hope and [[altruism]] provide a positive work environment that influences the moods and attitudes of workers. Youssef &amp; Luthans (2007) examined the effects hope, optimism, and [[Psychological resilience|resilience]] had in the workplace on employees’ job performance, job satisfaction, [[Happiness at work|work happiness]], and organizational commitment.&lt;ref&gt;Youssef, C. M., &amp; Luthans, F. (2007). Positive organizational behavior in the workplace: The impact of hope, optimism, and resilience. Journal of Management, 33: 774-800.&lt;/ref&gt; Hope and resilience had a more direct effect on organizational commitment whereas hope had a greater impact on performance. Hope allows employees to be better at creating more realistic plans for completing task so as not to focus on the failure that accompanies an incomplete task. Optimism strengthens the employee’s resilience to break through barriers and causes the employee to build social support and other strengths to overcome obstacle he or she may encounter.

Positive psychology also encourages maintaining positive mood in the work environment to encourage productivity on an individual level and organizational level. [[Organizational citizenship behavior]]s (OCB) refer to behaviors like altruism and [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] that are not formal tasks in that the behaviors are not a mandatory of the workers job description. They are considered extra-role behaviors that help in gauging the workers commitment to the job and to the rules of the job in the absence of monitoring these behaviors. OCB have proven to improve the moods of employees and the moods in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Glomb, T.M., Bhave, D.P., Miner, A.G., &amp; Wall, M. (2011). Doing good, feeling good: Examining the role of organizational citizenship behaviors in changing mood. Personnel Psychology, 64(1), 191-223.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[helping behavior]] improves mood because the individual is no longer focused of negative moods; helping others acts as a distracter for the employee. Altruism is effective because it has more impact in a social setting like the workplace and is more extrinsically rewarding. OCB encourage positive interactions among workers and lead to better psychological health for employees.

According to Froman (2010), having a more hopeful perspective about life leads one to being more optimistic about responding to opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Froman, L. (2010). Positive psychology in the workplace. Journal of Adult Development, 17: 59-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Workers are more resilient to adversity and are able to bounce back more quickly. When organizations encourage positive attitudes in their employees, they grow and [[flourishing|flourish]]. As a result, the organization profits and grows from the human capital of productive employees and the monetary capital resulting from productive workers.

===Fun===

Chan (2010) studied fun activities in the workplace that created a positive work environment that could retain and attract employees and encourage employee well-being.&lt;ref name="Chan S.C.H. 2010"&gt;Chan S.C.H., (2010) Does workplace fun matter? Developing a useable (sic) typology of workplace fun in a qualitative study. International Journal of Hospitality Management, 29(4), 720-728.&lt;/ref&gt; Activities must be enjoyable and pleasurable. The activities also encourage employees to be more responsible and a team player. These qualities empower employees to more engaged with their work, take on more leadership roles, and experience less stress. Making work fun promotes positive, happy moods in employees that in turn increase job satisfaction and organizational commitment. According to Chan’s framework, workplace fun must be staff-oriented, supervisor-oriented, social-oriented, or strategy oriented.&lt;ref name="Chan S.C.H. 2010"/&gt; While staff-oriented activities focus on creating fun work for employees, supervisor-oriented activities create a better relationship between the employees and supervisors.  Social-oriented activities create social events that are organizational-based (i.e. company barbecue or Christmas office party). Strategy-oriented activities allow more autonomy with employees in different aspects of their work in hopes of cultivating strengths within the organization’s employees. The framework proposes that a fun work environment promotes employee well-being in addition to fostering creativity, enthusiasm, satisfaction and communication among the organization’s employees. The research found in this study hopes to encourage implementing other work fun activities in other various industries in order to engage and retain positive employees.

==Appliance==

There are several examples of popular, real-world uses of infusing Positive Psychology in the workplace. In such contexts such as a workplace, researchers often hope to examine and measure variable levels of such factors such as productivity and organization. One such popular model is the aforementioned Job Characteristics Model (JCM), which applies influential theories of work as it correlates to the five central characteristics of skill variety, task identity, task significance, task autonomy, and task feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Turner N., Barling J., &amp; Zacharatos A. (2002). Positive psychology at work. In
C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 715–728). New
York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such practices such as business teams within a workplace often present the varying dynamics of positivity and negativity in business behaviors. There are often a plethora of special research teams that go into looking at certain workplaces in order to help report to employers the status of their employees. Furthermore, the three psychological states often measured and examined are: meaningfulness of performed work, responsibility of outcomes, and results knowledge. In mixing together these aspects, a score is generated in order to observe a range reflecting a job quality. In addition, each score details the differing degrees of autonomy and necessary feedback as it relates to ensuring high quality work. Most research points to the fact that typical teams of high performance are those that function high on positivity in their workplace behaviors.

==Controversies==

Adequate research regarding whether the practice of measuring factors, such as positive behaviors is lacking. More specifically, in attempting to measure some form of a variable in order to later ensure a positive environment context in the workplace, there is debate to an extent regarding which proper components to value and measure. Additionally, the act and process of specifically looking into certain factors of productivity in the workplace can also go on to influence workers negatively due to pressure.

==Conclusion==

The multitudes of research and new, developing information detailing the possibility of positive psychology at work often deals with reporting [[occupational safety and health|workplace safety]], the engagement of the employees, productivity, and overall happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Turner N., Barling J., &amp; Zacharatos A. (2002). Positive psychology at work. In C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 715–728). New
York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, understanding the significance of a healthy work environment can directly provide and contribute to work mastery and work ethic. Motivation, researchers have learned, helps to keep a reinforced sense of both discipline and a higher perception which then yields to higher levels of efficiency for both employees and employers.

'''Proximates''' are used in the analysis of biological materials as a decomposition of a human-consumable good into its major constituents.  They are a good approximation of the contents of packaged comestible goods and serve as a cost-effective and easy verification of nutritional panels. This means that testing can be used to verify lots, but cannot be used to validate a food processor or food processing facility; instead, a nutritional assay must be conducted on the product to qualify said producers. Nutritional panels in the United States are regulated by the FDA and must undergo rigorous testing to ensure the exact and precise content of nutrients. This should prevent food processors from making unfounded claims to the public.&lt;ref group=FDA&gt;{{cite web|title=Labeling &amp; Nutrition|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm064894.htm|work=Guidance for Industry: A Food Labeling Guide (7. Nutrition Labeling; Questions G1 through P8)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In industry, the standard proximates are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silliker Labs|url=http://www.merieuxnutrisciences.com/us/eng/silliker/our-solutions/chemistry/food-quality/345|work=Food Quality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Covance|url=http://nutri.covance.com/catalog/4-addassay.php?assay_id=238|work=Proximate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurofins|url=http://www.eurofinsus.com/services/Proximate_Testing.html|work=Proximate Testing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ash
*Moisture
*Proteins
*Fat
*Carbohydrates (calculated)
Analytically, four of the five constituents are obtained via chemical reactions and experiments. The fifth constituent, carbohydrates, are calculated based on the determination of the four others. Proximates should nearly always account for 100% of a food product; any deviation from 100% displays the resolution of the chemical test, as small variations in the way each test is performed accumulate or overlap the compositional make-up.

There are additional ingredients that may fall under the category of one of the five constituents. Carbohydrates, for example, include but are not limited to:
*Dietary fibers
*Sugars
*Sugar alcohol 
Whereas ash includes but is not limited to:
*Dietary minerals (sodium, potassium, iron, calcium)
*Vitamins (β-Carotene, retinol, vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, B vitamins)  
Although proximates do not give the entire nutritional assay, they are an inexpensive way to track deviations in the quality of foods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7551">The Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB) is a general health [[quality of life]] [[questionnaire]] which measures overall status and [[well-being]] over the previous three days in four areas: physical activities, social activities, mobility, and symptom/problem complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rehab Measures: Quality of Well Being and Self-Administered version|url=http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=1037|work=RehabMeasures.org|publisher=Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of 71 items and takes 20 minutes to complete.&lt;ref name= "guide"&gt;{{cite book|last=McDowell|first=Ian|title=MEASURING HEALTH: A Guide to Rating Scales and Questionnaires|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195165675|pages=675–683|url=http://a4ebm.org/sites/default/files/Measuring%20Health.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two different versions of the QWB; the original was designed to be administered by an interviewer, and the second development (the QWB-SA) was designed to be self-administered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality of Well Being|url=http://www.scireproject.com/outcome-measures/quality-of-well-being|work=SCIREproject.com|publisher=Monkey Hill Health Communications|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four domain scores of the questionnaire are combined into a total score that ranges from 0 to 1.0, with 1.0 representing optimum function and 0 representing death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health-Related Quality of Life Measures|url=http://www.healthmeasurement.org/Measures.html|work=HealthMeasurement.org|publisher=The Health Measurement Research Group|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The QWB was originally called the Health Status Index, then the Index of Well-Being, and then eventually became the Quality of Well-Being Scale.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt; It has undergone several modifications since its development.

The process of administering the QWB can be described in three stages. They are the assessment of functional status, scaling the responses and indicating [[prognosis]].

Assessment of functional status involves a structured interview which records the symptoms and problems experienced over the last eight days. It is used to classify the patient’s level of functioning. The interview takes about seven minutes or longer, according to the patient’s level of health. Questions in the interview covered three criteria of functioning: physical activity, social activity and mobility and confinement. The interview also records the presence of symptoms or problem complexes, which are problems that were experienced on the previous day, but were not being experienced at the present time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Busija|first=L|author2=Pausenberger, E |author3=Haines, TP |author4=Haymes, S |author5=Buchbinder, R |author6= Osborne, RH |title=Adult measures of general health and health-related quality of life: Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-Item (SF-36) and Short Form 12-Item (SF-12) Health Surveys, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 6D (SF-6D), Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB), and Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL).|journal=Arthritis Care &amp; Research|date=Nov 2011|volume=63|issue=Suppl 11|pages=S383-412|doi=10.1002/acr.20541|pmid=22588759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The responses from the interview were then scaled. Preference weights were given for each function level by 867 raters. The preference weights indicated the social judgement of the importance of each function level. A score is generated, which is known as W. W can then be adjusted to reflect the [[prognosis]] of a given medical condition.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt;

== International use ==
Since the development of the Quality of Well-Being Scale and the consequent Quality of Well-Being Scale-Self Administered, the questionnaire has been utilized in numerous studies worldwide. Due to the general nature of the questionnaire, it has proven useful in a variety of different formats and contexts.

One way in which the QWB and the QWB-SA has been utilized is that it has been a comparator used to validate other measures, or a starting point for creating subscales of the questionnaire. An example of this is a subscale developed for use with the QWB-SA that assesses [[mental health]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarkin|first=AJ|author2=Groessl, EJ |author3=Carlson, JA |author4=Tally, SR |author5=Kaplan, RM |author6=Sieber, WJ |author7= Ganiats, TG |title=Development and validation of a mental health subscale from the Quality of Well-Being Self-Administered.|journal=Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation|date=Sep 2013|volume=22|issue=7|pages=1685–96|doi=10.1007/s11136-012-0296-2|pmid=23104088|pmc=4819419}}&lt;/ref&gt; a comparator study seeking to investigate the Health and Activity Limitation Index&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boslaugh|first=SE|author2=Andresen, EM |author3=Recktenwald, A |author4= Gillespie, K |title=Evidence for potential bias in the Health and Activity Limitation Index as a health preference measure for persons with disabilities.|journal=Disability and health journal|date=Jan 2009|volume=2|issue=1|pages=20–6|doi=10.1016/j.dhjo.2008.07.004|pmid=21122739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a study seeking to validate a new questionnaire called the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)-8D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=J|author2=Iezzi, A |author3=Khan, MA |author4= Maxwell, A |title=Validity and Reliability of the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)-8D Multi-Attribute Utility Instrument.|journal=The patient|date=Nov 23, 2013|pmid=24271592 |doi=10.1007/s40271-013-0036-x |pmc=3929769 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=85–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The QWB and the QWB-SA have also been validated or assessed for suitability in various cultures and countries.

'''Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals''' ('''REACH''') is a [[European Union regulation]] dating from 18 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Full title: Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; REACH addresses the production and use of [[chemical substance]]s, and their potential impacts on both human health and the environment.  Its 849 pages took seven years to pass, and it has been described as the most complex legislation in the Union's history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=EU's REACH chemicals law begins life in Helsinki | date=31 May 2007 | publisher=EUobserver.com | url=http://euobserver.com/9/24169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most important in 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Q&amp;A: Reach chemicals legislation | date=28 November 2005 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4437304.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the strictest law to date regulating chemical substances and will affect industries throughout the world.&lt;ref name="US affected"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/14/MNGR2MV8UT1.DTL&amp;hw=toxic+chemicals&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 | title=European Parliament OKs world's toughest law on toxic chemicals | date=14 December 2006 | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Marla | last=Cone}}&lt;/ref&gt; REACH entered into force on 1 June 2007, with a phased implementation over the next decade. The regulation also established the [[European Chemicals Agency]], which manages the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of REACH.

==Overview==
[[File:European Chemicals Agency.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|[[European Chemicals Agency]] headquarters in {{ill|Annankatu (Helsinki)|fi}}.]]

When REACH is fully in force, it will require all companies manufacturing or importing chemical substances into the European Union in quantities of one [[tonne]] or more per year to register these substances with a new [[European Chemicals Agency]] (ECHA) in {{ill|Annankatu (Helsinki)|fi}}, [[Finland]]. Since REACH applies to some substances that are contained in objects (''articles'' in REACH terminology), any company importing goods into Europe could be affected.&lt;ref name="US affected"/&gt;

The [[European Chemicals Agency]] has set three major deadlines for registration of chemicals. In general these are determined by tonnage manufactured or imported, with 1000 tonnes/a. being required to be registered by 1 December 2010, 100 tonnes/a. by 1 June 2013 and 1 tonne/a. by 1 June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reagent.co.uk/blog/what-is-reach/|title=What is REACH? – ReAgent Chemical Services|date=6 February 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, chemicals of higher concern or toxicity also have to meet the 2010 deadline.

About 143,000 chemical substances marketed in the European Union were pre-registered by the 1 December 2008 deadline. Although pre-registering was not mandatory, it allows potential registrants much more time before they have to fully register. Supply of substances to the European market which have not been pre-registered or registered is illegal (known in REACH as "no data, no market").

REACH also addresses the continued use of chemical ''[[substance of very high concern|substances of very high concern]]'' (SVHC) because of their potential negative impacts on human health or the environment. From 1 June 2011, the European Chemicals Agency must be notified of the presence of SVHCs in articles if the total quantity used is more than one tonne per year and the SVHC is present at more than 0.1% of the mass of the object. Some uses of SVHCs may be subject to prior authorisation from the European Chemicals Agency, and applicants for authorisation will have to include plans to replace the use of the SVHC with a safer alternative (or, if no safer alternative exists, the applicant must work to find one) - known as ''substitution''. {{As of|2015|06|15}}, there are 168 SVHCs on the candidate list for authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

REACH applies to all [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] imported or produced in the EU. The European Chemicals Agency will manage the technical, [[Science|scientific]] and administrative aspects of the REACH system.

To somewhat simplify the registration of the 143,000 substances and to limit vertebrate animal testing as far as possible, substance information exchange forums (SIEFs) are formed amongst legal entities (such as manufacturers, importers, and data holders) who are dealing with the same substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://echa.europa.eu/sief_en.asp |title=Substance Information Exchange Fora&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher=[[European Chemicals Agency]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223062045/http://echa.europa.eu/sief_en.asp |archivedate=2009-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows them to join forces and finances to create 1 registration dossier. However, this creates a series of new problems as a SIEF is the cooperation between sometimes a thousand legal entities that did not know each other at all before but suddenly must:
*find each other and start communicating openly and honestly
*start sharing data
*start sharing costs in a fair and transparent way
*democratically and in full consensus take the most complex decisions
in order to complete a several thousand end points dossier in a limited time.

The [[European Commission]] supports businesses affected by REACH by handing out &amp;ndash; free of charge &amp;ndash; a software application ([[IUCLID]]) that simplifies capturing, managing, and submitting data on chemical properties and effects. Such submission is a mandatory part of the [[REACh authorisation procedure|registration process]]. Under certain circumstances the performance of a [[chemical safety assessment]] (CSA) is mandatory and a [[chemical safety report]] (CSR) assuring the safe use of the substance has to be submitted with the dossier. Dossier submission is done using the web-based software [[REACH-IT]].

The aim of REACH is to improve the protection of human health and the environment by identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances. At the same time, innovative capability and competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry should be enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reach|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|website = TEPPFA|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The European Commission’s (EC) White Paper of 2001 on a ‘future chemical strategy’ proposed a system that requires chemicals manufactured in quantities of greater than 1 tonne to be ‘registered’, those manufactured in quantities greater than 100 tonnes to be ‘evaluated’, and certain substances of high concern (for example carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic to reproduction - CMR’s) to be ‘authorised’.

The EC adopted its proposal for a new scheme to manage the manufacture, importation and supply of chemicals in Europe on in October 2003. This proposal eventually became law once the European Parliament officially approved its final text of REACH. It came into force on 1 June 2007.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
One of the major elements of the REACH [[regulation]] is the requirement to communicate information on [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] up and down the [[supply chain]]. This ensures that manufacturers, importers, and also their customers are aware of information relating to [[health]] and [[safety]] of the products supplied. For many [[retail]]ers the obligation to provide information about [[Chemical substance|substance]]s in their products within 45 days of receipt of a request from a [[consumer]] is particularly challenging. Having detailed information on the substances present in their products will allow retailers to work with the manufacturing base to substitute or remove potentially harmful substances from products. The list of harmful substances is continuously growing and requires [[organization]]s to constantly monitor any announcements and additions to the REACH scope. This can be done on the [[European Chemicals Agency]]'s website.

===Registration===
A requirement is to collect, collate and submit data to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the hazardous properties of all substances (except Polymers and non-isolated intermediates) manufactured or imported into the EU in quantities above 1 tonne per year. Certain substances of high concern, such as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductive toxic substances (CMRs) will have to be authorised.

Chemicals will be registered in three phases according to the tonnage of the substance evaluation:

More than 1000 tonnes a year, or substances of highest concern, must be registered in the first 3 years;

100-1000 tonnes a year must be registered in the first 6 years;

1-100 tonnes a year must be registered in the first 11 years.

In addition, industry should prepare risk assessments and provide controls measures for using the substance safely to downstream users.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"/&gt;

===Evaluation===
Evaluation provides a means for the authorities to require registrants, and in very limited cases downstream users, to provide further information.

There are two types of evaluation: dossier evaluation and substance :

Dossier evaluation is conducted by authorities to examine proposals for testing to ensure that unnecessary animal tests and costs are avoided, and to check the compliance of registration dossier with the registration requirements.

The relevant authorities perform substance evaluation when there is a reason to suspect that a substance presents a risk to human health or the environment (e.g. because of its structural similarity to another substance). Therefore, all registration dossiers submitted for a substance are examined together and any other available information is taken into account.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"/&gt;

===Authorisation===
{{main|REACH authorisation procedure}}
The REACH proposal sets up a system under which the use of substances with properties of very high concern and their placing on the market can be made subject to an authorisation requirement.

This authorisation requirement ensures that risks from the use of such substances are either adequately controlled or justified by socio-economic grounds, having taken into account the available information on alternative substances or processes.

The Regulation enables restrictions of use to be introduced across the European Community where this is shown to be necessary. Member States or the Commission may prepare such proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = www.teppfa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information exchange===
[[File:REACh Dates.png|{{largethumb}}|REACh Key Dates]]

Manufactures and/or importers should develop risk reduction measures for all known uses of the chemical including downstream uses. Downstream users such as plastic pipe producers should provide detail of their uses to their suppliers. In cases where downstream users decide not to disclose this information, they need to have their own CSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = TEPPFA, The Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
REACH is the product of a wide-ranging overhaul of EU chemical policy.  It passed the first reading in the [[European Parliament]] on 17 November 2005, and the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] reached a political agreement for a common position on 13 December 2005. The European Parliament approved REACH on 13 December 2006 and the Council of Ministers formally adopted it on 18 December 2006. Weighing up expenditure versus profit has always been a significant issue, with the estimated cost of compliance being around €5&amp;nbsp;billion over 11&amp;nbsp;years, and the assumed health benefits of saved billions of euro in healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=EU backs landmark chemicals law | date=13 December 2005 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4524772.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been different studies on the estimated cost which vary considerably in the outcome. It came into force on 20 January 2009, and will be fully implemented by 2015.

A separate regulation – the [[CLP Regulation]] (for "Classification, Labelling, Packaging") – implements the United Nations [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS) and will steadily replace the previous [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|Dangerous Substances Directive]] and [[Dangerous Preparations Directive]].

The REACH regulation was amended in April 2018 to include specific information requirements for [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euon.echa.europa.eu/view-article/-/journal_content/title/improved-clarity-on-nanomaterials-in-the-eu-member-states-vote-to-amend-reach-annex-1|title=Improved clarity on nanomaterials in the EU - Member States vote to amend REACH Annexes|last=|first=|date=|publisher=The European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The legislation was proposed under dual reasoning: protection of [[health|human health]] and protection of [[natural environment|the environment]].

Using potentially [[toxic substances]] (such as [[phthalate]]s or [[brominated flame retardant]]s) is deemed undesirable and REACH will force the use of certain substances to be phased out. Using potentially toxic substances in products other than those [[ingest]]ed by humans (such as [[electronic device]]s) may seem to be safe, but there are several ways in which chemicals can enter the human body and the environment. Substances can leave particles during [[consumer]] use, for example into the air where they can be inhaled or ingested. Even where they might not do direct harm to humans, they can contaminate the air or water, and can enter the food chain through plants, fish or other animals. According to the European Commission, little safety information exists for 99 percent of the tens of thousands of chemicals placed on the market before 1981.&lt;ref name="US affected"/&gt; There were 100,106 chemicals in use in the EU in 1981, when the last survey was performed. Of these only 3,000 have been tested and over 800 are known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. These are listed in the Annex 1 of the [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|Dangerous Substances Directive]] (now Annex VI of the [[CLP Regulation]]).

Continued use of many toxic chemicals is sometimes justified because "at very low levels they are not a concern to health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Pesticides 'in a third of foods' | date=27 September 2006 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5384138.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these substances may [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in the human body, thus reaching dangerous concentrations. They may also [[chemical reaction|chemically react]] with one another,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Food chemicals 'may harm humans' | date=21 September 2006 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5366028.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing new substances with new risks.

==In non-EU countries==
A number of countries outside of the European Union have started to implement REACH-regulations or are in the process of adopting such a regulatory framework to approach a more globalized system of chemicals registration under the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130708194823/http://www.icis.com/Articles/2010/05/31/9362538/reach-like+regulations+enacted+globally.html ICIS.com REACH-like regulations enacted globally] retrieved July 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Balkan countries such as [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] are in the process of adopting the EU REACH system under the auspices of the EU IPA programme. [[Switzerland]] has moved towards implementation of REACH through partial revision of the Swiss Chemical Ordinance on February 1, 2009.  The new Chemicals Management Regulation in [[Turkey]] is paving the way for the planned adoption of REACH in 2013. [[China]] has moved towards a more efficient and coherent system for the control of chemicals in compliance with GHS.

==Controversy==
Apart from the potential costs to [[industry]] and the complexity of the new law, REACH has also attracted concern because of [[animal testing]]. Animal tests on [[vertebrate]]s are now required but allowed only once per each new substance and if suitable alternatives cannot be used.  If a company pays for such tests, it must sell the rights of the results for a "reasonable" price, which is not defined.  There are additional concerns that access to the necessary information may prove very costly for potential registrants needing to purchase it.

An opinion in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2009 by Thomas Hartung and Constanza Rovida estimated that 54 million vertebrate animals would be used under REACH and that the costs would amount to €9.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;T. Hartung &amp; C. Rovida: Chemical regulators have overreached. Opinion in Nature, vol. 460, 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hartung is the former head of European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In a news release, ECHA criticised assumptions made by Hartung and Rovida; ECHA's alternative assumptions reduced sixfold the number of animals.&lt;ref&gt;ECHA - [http://echa.europa.eu/doc/press/pr_09_11_animal_testing_20090828.pdf New study inaccurate on the number of test animals for REACH] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215231108/http://echa.europa.eu/doc/press/pr_09_11_animal_testing_20090828.pdf |date=2010-02-15 }}. Helsinki, 28 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

On 8 June 2006, the REACH proposal was criticized by non-EU countries, including the United States, India and [[Brazil]], which stated that the bill would hamper global trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Beunderman | title=EU chemicals bill under fire from US-led coalition | date=June 9, 2006 | publisher=EUobserver.com | url=http://euobserver.com/9/21813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Only representative services==
Non-EU consultancies offer "only representative" services, though according to REACH it is not possible to register a substance if your "only representative" consultancy company is not based in the EU, unless it is subcontracted to an EU-based registrant.

Only representatives are EU based entities that must comply with REACH (Article 8) and should operate standard, transparent working practices. The Only Representative assumes responsibility and [[Legal liability|liability]] for fulfilling obligiations of importers in accordance with REACH for substances being brought into the EU by a non-EU manufacturer.

The SIEFs will bring new challenges. An article in the business news service [[Chemical Watch]] described how some "pre-registrants" may simply be consultants hoping for work ("gold diggers") while others may be aiming to charge exorbitant rates for the data they have to offer ("jackals").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Authorisation List==
The [[European Chemical Agency]] (ECHA) has published the REACH Authorisation List,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/authorisation/recommendation-for-inclusion-in-the-authorisation-list/authorisation-list|title=Page has moved - ECHA|website=echa.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to tighten the use of [[substance of very high concern|Substances of Very High Concern]] (SVHCs). The list is an official recommendation from the ECHA to the [[European Commission]]. The list is also regularly updated and expanded. Currently the Candidate List for Authorisation comprises a total of 173 SVHCs, some of which are already active on the Authorization List.

To sell or use these substances, manufacturers, importers, and retailers in the [[European Union]] (EU) must apply for authorization from the [[European Chemical Agency|ECHA]]. The applicant is to submit a chemical safety report on the risks entailed by the substance, as well as an analysis of possible alternative substances or technologies including present and future [[research and development]] processed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5652">'''Dr. Robert Kezaala''' is a [[medical doctor]], [[epidemiologist]], [[scholar]] and [[public health]] leader in the field of [[immunization]] and health emergencies. Currently he is serving as a Senior Health Advisor and team lead for Accelerated Immunization Initiatives: measles, rubella, epidemic meningitis and yellow fever control and Immunization in Emergencies at the [[United Nations Children’s Fund]].

==Education==
Dr. Kezaala received his medical degree from [[Makerere University]] in [[Kampala, Uganda]]. He also holds an MPH from the [[Royal Tropical Institute]] (KIT) in Amsterdam, Netherlands majoring in epidemiology and health planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/rubella/mri_annual-report_2013.pdf |format=PDF |title=Measles &amp; Rubella Initiative : Annual Report 2013 |website=Who.int |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Dr. Kezaala has over 30 years of professional experience in public health including 24 years at international level. In the late 1980s, Dr. Kezaala practiced as Medical Officer in Karamoja province in the northeast of [[Uganda]] with recognized work in immunization and Tuberculosis control. From 1992 to 1993, Dr Kezaala worked with UNDP in multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS control where he managed the collaborative program that supported Uganda government efforts to address the AIDS epidemic. Thereafter, until 1998, he worked with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) as Regional Health Delegate for Eastern and Southern Africa, managing a variety of health interventions including HIV/AIDS control, community water and sanitation  and refugee health and emergency response when he led IFRC's initial health response in Goma during the 1994 Rwanda crisis. Subsequently, he joined the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), where he worked for 14 years, first as epidemiologist and Team Lead for WHO-EPI in [[Ethiopia]]. From 2001 to 2005, Dr. Kezaala headed Measles Control for the Africa Region of WHO, when the Africa region registered a reduction in measles mortality by 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://measlesrubellainitiative.org/introducing-robert-kezaala-head-of-measles-rubella-unicef/ |title=Introducing Robert Kezaala, Head of Measles &amp; Rubella, UNICEF - Measles &amp; Rubella Initiative |website=Measlesrubellainitiative.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61663-8/fulltext?rss=yes|format=PDF||title=Reducing the global burden of congenital rubella syndrome|accessdate=2017-02-24|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61663-8|volume=380|journal=The Lancet|pages=1145–1146}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the next seven years serving as a medical officer with the Polio Eradication Initiative at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. While here, he worked in country support across the globe, including Chad, Pakistan, the Horn of Africa and served as the outbreak response manager for the 2010 Polio outbreak that affected Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Russia. During the stint in GPEI, Dr Kezaala developed the Short Interval Additional Dose (SIAD) tactical approach that has since become a standard for Polio outbreak response. In 2012, Dr Kezaala served as WHO liaison officer to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in setting up the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) for CDC's global Polio Eradication Initiative. Since June 2012, Dr Kezaala has served as Senior Health Advisor at the UNICEF headquarters in New York in charge of the Accelerated Immunization Initiatives - responsible for Measles and Rubella control, Yellow Fever, epidemic Meningitis and immunization in emergency settings. In 2016, he was instrumental as liaison officer to WHO in the response to the central Africa Yellow Fever outbreak that affected Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. 

Numerous news outlets and reports such as U.S. News, CNN, TV2Africa, allAfrica have quoted Dr. Kezaala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Park |first=Madison |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/06/health/measles-worldwide/ |title=How bad is measles around the world? |website=CNN.com |date=2015-02-06 |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX3bV7Li1zg |title=Measles Outbreak |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/media/media_65821.html |title=Eighty-six percent decline in measles cases brings Western Pacific Region closer than ever to measles elimination &amp;#124; Press centre |publisher=UNICEF |date= |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a thought leader in topics related to public health, vaccines, health diplomacy and on Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200710080129.html|title=Uganda: Mediocrity Haunts Us|website=Allafrica.com|accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170202033758/https://reader.exacteditions.com/issues/3536/page/4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Entrepreneurs%3A+the+new+global+citizens.-a0160752368 |title=Entrepreneurs: the new global citizens |website=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200607250811.html|title=Uganda: Looking Into the Movement And the Future of the State - Part Two|website=Allafrica.com|accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-injury Awareness Day''' ('''SIAD''') (also known as '''Self-Harm Awareness Day''') is a [[grassroots]] annual global awareness event / campaign on March 1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lifesigns.org.uk/siad/ |title=SIAD: Self Injury Awareness Day: LifeSIGNS |format= |work= |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where on this day, and in the weeks leading up to it and after, some people choose to be more open about their own [[self-harm]], and awareness organizations make special efforts to raise awareness about self-harm and self-injury. Some people wear an orange [[List of awareness ribbons|awareness ribbon]], write "LOVE" on their arms, draw a butterfly on their wrists in awareness of "the Butterfly Project" [[Gel bracelet|wristband]] or beaded bracelet to encourage awareness of self-harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstsigns.org.uk/siad|title=FirstSigns VO :: SIAD :: Self Injury Awareness Day|format=|work=|accessdate=11 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224030710/http://www.firstsigns.org.uk/siad/|archivedate=24 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the people who observe SIAD is to break down the common stereotypes surrounding self-harm and to educate medical professionals about the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martinson|first=Deb|title=National Self-Injury Awareness Day|url=http://www.selfinjury.org/nsiad/|publisher=American Self Harm Information Clearinghouse|accessdate=11 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824030324/http://selfinjury.org/nsiad/|archivedate=24 August 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Depression and self-harm often go hand-in-hand, though there are many other reasons people self-harm.  As many as two million Americans currently engage in self-harm, with methods like cutting, scratching, bruising, and hitting themselves, along with other more harmful methods. It’s said that these behaviors promote feelings of control and help relieve tension, while helping the person express their emotions and escape the numbness that accompanies [[depression (mood)|depression]].

SIAD was created to spread [[awareness]] and understanding of self-injury, which is often misrepresented and misunderstood in the mainstream. Those who self-harm are often left feeling alone and afraid to reach out for help because they fear they'll be seen as "crazy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifesigns.org.uk/fact-sheets/|title=Self-Injury Awareness Booklet|last=|first=|date=|website=LifeSIGNS|publisher=|access-date=September 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participating organizations ==
Many organizations are now getting involved in SIAD. Some of them include:
* Sociedad Internacional de Autolesión
* LifeSIGNS (Self-Injury Guidance &amp; Network Support)
* Self-Injury Foundation
* YoungMinds
* ChildLine
* YouthNet
* Adolescent Self-Injury Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38809">'''Senior dog food diets''' are [[pet food]]s that are catered toward the senior or mature pet population. The senior [[dog]] population consists of dogs that are over the age of seven for most dog breeds,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though in general large and giant breed dogs tend to reach this life stage earlier when compared to smaller breed dogs who are considered senior at a much later age. Senior dog foods contain nutrients and characteristics that are used to improve the health of the aging dog. [[Aging in dogs]] causes many changes to occur physiologically that will require a change in nutrient composition of their diet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laflamme|first=Dorthy|date=May 2005|title=Nutrition for Aging Cats and Dogs and the Importance of Body Condition|url=https://ac-els-cdn-com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/S0195561604001871/1-s2.0-S0195561604001871-main.pdf?_tid=d0e74ada-ba60-11e7-9d4f-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1509031244_1d1d81a201707fe80bac30e75e283d30|journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice|volume=35|pages=713–742|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major change that occurs is the decrease in energy requirements&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is addressed by lowered caloric content of senior pet foods. Although energy requirements decrease, protein requirements increase as the dog ages. Senior dog foods include a higher [[protein]] content as well as highly digestible protein sources to deal with this. Nutrients included for joint and bone health include [[glucosamine]], [[chondroitin]], [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] fatty acids as well as two main minerals; [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]]. Sources of [[fiber]] included in senior dog foods include [[beet pulp]] and [[flax seed]] as well as [[fructooligosaccharide]]s (FOS) and mannanoligosaccharides (MOS). These act to increase gastrointestinal health. Brain and cognitive health decline as the dog ages which leads to the inclusion of [[vitamin E]] and [[L-carnitine]] in senior dog diets to combat this decline. Skin and coat health can also decline in older dogs due to various reasons.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; The inclusion of [[linoleic acid]] as well as [[vitamin A]] into senior dog diets helps to improve or maintain the skin and coat of senior dogs. Immune system health is important to maintain in older dogs to prevent the development of various diseases. By including omega-3 and [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids, vitamin E, [[Beta-Carotene|β-carotene]] as well as [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|pre]]- and [[Probiotic|pro-biotics]], the immune system can be boosted and maintained to help improve overall health. &lt;nowiki/&gt;

== Energy demand ==
The maintenance energy requirement (MER), or the energy that is required to maintain normal activity, decreases significantly as a result of [[lean body mass]] loss in aging dogs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The MER can decrease by up to 25% as dogs age due to this loss.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cliniciansbrief.com/sites/default/files/attachments/Nutrition%20for%20Senior%20Dogs.pdf|title=Nutrition for senior dogs: New tricks for feeding old dogs|last=Churchill|first=Julia A.|date=2015|website=Clinician's Brief|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basal metabolic rate is maintained by lean mass energy expenditure, which accounts for 96% of the function of lean mass.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The [[metabolizable energy]], or the amount of available energy which is left after the losses in urine, feces and combustible gas is subtracted, can be found on the food bag or calculated using the modified Atwater equation:

ME (kcal/kg) = 10[(3.5 x Crude Protein) + (8.5 x Crude Fiber) + (3.5 x Nitrogen Free Extract)]

This equation takes into consideration the amount of energy availability from [[crude protein]], crude [[fiber]], and the nitrogen free extract from pet foods in order to calculate the amount of energy the animal is receiving from the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall J.A., Melendez L.D. and Jewell D.E.|first=|date=2013|title=Using gross energy improves metabolizable energy predictive equations for pet foods whereas undigested protein and fiber content predict stool quality|url=|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|pages=1–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to consider the metabolizable energy content of senior or mature pet foods using this equation, as energy requirements will vary with age.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+2244&amp;aid=2842|title=Metabolizable energy and caloric density|last=|first=|date=|website=Pet education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protein ==
{{Main|Protein (nutrient)}}
A dog's requirements for protein increases as a result of a reduced ability to synthesize proteins as it ages.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  As a result, it is extremely important to not restrict protein consumption to a senior dog as it can be as just as harmful as protein deficiency in young dogs.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; To ensure good health, it is important to provide dogs with the 22 amino acids which they require. Of these 22 amino acids, 12 can be synthesized. The rest must be provided by good sources of dietary protein in adequate quantities. Good sources of protein include eggs and fish, which have a high biological value. This value describes the percentage of usable amino acids within the protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://happydogfood.com/blogs/news/dietary-protein-for-dogs-and-cats-the-importance-of-digestible-proteins|title=Dietary protein for dogs and cats - the importance of digestible proteins|last=|first=|date=November 8, 2016|website=Happy Dog Food|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been recommended that a minimum of 2.55 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight should be fed daily to ensure that protein requirements are met.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; It is important to understand that protein requirements based on weight are variable and that many factors influence the protein requirements of each senior dog.

== Bone and joint health ==

Joint deterioration occurs as dogs age. As their joints become less lubricated there is increased friction between the [[bone]] and the [[cartilage]]. With this increased friction, the cartilage deteriorates and wears away. The reduction of this cushion in the joints causes bone-on-bone contact to occur, causing the animal great discomfort. This can cause various related issues such as altered gaits and changes in activity levels resulting in a greater possibility of obesity and other conditions related to mobility and activity levels.

There has been research done in human medicine that indicates the positive effect that a combination of chondroitin sulphate and glucosamine can have on moderate-to-severe knee pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clegg|first=Daniel O.|last2=Reda|first2=Domenic J.|last3=Harris|first3=Crystal L.|last4=Klein|first4=Marguerite A.|last5=O'Dell|first5=James R.|last6=Hooper|first6=Michele M.|last7=Bradley|first7=John D.|last8=Bingham|first8=Clifton O. III|last9=Weisman|first9=Michael H.|date=2006-02-23|title=Glucosamine, Chondroitin Sulfate, and the Two in Combination for Painful Knee Osteoarthritis|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=354|issue=8|pages=795–808|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052771|issn=0028-4793|pmid=16495392|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/7zw280cw}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is likely very similar to the effect these two ingredients have on the joints of aging dogs. It is important to note the effects of these supplements is not instant and the aforementioned studies showed approximately a 3-month period between the beginning of supplementation and the reduction of symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/treatments/natural/supplements-herbs/glucosamine-chondroitin-osteoarthritis.php|title=Glucosamine and Chrondroitin for Arthritis|website=www.arthritis.org|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glucosamine ===
{{Main|Glucosamine}}
Glucosamine is a building block for the synthesis of cartilage tissue.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-articles/understanding-dog-food/what-is-chicken-meal-in-dog-food|title=What is Chicken Meal in Dog Food? - Purina® {{!}} Purina|website=www.purina.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found naturally in the body, mainly in the [[Synovial fluid|fluid which surrounds the joints]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can help aging joints by maintaining the cartilage, thus reducing the pain caused by bone-on-bone contact within the joint (this is the primary source of joint pain in aging animals). This will increase the mobility of the dog which is vital for the maintenance of a healthy weight and general body function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vet-organics.com/blogs/news/pet-joint-care-part-two|title=What You Need To Know About Pet Joint Care: Part Two|work=Vet Organics|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been some studies which have showed [[anti-inflammatory]] properties of glucosamine which would also help joint function in aging dogs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Glucosamine is usually provided in supplements in the form of glucosamine sulfate, or by the inclusion of chicken meal in the diet, as it contains glucosamine as well as chondroitin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nutro.ca/en/natural-dog-food/nutro/dry/large-breed-senior-chicken-whole-brown-rice-oatmeal-recipe.aspx|title=NUTRO™ WHOLESOME ESSENTIALS™  Large Breed Senior Farm-Raised Chicken, Brown Rice &amp; Sweet Potato Recipe|last=Nutro|website=www.nutro.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Chondroitin ===
{{Main|Chondroitin sulfate}}
Chondroitin is a major component in the composition of [[cartilage]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It helps the cartilage retain moisture, lubricating the joint and allowing ease of movement of the bone across the cartilage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This reduces the damage to the cartilage over time. Chondroitin is produced naturally in the body but older dogs can often benefit from a supplemental dose of chondroitin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Chondroitin is commonly supplied as a supplement in the form of [[chondroitin sulfate]].

=== Omega-3 fatty acids ===

=== Calcium and phosphorus ===
{{Main|Calcium in biology}}	
{{Main|Phosphorus#Biological role}}
One of the most basic requirements of the aging dog’s body is the requirement for maintenance of their bones. In order for the bones to be able to heal from any injury or erosion, as well as maintain their strength to avoid these problem, they need a ready supply of calcium and phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/calcium-supplements|title=Calcium Supplements|website=vca_corporate|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are essential nutrients according to AAFCO guidelines, and should be included in a senior dog diet.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aafco.org/|title=The Association of American Feed Control Officials &gt; Home|website=www.aafco.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calcium]] and [[Phosphorus]] are also very valuable in the maintenance tooth health of dogs.

==== Flax seed ====
{{Main|Flax#Nutrition}}
Flax seed is the whole seed of the flax plant which contains both soluble and insoluble fiber.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skaervet.com/documents/Common%20Pet%20Food%20Ingredients.pdf|title=Common Pet Food Ingredients|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insoluble fraction includes [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]], and [[lignin]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These components have a very good water binding capacity which aids in adding bulk into the diet of the dog.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This has varying benefits for dogs depending on their lifestyle.

===  Fructooligosaccharides and mannanoligosaccharides ===
{{Main|Fructooligosaccharide}}
{{Main|Mannan oligosaccharide-based nutritional supplements}}
[[Fructooligosaccharide]]s, commonly known as FOS, consist of many different types of indigestible [[oligosaccharide]]s.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanson, K.S., Grieshop, C.M., Flickinger, E.A., Bauer, L.L., Healy, HP., Dawson K.A., Merchen N.R. and Fahey G.G.

Constipation prevention and treatment can be carried out by the supplementation of FOS by its subsequent effect on gut bacteria.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; MOS works in a different manner by effecting the attachment of bad bacteria in the gut of the dog.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These bad bacteria attach to the [[epithelial lining]] of the gastrointestinal tract and can cause the beginnings of [[pathogenic disease]]s.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; MOS works to counteract these by preventing the binding of these deleterious bacteria.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

A study carried out in dogs determined that these two compounds when supplemented together can help with overall immune function.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This is due to the decrease in overall bad bacteria and an increase in good bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. These two compounds also were not found to have any detrimental effects on food consumption, stool quality or stool output.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Brain and cognitive health ==
A dogs brain undergoes many pathological changes during the aging process. Some of these changes can include damage to the [[DNA]] (deoxyribonucleic acid), a decrease in the amount of [[myelin]] overlay on nerve cells as well as a buildup of [[protein]] in the brain which can potentially have toxic effects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Due to these physiological changes senior and aging dog can have possible impairment of proper cognition.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roudebush|first=Philip|last2=Zicker|first2=Steven C.|last3=Cotman|first3=Carl W.|last4=Milgram|first4=Norton W.|last5=Muggenburg|first5=Bruce A.|last6=Head|first6=Elizabeth|date=2005-09-01|title=Nutritional management of brain aging in dogs|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=227|issue=5|pages=722–728|doi=10.2460/javma.2005.227.722|issn=0003-1488}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impairment can include complex learning tasks as well as memory issues.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Vitamin E ===
{{Main|Vitamin E}}
The addition of Vitamin E as an [[antioxidant]] in senior dog food can have a positive effect on brain and cognitive health. Vitamin E is a [[Fat-soluble vitamin|fat soluble vitamin]] which works to prevent [[oxidative damage]] from occurring.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; [[Reactive oxygen species]] can develop in the brain and can have a harmful effect by causing oxidative stress on the tissues if they are not subdued by antioxidants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxidative Stress and Free Radical Damage in Neurology|last=Gadoth and Gobel|first=Nathan and Hans|publisher=Humana Press|year=2011|isbn=9781603275149|location=Totowa, New Jersey|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitochondrial aerobic metabolism is thought to be the largest source of reactive oxidative species.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] age their function declines which causes an increase in the production of oxidative species.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Studies carried out in aging dogs looking at the effects of antioxidant supplemented diets have shown that older dogs supplemented with antioxidants including Vitamin E were able to correctly perform tasks more often than senior dogs whose diets were not supplemented.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It has also been shown that in senior dogs consuming these antioxidant enriched diets there was an increase in positive behavioural actions during the feeding period compared to senior dogs consuming diets that were not supplemented.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== L-carnitine ===
{{Main|Carnitine}}
L-carnitine is an [[amino acid]] and precursor of [[Acetylcarnitine|acetyl-L-carnitine]] which is a mitochondrial cofactor.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It acts to help with overall mitochondrial function as well as [[lipid metabolism]] which is an important function of mitochondria.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This is important as an increase in mitochondrial function will help to reduce the rates of oxidative reactions in the brain which overall decrease damage to DNA  and stimulates better cognitive function.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Skin and coat health ==
Several physiological changes in the senior pet can lead to a decline in skin and coat health.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bellows|first=Jan|last2=Colitz|first2=Carmen M.

Skin and coat health are important to upkeep as dogs age and there are many components in senior dog foods that can benefit this important area of health.

[[File:Soybean Oil, Meal and Beans (10059732523).jpg|thumb|alt= soybean oil, meal and beans.|Soybean oil is a good source of linoleic acid.]]

=== Linoleic acid ===
{{Main|Linoleic acid}}
Linoleic acid is a [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]] that is classified as an [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega 6-fatty acid]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Straus M.|first=|date=November 2012|title=Plant oils: do you know which plant oils may help your dog, and which ones could cause problems?|url=http://go.galegroup.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/ps/i.do?&amp;id=GALE%7CA308130839&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=guel77241&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1|journal=Whole Dog Journal|volume=15|pages=16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linoleic acid plays an important role in the maintenance of the water barrier of skin.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This helps prevent the dryness and scaly skin that occurs during the aging process.

=== Copper ===
{{Main|Copper}}Loss of hair pigmentation is a common concern for senior dogs.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; Copper has been shown to improve coat conditions by reducing dry skin and improving the overall pigmentation of the coat.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewari, D.; Singh, V.K.; Gautam, S.; Dwivedi, V.|first=|date=December 2013|title=Nutritional dermatosis - a review|url=|journal=Intas Polivet|volume=14|pages=199–202|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, copper may able to delay the natural aging process of the whitening of a dog's coat.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

===&amp;nbsp;Riboflavin ===
{{Main|Riboflavin}}
Senior dogs require a larger amount of riboflavin for maintenance compared to adult dogs. Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, plays an important role as a cofactor for the [[Carbohydrate metabolism|metabolism of carbohydrates]]. Riboflavin is required in the diet to prevent cracking and dry skin, as well as a darkening of the pigmentation of skin.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spies|first=Tom D.|date=1943|title=The Natural Occurrence of Riboflavin Deficiency in the Eyes of Dogs|jstor=1671149|journal=Science|volume=98|issue=2547|pages=369–370|doi=10.2307/1671149|doi-broken-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riboflavin is also important for the vision of the senior dog as deficiencies can cause alterations in blood supply to the [[cornea]] which may lead to impaired vision and potential blindness.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; A source of riboflavin in senior dog diets is important to help prevent changes that aging can cause on skin.

== Immune system health ==
[[Immune system|Immune functions]] start to decline due to compromised ability to efficiently produce various [[protein]]s and cells that are important for the body's defense system as dogs age. [[Free radicals]] can cause [[oxidative stress]], killing the cells or impairing the functional capability of the cells, which leads to weakening of the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puertollano|first1=Maria A.|last2=Puertollano|first2=Elena|last3=Alvarez de Cienfuegos|first3=Gerardo|last4=de Pablo|first4=Manuel A.|title=Dietary Antioxidants: Immunity and Host Defense|journal=Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry|date=1 July 2011|volume=11|issue=14|pages=1752–1766|doi=10.2174/156802611796235107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, providing dietary [[antioxidants]] can be an effective method to prevent the oxidative stress and support the immune system.

=== Ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids ===
{{Main|Omega-3 fatty acid#Omega−6 to omega−3 ratio}}
[[Omega-6]] and [[omega-3]] fatty acids are very important for a strong healthy immune system and for preventing [[chronic disease]] in dogs. It is crucial in pet diets that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is properly balanced in order to achieve optimal health.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=R.

'''Spermatorrhea''' is a condition of excessive, involuntary [[ejaculation]]. It is a recognized disorder in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], in which certain patterns of involuntary ejaculation reflect problems with [[Kidney (Chinese medicine)|kidney]] [[qi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acuxo.com/library.asp?firstResponse=Spermatorrhea&amp;condition=Seminal%20Emission]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findhealer.com/library/article19.php3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612164614/http://www.findhealer.com/library/article19.php3 |date=June 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ayurvedic Medicine]], [[Ashwagandha]] and [[Country Mallow|Bala]] are used to treat this vata ailment. Indian TKDL also has medicinal prescription using the herb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ayurveda-tcm.com/ayurvedic-chinese-medicine-distance-learning/doku.php?id=bala |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707202235/http://ayurveda-tcm.com/ayurvedic-chinese-medicine-distance-learning/doku.php?id=bala |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th and 19th centuries, if a patient had [[ejaculation]]s outside of marital intercourse, or released more semen than is typical, then he was diagnosed with a disease called ''spermatorrhea'' or "seminal weakness".Indian Ayurveda has a cure for this disease which can be Developed with the help of cannabis infused medicines. A variety of drugs and other treatments, including [[circumcision]] and [[castration]], were advised as treatment.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moscucci |first1=Ornella |editor1-first=Andrew H. |editor1-last=Miller |others=James Eli Adams |title=Sexualities in Victorian Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRsgkuRwNRgC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22Male+masturbation+and+the+offending+prepuce%22+Moscucci#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=April 7, 2011 |year=1996 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |isbn=0-253-33066-1 |pages=63–64 |chapter=Male masturbation and the offending prepuce}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Acton (doctor)|William Acton]].

According to modern Western medicine, ejaculation is a normal process, and some even see it as a normal part of daily life, and incapable of causing ill effects, other than temporary tiredness and reduction of sexual desire in the individual concerned. In contrast, Traditional Chinese Medicine counts the production of [[semen]] as one of the biggest strains on [[Jing (TCM)|jing]] (kidney essence).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7776">The '''Rockefeller Foundation Economic Council on Planetary Health''' at the Oxford Martin School was established on 1 June 2017 to further define the new discipline of [[planetary health]]. Its mandate is to explore the economic link between human health and the earth’s natural systems on which health depends. By the end of 2019, it must recommend actionable public policy on this link.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetaryhealth.ox.ac.uk/about/|title=About the Rockefeller Foundation Economic Council on Planetary Health at the Oxford Martin School|last=|first=|date=October 12, 2017|website=The Rockelller Foundation-Martin Oxford School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council, made up of world leaders from government, international organizations, civil society, business, finance and academia, will meet several times throughout the 18 months of its mandate to develop specific recommendations and a decision-making framework that balances economic development with ecosystem protection, while promoting human health and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetaryhealth.ox.ac.uk/about/|title=Rockefeller Foundation Economic Council on Planetary Health at the Oxford Martin School|last=Zedillo|first=Ernesto|date=October 12, 2017|website=Rockefller Foundation-Martin Oxford School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council is hosted at the [[Oxford Martin School]] at the [[University of Oxford]].

== Background ==
The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] is a private foundation, with a stated mission of "promoting the well-being of humanity throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/our-work/|title=Our Work|last=|first=|date=October 12, 2017|website=The Rockefeller Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford Martin School]] is a research and policy unit based in the Social Sciences Division of the University of Oxford. Together, they have joined forces to build the new and emerging field of [[planetary health]]. Planetary health examines "the relationship between human health and the natural systems on which it depends."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 2015|title=Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of The Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission on planetary health|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60901-1/fulltext|journal=The Lancet|volume=386|pages=1973–2028|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific case for a planetary health approach was established in a July 2015 report in [[The Lancet]], “[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60901-1/fulltext Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch],” wherein the Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on planetary health detailed the ways in which the degradation of natural systems harms the health of individuals, families and communities around the world. The report made several recommendations for how to do this, including having integrated social, economic and environmental policies, and better governance.

The role of the Economic Council on Planetary Health will be to provide advice and recommendations for how to reach these goals. The Council will meet several times a year to explore the economic link between human health and environmental change; increase existing scientific planetary health evidence by providing leaders and policy-makers with economic data for protecting human health through the preservation of the earth’s natural systems; and recommend the necessary economic policy reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetaryhealth.ox.ac.uk/planetary-health/|title=The Rockefeller Foundation Economic Council on Planetary Health|last=|first=|date=October 12, 2017|website=Rockefeller Foundation-Oxford Martin School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2019, the Council is expected to produce a report that will recommend actionable public policy for governments and institutions on advancing planetary health.

The Rockefeller Foundation will provide $15 million toward establishing the pillars of a new planetary health discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/planetary-health-a-new-discipline-in-global-health/|title=Planetary Health: A New Discipline in Global Health|last=Rodin|first=Judith|date=October 16, 2017|website=The Rockefeller Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations are also contributing to the emerging field, including the [https://planetaryhealthalliance.org/ Planetary Health Alliance] (PHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/planetary-health-alliance-launched-to-address-public-health-threats/|title=Harvard University, Wildlife Conservation Society launch new ‘Planetary Health Alliance’ with support from The Rockefeller Foundation|last=|first=|date=December 11, 2015|website=Harvard School of Public Health|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Vaginismus''' is a condition in which involuntary [[muscle spams]] prevents [[vaginal penetration]].&lt;ref name=Fer2016&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferri |first1=Fred F. |title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2017 E-Book: 5 Books in 1 |date=2016 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=9780323448383 |page=1330 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1330 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often results in [[pain with sex|pain with attempts at sex]].&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; Often it begins when [[sexual intercourse]] is first attempted.&lt;ref name=Mer2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The underlying cause is generally a fear that penetration will hurt.&lt;ref name=Mer2013/&gt; Risk factors include a history of [[sexual assault]], [[endometriosis]], [[vaginitis]], or a prior [[episiotomy]].&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and [[pelvic examination|examination]].&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; It requires there to be no [[anatomical]] or physical problems and a desire for penetration on the part of the women.&lt;ref name=Mer2013&gt;{{cite web |title=Vaginismus |url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/sexual-dysfunction-in-women/vaginismus |website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition |accessdate=15 October 2018 |date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Braddom |first1=Randall L. |title=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation E-Book |date=2010 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=1437735630 |page=665 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dxd4Kcy1StYC&amp;pg=PA665 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Severity as well as the pain during penetration varies between women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Reissing | first =Elke | authorlink = |author2=Yitzchak Binik |author3=Samir Khalife  | title =Does Vaginismus Exist?

==Causes==

===Primary vaginismus===
A woman is said to have primary vaginismus  when she is unable to have penetrative sex or experience vaginal penetration without pain. It is commonly discovered in teenage girls and women in their early twenties, as this is when many girls and young women first attempt to use [[tampon]]s, have penetrative sex, or undergo a [[Pap test|Pap smear]]. Women with vaginismus may be unaware of the condition until they attempt vaginal penetration. A woman may be unaware of the reasons for their condition.&lt;ref name=Pacik09/&gt;

A few of the main factors that may contribute to primary vaginismus include:

* a condition called [[vulvar vestibulitis]] syndrome, more or less synonymous with focal [[vaginitis]], a so-called [[sub-clinical]] inflammation, in which no pain is perceived until some form of penetration is attempted
* [[urinary tract infection]]s
* vaginal [[Candidiasis|yeast infections]]
* [[sexual abuse]], [[rape]], other [[sexual assault]], or attempted sexual abuse or assault
* knowledge of (or witnessing) sexual or physical abuse of others, without being personally abused
* [[domestic violence]] or similar conflict in the early home environment
* fear of pain associated with penetration, particularly the popular misconception of "breaking" the [[hymen]] upon the first attempt at penetration, or the idea that vaginal penetration will inevitably hurt the first time it occurs
* chronic pain conditions and [[Harm avoidance|harm-avoidance]] behaviour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borg |first1=Charmaine |last2=Peters |first2=L. M. |last3=Weijmar Schultz |first3=W. |last4=de Jong |first4=P. J. |title=Vaginismus: Heightened Harm Avoidance and Pain Catastrophizing Cognitions |journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=558–567 |date=February 2012 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02535.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* any physically invasive trauma (not necessarily involving or even near the genitals)
* generalized anxiety
* stress
* negative emotional reaction towards sexual stimulation, e.g. disgust both at a deliberate level and also at a more implicit level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borg|first=Charmaine|author2=Peter J. De Jong |author3=Willibrord Weijmar Schultz |title=Vaginismus and Dyspareunia: Automatic vs. Deliberate: Disgust Responsivity|journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine|date=June 2010|volume=7|issue=6|pages=2149–2157|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01800.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* strict conservative moral education, which also can elicit negative emotions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borg|first=Charmaine|author2=Peter J. de Jong |author3=Willibrord Weijmar Schultz |title=Vaginismus and Dyspareunia: Relationship with General and Sex-Related Moral Standards|journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine|date=Jan 2011|volume=8|issue=1|pages=223–231|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02080.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary vaginismus is often [[idiopathic]].&lt;ref name=Health.am&gt;{{cite web | title =Vaginismus | work =Sexual Pain Disorders and Vaginismus | url=http://www.health.am/sex/more/sexual_pain_disorders_vaginismus/ | year = 2006 | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaginismus has been classified by Lamont&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lamont | first1 = JA | title = Vaginismus | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 131 | issue = 6 | pages = 633–6 | year = 1978 | pmid = 686049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the severity of the condition. Lamont describes four degrees of vaginismus: In first degree vaginismus, the patient has spasm of the pelvic floor that can be relieved with reassurance. In second degree, the spasm is present but maintained throughout the pelvis even with reassurance. In third degree, the patient elevates the buttocks to avoid being examined. In fourth degree vaginismus (also known as grade 4 vaginismus), the most severe form of vaginismus, the patient elevates the buttocks, retreats and tightly closes the thighs to avoid examination. Pacik expanded the Lamont classification to include a fifth degree in which the patient experiences a visceral reaction such as sweating, hyperventilation, palpitations, trembling, shaking, nausea, vomiting, losing consciousness, wanting to jump off the table, or attacking the doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pacik, PT. |author2=Cole, JB. |title=When Sex Seems Impossible. Stories of Vaginismus and How You Can Achieve Intimacy |publisher=Odyne Publishing |year=2010 |pages=40–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lamont classification continues to be used to the present and allows for a common language among researchers and therapists.

Although the [[pubococcygeus muscle]] is commonly thought to be the primary muscle involved in vaginismus, Pacik identified two additionally-involved spastic muscles in treated patients under sedation. These include the entry muscle ([[bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbocavernosum]]) and the mid-vaginal muscle ([[puborectalis muscle|puborectalis]]). Spasm of the entry muscle accounts for the common complaint that patients often report when trying to have intercourse: "It's like hitting a brick wall".&lt;ref name=Pacik09&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pacik PT |title=Botox treatment for vaginismus |journal=Plast. Reconstr. Surg. |volume=124 |issue=6 |pages=455e–6e |date=December 2009 |pmid=19952618 |doi=10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181bf7f11 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&amp;volume=124&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=455e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secondary vaginismus ===
Secondary vaginismus occurs when a person who has previously been able to achieve penetration develops vaginismus. This may be due to physical causes such as a [[yeast infection]] or trauma during [[childbirth]], while in some cases it may be due to psychological causes, or to a combination of causes. The treatment for secondary vaginismus is the same as for primary vaginismus, although, in these cases, previous experience with successful penetration can assist in a more rapid resolution of the condition. Peri-menopausal and menopausal vaginismus, often due to a drying of the vulvar and vaginal tissues as a result of reduced estrogen, may occur as a result of "micro-tears" first causing sexual pain then leading to vaginismus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pacik|first=Peter|title=When Sex Seems Impossible. Stories of Vaginismus &amp; How You Can Achieve Intimacy|year=2010|publisher=Odyne|location=Manchester, NH|isbn=978-0-9830134-0-2|pages=8–16|url=http://www.vaginismusmd.com/book/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further factors that may contribute to either secondary or primary vaginismus include:
* Fear of losing control
* Not trusting one’s partner
* Self-consciousness about body image
* History of sexual abuse, rape, sexual assault, or attempted sexual abuse or assault
* Misconceptions about sex or unattainable standards for sex from exaggerated sexual materials, such as pornography or abstinence 
* Fear of vagina not being wide or deep enough / fear of partner’s penis being too large
* Undiscovered or denied sexuality

==Mechanism==
Which muscles are involved is unclear but may include the [[pubococcygeus muscle]], [[levator ani]], [[Bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbocavernosus]], circumvaginal, and perivaginal muscles.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lahaie|first=MA|author2=Boyer, SC |author3=Amsel, R |author4=Khalifé, S |author5= Binik, YM |title=Vaginismus: a review of the literature on the classification/diagnosis, etiology and treatment.|journal=Women's health (London, England)|date=Sep 2010|volume=6|issue=5|pages=705–19|pmid=20887170|doi=10.2217/whe.10.46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==

A [[Cochrane review]] found little high quality evidence regarding the treatment of vaginismus in 2012.&lt;ref name=Mel2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melnik|first1=T|last2=Hawton|first2=K|last3=McGuire|first3=H|title=Interventions for vaginismus.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=12 December 2012|volume=12|pages=CD001760|pmid=23235583|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001760.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically it is unclear if [[systematic desensitisation]] is better than other measures including nothing.&lt;ref name=Mel2012/&gt;

===Psychological===
According to Ward and Ogden's qualitative study on the experience of vaginismus (1994), the three most common contributing factors to vaginismus are fear of painful sex; the belief that sex is wrong or shameful (often the case with patients who had a strict religious upbringing); and traumatic early childhood experiences (not necessarily sexual in nature).

People with vaginismus are twice as likely to have a history of childhood sexual interference and held less positive attitudes about their sexuality, whereas no correlation was noted for lack of sexual knowledge or (non-sexual) physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reissing ED, Binik YM, Khalifé S, Cohen D, Amsel R |title=Etiological correlates of vaginismus: sexual and physical abuse, sexual knowledge, sexual self-schema, and relationship adjustment |journal=J Sex Marital Ther |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=47–59 |year=2003 |pmid=12519667 |doi=10.1080/713847095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical===
[[File:Dilatorsfortreatingvaginismus.jpg|thumb|Dilators for treating vaginismus]]
Often, when faced with a person experiencing painful intercourse, a gynecologist will recommend [[Kegel exercises]] and provide some additional lubricants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sogc.org/publications/when-sex-hurts-vaginismus/|title= When sex hurts – vaginismus|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= n.d.|publisher= The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada|accessdate= |deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131020055743/http://sogc.org/publications/when-sex-hurts-vaginismus/|archivedate= 2013-10-20|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthline.com/health/vaginismus?toptoctest=expand |title=Vaginismus |last=Herndon | first= Jaime |date=November 30, 2015|website=Healthline |publisher= George Kruick, MD. |accessdate=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/vaginismus-causes-symptoms-treatments |title= Women’s Health: Vaginismus |last= Nazario | first= Brunilda, MD.  |date= 2012 |website=WebMD|publisher= |accessdate=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Womens_Health_Watch/2012/May/when-sex-gives-more-pain-than-pleasure |title= When sex gives more pain than pleasure.|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= May 2012 |website=Harvard Health Publications |publisher= Harvard Health |accessdate= December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strengthening the muscles that unconsciously tighten during vaginismus may be extremely counter-intuitive for some people. Although vaginismus has not been shown to affect a person's ability to produce lubrication, providing additional lubricant can be helpful in achieving successful penetration. This is due to the fact that women may not produce natural lubrication if anxious or in pain. Treatment of vaginismus may involve the use [[Hegar dilators]], (sometimes called vaginal trainers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Vaginismus/Pages/Treatment.aspx|title=NHS Choices Vaginal Trainers to treat vaginismus|last=nhs|first=nhs|date=2015|website=NHS Choices Vaginismus treatment|publisher=NHS}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  progressively increasing the size of the dilator inserted into the vagina.&lt;ref name="Doleys2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Doleys|first=Daniel|title=Behavioral Medicine|accessdate=|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|language=English |isbn=9781468440706|page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuromodulators===
[[Botulinum toxin|Botulinum toxin A (Botox)]] has been considered as a treatment option, under the idea of temporarily reducing the hypertonicity of the pelvic floor muscles. Although no random controlled trials have been done with this treatment, experimental studies with small samples have shown it to be effective, with sustained positive results through 10 months.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pacik, PT. Vaginismus: A Review of Current Concepts and Treatment using Botox Injections, Bupivacaine Injections and Progressive Dilation Under Anesthesia. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Journal, {{DOI|10.1007/s00266-011-9737-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar in its mechanism of treatment, [[lidocaine]] has also been tried as an experimental option.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melnick"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melnik|first=T|author2=Hawton, K |author3=McGuire, H |title=Interventions for vaginismus.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Dec 12, 2012|volume=12|pages=CD001760|pmid=23235583|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001760.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anxiolytic]]s and [[antidepressant]]s are other pharmacotherapies that have been offered to people in conjunction with other psychotherapy modalities, or if these patients experience high levels of anxiety from their condition.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt; Results from these medications have not been consistent.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
True epidemiological studies of vaginismus have not been done, as diagnosis would require painful examinations that such women would most likely avoid. Data available is primarily reported statistics from clinical settings.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt;

A study of vaginismus in people in [[Morocco]] and [[Sweden]] found a prevalence of 6%. 18-20% of people in British and Australian studies were found to have manifest [[dyspareunia]], while the rate among elderly British people was as low as 2%.&lt;ref name=ex&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lewis RW, Fugl-Meyer KS, Bosch R, etal |title=Epidemiology/risk factors of sexual dysfunction |journal=J Sex Med |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=35–9 |date=July 2004 |pmid=16422981 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2004.10106.x |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2004.10106.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1990 study of people presenting to sex therapy clinics found reported vaginismus rates of between 12% and 17%, while a random sampling and structured interview survey conducted in 1994 by National Health and Sexual Life Survey documented 10%-15% of people reported that in the past six months they had experienced pain during intercourse.&lt;ref name="Health.am"/&gt;

The most recent study-based estimates of vaginismus incidence range from 5% to 47% of people presenting for sex therapy or complaining of sexual problems, with significant differences across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;see Reissing et al. 1999; Nusbaum 2000; Oktay 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It seems likely that a society's expectations of person's sexuality may particularly impact on the people with the condition.&lt;ref name=van&gt;{{cite web | title =Critical literature Review on Vaginismus| work =Critical literature Review on Vaginismus | url=http://www.vaginismus-awareness-network.org/lit_review.html | publisher=Vaginismus Awareness Network | accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water birth''' is [[childbirth]] that occurs in water. Proponents believe water birth results in a more relaxed, less painful experience that promotes a [[Midwifery|midwife]]-led model of care.&lt;ref name="Cochrane2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cluett|first1=E.

==Benefits==

A moderate to weak level of evidence indicates that water immersion during the first stage of childbirth reduces the pain of labor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A [[Cochrane Library|2018 Cochrane Review]] found that immersion during the first stage of [[childbirth]] reduces the use of [[epidural]]s, however there is no clear evidence on the benefits of water immersion for the second stage of labor or full water birth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is no evidence of increased [[adverse effect]]s for immersion during the first or second stages of labor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is not strong evidence that a water birth reduces tearing or perineal trauma.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Water birth may offer perineal support for a birthing mother, and some theorize that this may decrease the risk of tearing and reduce the use of [[episiotomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Garland | first = D | title = Waterbirth: An Attitude to Care | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 0750652020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 review reported that it has been found that water immersion during the first stage of labor can reduce the length of the first stage, reduce labor pain, and the use of epidural/spinal analgesia. It is also associated with a lower rate of [[cesarean delivery]] and [[stress urinary incontinence]]  symptoms 42 days after delivery.  The review reported that immersion during labor did not appear to increase the rate of infections for the mother or the baby, and [[APGAR]] scores for the baby were similar to that of conventional births.

==Risks and concerns==

The British [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] and the [[Royal College of Midwives]] issued a joint statement supporting water birth for healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies but does not recommend it in cases of complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Royal College of Midwives]]/[[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] | year = 2006 | url = http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/JointStatmentBirthInWater2006.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090413130622/http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/JointStatmentBirthInWater2006.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2009-04-13 | format = pdf | title = Immersion in water during labour and birth | accessdate = 2012-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 commentary, the Committee on Fetus and Newborn of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) released an analysis of the scientific literature regarding underwater births. The Committee noted several positive studies for underwater birth but went on to criticize them for lacking proper [[scientific control]]s, a significant number of infant deaths and diseases, and the general lack of information to support the use of water births. The paper concluded:&lt;ref name = AAP&gt;{{Cite journal | author1 = &lt;!-- comment to keep out Citation Bot --&gt;| last = Committee On Fetus Newborn | last2 = Blackmon | first2 = D. G. | last3 = Adamkin | first3 = L. R. | last4 = Bell | first4 = D. H. | last5 = Denson | first5 = E. F. | last6 = Engle | first6 = S. E. | last7 = Martin | first7 = W.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The safety and efficacy of underwater birth for the newborn has not been established. There is no convincing evidence of benefit to the neonate but some concern for serious harm. Therefore, underwater birth should be considered an experimental procedure that should not be performed except within the context of an appropriately designed RCT after informed parental consent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The AAP received numerous letters in response to the statement, many claiming passionately that water birth had strong benefits and minimal risks for both parents and children and criticizing the AAP for failing to publish positive studies about the practice. In response, an author of the statement noted that the claims made were unsubstantiated and based purely on [[anecdotal evidence]], with no [[randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs) that would allow an evidence-based assessment of the safety and benefits of water births. The author concluded by urging for proponents to support such a trial so that the question could be answered. The editor of the journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'', where the commentary was published, noted that no such trials had ever been submitted to the journal, which had a policy against publishing articles that are not based on scientific evidence. The reply concluded that "I have not received any science-based commentaries from the groups that you cite in your letter. We cannot publish every letter, based on opinions only, that we receive."&lt;ref name = AAPResponse&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hess | first1 = S. | title = Strong Opinions Versus Science in Water-Birth Controversy | doi = 10.1542/peds.2005-1334 | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 116 | issue = 2 | pages = 522–523; author 523 523 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16061620 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth pool==
A birth pool is a specially designed vessel containing water for women to immerse themselves in for pain relief during labour.  Birth pools work on the same principle as a bathtub, but are distinct from them&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harper, R.N.|first1=Barbara|title=Gentle Birth Choices|date=2005|publisher=Inner Traditions|isbn=1-59477-067-0|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to buoyancy and freedom of movement, factors deemed to be important in labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tips on encouraging a straightforward birth during labour|url=http://www.nct.org.uk/birth/encouraging-straightforward-birth-what-do-labour|publisher=National Childbirth Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; A birth pool can either be permanently installed or portable. Getting into a pool of water for labour is often called ''water birth'' because some women choose to remain in the water for birth as well.

Health policy in England stipulates women should be given the opportunity to labour in water through the publication of Intrapartum care guidelines issued in 2007 by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)]].  The [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] and the [[Royal College of Midwives]] have jointly supported labour and birthing in water, and encourage hospitals to ensure birth pools are available to all women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joint Statement on Birth In Water|url=https://www.rcm.org.uk/sites/default/files/rcog_rcm_birth_in_water.pdf|agency=Joint Statement by RCM and RCOG|publisher=Royal College of Midwives RCM|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immersing in water in a birth pool is one of the methods available to manage pain during labour, in addition to [[TENS|TENS machine]], [[Gas and air]], [[Pethidine]] injection, [[deep breathing]], [[massage]] and [[epidural]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leap|first1=Nicky|last2=Dodwell|first2=Miranda|last3=Newburn|first3=Mary|title=Working with pain in labour|journal=New Digest|date=January 2010|volume=49|url=http://www.nct.org.uk/system/files/related_documents/Research%20overview-%20Working%20with%20pain%20in%20labour_6.pdf.|publisher=National Childbirth Trust NCT}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characteristics ===
Before birth pools became readily available there are many stories of women labouring and birthing in re-purposed tub-like products including animal watering troughs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Choosing Waterbirth|last = Bertram|first = Lakshmi|publisher = Hampton Roads Publishing Company, Inc|year = 2000|isbn = 1-57174-152-6|location = USA|pages = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinary bathtubs found in American and British homes are not adequate to provide enough room for women to comfortably move and try different positions in labour, such as squatting or kneeling, and are not deep enough to create [[buoyancy]].  In order to create the feeling of weightlessness through buoyancy the water needs to almost cover the women's breasts while she is sitting and should cover her belly while she is squatting, leaning over the side of the pool or kneeling upright in the pool sitting back on her heels.

The original circular birth pool [[Michel Odent|Dr Michel Odent]] used at Pithiviers hospital (France) in the early 1980s was two meters in diameter and .6 meters deep, large enough to accommodate two people and make it difficult for interference during the birthing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gentle Birth Choices|last = Harper|first = Barbara|publisher = Inner Traditions|year = 2005|isbn = 1-59477-067-0|location = USA|pages = 175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern birth pools are somewhat smaller with a diameter between 110-150 centimeters and at least twenty, preferably twenty-two, inches of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Waterbirth Handbook|last = Lichy|first = Dr. Roger|publisher = Gateway Books|year = 1993|isbn = 0-946551-70-7|location = UK|pages = 63, 132|last2 = Herzberg|first2 = Eileen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors to consider when choosing a birth pool are:
* Size – is it appropriate for you and the place you will give birth
* Fill time and process – how long will it take and what type of hose/spout is required
* Safety – how will you safely get in and out

=== Types available in the UK===
Birth pools are generally categorised between two broad types: permanently installed or portable.  Many hospitals in the United Kingdom now have a birth pool plumbed in, and portable birth pools can be purchased or hired for use at home or in hospital.

*Permanently Installed Birth Pools:  The [[National Health Service (NHS)]] purchases birth pools for hospital birth centres, delivery suites and community midwife teams throughout the country.
*Portable Birth Pools:  More often used for home births, portable birth pools can also be used within hospitals when a permanently installed birth pool is not available.

'''''Welfare, Choice and Solidarity in Transition: reforming the health sector in Eastern Europe''''' was written by [[János Kornai]] and [http://fsi.stanford.edu/people/kareneggleston/ Karen Eggleston], published in 2001.

This book focused on ten post-socialist Eastern European countries, including [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia]].

In 2007, (according to the definition of the [[World Bank]]) in these ten countries, Albania is a [[lower-middle-income economy]]; the Czech Republic and Slovenia are [[high-income economies]]; and others belong to [[upper-middle-income economies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20421402~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html Country Groups (The World Bank)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11414">'''Women who have sex with women''' ('''WSW''') are [[Woman|women]] who engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] with other women, whether or not they identify themselves as [[lesbian]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]], or dispense with [[Sexual identity|sexual identification]] altogether.&lt;ref name="Gorgos2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gorgos|first=L. M.|author2=J. M. Marrazzo |year=2011|title=Sexually Transmitted Infections Among Women Who Have Sex With Women|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=53|issue=suppl 3|pages=S84–S91|issn=1058-4838|doi=10.1093/cid/cir697|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/suppl_3/S84.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''WSW'' is often used in medical literature to describe such women as a group for clinical study, without needing to consider sexual self-identity.

==Physical==
In terms of medical issues with regard to [[lesbian sexual practices]], the sexual identification of women who consult a medical professional is usually not sought nor volunteered, due to the misconceptions and assumptions about sexuality and the hesitancy of some women in disclosing their accurate sexual histories even to a physician.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Many women who do not participate in heterosexual activity do not go to see a physician because they do not require [[birth control]], which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a [[gynecologist]] when they become sexually active.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, these women are not screened regularly with [[pap smear]]s because they have a lower perceived risk of acquiring a [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]] or types of cancer. A factor which leads to lesbians neglecting to seek medical screening in the United States is a lack of health insurance offered by employers for same-sex domestic partners.&lt;ref name="HHS"&gt;"[http://womenshealth.gov/faq/lesbian-health.cfm Frequently Asked Questions: Lesbian Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129175054/http://www.womenshealth.gov/faq/lesbian-health.cfm |date=2009-01-29 }}", womenshealth.gov. [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]. Retrieved January 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

When women do seek medical attention, medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked their sexual orientation by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual.&lt;ref name="mravack"&gt;Mravack, Sally A. (July 2006)."Primary Care for Lesbians and Bisexual Women", ''American Family Physician'' '''74''' (2), pp. 279–286.&lt;/ref&gt;

A patient's complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had sexual contact with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.&lt;ref name="mravack"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Another summary of overall surveys found that women who identify as lesbian, 80-95% had previous sexual contact with men, and some report sexual behavior that is risky. (King, p. 221.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heart disease]] is listed by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] as the number one cause of death for all women. Factors that add to risk of heart disease include [[obesity]] and [[smoking]], both of which are more prevalent in lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher [[body mass]] and are generally less concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women, although they are more likely to engage in exercise regularly.&lt;ref name="HHS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mravack"/&gt;

Lack of differentiation between lesbians and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence of [[breast cancer]] in lesbians.&lt;ref name="mravack"/&gt; It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular pap smears makes it more difficult to detect [[cervical cancer]] at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing [[ovarian cancer]] rates are higher in lesbians than in heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.&lt;ref&gt;Vo, Christine, Carney, Michael (December 2007). "Ovarian Cancer Hormonal and Environmental Risk Effect", ''Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics''34 (4) p. 687–700.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental==
Since medical literature began to describe homosexuality, it has often been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[substance abuse]], and [[suicide]]. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Schlager, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Women who identify as lesbian report feeling significantly different and isolated during adolescence;&lt;ref name="schlager153"&gt;Schlager, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; these emotions have been cited as appearing on average at 15 years old in lesbians and 18 years old in women who identify as bisexual.&lt;ref name="rust2"&gt;Rust, Paula, (March, 1993). "Coming out" in the Age of Social Constructionism: Sexual Identity Formation among Lesbian and Bisexual Women", ''Gender and Society'', '''7''' (1), p. 50-77.&lt;/ref&gt; On the whole, women tend to work through developing a self-concept internally, or with other women with whom they are intimate. Women (heterosexual or otherwise) also limit who they divulge their sexual identities to and more often see being lesbian as a choice, as opposed to gay men, who work more externally and see being gay as outside their control.&lt;ref name="schlager153"/&gt;

[[Anxiety disorder]]s and [[depression (mood)|depression]] are the most common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women.&lt;ref&gt;Solarz, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or experience relationship difficulties with no support system.&lt;ref&gt;Schlager, pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt; More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had [[Suicidal ideation|suicidal thoughts]], and 18% had attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Solarz, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

A population-based study completed by the National Alcohol Research Center found that women who identify as lesbian or bisexual are less likely to abstain from alcohol. Lesbians and bisexual women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol, as well as not being satisfied with treatment for substance abuse programs.&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, Laurie, Trocki, Karen (2005). "Alcohol Consumption, Alcohol-Related Problems, and Other Substance Use Among Lesbian and Bisexual Women", ''Journal of Lesbian Studies'', '''9''' (3), p. 19–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.&lt;ref&gt;Solarz, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexually transmitted infections==
Some STIs are communicable between women, including [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[trichomoniasis]], [[syphilis]], [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), [[bacterial vaginosis]] (BV), and [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV). Transmission of specific sexually transmitted diseases among women who have sex with women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Special Populations - 2010 STD Treatment Guidelines |publisher=CDC| url =  https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/specialpops.htm | accessdate = 2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oral sex|Oral-genital contact]] may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV,&lt;ref&gt;Frenkl, Tara Lee, Potts, Jeannette (February 2008). "Sexually Transmitted Infections", ''Urologic Clinics of North America'', '''35''' (1) p. 33–46.&lt;/ref&gt; even among women who have had no prior sex with men.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial vaginosis occurs more often in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is transmitted by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women. BV often occurs in both partners in a lesbian relationship;&lt;ref&gt;Risser, Jan M.H., Risser, William L., Risser, Amanda (December 2008). "Epidemiology of Infections in Women", ''Infectious Disease Clinics of North America'', '''22''' (4), pp. 581–599.&lt;/ref&gt; a recent study of women with BV found that 81% had partners with BV.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of HIV transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions; the highest rate of transmission of HIV to women is among those who have sexual intercourse with men or participate in intravenous drug use.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, 360.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/basic.htm HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report: Cases of HIV Infection and AIDS in the United States and Dependent Areas, 2006.] Centers for Disease Control.
