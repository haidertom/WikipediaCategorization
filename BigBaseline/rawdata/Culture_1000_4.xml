'''''Amafufunyana''''' is an unspecified [[Culture-bound syndrome|"culture-bound" syndrome]] named by the traditional healers of the [[Xhosa people]] that relates to claims of [[demonic possession]] due to members of the Xhosa people exhibiting [[aberrant behavior]] and psychological concerns.&lt;ref name="PP"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Niehaus DJ, Oosthuizen P, Lochner C, Emsley RA, Jordaan E, Mbanga NI, Keyter N, Laurent C, Deleuze JF, Stein DJ |date=March–April 2004 |title=A culture-bound syndrome 'amafufunyana' and a culture-specific event 'ukuthwasa': differentiated by a family history of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders |journal=[[Psychopathology (journal)|Psychopathology]] |publisher=[[Karger Publishers]] |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=59–63 |doi=10.1159/000077579 |pmid=15057028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After study, it was discovered that this term is directed toward people suffering from varying types of [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="PP"/&gt; A similar term, [[ukuthwasa]], is used to refer to positive types of claimed possession, though this event also involves those suffering from schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="CRC"/&gt; It has also found cultural usage among some groups of [[Zulu people]]s.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Fresh Perspectives: Introduction to Psychology |chapter=Psychopathology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-btwxJAR_gC&amp;dq |publisher=[[Pearson South Africa]] |page=368 |date=2007 |isbn=9781868912896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct translation of the term ''amafufunyana'' is [[Anxiety|nerves]] and is a part of a much more complex cultural ideology connecting varying types of [[psychosis]] with religious, social, and recently psychiatric beliefs and activities. In a 1998 interview with Xhosa people suffering from schizophrenia by Lund et al., it was determined that through interaction with scientists and psychological services, the preferred treatment for the cultural condition had shifted from relation to traditional healers to active [[psychiatric assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lund C, Swartz L |date=June 1998 |title=Xhosa-Speaking Schizophrenic Patients' Experience of Their Condition: Psychosis and Amafufunyana |url=http://sap.sagepub.com/content/28/2/62.abstract |journal=[[South African Journal of Psychology]] |publisher=[[Psychological Society of South Africa]] |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=62–70 |doi=10.1177/008124639802800202 |accessdate=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claimed symptoms and causes==
People who claim to be suffering from ''amafufunyana'' state that their symptoms include hearing "voices from their stomachs", speaking in another language or in a disturbing tone, and general agitation and possible violence. There is also the possibility of suicide being attempted.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;

One of the cultural beliefs for the cause is bewitchment from drinking a [[magic potion]] brewed from ants that have been feeding upon a buried dead body.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt; General possession by [[malignant]] spirits is also believed. Among the Zulu specifically, there is also the belief that a "horde of spirits" from multiple ethnic groups come together to take over a person's body.&lt;ref name="CRC"&gt;{{cite book |last=Helman |first=Cecil G. |date=January 26, 2007 |title=Culture, Health and Illness, Fifth edition |chapter=Cross-Cultural Psychiatry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uz59BgAAQBAJ&amp;dq |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |page=269 |isbn=9781444113631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common cultural treatment for the claimed ailment is for one of the traditional healers, often ''ukuthwasa'' themselves, to perform a ritual of [[exorcism]].&lt;ref name="CRC"/&gt;
==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=November 2017}}

==History==
Recorded incidents of ''amafufunyana'' appear to have begun in the early 20th century and researchers such as Ngubane ''et al'' have suggested that its cultural formation may have had something to do with [[colonialism]] and [[Human migration|migration]] of [[indigenous peoples]] away from their homes. There have also been widespread outbreaks of the condition, similar to events involving contagious spread of [[hysteria]], recorded in the 1980s at a rural girl's [[boarding school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinason |first=Valerie |date=2002 |title=Attachment, Trauma and Multiplicity: Working with Dissociative Identity Disorder |chapter=Dissociation and Spirit Possession |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJ8XtDSajhAC&amp;dq |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |pages=233–236 |isbn=9780415195560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common types of people that are identified as afflicted by the cultural group are those of the lowest economic and social level and more often during times of cultural hardship and change, such as during migrations. More women than men are also identified.&lt;ref name="CRC"/&gt;

[[File:Boomerang (PSF).jpg|thumb|A [[boomerang]] returns to where it was sent from]]
'''Boomerang Generation''' is a term applied in [[Western culture]] to young adults graduating high school and college in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Reed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/the_p_word/newsid_8057000/8057167.stm |title='Boomerang' generation back home |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Jayson [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-13-analysis-boomerang_N.htm Analysis: 'Boomerang' generation mostly hype] USA Today 3/14/2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MICHELLE HIRSCH,[http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Issues/Life-and-Money/2010/06/12/The-Boomerang-Generation-More-Reasons-to-Move-Back-Home.aspx The Boomerang Generation: More Reasons to Move Back Home] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204080345/http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Issues/Life-and-Money/2010/06/12/The-Boomerang-Generation-More-Reasons-to-Move-Back-Home.aspx |date=December 4, 2010 }} June 12, 2010  The Fiscal Times&lt;/ref&gt; They are so named for the percentage of whom choose to share a home with their parents after previously living on their own—thus [[boomerang]]ing back to their parents' residence. This arrangement can take many forms, ranging from situations that mirror the high dependency of pre-adulthood to highly independent, separate-household arrangements.

The term can be used to indicate only those members of this age-set that actually do return home, not the whole generation. In as much as home-leaving practices differ by [[economic class]], the term is most meaningfully applied to members of the [[middle class]].

==Introduction==
{{Disputed section|date=June 2009}}
The parental expectation of having an "[[Empty nest syndrome|empty nest]]", traditional in the United States and some other industrialized cultures, has increasingly given way in the 1990s and 2000s to the reality of a "cluttered nest" or "crowded nest". The latter term was popularized by Kathleen Shaputis's 2004 book ''The Crowded Nest Syndrome: Surviving the Return of Adult Children'',&lt;ref name="Shaputis"&gt;Shaputis, Kathleen. ''The Crowded Nest Syndrome: Surviving the Return of Adult Children''. Clutter Fairy Publishing, 2004. Print. {{ISBN|978-0-9726727-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which takes a critical view of the trend.

[[The University of Western Ontario|University of Western Ontario]] professor Roderic Beaujot discusses the phenomenon of delayed home-leaving at length. He cites [[Statistics Canada|Canadian census statistics]] showing that, in 1981, 27.5% of Canadians aged 20–29 lived with their parents; in 2001, the figure had grown to 41%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vifamily.ca/library/cft/delayed_life.html Delayed Life Transitions: Trends and Implications] accessed on June 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States the proportion of adults ages 20 to 34 living with their parents has increased from 9% in 1960 to almost 17% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Fields J. and L.M. Casper, ''America's families and living arrangements'', 2000, US Census Bureau, Current Population Reports, as cited in Nijole Benokratis, ''Marriages and Families'', 6th edition, Pearson, 2008, p.371&lt;/ref&gt; However, US [[Census bureau|census]] data also suggest that the rate at which adult children have been living with parents has been steady since 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/hh-fam.html Families and Living Arrangements, table AD-1] accessed on June 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Census Bureau reported a 5 percent point increase in the number of young men (ages 24–34) living with their parents for the period between 2005 (14%) and 2011 (19%). For the same period, the number of young women living with their parents increased from 8% in 2005 to 10% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2011/11/boomerang_generation_us_census.html Boomerang generation: U.S. Census shows more young adults moving in with parents]&lt;/ref&gt;

The coming of age of this generation coincide with the economic downturn starting with the collapse of the [[stock market bubble]] in 2000. This led to rising [[unemployment]] until 2004, the same time this generation was entering the workforce after high school or college graduation.  Additionally, in the [[new economy]], where [[globalisation]]-induced phenomena like [[outsourcing]] have eliminated many jobs,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/economy/jan-june04/jobs_3-11.html Jobs moving overseas] accessed on January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/04/10.21.04/outsourcing_jobs.html U.S. underestimates jobs lost to outsourcing, labor experts assert] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916141619/http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/04/10.21.04/outsourcing_jobs.html |date=September 16, 2006 }} from Cornell News accessed on January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washtimes.com/world/20060611-100706-2930r.htm Job outsourcing 'serious problem'] from the Washington Times accessed on January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Oct04/Bronf.outsourcing.rpt.lm.html Bureau of Labor Statistics grossly underestimates U.S. jobs lost to outsourcing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909204208/http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Oct04/Bronf.outsourcing.rpt.lm.html |date=September 9, 2006 }} from Cornell News accessed on January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[real wages]] have fallen over the last twenty years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milkeninstitute.org/publications/publications.taf?function=detail&amp;ID=273&amp;cat=Arts Amid Plenty, the Wage Gap Widens] from the Milken Institute accessed on January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/04/business/04charts.html?ei=5090&amp;en=7286ff0309ded7bd&amp;ex=1296709200&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print When It Comes to Pay, It Helps to Be the One Signing the Checks] from the New York Times accessed on January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/rn/1997-98/98rn48.htm  Is Youth Worse Off Than Two Decades Ago?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910064759/http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/rn/1997-98/98rn48.htm |date=September 10, 2006 }} from the Parliament of Australia accessed on January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and a college degree no longer ensures job stability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=119869 Is Job Stability in the US Falling?

Moving back home allows them the option of unpaid [[internship]]s and additional schooling without the burden of paying rent at market rates (or paying rent at all).

An increase in divorce rates as well as a delay in initial marriage are other contributing factors in young adults returning to reside with their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harvardjlg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Goldfarb.BoomerangGeneration.pdf|title=Who Pays for the Boomerang Generation?|last=Goldfarb|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This generation differs from previous ones in that many members expect to remain with their parents for some years while maintaining their own social and professional lives. Home-leaving remains a priority for most in the Boomerang Generation, though financial burden (and the comforts of financial stability in their parents'  homes) often delays the fruition of that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/07/29/boomerang-millennials-get-cozy-at-home/|title=‘Boomerang’ Millennials Get Cozy at Home|last=Sussman|first=Anna Louie|date=2015-07-29|website=WSJ|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trend==
The phenomenon of boomeranging/delayed home-leaving has generated considerable inquiry and debate, including academic studies at reputable universities; full-length books, such as ''The Hands-On Guide to Surviving Adult Children Living at Home'' by Christina Newberry;&lt;ref name="Newberry"&gt;Newberry, Christina. ''The Hands-On Guide to Surviving Adult Children Living at Home''. Nuru Guides, 2012. Print. {{ISBN|978-0981390055}}&lt;/ref&gt; articles in national newspapers; documentaries, such as ''Generation Boomerang'';&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|3572052|Generation Boomerang (2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and major motion pictures, such as ''[[Failure to Launch]]'' (2006) starring [[Matthew McConaughey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McConaughey|first=Matthew|title=Failure to Launch|date=2006-03-10|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427229/plotsummary|last2=Parker|last3=Deschanel|last4=Bartha|first2=Sarah Jessica|first3=Zooey|first4=Justin|accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===

Economic instability is the primary justification for this phenomenon, as articulated in Kimberly Palmer's 2007 ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' article "The New Parent Trap: More Boomers Help Adult Kids out Financially".&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Kimberly. "[https://www.usnews.com/articles/business/your-money/2007/12/12/the-new-parent-trap.html?PageNr=1 The New Parent Trap: More Boomers Help Adult Kids out Financially]." ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', Dec. 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the term Boomeranger has been used to draw reference to those Gen-Xers and Gen-Yers of the Boomerang Generation who have either returned to an earlier, more modest lifestyle or have simply moved back home with parents and other loved ones, in response to the [[Great Recession]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Where the young person and his/her parents can tolerate the arrangement, it provides tremendous financial relief to the young person. Such co-residence can be a valuable form of insurance, particularly for youths from poorer families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp677.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Moving Back Home: Insurance Against Labor Market Risk'', March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; It may also provide non-negligible income to the parents, though in many cultures, the boomeranger retains all or nearly all of their disposable income for [[disposable and discretionary income|discretionary income]] purchases.

Though inter-generational cohabitation is ''[[terra incognita]]'' for many in modern industrialized Western societies and therefore challenging, those who attempt it can benefit from the experience.  The arrangement tends to force all involved to communicate and negotiate in ways they did not when the children were pre-adults.  In the best case, this can lead to healthy adult relationships between parents and children.

This can benefit parents when they reach old age.  In societies where it is common for children to live with their parents into adulthood, such as Asian and Hispanic cultures, children more frequently take care of aging parents rather than devolving the responsibility on a third party, such as a nursing home. Whether the Boomerang Generation will follow suit remains to be seen, as the older [[Baby Boom]] generation ages. And let's not forget that the recession has affected the Baby Boomers as well, perhaps even more so than their children, as many lost significant investments and savings intended for retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/articles/2011/10/31/the-recessions-impact-on-baby-boomer-retirement|title=The Recession's Impact on Baby Boomer Retirement|last=Brandon|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102144155/http://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/articles/2011/10/31/the-recessions-impact-on-baby-boomer-retirement|archive-date=2011-11-02|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, we can only hope the cohabitation of parents and their adult children can be mutually beneficial in terms of easing the financial burden. While the boomerangers may live rent free, it is common for them to take on other financial responsibilities in return, such as groceries or utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2012/03/PewSocialTrends-2012-BoomerangGeneration.pdf|title=The Boomerang Generation Feeling OK about Living with Mom and Dad|last=Parker|first=Kim|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, 20% of adults in their 20s and early 30s were residing with their parents, which is twice the amount of the previous generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/magazine/its-official-the-boomerang-kids-wont-leave.html|title=It’s Official: The Boomerang Kids Won’t Leave|last=Davidson|first=Adam|date=2014-06-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-28|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are many reasons cited for the need for parental support, one of the greatest contributing factors is said to be student loan debt. 45% of 25-year-old college graduates currently owe $20,000 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/12/business/some-parents-shouldering-student-loans-fall-on-tough-times.html|title=Some Parents, Shouldering Student Loans, Fall on Tough Times|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|date=2012-11-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-28|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some families, the financial instability of the mid 2000s caused a decrease in funds allocated for higher education, therefore decreasing parental financial contributions and causing the need for more loans to cover educational costs. And while student loans are more frequently taken out in the student’s name, some parents who took out loans are facing substantial debt and are now relying on their adult children to provide financial assistance while they pay them off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/should-parents-use-retirement-savings-for-college-tuition-1488559632|title=Should Parents Use Retirement Savings for College Tuition?|last=Schoenberger|first=Chana R.|date=2017-03-03|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-03-28|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition===

Critics of the practice of boomeranging, such as Shaputis,&lt;ref name="Shaputis"/&gt; worry about the negative effect this trend has on the financial and social independence of the children.

Those who return home from the unrestrictive nature of college dorm life may have difficulty readjusting to their parents' domestic expectations.  Where living space is shared, gatherings with friends can be limited in frequency or scope.  Dating is similarly constrained and can be impaired by the stigma of the young adult's perceived inability to function independently of his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/home-stretch-what-happens-when-twentysomethings-move-back-in-with-their-parents-7658253.html|title=Home stretch: What happens when twentysomethings move back in with|date=2012-04-22|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28684">'''Celebratory gunfire''' (also called '''aerial firing''' or '''happy fire''') is the shooting of a [[firearm]] into the air in celebration.  It is culturally accepted in parts of the [[Balkans]], the [[Middle East]], the Central Asian region of [[Afghanistan]], and the South Asian region of [[Pakistan]].  In regions such as [[Puerto Rico]] and continental areas of the [[United States]] it is practiced illegally, especially on holidays like New Year's Eve.&lt;ref name="dawn"/&gt;

Common occasions for celebratory gunfire include [[New Year's Day]] as well as religious holidays such as [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]].&lt;ref name=SETimes/&gt; The practice may result in random death and injury from [[stray bullet]]s. Property damage is sometimes another result of celebratory gunfire; shattered windows and damaged roofs are often found after such celebrations.&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt;

==Falling-bullet injuries==
[[Image:Telop-mkd.jpg|thumb|right|"Bullets are not greeting cards. Celebrate without firearms." From the IANSA Macedonian poster campaign, December 2005]]
Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with [[terminal velocity|terminal velocities]] much lower than their [[muzzle velocity]] when they leave the barrel of a firearm.  Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground.  Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its [[Trajectory of a projectile|angular ballistic trajectory]] and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in [[free fall]].

A study by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found that 80% of celebratory gunfire-related injuries are to the head, feet, and shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5350a2.htm |title=New Year's Eve Injuries Caused by Celebratory Gunfire --- Puerto Rico, 2003 |accessdate=2007-07-31 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Puerto Rico]], about two people die and about 25 more are injured each year from celebratory gunfire on New Year's Eve, the CDC says.&lt;ref name=Abdul-Alim/&gt; Between the years 1985 and 1992, doctors at the [[King/Drew Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], treated some 118 people for random falling-bullet injuries. Thirty-eight of them died.&lt;ref name=Incorvaia2007&gt;{{cite journal

Firearms expert [[Julian Hatcher]] studied falling bullets in the 1920s and calculated that .30 [[caliber]] rounds reach terminal velocities of &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;90&amp;nbsp;m/s&amp;nbsp;(300&amp;nbsp;feet per second or 186&amp;nbsp;miles per hour)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hatcher, Julian Sommerville|title=Hatcher's Notebook |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA |year= 1962|isbn=0-8117-0795-4|page= 514 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A bullet traveling at only &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;61&amp;nbsp;m/s&amp;nbsp;(200&amp;nbsp;feet per second)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;100&amp;nbsp;m/s&amp;nbsp;(330&amp;nbsp;feet per second)&lt;/span&gt; can penetrate human skin.&lt;ref name="isbn1-58890-308-7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stewart, Michael J. |title=Head, Face and Neck Trauma: Comprehensive Management |publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers |location=New York |year= 2005|isbn=1-58890-308-7|page= 189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[International Action Network on Small Arms]] (IANSA) ran education campaigns on the dangers of celebratory gunfire in [[Serbia and Montenegro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In Serbia, the campaign slogan was "every bullet that is fired up, must come down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/12/C00FD2BC-CD6E-4774-A127-F38C1133CC4F.html |title=Serbs Told To Keep Guns Quiet On New Year's Eve – RADIO FREE EUROPE / RADIO LIBERTY |accessdate=2007-08-01 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property damage==
Bullets often lodge in [[roof]]s, causing minor damage that requires repair in most cases. Normally, the bullet will penetrate the roof surface through to the roof deck, leaving a hole where water may run into the building and cause a leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsboadvertisingservice.com/library1.htm#BULLETS |title=Professionals Topics Library : Roofs &amp; Bullets |accessdate=2007-08-02 |format= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817004232/http://www.fsboadvertisingservice.com/library1.htm#BULLETS |archivedate=2007-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The number of complaints regarding random shooting in [[Dallas, Texas]], on New Year's Eve declined from approximately 1,000 in 1999 to 800 each in 2001 and 2002.&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt;
*In early 2008, increased partisanship in [[Lebanon]] led to the practice of firing celebratory gunfire in support when politicians appeared on local television, leading to multiple deaths and to calls from these leaders to end the practice.&lt;ref name=Fallout/&gt;

==Notable incidents==
&lt;!-- Notable incidents should involve either multiple fatalities, tracing the bullet to the shooter, change in policy or procedure, or some other form of notability above and beyond a random injury. --&gt;

==Cultural references==
The non-fiction U.S. [[cable television]] program ''[[MythBusters]]'' on the [[Discovery Channel]] covered this topic in [[MythBusters (2006 season)#Episode 50 .E2.80.93 .22Bullets Fired Up.22|Episode 50: "Bullets Fired Up"]] (original airdate: April 19, 2006). [[Special-effects]] experts [[Adam Savage]] and [[Jamie Hyneman]] conducted a series of experiments to answer the question: "Can celebratory gunfire kill when the bullets fall back to earth?"

Using [[pig]] carcasses, they worked out the terminal velocity of a falling bullet and had a mixed result, answering the question with all three of the show's possible outcomes: Confirmed, Plausible and Busted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode_06.html |title=Discovery Channel :: Mythbusters: Episode Guide |accessdate=2007-07-31 |work=StarPhoenix |publisher=CanWest Interactive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823212625/http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode_06.html |archivedate=2007-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They tested falling bullets by firing them from both a [[handgun]] and a [[rifle]], by firing them from an [[air gun]] designed to propel them at terminal velocity, and by dropping them in the desert from an instrumented balloon.

They found that while bullets traveling on a perfectly vertical trajectory tumble on the way down, creating turbulence that reduces terminal velocity below that which would kill, it was very difficult to fire a bullet in a near-ideal vertical trajectory. In practice, bullets were likely to remain spin-stabilized on a ballistic trajectory and fall at a potentially lethal terminal velocity. They also verified cases of actual deaths from falling bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2006/04/episode_50_bullets_fired_up_vo_1.html |title=Annotated Mythbusters: Episode 50: Bullets Fired Up, Vodka Myths III |accessdate=2007-08-01 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7091">'''Chinese patriarchy''' refers to the history and prevalence of [[patriarchy|male dominance]] in Chinese society and culture, although patriarchy is not exclusive to Chinese culture and exists all over the world.

== Dynamics ==
[[Mencius]] outlined the three subordinations. A woman was to be subordinate to her [[father]] in youth, her husband in maturity, and her son in old age.&lt;ref name="Birdwhistell2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joanne D. Birdwhistell|title=Mencius and Masculinities: Dynamics of Power, Morality, and Maternal Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gaI7zFH1UT0C|accessdate=31 July 2013|year=2007|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8038-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Familial relationships are prefixed, and family lifestyles and behaviors are constrained by social norms. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=F.|date=2005|title=Residential patterns of parents and their married children in contemporary China: A life course approach|url=|journal=Population Research and Policy Review|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1007/s11113-004-6371-9|via=|doi-access=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another one of these famous quotes is also related to the patriarchy found in Athens. "Men are free to roam outside, but the woman must stay inside."

A cliché of classical texts, which is repeated throughout the tradition, is the familiar notion that men govern the outer world, while women govern the home.
In the [[Han dynasty]], the female historian [[Ban Zhao]] wrote the ''[[Lessons for Women]]'', advice on how women should behave. She outlines the four virtues women must abide by: proper virtue, proper speech, proper countenance, proper merit. The "three subordinations and the four virtues" is a common four-character phrase throughout the imperial period.

As for the historical development of Chinese [[patriarchy]], women's status was highest in the [[Tang dynasty]], when women played sports (polo) and were generally freer in fashion and conduct. Between the Tang and Song dynasties, a fad for little feet arose, and from the [[Song dynasty]] onwards foot binding became more and more common for the elite. In the Ming dynasty, a tradition of virtuous widowhood developed. Widows, even if widowed at a young age, would be expected not to remarry. Their virtuous names might be displayed on the arch at the entrance of the village.

[[Confucian]] conceptions of "respect for the elders" has been focused on preserving the traditional role of the father as the primary leader and decision maker of the family. In the hierarchy of traditional Chinese cultural family life, the father and sons take prominence over the mother and daughters.

== 20th century ==
Features of patriarchy in 20th and 21st century China are a combination of contemporary problems found even in the West and traditional Chinese issues.

Men hold most of the major positions of power within the country, especially in the political and military spheres. However, with the decline of traditional practices through the 20th century, women have come to enjoy virtually equal economic power. This is especially true in the cities, where the social stigma of being a working woman is virtually nonexistent, although skepticism of unmarried, career-minded women is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tatlow |first1=Didi Christian |last2=Forsythe |first2=Michael |date=20 February 2015 |title=In China’s Modern Economy, a Retro Push Against Women |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/world/asia/china-women-lag-in-work-force-especially-in-top-jobs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both genders face strong pressure to be [[marriage|married]], women who remain unmarried past the age of 25 are shamed by state media with the label [[sheng nu|leftover women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Magistad |first=Mary Kay |date=20 February 2013 |title=BBC News - China's 'leftover women', unmarried at 27 |work=[[BBC News]] |location=Beijing |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21320560 |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, foot binding and arranged marriages have been virtually eradicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schiavenza |first=Matt |date=16 September 2013 |title=The Peculiar History of Foot Binding in China |work=[[The Atlantic]] |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/09/the-peculiar-history-of-foot-binding-in-china/279718/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the issue of forced abortions in China, especially for [[sex-selective abortion|sex selection]] purposes; authorities have been accused of giving the women virtually no control over their bodies in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fong |first=Mei |date=5 January 2016 |title=One Child}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5450">'''Criminal tradition''' - of the cultural transmission of criminal values. Criminal traditions are transmitted from the older generation to the younger generation, such as social customs are in other forms of society.

Studies of the criminal tradition involved  Clifford R. Shaw and Henry D. McKay. They put forward a theory of “cultural transmission”, focuses on the development in some urban neighborhoods of a criminal tradition that persists from one generation to another despite constant changes in population. This theory stresses the value systems of different areas

Also worth noting theory of “differential association,” in which  Edwin H. Sutherland described the processes by which criminal values are taken over by the individual. Edwin H. Sutherland asserted that criminal behavior is learned and that it is learned in interaction with others who have already incorporated criminal values.&lt;ref&gt;Criminology Theory: Selected Classic Readings, by Frank P. Williams III, Marilyn D. McShane&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Shaw and McKay on the concept of cultural transmission indicates that a criminal tradition or subculture does exist in areas of  larger cities.  According to their studies Criminal tradition arises and is maintained in areas of instability, and the values, norms, and behaviors of the participants in the criminal tradition are viewed as normal by these people.&lt;ref&gt;Hepburn J. R. Subcultures, violence, and the subculture of violence: An old rut or a new road? //Criminology. – 1971. – Т. 9. – №. 1. – С. 87-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population categories subject to criminal traditions ==

Traditions are not personified, so adolescents and boys are easier to obey than direct instructions from specific individuals. This is the power of tradition. The norms of the life of groups in which the will of their members manifest themselves take the form of tradition most often. In the tradition that there is no personification, adolescents find it easier to obey them than to a particular person. Against this background, the criminal traditions that are prevalent in youth criminal groups, especially in closed educational and correctional institutions are especially dangerous. In a criminal environment, there are two kinds of traditions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravo.vuzlib.su/book_z686_page_12.html "Laws of the criminal world of youth (criminal subculture)" by Pirozhkov V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* They came to us from the criminal environment of the distant past and transformed into modern ones, taking into account the conditions of life of society and the relations dominating in it;
* New traditions that have arisen and established in a criminal environment in modern conditions and have no analogues in the past.

At the same time, there is a transformation of existing criminal traditions and the emergence of new ones. The reason for this is the changes in the social, economic, legal and other spheres.

== World criminal tradition ==

On the criminal tradition in different countries of the world, there is a huge amount of work. There is an impressive number of works on the Russian criminal tradition, written in different languages. 
We can also highlight works by Jonny Steinberg on [[The Numbers Gang|the numbers gangs]] of South Africa

== Alternative opinions ==

There is also the view that it is impossible to consider all the traditions of the criminal environment as antisocial and harmful, including, for the reason that some of the traditions in the cells of the remand center, contribute to hygiene and the maintenance of sanitary norms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravo.vuzlib.su/book_z686_page_12.html "Laws of the criminal world of youth (criminal subculture)" by Pirozhkov V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian criminal tradition == 

In Russian criminal tradition adherents of the criminal (criminal) tradition are characterized by active participation in the life of the "thieves' community"; Living on tangible assets obtained by criminal means; Propaganda of "thieves' customs and traditions, as well as criminal way of life; Compulsion to keep a word not only before the "brother", but also the criminal-criminal world; Organization of collection of "obschekovyh" funds and control over their use; Guardianship and assistance to detainees and convicts, the so-called "vagabonds" and "honest prisoners"; Compliance with the decisions of "gatherings"; Demanding of "brotherhood" and control over their compliance; Organization of counteraction to state bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rulit.me/books/cvetnaya-mast-elita-prestupnogo-mira-read-10956-1.html ВМЕСТО ПРЕДИСЛОВИЯ "ВОРЫ В ЗАКОНЕ" — ИСТОРИЯ ПРОБЛЕМЫ] RuLit&lt;/ref&gt;

Pictured is an interior display area of the [[National Gallery of Canada]].]]
'''Cultural policy''' is the government [[public policy|actions, laws and programs]] that regulate, protect, encourage and financially (or otherwise) support activities related to [[the arts]] and creative sectors, such as [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[literature]], and [[filmmaking]], among others and [[culture]], which may involve activities related to language, heritage and diversity. The idea of cultural policy was developed at UNESCO in the 1960s.  Generally, this involves governments setting in place processes, legal classifications, regulations, legislation and institutions (e.g., [[Art museum|galleries]], [[museum]]s, [[library|libraries]], [[opera house]]s, etc.) which promote and facilitate [[cultural diversity]] and creative expressions in a range of art forms and creative activities. Cultural policies vary from one country to another, but generally they aim to improve the [[accessibility]] of arts and creative activities to citizens and promote the [[artistic]], [[music]]al, [[ethnic]], [[sociolinguistic]], [[literary]] and other expressions of all people in a country. In some countries, especially since the 1970s, there is an emphasis on supporting the culture of [[indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] peoples and marginalized communities and ensuring that cultural industries (e.g., filmmaking or TV production) are representative of a country's diverse [[cultural heritage]] and ethnic and linguistic demographics. 

Cultural policy can be done at a nation-state level, at a sub-national  level (e.g., U.S. states or Canadian provinces), at a regional level or at a municipal level (e.g., a city government creating a museum or arts centre). Examples of cultural policy-making at the nation-state level could include anything from funding [[music education]] or theatre programs at little to no cost, to hosting corporate-sponsored art exhibitions in a government museum, to establishing legal codes (such as the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]]’s [[501(c)(3)]] tax designation for [[not-for-profit]] enterprises) and creating political institutions (such as the various [[minister of culture|ministries of culture]] and departments of culture and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in the United States), arts granting councils, and cultural institutions such as galleries and museums. Similar significant organisations in the United Kingdom include the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), and Arts Council England.

Throughout much of the twentieth century, many of the activities that compose cultural policy in the 2010s were governed under the title of "[[arts policy]]". Arts policy includes direct funding to artists, creators and art institutions and indirect funding to artists and arts institutions through the tax system (e.g., by making donations to arts charities tax deductible). However, as [[Kevin V. Mulcahy|Kevin Mulcahy]] has observed, "cultural policy encompasses a much broader array of activities than were addressed under arts policy. Whereas arts policy was effectively limited to addressing aesthetic concerns (e.g., funding art galleries and opera houses), the significance of the transformation to cultural policy can be observed in its demonstrable emphases on [[cultural identity]], [[valorization]] of [[Indigenous people|indigineity]] [Indigenous people's culture] and analyses of historical dynamics (such as [[hegemony]] and [[colonialism]])."&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 2006. "What is Cultural Policy?"&lt;/ref&gt; A general trend in Western industrialized nations is a shift, since the 1970s and 1980s, away from solely supporting a small number of relatively elite, professionalized art forms and institutions (e.g., [[Classical music]], painting, sculpture, art galleries) to also supporting amateur and community cultural and creative activities (e.g., [[community theatre]]) and cultural  forms which were not considered part of the [[Western canon]] by previous generations (e.g., [[traditional music]] such as [[blues]], [[World music]], and so on).

==History==
Prior to the twentieth century, the arts were typically supported by the patronage of the church, aristocrats such as kings and queens, and wealthy merchants. During the nineteenth century, artists increased their use of the private marketplace to earn revenue. For example, the composer [[Beethoven]] put on public concerts for which admission was charged. During the twentieth century, governments began to take over some of the arts patronage roles. Governments' first efforts to support culture were typically the establishment of archives, museums and libraries. Over the twentieth century, governments established a range of other institutions, such as arts councils and departments of culture. The first departments of culture typically supported the major arts that are part of the [[Western canon]], such as painting and sculpture, and the major performing arts (Classical music and theatre).
===Arts policy===
[[File:Choreographed Opera Performance (Carmen by Bizet).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Due to [[opera]] productions' huge stage sets, use of many costumed singers and the requirement for an [[Pit orchestra|orchestra]], opera is one of the most expensive arts to produce. As a result, most opera companies in the 21st century require government funding to operate.]]
In the twentieth century, Western governments in the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many European nations developed arts policy measures to promote, support and protect the arts, artists and arts institutions. These governments' arts policy initiatives generally had two aims: supporting excellence in the arts and broadening access to the arts by citizens. &lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. ''The Economics of Cultural Policy''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 59-63 &lt;/ref&gt; An example of an arts policy initiative that supports excellence would be a government grant program which provides funding to the highest-achieving artists in the country. A concrete example would be a literary prize of $100,000 for the best fiction authors from the country, as selected by a panel of top experts. An example of an arts policy initiative that aims at increasing access to the arts would be a music in the schools program funded by the government. A concrete example would be a program which funded an [[orchestra]] or [[jazz quartet]] and paid them to play free concerts in elementary schools. This would enable children from lower- and middle-income families to hear live music. 

The two goals, supporting excellence and broadening access, are often [[trade-off]]s, as any increase in emphasis on one policy objective typically has an adverse effect on the other goal.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. ''The Economics of Cultural Policy''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 59-63 &lt;/ref&gt; To give an example, if a hypothetical country has a $12 million per year grant program for [[orchestra]]s in the country, if the government focuses on the goal of supporting musical excellence, it may decide to provide $4 million per year to the three top orchestras in the country, as determined by a panel of independent professional [[music critic]]s, conductors and music professors. This decision would strongly support the goal of enhancing excellence, as funding would only go to the top musical groups. However, this approach would only enable citizens in three cities to have access to professional orchestras.

On the other hand, if the government was focusing on broadening access to symphony concerts, it might direct the independent panel to pick 12 orchestras in the country, with the stipulation that only one orchestra per city be selected. By proving $1 million per year to 12 orchestras in 12 cities, this would enable citizens from 12 cities in the country to see live orchestra shows. However, by funding 12 orchestras, this would mean that funding would go to ensembles that do not meet the highest standards of excellence. Thus, excellence and broadening access are often trade-offs.

==Theoretical approaches==
[[File:The Railway Museum 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A railway museum in Japan displays antique locomotives.]]
Cultural policy, while a small part of the budgets of even the most generous of governments, governs a sector of immense complexity.  It entails “a large, heterogeneous set of individuals and organizations engaged in the creation, production, presentation, distribution, and preservation of and education about aesthetic heritage, and entertainment activities, products and artifacts”.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 2002. “Arts and Culture.” in &lt;u&gt;The State of Nonprofit America&lt;/u&gt;. ed. Lester M. Salamon. Washington D.C.: Brookings University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A cultural policy necessarily encompasses a broad array of activities and typically involves public support for:
* Heritage, battlefield and historic preservation sites
* Zoos, botanical gardens, arboretums, aquariums, parks
* Libraries and museums (fine arts, scientific, historical)
* [[Visual arts]] (film, painting, sculpture, pottery, architecture)
* [[Performing arts]] (symphonic, chamber and choral music; jazz, hip-hop and folk music; ballet, ballroom and modern dance; opera and musical theatre; circus performances, rodeos and marching bands)&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida, Yukihiko,　''Jane Barlow and Witaly Osins, ballet teachers who worked in postwar Japan, and their students'', Pan-Asian Journal of Sports &amp; Physical Education, Vol.3(Sep), 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Public humanities]] programs ([[public broadcasting]], [[creative writing]], [[poetry]])

Some governments may place policy areas from this list in other ministries or departments. For example, national parks may be assigned to an environment department, or public humanities may be delegated to an education department.  

Since culture is a [[public good]] (i.e., contributes a public value to society for which it is hard to exclude non-payers, as all of society benefits from arts and culture) and something that is generally viewed as a [[merit good]], governments have pursued programs to promote greater accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;d'Angelo, Mario and Vesperini, Paul. 1999. Cultural Policies in Europe: Method and Practice of Evaluation, Council of Europe Publishing, Strasbourg&lt;/ref&gt; In this way of thinking, significant aesthetic works such as paintings and sculptures should be made broadly available to the public. In other words, “high culture” should not be the exclusive preserve of a particular social class or of a metropolitan location. Rather, the benefits of the highest reaches of cultural excellence should be made in an egalitarian manner; national cultural treasures should be accessible without regard to the impediments of class circumstances, educational attainment or place of habitation. A democratic state cannot be seen as simply indulging the aesthetic preferences of a few, however enlightened, or of overtly infusing art with political values. Consequently, a democratic cultural policy must articulate its purposes in ways that demonstrate how the public interest is being served. These purposes have often been expressed as involving either the creation of [[cultural democracy]] or the [[democratization of culture]].

The objective of cultural democratization is the aesthetic enlightenment, enhanced dignity, and educational development of the general citizenry. “Dissemination was the key concept with the aim of establishing equal opportunity for all citizens to participate in publicly organized and financed cultural activities”.&lt;ref&gt;Duelund, Peter. 2001. “Cultural Policy in Denmark.” ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 31: 34-57.&lt;/ref&gt; To further this goal, performances and exhibitions are low cost; public art education promotes equality of aesthetic opportunity; national institutions tour and perform in work places, retirement homes and housing complexes.

As indicated earlier, the “democratization of culture” is a top-down approach that promulgates certain forms of cultural programming that are deemed to be a public good. Clearly, such an objective is open to criticism for what is termed cultural [[elitism]]; that is, the assumption that some aesthetic expressions are inherently superior - at least as determined by a cognoscenti concerned with the acquisition of [[cultural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1984. &lt;u&gt;Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste&lt;/u&gt;. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; “The problem with this policy [is] that, fundamentally, it intend[s] to create larger audiences for performances whose content [is] based on the experience of society’s privileged groups. In sum, it has… taken for granted that the cultural needs of all society’s members [are] alike”.&lt;ref&gt;Langsted, Jorn, ed. 1990. &lt;u&gt;Strategies: Studies in Modern Cultural Policy&lt;/u&gt;. Aarhus University Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of cultural democracy, on the other hand, is to provide for a more participatory (or populist) approach in the definition and provision of cultural opportunities.

The coupling of the concept of democratization of culture to cultural democracy has a pragmatic as well as a philosophical component. [[Cultural patronage]] in democratic governments is markedly different from patronage by wealthy individuals or corporations. Private or politically paramount patrons are responsible only to themselves and are free to indulge in their tastes and preferences. Democratic governments, on the other hand, are responsible to the electorate and are held accountable for their policy decisions.

The two objectives just discussed - dissemination of high culture and participation in a broader range of cultural activities - evoke a related debate about the content of public culture: “[[elitist]]” or “[[populism|populist]].” 
===Elitism===
Proponents of the elitist position argue that cultural policy should emphasize aesthetic quality as the determining criterion for public subvention. This view is typically supported by the major cultural organizations, creative artists in the traditionally defined field of the fine arts, cultural critics, and the well-educated, well-to-do audiences for these art forms. [[Ronald Dworkin]] terms this the “lofty approach,” which “insists that art and culture must reach a certain degree of sophistication, richness, and excellence in order for human nature to flourish, and that the state must provide this excellence if the people will not or cannot provide it for themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Ronald. 1985. “Can a Liberal State Support Art?” in &lt;u&gt;A Matter of Principle&lt;/u&gt;. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 221-233.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the elitist position generally focus on supporting the creation, preservation and performance of works of the [[Western canon]], a group of artworks that are viewed as the best artistic and cultural products of Western society.

===Populism===
By contrast, the populist position advocates defining culture broadly and inclusively and making this culture broadly available.  The populist approach emphasizes a less traditional and more pluralist notion of artistic merit and consciously seeks to create a policy of cultural diversity. With a focus on personal enhancement, the populist’s position posits very limited boundaries between amateur and professional arts activities. Indeed, the goal is to provide opportunities for those outside the professional mainstream. To give an example, whereas an elite approach advocates support for professional musicians, particularly those from [[Classical music]], a populist approach would advocate support for amateur, community singers and musicians.

“Proponents of populism are frequently advocates of minority arts, [[folk arts]], ethnic arts, or [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] activities” as Kevin V. Mulcahy said.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 1982. “Controversies in Arts Policymaking.” in &lt;u&gt;Public Policy and the Arts&lt;/u&gt;. eds. Kevin V. Mulcahy and C. Richard Swaim. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural “elitists,” on the other hand, argue in support of excellence over amateurism and favor an emphasis on aesthetic discipline over “culture as everything.” There are “two key tensions for national cultural policy between the goals of excellence versus access, and between government roles as facilitator versus architect”.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, Jennifer; McAllister, Libby; and Davis, Glyn. 2003. “Paradoxes and Contradictions in Government Approaches to Contemporary Cultural Policy: An Australian Perspective.” ''The International Journal of Cultural Policy''. 9: 17-34.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Kevin V. Mulcahy argued that in effect, elitism is cultural democracy as populism is to the democratization of culture. Unfortunately, there has been a tendency to see these positions as mutually exclusive, rather than complementary. “Elitists” are denounced as “high brow snobs” advocating an esoteric culture which focuses on [[art music]] and the types of art seen in museums and galleries; populists are dismissed as “pandering philistines” promoting a trivialized and commercialized culture, as they endorse the value of [[popular music]] and [[folk art]]. However, these mutual stereotypes belie complementariness between two bookends of an artistically autonomous and politically accountable cultural policy. There is a synthesis that can be termed a “latitudinarian approach” to public culture; that is, one that is aesthetically inclusive and broadly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin V. Mulcahy|Mulcahy, Kevin V.]] 1995b. “The NEA and the Reauthorization Process: Congress and Arts Policy Issues.” in Mulcahy and Wyszomirski, &lt;u&gt;America’s Commitment to Culture&lt;/u&gt;. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 1995c. “The Public Interest and Arts Policy.” in Mulcahy and Wyszomirski, &lt;u&gt;America’s Commitment to Culture&lt;/u&gt;. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewpoints==
Such a public-cultural policy would remain faithful to the highest standards of excellence from a broad range of aesthetic expressions while providing the widest possible access to people from different geographic locales, socio-economic strata, and educational background, as Dr. Mulcahy said.&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 1991. “The Public Interest in Public Culture.” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 21: 5-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In conceiving of public policy as an opportunity to provide alternatives not readily available in the marketplace, public cultural agencies would be better positioned to complement the efforts of the private sector rather than duplicate their activities.  Similarly, cultural agencies can promote [[community development]] by supporting artistic heritages that are at a competitive disadvantage in a cultural world that is increasingly profit-driven. In sum, excellence should be viewed as the achievements of greatness from a horizontal, rather than a vertical, perspective and a cultural policy as supporting the totality of these varieties of excellence.

These attitudes about a public cultural responsibility stand in marked contrast to much of the rest of the world, where culture is a question of historic patrimony, or the national identities of peoples, whether in independent states or regions within more powerful states. Inevitably, sensitive issues are involved in any discussion of culture as a public policy. However, given the demands in a democratic system that public policies show a return to the taxpayer, cultural policy has frequently argued for support on the basis of utility. It can be argued that there is a parity between the state’s responsibility for its citi’ social-economic-physical needs and their access to culture and opportunities for artistic self-expression. However, the aesthetic dimension of public policy has never been widely perceived as intuitively obvious or politically imperative. Accordingly, the cultural sector has often argued its case from the secondary, ancillary benefits that result from public support for programs that are seemingly only aesthetic in nature. Cultural policy is not typically justified solely on the grounds that it is a good-in-itself, but rather that it yields other good results.

The future of cultural policy would seem to predict an increasingly inexorable demand that the arts “carry their own weight” rather than rely on a public subsidy to pursue “art for art’s sake”.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 1995a. “Federal Cultural Support: Toward a New Paradigm?” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society''. 25: 69-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin V. Mulcahy dubbed this “cultural [[Darwinism]]” is most pronounced in the United States where public subsidy is limited and publicly supported aesthetic activities are expected to demonstrate a direct public benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 2003. “The State Arts Agency: An Overview of Cultural Federalism in the United States.” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 32: 67-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-American cultural institutions are less constrained by the need to maintain diversified revenue streams that demand high levels of earned income and individual and corporate donations to compensate for limited government appropriations.

On the other hand, cultural institutions everywhere are increasingly market-driven in their need for supplementary funds and as a justification for continued public support. The American model of an essentially [[privatization|privatized]] culture is increasingly attractive to governments seeking to curtail their cultural subsidies. In a system of [[mixed funding]], public culture can nurture the arts groups and cultural activities that contribute to individual self-worth and community definition even if counting for less in the economic bottom-line. At root, a cultural policy is about creating public spheres that are not dependent upon [[profit motive]]s nor validated by commercial values. As political democracy is dependent upon the existence of civil society and socio-economic pluralism, cultural policy stands as an essential public commitment in realizing these fundamental preconditions.

One of the available and yet underappreciated tools in cultural policy at the national level is the reduction of VAT rates for cultural goods and services. Economic theory can be used to explain how reduced fiscal rates are expected to decrease prices and increase quantities of consumed cultural goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiecki, Karol J. and Trilce Navarette 2015. “[https://ideas.repec.org/p/cue/wpaper/awp-02-2015.html Fiscal and Economic Aspects of Book Consumption in the European Union].” ACEI Working Paper 02-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Fiscal policy can be an important part of cultural policy, in particular the VAT rate discounts on cultural consumption, yet it receives less attention than deserved.

==Scope==
At the international level [[UNESCO]] is in charge of cultural policy. Contact information for ministries of culture and national arts councils in 160 countries is available from the website of the [[International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies]] (IFACCA). On a local scale, subnational (e.g., state or provincial governments), city and local governments offer citizens and local authorities the opportunity to develop arts and culture with the Agenda 21 for Culture.

==Research==
Cultural policy research is a field of academic inquiry that grew out of [[cultural studies]] in the 1990s. It grew out of the idea that cultural studies should not only be critical, but also try to be useful.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Bennett, ''Culture, A reformer's Science'', SAGE, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, there are many departments of Cultural Policy Studies around the world.

'''Cultural sustainability''' as it relates to [[sustainable development]] (to [[sustainability]]), has to do with the maintaining of cultural beliefs, [[cultural practice]]s, [[Historic preservation|heritage conservation]], culture as its own entity, and attempts to answer the question of whether or not any given cultures will exist in the context of the future.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soini|first=Katriina|last2=Birkland|first2=Inger|year=2014|title=Exploring the scientific discourse on cultural sustainability|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/science/article/pii/S0016718513002558|journal=Geoforum|volume=51|pages=213–223|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culture is defined as a set of beliefs, morals, methods, and a collection of human knowledge that is dependent on the transmission of these characteristics to younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture|title=Definition of CULTURE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability is defined as the ability to sustain or continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sustainable|title=Definition of SUSTAINABLE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two concepts have been intertwined within social and political domains, and as such, have become one of the more important concepts of [[sustainability]].

First mentioned in 1995, cultural sustainability also presents viable options within the realm of social policy, providing solutions to sustainable development issues.

Cultural Sustainability can be regarded as a fundamental issue, even a precondition to be met on the path towards sustainable development. However, the theoretical and conceptual understanding of cultural sustainability within the general frames of Sustainable Development remains vague and consequently, the role of culture is poorly implemented in the environmental, as well as political and social policy. Determining the impact of Cultural Sustainability is found by investigating the concept of culture in the context of Sustainable development, through multidisciplinary approaches and analyses. This means examining the best practices for bringing culture into political and social policy as well as practical domains, and developing means and indicators for assessing the impacts of culture on Sustainable Development.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Cultural sustainability has always been categorized under the social pillar of the three pillars of sustainability, but with recent developments within this field considerations are being made in order to make Cultural Sustainability its own pillar, due to its growing importance within social, political, environmental, and economic spheres.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The importance of cultural sustainability lies within its influential power over the people, as decisions that are made within the context of society are heavily weighed by the beliefs of that society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bender|first=Oliver|last2=Haller|first2=Andreas|year=2017|title=The cultural embeddedness of population mobility in the Alps: Consequences for sustainable development|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00291951.2017.1317661|journal=Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift - Norwegian Journal of Geography|volume=71|pages=132–145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Socio-political landscapes ==
Culture has an overwhelming effect on social, economic and political planning, but as of yet, has failed to be incorporated into social and political policy on a grand scale,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Axelsson|first=Robert|last2=Angelstam|first2=Per|last3=Degerman|first3=Erik|last4=Teitelbaum|first4=Sara|last5=Andersson|first5=Kjell|last6=Elbakidze|first6=Marine|last7=Drotz|first7=Marcus K.|date=2013-03-01|title=Social and Cultural Sustainability: Criteria, Indicators, Verifier Variables for Measurement and Maps for Visualization to Support Planning|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-012-0376-0|journal=AMBIO|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=215–228|doi=10.1007/s13280-012-0376-0|issn=0044-7447|pmc=3593035|pmid=23475657}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, certain policies regarding both policy and politics have managed to be implemented into some conventions that are implemented on a global scale.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Culture is found everywhere within a society, from the relics of previous generations, to the accumulated values of a society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Culture within society can be divided into two, equally important subtopics that aid in the description of cultural specific characterizations. These categories, as defined by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) are "Material" and "Immaterial".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Material objects such as shrines, paintings, buildings, landscapes and other humanistic formations act as a physical representation of the culture in that area.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although they have little social and political utility, they serve as physical landmarks and culturally dependant objects whose meaning is created and maintained within the context of that society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The accumulation of these cultural characteristics are what measures a society's cultural integrity, and these characteristics are inherently capable of transforming landscapes of political, social, &amp; environment nature via the influence that these values and historical remains have on the population.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Little success has come with the implementations of cultural policy within the context of politics due to a lack of empirical information regarding the topic of cultural sustainability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Immaterial category contains more socially and politically applicable characteristics such as practices, traditions, aesthetics, knowledge, expressions etc.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiu|first=Rebecca|year=2004|title=Socio-Cultural Sustainability of Housing: a Conceptual Exploration|url=http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/pdf/14036096/v21i0002/65_ssohace.xml|journal=Housing, Theory and Society|volume=21|pages=65–76|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics embody social and political utility through education of people, housing, [[social justice]], [[Human rights|Human Rights]], employment and more.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These values contribute to the wellbeing of a society through the use of collective thinking and ideals i.e. culture. Culture also presents more room for expansion on its effects on a society. Specifically, creativity, respect, empathy, and other practices are being used to create social integration and also to create a sense of "self" in the world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Convention implementation ===
[[File:UNESCO logo.svg|left|295x295px]]
Implementation of policy on a global scale has had little success, but enough to show an increasing interest in the topic of Cultural Sustainability. The conventions that have been implemented, have done so on a large scale, involving multiple countries, across most continents. UNESCO has been responsible for the vast majority of these conventions, maintaining that cultural sustainability and cultural heritage are a strong cornerstone of society.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/convention|title=Text of the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more relevant conventions created in 2003 is the "Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage" which proclaims that culture must be protected against all adversarial combatants.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This safeguard was implemented as an understanding that culture guarantees sustainability. Implementing policy based on cultural history is in the process of becoming a widely talked about subject and holds that cultures will be able to thrive in the context of both present and future. Conventions made by UNESCO regarding cultural preservation and sustainability are surrounding the promotion of [[cultural diversity]], which means multiple cultures and ideals within one grand culture.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cultural heritage ==
Cultural memorabilia and artifacts from a cultures history maintain an important role in modern society as they are kept as relics and shrines in order to remember the stories, knowledge, skills and methods of ancestors and learn invaluable lessons from the past. Today, cultures use libraries, art exhibits and museums as a placeholder for these important objects and other culturally significant artifacts.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loach|first=Kirsten|last2=Rowley|first2=Jennifer|last3=Griffiths|first3=Jillian|date=2017-03-04|title=Cultural sustainability as a strategy for the survival of museums and libraries|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10286632.2016.1184657|journal=International Journal of Cultural Policy|volume=23|issue=2|pages=186–198|doi=10.1080/10286632.2016.1184657|issn=1028-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are these objects revered, but the buildings themselves are oftentimes a symbol of cultural integrity to the community which it belongs. Linking with the other pillars of sustainability, the biggest barrier to cultural sustainability is funding. Economic sustainability relies on a number of systems with goals to ensure economic prosperity by eliminating spending where it is not needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/development-developpement/priorities-priorites/segs-sced.aspx?lang=eng|title=Development Sustainable Economic Growth Strategy|last=Government of Canada|first=Foreign Affairs Trade and Development Canada|website=GAC|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural buildings such as museums oftentimes fail to receive the funding it needs to continue the preservation of culturally significant artifacts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Sustainable tourism ==
[[Tourism]] is a travelling method for which people can venture to different areas of the globe and experience new ways of living, and explore landscapes not native to their country of origin. Tourism is constantly being criticized for its impact on the social, political and environmental landscapes due to its high volume of mass consumers. Within the realm of tourism exists more sustainable practices and ideals that are aligned with the idea of cultural sustainability.

=== Geotourism ===
[[File:Forest view stairs in Thenmala 1.jpg|left|thumb]]
[[Geotourism]] is a form of tourism which relies heavily upon the sustainability, or even the improvement of a selected geological location.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farsani|first=Neda Torabi|last2=Coelho|first2=Celeste|last3=Costa|first3=Carlos|year=2012|title=Geotourism and Geoparks as Gateways to Socio-cultural Sustainability in Qeshm Rural Areas, Iran|url=http://www.tandfonline.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/doi/abs/10.1080/10941665.2011.610145#aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YW5kZm9ubGluZS5jb20uc3ViemVyby5saWIudW9ndWVscGguY2EvZG9pL3BkZi8xMC4xMDgwLzEwOTQxNjY1LjIwMTEuNjEwMTQ1P25lZWRBY2Nlc3M9dHJ1ZUBAQDA=|journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research|volume=17|pages=30–48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving as an alternative to [[Mass tourism|Mass Tourism]], Geotourism was created with the purpose of aiding in the sustainable development movement. Geotourism is a method which focuses on Sustainable culture, ecological preservation and restoration, welfare of local populous, and the wildlife in the immediate area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The link between Geotourism and Cultural sustainability lies within their role in maintaining the natural state of the environment, including the social and cultural environment. Preservation of the local culture has been a key element of Geotourism from its inception, and due to this form of tourism, travellers are able to experience true local culture, lifestyles, and practices experienced by the people native to that region.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This form of tourism provides education regarding destinations they have travelled to via ethnographic methods, and also calls upon the traveller to become aware of the footprint they leave on the environment, as well as social changes that may be harmful to the indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jamal|first=Tazim|last2=Camargo|first2=Blanca|last3=Sandlin|first3=Jennifer|last4=Segrado|first4=Romano|date=2010-01-01|title=Tourism and Cultural Sustainability: Towards an Eco-cultural Justice for Place and People|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02508281.2010.11081643|journal=Tourism Recreation Research|volume=35|issue=3|pages=269–279|doi=10.1080/02508281.2010.11081643|issn=0250-8281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responsibility plays an important role in Geotourism by informing travellers of their duties to respect, and preserve the local culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many countries have adapted this method of tourism, going as far as to implement geotourism sites equipped with guides that discuss matters of importance in that area such as environmental or cultural concerns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such countries include:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Many states within the U.S.A. including California &amp; Arizona 
* Romania 
* Norway 
* Honduras 
Geotourism in Honduras includes The Bay Islands,  a Caribbean archipelago made up of three main islands, Utila, Roatan, and Guanaja and a few lesser islands and cays located off the north coast of Honduras. These islands have been blessed with stunning natural scenery, highlighted by idyllic beaches, tropical hillsides, and mangrove forests. &lt;ref&gt;https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1025_041025_travelwatch.html 
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mexico 
Geotourism in Mexico includes Puerto Penasco. This region includes the protected Sea of Cortez, the Pinacate Crator which offers barren desesrts, sacred tribal and Indian lands, fishing zones, estuaries, oyster beds,  and vibrant farmland and wine country.&lt;ref&gt;http://geo-mexico.com/?p=12768 &lt;/ref&gt;
* Canada 
Geotourism in Canada includes Nova Scotia. It was visited by explorers and geologists from around the world for centuries, Nova Scotia′s geological sites are now recognized for their beauty as much as for their rich history. Nova Scotia’s sites include the iconic lighthouses, which is built on rocky precipices that reach out into the sea. &lt;ref&gt;http://press.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/24/canadian-parks-wilderness-newfoundland-labrador-geotourism-mapguide/ &lt;/ref&gt;
* Portugal 
Geotourism in Portugal includes the Geopark of Arouca, which, in 2010, was officially recognised and joined the Global network of Geoparks, under the auspices of UNESCO. The park is known for it’s natural, gastronomical, and cultural heritage. This mountainous area, with rivers, natural parks, steep slopes and lush vegetation covers the entire municipality of Arouca. The granite used to build so many religious and historical monuments, Romanesque chapels and Baroque churches in the region came was extracted from its mountains – Freita and Montemuro.
&lt;ref&gt;http://visitportoandnorth.travel/Porto-and-the-North/Visit/Artigos/Geotourism-in-the-north-of-Portugal &lt;/ref&gt;
As the practice of sustainability in all forms (environmental, social, and economy) becomes a more revered topic and gains traction within political spheres, sociologists suggest refining the practices of tourism to fit a mold that is more conducive to the sustainability models.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tazim et al. suggests the key to sustainable tourism lies within the responsible practice of travellers, but also within the direct participation of the locals in tourism practices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although Geotourism shows to be a viable alternative for mass tourism, reducing the footprint of travellers on different parts of the world, there have been criticisms made regarding its fairness to the local population. Issues of fair pay, and the rights of the local people are the basis of the ethical dilemmas this kind of tourism faces. Tourism has a direct effect on the culture of the local populous, and as such, the focus of sociologists has been how to maintain the local environment (physically, socio-culturally, and economically) while at the same time, introduce people to a new culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3318">'''Saba's culture''' bears the influence of its early settlers, among them the [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[African peoples|Africans]], and [[Dutch people|Dutch]]. Because [[Saba]] measures only five square miles and has a treacherous coastline (making invasion difficult), its population has always been small. Today its population numbers about 1500 people, with approximately 250 being [[expatriate]]s. Many of the non-Sabans teach at or attend the [[Saba University School of Medicine]].   

Although archaeologists have found evidence of early [[Amerindian]] presence, a group of shipwrecked Englishmen in 1632 found the island uninhabited. During the colonial period, Saba's ownership changed hands many times between the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], English, Dutch, and [[French people|French]]. Although part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]] since 1954, Saba's official language (along with that of [[Sint Maarten]] and [[Sint Eustatius]]) is both [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[English language|English]], given the fact that the majority of Sabans speak English as their first language. English has been added to Saba's school curriculum by the Dutch government as a result.

Most Sabans are descended from a handful of families. Hassell, Simmons, and Johnson are common surnames. Early settlers relied on farming, fishing, sailing, and shipbuilding for their livings; [[pirate]]s sought haven there, too. They passed down a hardy nature necessary to survive the island's conditions. 

Because of its difficult terrain (the island is a dormant [[volcano]] rising out of the sea), modern conveniences were slow in coming to Saba. In 1938, construction began to connect its four villages with a road – a feat which engineers had said was impossible due to the island's perilous landscape. Full-time electricity only became available in the 1970s. Its houses have a quaint, cottage look with red roofs. The lifestyle is still slow and old-fashioned with little nightlife, even with the emergence of an [[ecotourism]] industry in the last few decades. Sabans are proud of their history of environmental conservation, calling Saba “The Unspoiled Queen.”

Saban women continue to make two traditional island products, [[Saba lace]] and [[Saba Spice]]. Saba Lace is handstitched lace, which the island's women began making in the late 19th century and built into a thriving mail-order business with the United States. Saba Spice is a rum drink, brewed with a combination of spices.  

As in other [[Caribbean]] locations, Sabans throw an annual [[Caribbean Carnival|Carnival]]. Saba's Carnival takes place the last week in July and includes parades, steel bands, competitions, and food.  

[[Catholicism]] is Saba's predominant religion. Other faiths practiced on the island include the [[Anglican]] Church, the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[Holiness movement|Wesleyan Holiness]], [[Islam]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and [[Judaism]].

[[File:To deposit or not to deposit, that is the question - journal.pbio.1001779.g001.png|thumb|The decision whether and how to share data often rests with researchers.]]
'''Data sharing''' is the practice of making data used for scholarly research available to other investigators. Replication has a long history in science.  The motto of The Royal Society is 'Nullius in verba', translated "Take no man's word for it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/ History of the Royal Society] webpage accessed June 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Many funding agencies, institutions, and publication venues have policies regarding data sharing because transparency and openness are considered by many to be part of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/professor-stefan-elbe/a-global-health-epidemic-_b_14129608.html|title=A Global Health Epidemic Is A Ticking Time Bomb - But Virus Databases Can And Are Helping To Save Lives|website=HuffPost UK|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of funding agencies and science journals require authors of [[Peer review|peer-review]]ed papers to share any supplemental information (raw data, statistical methods or source code) necessary to understand, develop or [[Reproducibility|reproduce]] published research. A great deal of scientific research is not subject to data sharing requirements, and many of these policies have liberal exceptions. In the absence of any binding requirement, data sharing is at the discretion of the scientists themselves. In addition, in certain situations governments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/7270183|title=A shot of transparency|date=2006-08-10|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-09-06|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; and institutions prohibit or severely limit data sharing to protect proprietary interests, national security, and subject/patient/victim confidentiality. Data sharing may also be restricted to protect institutions and scientists from use of data for political purposes.

Data and methods may be requested from an author years after publication. In order to encourage data sharing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How to encourage the right behaviour|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/416001b|journal=Nature|volume=416|issue=6876|pages=1–1|doi=10.1038/416001b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prevent the loss or corruption of data, a number of funding agencies and journals established policies on [[Scientific data archiving|data archiving]]. Access to publicly archived data is a recent development in the [[history of science]] made possible by technological advances in communications and [[information technology]]. To take full advantage of modern rapid communication may require consensual agreement on the criteria underlying mutual recognition of respective contributions. Models recognized for improving the timely sharing of data for more effective response to emergent infectious disease threats include the data sharing mechanism introduced by the GISAID Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCauley|first=John W.|date=2017-02-23|title=Viruses: Model to accelerate epidemic responses|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/542414b|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=542|issue=7642|pages=414–414|doi=10.1038/542414b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ip-watch.org/2017/05/20/no-free-lunch-g20-health-ministers-find-first-meeting/|title=No Free Lunch, G20 Health Ministers Find At First Meeting|date=2017-05-20|website=Intellectual Property Watch|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite policies on data sharing and archiving, data withholding still happens. Authors may fail to archive data or they only archive a portion of the data. Failure to archive data alone is not data withholding. When a researcher requests additional information, an author sometimes refuses to provide it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Savage CJ, Vickers AJ | year = 2009 | title = Empirical Study of Data Sharing by Authors Publishing in PLoS Journals | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 9| page = e7078 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0007078 | pmid=19763261 | pmc=2739314}}&lt;/ref&gt; When authors withhold data like this, they run the risk of losing the trust of the science community.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/books/obas/contents/publication.html Publication and Openness]," chapter from "On Being A Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research", National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data sharing may also indicate the sharing of personal information on a social media platform.

==U.S. government policies==

===Federal law===
On August 9, 2007, President Bush signed the [[America COMPETES Act]] (or the "America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Act") requiring civilian federal agencies to provide guidelines, policy and procedures, to facilitate and optimize the open exchange of data and research between agencies, the public and policymakers. See Section 1009.&lt;ref name = "H.R. 2272"&gt;"[http://commdocs.house.gov/reports/110/h2272.pdf America COMPETES Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIH data sharing policy===
{{Quote |‘The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grants Policy Statement defines "data" as "recorded information, regardless of the form or medium on which it may be recorded, and includes writings, films, sound recordings, pictorial reproductions, drawings, designs, or other graphic representations, procedural manuals, forms, diagrams, work flow charts, equipment descriptions, data files, data processing or computer programs (software), statistical records, and other research data."’ | Council on Governmental Relations&lt;ref&gt;"[http://206.151.87.67/docs/CompleteDRBooklet.htm Access to and retention of research data]: Rights and responsibilities", p. 5. Council on Governmental Relations, March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The NIH Final Statement of Sharing of Research Data says:
{{Quote |‘NIH reaffirms its support for the concept of data sharing. We believe that data sharing is essential for expedited translation of research results into knowledge, products, and procedures to improve human health. The NIH endorses the sharing of final research data to serve these and other important scientific goals. The NIH expects and supports the timely release and sharing of final research data from NIH-supported studies for use by other researchers.

‘NIH recognizes that the investigators who collect the data have a legitimate interest in benefiting from their investment of time and effort. We have therefore revised our definition of "the timely release and sharing" to be no later than the acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final data set. NIH continues to expect that the initial investigators may benefit from first and continuing use but not from prolonged exclusive use.’ | ‘[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html Final NIH statement on sharing research data].’&lt;ref name = "Grants"&gt;"[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/index.htm NIH Data Sharing Policy]."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===NSF Policy from Grant General Conditions===
{{Quote |'''36. Sharing of Findings, Data, and Other Research Products'''
''a. NSF …expects investigators to share with other researchers, at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of the work. It also encourages awardees to share software and inventions or otherwise act to make the innovations they embody widely useful and usable.''

''b. Adjustments and, where essential, exceptions may be allowed to safeguard the rights of individuals and subjects, the validity of results, or the integrity of collections or to accommodate legitimate interests of investigators.'' | "[https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2001/gc101/gc101rev1.pdf National Science Foundation]: Grant General Conditions (GC-1)", April 1, 2001 (p. 17).}}

==Office of Research Integrity==
Allegations of misconduct in medical research carry severe consequences. The United States Department of Health and Human Services established an office to oversee investigations of allegations of misconduct, including data withholding. The website defines the mission:

{{Quote |"The Office of Research Integrity (ORI) promotes integrity in biomedical and behavioral research supported by the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) at about 4,000 institutions worldwide. ORI monitors institutional investigations of research misconduct and facilitates the responsible conduct of research (RCR) through educational, preventive, and regulatory activities." | [http://ori.dhhs.gov/ Office of Research Integrity].}}

==Ideals in data sharing==
Some research organizations feel particularly strongly about data sharing. Stanford University's [[WaveLab (mathematics software)|WaveLab]] has a philosophy about reproducible research and disclosing all algorithms and source code necessary to reproduce the research. In a paper titled "WaveLab and Reproducible Research," the authors describe some of the problems they encountered in trying to reproduce their own research after a period of time. In many cases, it was so difficult they gave up the effort. These experiences are what convinced them of the importance of disclosing source code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf WaveLab and Reproducible Research] by Jonathan B. Buckheit and [[David Donoho|David L. Donoho]]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy is described:
:''The idea is: An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~wavelab/ WaveLab850 website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rimmer|first=Matthew|date=2005-09-01|title=Japonica Rice: Intellectual Property, Scientific Publishing and Data‐sharing|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08109020500235180|journal=Prometheus|volume=23|issue=3|pages=325–347|doi=10.1080/08109020500235180|issn=0810-9028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Data Observation Network for Earth''' ([[DataONE]]) and Data Conservancy&lt;ref&gt;[https://dataconservancy.org]&lt;/ref&gt; are projects supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] to encourage and facilitate data sharing among research scientists and better support [[meta-analysis]]. In environmental sciences, the research community is recognizing that major scientific advances involving integration of knowledge in and across fields will require that researchers overcome not only the technological barriers to data sharing but also the historically entrenched institutional and sociological barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reichman O.J. |author2=Jones M.B. |author3=Schildhauer M.P. | year = 2011 | title = Challenges and Opportunities of Open Data in Ecology | url = | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6018| pages = 703–705 | doi = 10.1126/science.1197962 | pmid=21311007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Richard J. Hodes, director of the [[National Institute on Aging]] has stated, "the old model in which researchers jealously guarded their data is no longer applicable".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/health/04alzheimer.html NY Times article about value of shared data to Alzheimers research]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alliance for Taxpayer Access is a group of organizations that support open access to government sponsored research. The group has expressed a "Statement of Principles" explaining why they believe open access is important.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/ The Alliance for Taxpayer Access website]&lt;/ref&gt; They also list a number of international public access policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/international.html Worldwide momentum for public access to publicly funded research ]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is no more so than in timely communication of essential information to effectively respond to health emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shu|first=Yuelong|last2=McCauley|first2=John|title=GISAID: Global initiative on sharing all influenza data – from vision to reality|url=http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22750|journal=Eurosurveillance|volume=22|issue=13|doi=10.2807/1560-7917.es.2017.22.13.30494}}&lt;/ref&gt; While public domain archives have been embraced for depositing data, mainly post formal publication, they have failed to encourage rapid data sharing during health emergencies, among them the Ebola&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yozwiak|first=Nathan L.|last2=Schaffner|first2=Stephen F.|last3=Sabeti|first3=Pardis C.|date=2015-02-26|title=Data sharing: Make outbreak research open access|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/518477a|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=518|issue=7540|pages=477–479|doi=10.1038/518477a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zika,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/zika-virus-outbreak-when-research-goes-off-the-rails/article8203618.ece|title=When research goes off the rails|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-02-11|title=Benefits of sharing|url=http://www.nature.com/news/benefits-of-sharing-1.19322|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=530|issue=7589|pages=129–129|doi=10.1038/530129a}}&lt;/ref&gt; outbreaks.

==Data sharing problems==

===Academic genetics===
Withholding of data has become so commonplace in academic genetics that researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital published a journal article on the subject. The study found that "Because they were denied access to data, 28% of geneticists reported that they had been unable to confirm published research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.287.4.473 |vauthors=Campbell EG, Clarridge BR, Gokhale M |title=Data withholding in academic genetics: evidence from a national survey |journal=JAMA |volume=287 |issue=4 |pages=473–80 |year=2002 |pmid=11798369 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11798369|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic psychology===
In a 2006 study, it was observed that, of 141 authors of a publication from the American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 103 (73%) did not respond with their data over a 6-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wicherts | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Borsboom | first2 = D. | last3 = Kats | first3 = J. | last4 = Molenaar | first4 = D. | title = The poor availability of psychological research data for reanalysis | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.61.7.726 | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 61 | issue = 7 | pages = 726–728 | year = 2006 | pmid =  17032082| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow up study published in 2015, it was found that 246 out of 394 contacted authors of papers in APA journals did not share their data upon request (62%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vanpaemel | first1 =W. | last2 = Vermorgen | first2 = M. | last3 = Deriemaecker | first3 = L. | last4 = Storms | first4 = G. | title = Are we wasting a good crisis?

===Academic archaeology===
A 2018 study reported on study of a random sample of 48 articles published during February–May 2017 in the ''[[Journal of Archaeological Science]]'' which found openly available raw data for 18 papers (53%), with compositional and dating data being the most frequently shared types. The same study also emailed authors of articles on experiments with stone artifacts that were published during 2009 and 2015 to request data relating to the publications. They contacted the authors of 23 articles and received 15 replies, resulting in a 70% response rate. They received five responses that included data files, giving an overall sharing rate of 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marwick|first1=Ben|last2=Birch|first2=Suzanne E. Pilaar|title=A Standard for the Scholarly Citation of Archaeological Data as an Incentive to Data Sharing|journal=Advances in Archaeological Practice|date=5 April 2018|volume=6|issue=02|pages=125–143|doi=10.1017/aap.2018.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientists in training===
A study of scientists in training indicated many had already experienced data withholding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001888-200602000-00007 |vauthors=Vogeli C, Yucel R, Bendavid E |title=Data withholding and the next generation of scientists: results of a national survey |journal=Acad Med |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=128–36 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16436573 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1040-2446&amp;volume=81&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=128|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study has given rise to the fear the future generation of scientists will not abide by the established practices.

==Differing approaches in different fields==
Requirements for data sharing are more commonly imposed by institutions, funding agencies, and publication venues in the medical and biological sciences than in the physical sciences. Requirements vary widely regarding whether data must be shared at all, with whom the data must be shared, and who must bear the expense of data sharing.

Funding agencies such as the NIH and NSF tend to require greater sharing of data, but even these requirements tend to acknowledge the concerns of patient confidentiality, costs incurred in sharing data, and the legitimacy of the request. Private interests and public agencies with national security interests (defense and law enforcement) often discourage sharing of data and methods through non-disclosure agreements.

Data sharing poses specific challenges in [[participatory monitoring]] initiatives, for example where forest communities collect data on local social and environmental conditions. In this case, a rights-based approach to the development of data-sharing protocols can be based on principles of [[free, prior and informed consent]], and prioritise the protection of the rights of those who generated the data, and/or those potentially affected by data-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;D Sabogal. 2015. Data sharing in community-based forest monitoring: lessons from Guyana. Global Canopy Programme. http://forestcompass.org/how/resources/data-sharing-community-based-forest-monitoring-lessons-guyana&lt;/ref&gt;

In art, a '''dedication''' is the creation or attribution of a work of art as a [[tribute]] to or in honor of a person, place, or thing. The dedicatee may be the [[commission (art)|commissioner]], conductor, premiere performer or musical ensemble, or patron. The work may be [[memorial]].

In music, examples include many of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s works, such as the [[Piano Sonata No. 30 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata Op. 109]], dedicated to his friend [[Antonie Brentano]]'s daughter Maximiliane.&lt;ref name="Anderson2007"&gt;{{cite AV media notes|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.557724&amp;catNum=557724&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English#|last=Anderson|first=Keith|title=Beethoven: Piano Trios, Vol. 2 – Piano Trios Nos. 1, 2, 9|publisher=[[Naxos Records]]|type=CD|ID=8.572343|year=2007|ref={{harvid|Anderson|2007}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CooperP225"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Tq5ci-9OMLEC|title=Beethoven|last=Cooper|first=Barry|authorlink=Barry Cooper (musicologist)|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United States|year=2000|isbn=978-0191592706|page=225|ref={{harvid|Cooper|2000}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Economics of the arts and literature'''  or '''cultural economics''' (used below for convenience) is a branch of economics that studies the economics of creation, distribution, and the consumption of [[work of art|works of art]], literature and similar creative and/or cultural products.   For a long time, the concept of the "arts" were confined to visual arts (e.g., painting) and performing arts (music, theatre, dance) in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. Usage has widened since the beginning of the 1980s with the study of [[cultural industry]] (cinema, television programs, book and periodical publishing and music publishing) and the economy of cultural institutions (museums, libraries, historic buildings).  The field is coded as [[JEL classification codes#Other special topics (economics) JEL: Z Subcategories|JEL: Z11]] in the ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]'' [[JEL classification codes|classification system]] used for article searches.&lt;ref&gt;In the JEL system, '[[Cultural economics|Cultural Economics]]' is a [[JEL classification codes#Other special topics (economics) JEL: Z Subcategories|broader category]] than used in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Alejandro Plaza.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Painter Alejandro Plaza at work on a canvas. Once this painting is complete, it will be a unique good, for which there is no exact substitute]]
Cultural economics is concerned with the arts in a broad sense. The goods considered have creative content, but that is not enough to qualify as a cultural good. Designer goods such as clothes and drapes are not considered usually to be works of art or culture. Cultural goods are those with a value determined by symbolic content rather than physical characteristics. (For further considerations, see also [[Cultural Institutions Studies]]). Economic thinking has been applied in ever more areas in the last decennia, including pollution, corruption and education.

Works of art and culture have a specific quality, which is their uniqueness. While other economic goods, such as [[crude oil]] or [[wheat]] are generic, interchangeable commodities (given a specific grade of the product), there is only one example of a famous painting such as the [[Mona Lisa]], and only one example of Rodin's well-known sculpture "[[The Thinker]]". While copies or reproductions can be made of these works of art, and while many inexpensive posters of the Mona Lisa and small factory-made replicas of "The Thinker" are sold, neither full-size copies nor inexpensive reproductions are viewed as substitutes for the real artworks, in the way that a consumer views a pound of Grade A sugar from Cuba as a fully equivalent substitute for a pound of Grade A sugar from United States or Dominican Republic.  As there is no equivalent item or substitute for these famous works of art, classical economist [[Adam Smith]] held it was impossible to value them. [[Alfred Marshall]] noted that the demand for a certain kind of cultural good can depend on its consumption: The more you have listened to a particular kind of music, the more you appreciate. In his economic framework, these goods do not have the usual decreasing [[marginal utility]].

Key academic works in cultural economics include those of [[William Baumol|Baumol]] and [[William G. Bowen|Bowen]] (Performing Arts, The Economic Dilemma, 1966), of [[Gary Becker]] on addictive goods, and of [[Alan Peacock]] (public choice). This summary has been divided into sections on the economic study of the performing arts, on the market of individual pieces of art, the art market in cultural industries, the economics of cultural heritage and the labour market in the art sector.

== Performing arts: Baumol and cultural economics ==
[[File:Lux Video Theatre rehearsal 1951.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This picture shows actors rehearsing for a play in 1951. Despite the numerous technological advances in between 1951 and the 2010s, in the 2010s, it would still require the same number of actors to perform this play. For this reason, scholars argue that some cultural industries are not getting more efficient the way other industries, such as accounting and banking, are; these latter two industries require far fewer workers in the 2010s due to the development of computer programs.]]
The seminal paper by William Baumol and Bowen introduced the term [[Baumol's cost disease|cost disease]] for a relative cost growth of live performances. This cost growth explains the increasing dependency of this kind of art on state subsidies. It occurs when the consumable good is labour itself. To understand this phenomenon, compare the change in the cost of performing the [[Molière]] play "[[Tartuffe]]" in 1664 and in 2007 with the change in cost of calculating a large number of sums from an accounting ledger. In 1664, you needed two hours and twelve actors to perform Molière's play, and it would take, say, twelve accountants working for two hours to add up all the sums in an accounting ledger. In 2007, a single accountant with a $10 calculator can add the sums in 20 minutes, but you still need two hours and twelve actors for the Molière play. Artists must make a considerable investment in [[human capital]] (e.g., training), and needs to be paid accordingly. The artists' pay needs to rise along with that of the population in general. As the latter is following the general productivity in the economy, the cost of a play will rise with general productivity, while the actors' productivity does not rise.

There are two lines of thought in subsequent literature on the economics of the performing arts:

*The first concentrates on the existence of productivity growth in some areas of production, thus contradicting the relevance of cost disease. Staying with the "Tartuffe" example, the same performance can be viewed by an ever-larger audience by improvements in the design of theatres, and by the introduction of microphones, television and recording.
*The second is concerned with the allocation of subsidies to the cultural sector. While these should be in the general public interest, they may have an income distribution effect, e.g. if they reduce cost to the relatively well-off part of society. This is the case when the well-off are overrepresented in the audiences of subsidized plays, or when subsidies go to a small elitist group of artists.

== Market for artworks ==
Two segments of the market in the visual arts can be distinguished: works of art that are familiar and have a history, and contemporary works that are more easily influenced by fashion and new discoveries. Both markets, however, are [[oligopoly|oligopolistic]], i.e., there are limited numbers of sellers and buyers ([[oligopsony]]). Two central questions on the working of the markets are: How are prices determined, and what is the [[rate of return|return]] on artworks, compared to the return on financial assets?

=== Price determination ===
Components of a work of art, like raw stone, tubes of paint or unpainted canvas, in general have a value much lower than the finished products, such as a sculpture or a finished painting. Also, the amount of labour needed to produce an item does not explain the big price differences between works of art. It seems that the value is much more dependent on potential buyers', and experts' perception of it. This perception has three elements: First, social value, which is the social status the buyer has by owning it. The artist thus has an "artistic capital". Second, the artistic value, compared to contemporary works, or as importance to later generations. Third, the price history of the item, if a buyer uses this for his expectation of a future price at which he might sell the item again (given the oligopolistic market structure).
Three kinds of economic agents determine these values. Specific experts like gallery owners or museum directors use the first, social value. Experts like art historians and art professors use the second, artistic value. Buyers who buy works of art as an investment use the third, the price history and expectations for future price increases.

=== Art market and investment ===
[[File:Asrlar Sadosi2012b.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fine art such as paintings are typically sold at [[auction]]s.]]
Some major financial institutions, banks and insurance companies, have had considerable return rates on investments in art works in the 1990s. These rates have not slowed down at the same time as the rates on [[stock exchange]]s, in the early 90's. This may indicate a [[diversification (finance)|diversification]] opportunity. Apart from this evidence of successful investment, the amount of data available has stimulated study of the market. Many works are sold on [[auction]]s. These transactions are thus very transparent. This has made it possible to establish price databases, with prices of some items going back to 1652. Empirical studies have shown that, on average, the [[rate of return|return]] on works of art has been lower than that on [[stock|equity]], with a [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] that is at least as high. An [[intangible asset|intangible]] gain in terms of pleasure of having a work of art could explain this partly. However, before interpreting the figures, it should be borne in mind that art is often exempt of many kinds of taxes. In 1986, Baumol made an estimate of an average yearly rate of return of 0.55 percent for works of art, against a rate of return of 2.5 percent for financial assets, over a 20-year period.

== Cultural industries ==
Some famous artworks such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' painting are not reproducible (at least in the sense of creating another copy that would be seen as equivalent in value), but there are many cultural goods whose value does not depend on a single, individual copy. Books, recordings, movies get some of their value from the existence of many copies of the original. These are the products of major cultural industries, which are the book industry, the music industry and the film industry. These markets are characterized by:
* '''Uncertainty of value'''. The demand for a good (market success) is hard to predict. For example, with movies, even if a film's plot, themes and selection of actors has been extensively tested using focus groups and polls, and even if the movie uses popular [[A-list]] actors, this film may still be a [[box office bomb]] (e.g., ''[[Gigli]]'', a 2003 American romantic comedy starring [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]]). On the other hand, a low-budget film by an unknown director and an unknown cast, such as ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' can surprise the industry by being a major hit. This uncertainty is a characteristic of an [[experience good]] such as films, TV shows, musical theatre shows and music concerts.
* '''Infinite variety'''. You can differentiate between regular consumer products, e.g. cars, on basis of its characteristics. For example, a hatchback can be purchased from a number of manufacturers with a set list of options (e.g., automatic transmission, standard transmission, convertible, etc.), with the different options requiring different charges. Many general products allow classification on a relatively small number of such characteristics. Cultural goods, however, have a very high number of characteristics, which, on top of that, often are subjective. For example, an early 1990s band with loud, [[distortion (music)|distorted]] [[electric guitar]] could be considered to be [[grunge]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[heavy metal music]] or [[alternative rock]] by different [[music critic]]s.  This makes cultural products hard to compare.
* '''High concentration in the products which are traded or sold'''. A major part of sales of cultural goods is in a very small number of [[bestseller]]s (e.g., with books), [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s (movies) or hit [[Single (music)|single]]s (pop music).
* '''Short [[product life cycle management|life cycle]]'''. Most cultural items are sold/traded shortly after their introduction or production. Some cultural goods, such as broadcast news, have little or no market value shortly after the broadcast. Of course, some cultural products may retain saleability for years or even decades, as with the small number of films that become [[cult movie]]s (e.g., ''[[Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'') or certain classic novels or albums that have enduring appeal (the "[[back catalogue]]" of a record label).
* '''High [[fixed cost]]s'''. There is high cost before introduction of a new artwork or cultural product. Making a movie can cost millions of dollars; however the marginal cost of making an additional copy of the DVD may cost less than a dollar.

=== Market structure ===
The important cultural industries tend to have an [[oligopolistic]] [[market structure]]. The market is dominated by a few major companies, with the rest of the market consisting of many small companies. The latter may act as a filter or as "gatekeepers" for the artistic supply. A small company with a successful artist or good quality roster can be bought by one of the major companies. Big conglomerates, pooling TV and film production, have existed for decades. The 1990s have seen some mergers extending beyond the industry as such, and mergers of hardware producers with content providers. Anticipated gains from [[synergy]] and [[market power]] have not been realised, and from the early 2000s there has been a trend towards organisation along sector lines.

== Economics of cultural heritage ==
[[Cultural heritage]] is reflected in goods and real estate. Management and [[regulatory economics|regulation]] of museums has come under study in this area.

=== Museums ===
[[File:The Otsuka Museum of Art20s3200.jpg|thumb|right200px|The [[Otsuka Museum of Art]] in Japan.]]
Museums, which have a conservatory role, and provide exhibitions to the general public, can be commercial, or on a non-profit base. In the second case, as they provide a [[public good]], they pose the problems related to these goods: should they be self-financing, or be subsidized ? One of the specific issues is the imbalance between the huge value of the collections in museums, and their budgets. Also, they are often located in places (city centres) where the cost of land is high, which limits their expansion possibilities. American museums exhibit only about half of their collection. Some museums in Europe, like the Pompidou Centre in France, show less than 5 percent of their collection. Apart from providing exhibitions, museums get proceeds from derived products, like catalogues and reproductions. They also produce at a more intangible level: They make collections. Out of so many pieces in the public domain, they make a selection based on their expertise, thus adding value to the mere existence of the items.

The dual goal of conservation and providing exhibitions obviously presents a choice. On the one hand the museum has, for conservation reasons, an interest in exhibiting as few items as possible, and it would select lesser known works and a specialized audience, to promote knowledge and research. On the other hand, the exhibition argument requires showing the major pieces from different cultures, to satisfy the demands from the public and to attract a large audience. When a government has made a choice about this, application of economic [[contract theory]] will help to implement this choice by showing how to use incentives to different managers (on the financial, conservatory side) to obtain the required result.

=== Real estate and buildings  ===
[[File:Wr Neustaedter Dom.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In many countries, historic buildings such as cathedrals are considered to be "heritage buildings" and as such they are protected against demolition or substantial modifications.]]
Many countries have systems that protect historically significant buildings and structures. These are buildings or other structures that are deemed to have cultural importance or which are deemed to have heritage value. Owners get tax deductions or subsidies for restoration, in return for which they accept restrictions on modifications to the buildings or provide public access. Buildings that are often classified as heritage buildings include former or current Parliament buildings, cathedrals, courthouses, houses built in a recognized historical style, and even fairly regular houses, if the house was formerly the home of a famous [[politician]], [[artist]] or inventor. Buildings with heritage status cannot typically be demolished. Depending on the nature of the heritage restrictions, the current owner may or may not be allowed to modify the outside or inside of the building. Such a system poses the same choice problems as museums do. There has been little study of this issue.

== Artists' labour market ==
The [[labour market]] for artists is characterized by:
* There is an '''extremely unequal [[income distribution]]''' within the market segment. A very small group of artists earn a high proportion of the total income, while the average income is low.
* There is a '''structural excess supply of labour'''. There are always more people who would like to earn their income as an artist than there is demand for artists and artworks. For example, there are far more young [[indie rock]] bands aspiring to careers in music than there are available paid contracts in the recording industry. Due to this excess supply of labour, a [[nightclub]] owner has so many local young bands requesting to play at her venue that she can offer them little or no payment for their performance.
* There are '''intangible returns to labour''', also called "nonpecuniary benefits" (this means non-financial, non-wage benefits). For example, a musician is able to spend her days creating beautiful music and working with other creative people, which is very satisfying. Due to these intangible returns, artists are often willing to accept lower wages than their qualifications would earn in a different market. For example, working with a famous musician may provide such great intangible benefits (e.g., it is exciting to meet and work with such a well-known performer) that a [[record producer]] may be able to ask musicians to record with the start musician for little or no payment.
* '''Non-separation of artist and work'''. While some workers in the cultural industries do not make a strong connection between their work tasks and their self-identity, for some types of artists, such as painters, sculptors and filmmakers, the image their artwork or creative output gives them is important to artists' sense of self. Whether this phenomenon occurs depends on a number of factors, such as the type of artistic job and individuals' perceptions. In the 2010s, many famous [[film director]]s view the movies they direct as directly identified with their artistic vision. However, an assistant director leading scenes in [[action film]]s may see him or herself as a worker in a cultural industry, and he/she may not feel artistically identified with the film's he/she works on.

=== Star system ===
[[File:Evan Rachel Wood (April 2009) 4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sherwin Rosen]] states that top stars have such high earnings because their movies sell more copies.]]
The term [[superstar (celebrity)|"star system"]], coined by [[Sherwin Rosen]], is used to explain why a very small number of the artists and creators in the market, such as the celebrity [[A-list]] actors and top [[pop singer]]s, earn most of the total earnings in a sector. Rosen's 1981 paper examined the economics of superstars to determine why “relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage.” Rosen argues that in superstar markets, "small differences in talent at the top of the distribution will translate into large differences in revenue." Rosen points out that "...sellers of higher talent charge only slightly higher prices than those of lower talent, but sell much larger quantities; their greater earnings come overwhelmingly from selling larger quantities than from charging higher prices".

In cultural industries, the uncertainty about the quality of a product plays a key role in this. The consumer does not really know how good the product is, until he or she has consumed it (think of a movie), and the producer is confronted with the typical uncertainty in a cultural industry. The consumer looks for guidance in the price, reputation, or a famous name on the cover or poster. As the producer understands this using a famous director, actor or singer affects demand, he or she is prepared to pay a lot for a name considered a sign of quality (a star). Indeed, authors like Adler and Ginsburgh have given evidence that star status is determined by chance: in a musical contest, results were highly correlated with the order of performance. This randomness has been used to explain why the labor supply in the sector remains excessive: given the extreme gains of a star, and an irrational behaviour, or particular preferences, with respect to chance, unsuccessful artists keep trying, even when they are earning their money mostly in a different trade, such as waiting tables. A second argument is the possibility of intangible returns to artists' labour in terms of social status and lifestyle. For example, even a struggling [[DJ]] spends most of her time onstage on [[nightclub]]s and [[rave]]s, which for some people is a desirable outcome.

=== Production structure ===
[[File:Set design by Philippe Chaperon for Act4 sc2 of Aida by Verdi 1880 Paris.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A painter who does canvases that hang in major museums and a professional set painter for opera or theatre are both skilled painters who do painting for a living. However, the former is more likely to view her/his paintings as part of her artistic expression and identity, whereas the latter is more likely to view her/himself as a craftsperson.]]

A case has been made for the existence of a different structure in the production of cultural goods . (See [[Cultural Institutions Studies]].) An artist often considers a product to be an expression of himself, while the ordinary craftsperson is only concerned with his product, as far as it affects his/her pay or salary. For example, a painter who creates artworks that are displayed in museums may view her paintings as her artistic expression. On the other hand, a scene painter for a music theatre company may see herself as a craftsperson who is paid by the hour for doing painting. The artist may thus want restrict the use of his or her product, and he/she may object if a museum uses a reproduction of his/her painting to help sell cars or liquor. On the other hand, the scene painter may not object to commercial re-uses of her set painting, as she/he may see it just as a regular job.

Built in 1968, '''El Mercado de Los Angeles''' is located in the Boyle Heights district of the city of Los Angeles east of the LA River and adjacent to East Los Angeles (an unincorporated portion of the County of Los Angeles often cited as the heart of the Mexican/American community) on the corner of 1st Street and Lorena Street and is accessible by the Metro Gold Line's [[Indiana (Los Angeles Metro station)|Indiana Station]] located two blocks east.  El Mercado is a three-floor indoor shopping center that offers dining and restaurant services, entertainment with live mariachi bands and shopping from various vendors. Although El Mercado is themed and represents a space that honors [[Mexico]] and [[Mexican culture]], other Latinos from different ethnicities visit and shop there.&lt;ref name="El Mercado de Los Angeles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of El Mercado de Los Angeles|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/history.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an indoor shopping and meeting place, El Mercado also provides economic agency for Latinos as vendors selling music and films, exotic boots, belts, hats, a jewelry store, Mexican handcrafts, toys, cosmetics and services such as travel and sending money to their natal communities.&lt;ref name="Swap meets and Socioeconomic Alternatives"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barros-Nock|first=Magdalena|title=Swap meets and Socioeconomic Alternatives for Mexican Immigrants: The Case of San Joaquin Valley|journal=Human Organization|date=2 September 2009|volume=68|issue=3|pages=307–317|url=http://sfaa.metapress.com/content/6550852777144576/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through selling and bartering Latino vendors engage in market exchanges that give agency to both the buyer and seller. El Mercado de Los Angeles is a place where Latinos can gather together for social purposes and to enjoy cultural experiences through food, music, and other forms of semiotics such as the paintings on the buildings and a mural of the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Virgen de Guadalupe]] that link them to their native lands.

== Cultural de-territorialization and identity ==
In East Los Angeles, Latinos constitute approximately 97.1% of the population.&lt;ref name="East Los Angeles demographic information"&gt;{{cite web|title=East Los Angeles Demographic Data|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/East-Los-Angeles-California.html|publisher=CityData.com|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy population of Latinos in [[Eastside Los Angeles|East Los Angeles]] demonstrates the appropriation of space due to the process of [[deterritorialization|de-territorialization]]. De-territorialization of culture refers to the weakening relationships between culture and place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deterritorialization]]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, many thought of culture restricted in localized terms, that is cultural was rooted to a particular geographical area, nation, or state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inda|first=Jonathan Xavier|author2=Renato Rosaldo|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|journal=A world in motion|year=2002|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as East Los Angeles proves different, Latinos as cultural subjects, continue to traverse national borders bringing along with them their cultural practices and traditions in different territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inda|first=Jonathan Xavier|author2=Renato Rosaldo|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|journal=A world in motion|year=2002|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Territorialization on the other hand can be more understood as the process of turning a space into a place, as explained by Clara Irazabal and Ramzi Farhart in their article “Latino Communities in the United States: Place-Making in the Pre-World War II, Postwar, and Contemporary City”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irazábal|first=Clara|author2=Ramzi Farhat|title=Latino Communities in the United States: Place-Making in the Pre-World War II, Postwar, and Contemporary City|journal=Journal of Planning Literature|year=2008|volume=22|issue=3|pages=207|doi=10.1177/0885412207310146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affirmations of belonging and community space ==
El Mercado is place that allows Latinos to assert their identity to foster a sense of belonging and build an intimate community space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guitérrez Nájera|first=Lourdes|title=Hayandose: Zapotex Migrant Expressions of Membership and Belonging|journal=Beyond El Barrio: Everyday life in Latina/o America|year=2010|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lourdes Gutierrez Nájera explains in her article “Hayandoese: Zapotec Migrant Expressions of Membership and Belonging” how Yalaltecos communities in Los Angeles affirm their identity and create a sense of ethnic belonging and community through participation in life cycle events and every day practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guitérrez Nájera|first=Lourdes|title=Hayandose: Zapotex Migrant Expressions of Membership and Belonging|journal=Beyond El Barrio: Everyday life in Latina/o America|year=2010|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article “Swap meets, Flea Markets, and Open-Air Public Markets: a community and economic development model for low-income and underserved neighborhoods”, Jeffrey Edwin Juarez describes swap meets as regular meeting spaces that people treat as recreation places, much like a park, to spend time together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juarez|first=Jeffery Edwin|title=Swap Meets, Flea Markets, and Open-Air Public Markets: A community and economic development model for low-income and underserved neighborhoods|year=2011|page=12|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/69455|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Mercado is a community pace for Latino’s for both local’s and visitors to interact, spend time together and share experiences. One way El Mercado fosters its community space is through its large restaurant located on the third floor popularly known as El Mercadito, which is actually themed in to three different restaurants representing different cities of Mexico that make up the one large restaurant.&lt;ref name="El Mercado de Los Angeles"/&gt; El Mercadito restaurant is widely used by families and friends as a community space to make reservations for birthday celebrations, wedding receptions, quincenera receptions, and other banquet purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Mercadito Restaurant Directory|url=http://www.elmercaditorestaurant.com/HTML/reservaciones/reservation.html|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic agency at El Mercado ==
El Mercado de Los Angeles serves a significant economic purpose for Latinos in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Los Angeles region]]. For the customers at El Mercado, the mercado provides affordable items that make shopping accessible for people across income levels. Also importantly, mercados foster relationships between vendors.&lt;ref name="Sherry 1990 13-30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherry|first=John F.|title=A Sociocultural Analysis of A Midwestern American Flea Market|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=June 1990|volume=17|issue=1|pages=13–30|doi=10.1086/208533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition between vendors exists, but mercados in general often function as sites of both economic competition and collaboration between vendors within the mercado.&lt;ref name="Sherry 1990 13-30"/&gt; The sense of competition is increased between the relationship between vendor and customer.

At swap meets, or mercados like El Mercado, complex relationships exist between buyers and sellers.&lt;ref name="Russell W. Belk, John F. Sherry, Jr. and Melanie Wallendorf 1988 457"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell W. Belk, John F. Sherry, Jr. and Melanie Wallendorf|title=A Naturalistic Inquiry Into Buyer and Seller Behavior at a Swapmeet|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=March 1988|volume=14|issue=4|page=457|doi=10.1086/209128|first1=Russell W.|last2=Sherry, Jr.|first2=John F.|last3=Wallendorf|first3=Melanie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercados are less bureaucratic spaces that corporate stores or even independent businesses.&lt;ref name="Russell W. Belk, John F. Sherry, Jr. and Melanie Wallendorf 1988 457"/&gt; Vendors must apply for a permit at El Mercado, yet the vendors frequently make informal exchanges such as bartering/trading, or bargaining for prices. These informal market exchanges give [[agency (sociology)|agency]] to both the buyer and seller because each have a role in setting the terms of the business transaction. El Mercado de Los Ángeles not only provides cultural significance to the consumers who come to it, but it also provides a space for affordable items and economic negotiation.

== Monetary and cultural remittances at El Mercado ==
El Mercado de Los Angeles offers a variety of services that help send off monetary remittances to [[Latin America]]. The Mercado also provides travel and calling services that help customers participate in the formation of cultural remittances to Latin America.&lt;ref name="El Mercado de Los Angeles"/&gt;

=== Monetary remittances at El Mercado ===
El Mercado also serves as an important site of cultural and monetary remittances between the United States and [[México]], specifically. This mercado is a site of cultural that is the product of cultural hybridities. It is also a site that actively constructs cultural hybridities in the United States and México. El Mercado offers services to send money back to México securely as well as offering a [[bureau de change|currency exchange]] between [[peso]]s and United States dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of El Mercado de Los Angeles|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/directory.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers are able to send monetary remittance home to México by using the services at the Mercado. These services also assist vendors at the Mercado send some of the profits that they make at the Mercado to family members or communities abroad. These remittances are often directed at families or [[hometown associations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sana|first=Mariano|title=Growth of Migrant Remittances from the United States to Mexico, 1990-2004|journal=Social Forces|date=March 2008|volume=86|issue=3|page=1001|doi=10.1353/sof.0.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural remittances at El Mercado ===
The Mercado de Los Angeles also facilitates opportunities to create [[cultural remittances]] for Latino migrants. The mercado offers international calling services and a [[travel agency]] that sells international plane tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of El Mercado de Los Angeles|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/directory.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These services aid the fluid migratory process that physically transports migrants from their countries of origin to the countries of current residence. Along with the physical transportation, the Mercado specializes in transculturated goods and items. Many of the stores specialize in traditional Mexican clothing, books, or films. Yet, these traditional items are presented in a transculturated context, outside of [[México]] or [[Latin America]]. The mercado becomes a transculturated site that participates in cultural remittance when it facilitates the physical circular migration of migrants returning to their home country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flores|first=Juan|title=The Diaspora Strikes Back: Caribeño Tales of Learning and Turning|year=2008|publisher=Rutledge|isbn=0415952611|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migrants returning home bring cultural remittances to the land that they left, and El Mercado de Los Angeles is an important site of this cultural remittance process in Los Angeles.

== Semiotic meaning-making at El Mercado ==
El Mercado de Los Angeles actively produces and shapes culture through a variety of ways. Semiotics describes a series of processes in which meaning is given to the world around humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturken|first=Marita |last2=Cartwright|first2=Lisa|title=Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195314409|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; As humans interpret visual sensory clues about the world, meaning and culture are produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturken |first=Marita |last2=Cartwright|first2=Lisa|title=Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195314409|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the mercado, mariachi music and visual murals are two principal ways that semiotic processes produce culture.

=== Mariachi at El Mercado ===
The cultural significance of El Mercado is complemented by presence of semiotic cultural elements such as music and the murals present at El Mercado. Semiotics is a process through which visuals, sounds, and other sensory experiences are given meaning and made socially significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturken|first=Marita |last2=Cartwright|first2=Lisa|title=Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195314409|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of semiotic meaning-making is present at the mercado, especially through the mariachi restaurants. The third floor of the mercado is composed of three restaurants that are well known for not only the food but the mariachi music that they all play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mariachi at El Mercado|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/mariachi-en.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=1 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolores Inés Casillas, a theorist who writes about cultural semiotics, considers listening to sound a political practice. She views nostalgic sounds from home countries as a means of remembering the home country while constructing space in the land of migration.&lt;ref name="Casillas 2010 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Casillas|first=Dolores|chapter=¡Puuurrrooo MÉXICO!|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/6938122/Puuurrrooo_M%C3%89XICO_Listening_to_Transnationalism_on_U.S._Spanish-language_Radio|title=Beyond El Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America|editor1=Gina M. Perez|editor2=Frank A. Guridy|editor3=Adrian Burgos, Jr.|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-9129-5|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of political listening supports the idea that El Mercado de Los Angeles is an active sight of cultural production through the visuals and music present at the mercado.

=== Murals at El Mercado ===
The Mercado de Los Angeles website also portrays some of the several [[murals]] that are present at this marketplace. The themed [[mariachi]] restaurants on the third floor provide a visual representation that constructs a cultural space in the heart of [[Los Angeles]]. From the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] inspired dining room to an [[Aztec]] themed dining room, the mercado provides many visions of a traditional ''México lindo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photo Gallery|url=http://www.elmercaditorestaurant.com/HTML/photo%20album/photo_album.html|publisher=El Mercadito Restaurant}}&lt;/ref&gt; These visual forms are not representations of transnational scenes, but of pastoral memories of historical scenes. These pastoral visuals represent an idealized and fond memory of areas throughout Latin America. This space provides meaningful space for the customers of El Mercado de Los Angeles and contributes to the semiotic construction of cultural hybrities at the mercado. The semiotic components of meaning-making affect the Mercado of Los Angeles as a site of economic and cultural significance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2903">The '''Ethnic Power Relations (EPR)''' [[dataset]] identifies all politically relevant ethnic groups, their size, and their access to state power in every country of the world with a population of at least 250,000 from 1946 to 2017. It includes annual data on over 800 groups and codes the degree to which their representatives hold executive-level state power, from total control of the government, [[Powersharing | power-sharing]] to overt political discrimination. Also, it provides information on [[regional autonomy]] arrangements.

The EPR data is maintained by researchers at the Chair of International Conflict Research at [[ETH Zurich]]. The current version of the EPR data is available in research-ready country-year and group-year format from the GROWup Research Front-End data portal.&lt;ref name=growup&gt;{{cite web |url=https://growup.ethz.ch/|title=GROWup - Geographical Research On War, Unified Platform|website=growup.ethz.ch|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast to similar datasets, such as [[Minorities at Risk|Minorities At Risk (MAR)]], the EPR list includes minority and majority groups. The EPR data is one of the most widely used datasets on ethnic groups in [[Social Sciences]]. Google Scholar lists 1035 references to the EPR.&lt;ref&gt;Cederman, Lars-Erik, Wimmer, Andreas, &amp; Min, Brian. 2010. “[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/why-do-ethnic-groups-rebel-new-data-and-analysis/4F69AEFBD88FAADE63207FF7D1F69449 Why do ethnic groups rebel?

==EPR Dataset Family==
[[File:EPRdatasetfamily.jpg|thumb]]
In addition to ethnic power relations, the EPR dataset family includes information on ethnic groups’ settlement patterns, links to rebel organizations, transborder ethnic kin relations, ethnic [[refugee]] groups, and intraethnic cleavages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icr.ethz.ch/data/epr|title=Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) Dataset Family |access-date=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Expert survey==
The EPR data is composed on the basis of an online expert survey. Nearly one hundred country and regional experts were asked to identify the ethnic categories most salient for national politics in each country.

[[Evolution]] has been an important theme in fiction, including [[speculative evolution]] in [[science fiction]], since the late 19th century, though it began before [[Charles Darwin]]'s time, and reflects [[orthogenesis|progressionist]] and [[Lamarck]]ist views as well as Darwin's.&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stableford |first1=Brian M. |last2=Langford |first2=David R. | |title=Evolution |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/evolution |work=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |publisher=Gollancz |accessdate=24 July 2018 |date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darwinian evolution]] is pervasive in literature, whether taken optimistically in terms of how humanity may evolve towards perfection, or pessimistically in terms of the dire consequences of the interaction of human nature and the struggle for survival. Other themes include the replacement of humanity, either by other species or by [[intelligent machine]]s.

==Context==

[[Charles Darwin]]'s [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]], as set out in his 1859 ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', is the dominant theory in modern biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |last = Coyne |first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-923084-6 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evolution Resources |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] |year=2016 |url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/index.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603230514/http://www.nas.edu/evolution/index.html |archivedate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is accompanied as a philosophy and in fiction by two earlier evolutionary theories, progressionism ([[orthogenesis]]) and [[Lamarckism]].&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; Progressionism is the view that evolution is progress towards some goal of perfection, and that it is in some way directed towards that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruse |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |date=1996 |title=Monad to man: the Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03248-4 |pages=526–539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamarckism, a philosophy that long predates [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck]], is the view that evolution is guided by the inheritance of characteristics acquired by use or disuse during an animal's lifetime.&lt;ref name=Zirkle1935&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zirkle | first1=Conway | authorlink=Conway Zirkle | year=1935 | title=The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis| journal=[[The American Naturalist]] | volume=69 | issue=| pages=417–445 | doi=10.1086/280617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progressionism==
{{see|Orthogenesis}}

Ideas of progress and evolution were popular, long before Darwinism, in the 18th century, leading to [[Nicolas-Edme Rétif]]'s allegorical 1781 story ''{{ill|La découverte Australe par un homme volant|fr|La Découverte australe}}'' (The Southern Hemisphere Discovery by a Flying Man).&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; 

The evolutionary biologist Kayla M. Hardwick quotes from the 2013 film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', where the villain Faora states: "The fact that you possess a sense of morality, and we do not, gives us an evolutionary advantage. And if history has taught us anything, it is that evolution always wins." She points out that the idea that evolution wins is progressionist, while (she argues) the idea that evolution gives evil an advantage over the moral and good, driving the creation of formidable monsters, is a popular science fiction misconception.&lt;ref name=Hardwick2014&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hardwick |first1=Kayla M. |title=Natural selection at the movies: Only the bad guys evolve |url=https://nothinginbiology.org/2014/10/22/natural-selection-at-the-movies-only-the-bad-guys-evolve/ |website=Nothing in Biology Makes Sense [except in the light of evolution] |accessdate=24 July 2018 |date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardwick gives as examples of the evolution of "bad-guy traits" the [[Morlock]]s in [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1895 ''[[The Time Machine]]'', the bugs' [[caste (insect)|caste system]] in [[Robert Heinlein]]'s 1959 ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', and the effective colonisation by [[Don Siegel]]'s 1956 ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' aliens.&lt;ref name=Hardwick2014/&gt;

==Lamarckism==
{{see|Lamarckism}}

In French 19th century literature, evolutionary fantasy was Lamarckian, as seen in [[Camille Flammarion]]'s 1887 ''Lumen'' and his 1894 ''[[Omega: The Last Days of the World]]'', [[J.-H. Rosny]]'s 1887 ''Les Xipéhuz'' and his 1910 ''La mort de la terre'', and [[Jules Verne]]'s 1901 ''La grande forêt, le village aérien''. The Lamarckist philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s creative evolution driven by the supposed [[élan vital]] likely inspired [[J. D. Beresford]]'s English evolutionary fantasy, his 1911 ''[[The Hampdenshire Wonder]]''.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

==Darwinism==
[[File:Alvim-correa12.jpg|thumb|Illustration for a 1906 edition of [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1898 "[[The War of the Worlds]]" by [[Henrique Alvim Corréa]]]]
{{see|Speculative evolution}}

Darwin's version of evolution has been widely explored in fiction, both in fantasies and in imaginative explorations of its grimmer "[[survival of the fittest]]" effects, with much attention focused on possible human evolution. H. G. Wells's ''The Time Machine'' already mentioned, his 1896 ''[[The Island of Dr Moreau]]'', and his 1898 ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' all pessimistically explore the possible dire consequences of the darker sides of human nature in the struggle for survival.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; More broadly, [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1899 ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and [[R. L. Stevenson]]'s 1886 ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' portray Darwinian thinking in mainstream [[English literature]].&lt;ref name="NYT1986"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levine |first1=George |title=Darwin and the Evolution of Fiction |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/books/darwin-and-the-evolution-of-fiction.html |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] wrote an optimistic tale, ''The Last Judgement'', in the 1927 collection ''Possible Worlds''. This influenced [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s 1930 ''[[Last and First Men]]'', which portrays the many species that evolved from humans in a billion-year timeframe. A different take on Darwinism is the idea, popular from the 1950s onwards, that humans will evolve more or less godlike mental capacity, as in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1950 ''[[Childhood's End]]'' and [[Brian Aldiss]]'s 1959 ''[[Galaxies Like Grains of Sand]]''. Another science fiction theme is the replacement of humanity on Earth by other species or [[intelligent machine]]s. For instance, [[Olof Johannesson]]'s 1966 ''The Great Computer'' gives humans the role of enabling intelligent machines to evolve, while [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s 1985 ''Galapagos'' is one of several novels to depict a replacement species.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3161">'''"Genre-busting"''' is a term used occasionally in reviews of written work, music and visual art and refers to the author or artist's ability to cross over two or more established styles. For instance, in writing, to combine the horror [[genre]] with a [[Western (genre)|western]] or [[hard-boiled]] detective story with [[science fiction]]. In music the term may refer to a song combining styles or defying classification.

The sound of the term calls to mind other uses of "buster" such as "crime buster", "[[Gangbusters]]", "[[Ghostbusters]]", "[[No. 617 Squadron RAF|Dambusters]]", etc.

Creative people don't always feel comfortable working within an established category. So genre-busting within the publishing world has become a type of [[literary fiction]]. The publisher [[Atticus Books]] has gone so far as to declare, on their website: ''"We specialize in genre-busting literary fiction—i.e., titles that fall between the cracks of genre fiction and compelling narratives that feature memorable main characters."''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://atticusbooksonline.com/about |title=Atticus Books (about) |publisher=atticusbooksonline.com |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Video Movie Guide 1998'' stated in its foreword, "In past years, reviews in VMG have been broken down into genre categories. Now, by popular demand, we are listing all movies together in alphabetical order.... So many movies today mix genres... and there are no clear-cut categories anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Mick|last2=Porter|first2=Marsha|title=Video Movie Guide 1998|date=October 1997|isbn=978-0345424235|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewed in ''Mustard'' comedy magazine in 2005, writer [[Alan Moore]] said: "I mean, this is probably a bad thing to say to someone from a comedy magazine, but I don't like genre. I think that genre was made up by some spotty clerk in [[WH Smiths]] in the 1920s to make his worthless fucking job a little easier for him: "it'd be easier if these books said what they were about on the spine."" going on to say: "In the novel I'm writing, Jerusalem, there's an awful lot of funny stuff, and there's supernatural stuff; there's stuff in the prologue that's as good as [[Stephen King]] and it's just a description of my brother walking through a block of flats. It's horror. And there's social history, there's political stuff. Why not mix it all together? Because that's what life is actually like. We laugh, we cry, you know, we buy the t-shirt." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.mustardweb.org/04/page15.htm |title=The Mustard Interview |publisher=mustardweb.org |date=January 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Germanische Altertumskunde Online''''', formerly called '''''Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde''''', is a German encyclopedia of the study of Germanic history and cultures, as well as the cultures that were in close contact with them.

The first edition of the ''Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde'' appeared in four volumes between 1911 and 1919, edited by [[Johannes Hoops]]. The second edition, under the auspices of the [[Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities]], was edited by [[Heinrich Beck (Germanist)|Heinrich Beck]] (from vol 1, 1968/72), [[Heiko Steuer]] (from vol. 8, 1991/94), Rosemarie Müller (from 1992), and [[Dieter Geuenich]] (from vol. 13, 1999), and was published by [[Walter de Gruyter]] between 1969 and 2008.

In 2010, the most recent version was published, now renamed ''Germanische Altertumskunde Online''. Edited by Heinrich Beck, [[Sebastian Brather]], [[Dieter Geuenich]], [[Wilhelm Heizmann]], [[Steffen Patzold]], and [[Heiko Steuer]], it is published online by De Gruyter, accessible via subscription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.degruyter.com/databasecontent?dbid=gao&amp;dbsource=%2Fdb%2Fgao degruyter.com: ''Germanische Altertumskunde Online'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Goseck, a [[monastery]] built on the foundations of a [[castle]], as well as the [[vineyard]] of Dechantenberg is located in the municipality of Goseck of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in [[Germany]]. It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]] is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called “[[Landesausbau]]”  and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== World Heritage Nomination ==
Goseck and its vineyard is one of the eleven components of the cultural landscape [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]]. Together with the agricultural features on the northern slopes of the Saale and the sandstone quarries used for the building of the monastery, this ensemble conveys the different forms of land use of the [[medieval]] monastery structures.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1.{{cite book|title=Nominations to the World Heritage List (Krakow, 2017).|publisher= UNESCO press|page=54|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History == 
[[File:Vineyard Steinmeister.jpg|thumb|Vineyard Steinmeister]]
Goseck Castle was part of a network of [[Franks|Frankish]] [[castles]] on the [[Saale]] River. It was founded around the year 800. The counts of Goseck were one of the noblest aristocratic families of the empire in the [[10th Century in Germany|10th]] and [[11th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Pfalzgrafen von Sachsen bis zum Jahre 1088. ''In:'' Braunschweigisches Jahrbuch 36.|trans-title= The palsgraves of Saxony until the year 1088.''In:'' Yearbook of Braunschweig 36.|page=24–52|author=Starke, Heinz-Dieter|publisher=City of Braunschweig|date=1955|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Count Frederick I of Goseck had his center of power in Goseck . In 1041, Adalbert (archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen from 1043) founded a [[Benedictine monastery]] in the eastern part of the noble castle of Goseck. The minster was erected in 1046.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Burg, Kloster und Schloss Goseck. Zum Stand der baugeschichtlichen Erforschung. ''In:'' Denkmalpﬂege in Sachsen-Anhalt 7 |trans-title=Castle, monastery and palace Goseck. Research on the building history. In: Preservation of historical monuments in Saxony-Anhalt 7.|page=1–30|author=Schmitt, Reinhard|publisher=Saxony-Anhalt|date=1999|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
It is situated 9 kilometers northeast of Naumburg across the Saale Valley on the opposite bank. This monastery of the 11th century is a preserved and documented structure of the High Middle Ages. It was built to be visible from afar, offering lines of sight to most of the monuments in the nominated areas.

== Architecture ==
The [[crypt]] and [[choir]] of the monastery church display the very best of [[Salian]] architecture. Goseck is an example for the transformation of a noble family’s hereditary seat into a monastery with dynastic memorial tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quellen zur Geschichte und Baugeschichte von Burg, Kloster und Schloss Goseck. ''In:'' Saale-Unstrut-Jahrbuch 4. |trans-title=Sources on history and building history of the castle, monastery and palace Goseck. In: Yearbook of Saale-Unstrut 4.|page=28–43|author=Schmitt, Reinhard|publisher=Saxony-Anhalt|date=1999|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viniculture ==
In the chronicles of the Benedictines of the Goseck monastery the terraced vineyard below the site is dated back to the year 1093; it is the oldest vineyard in continuous use in the nominated region. The Dechantenberg vineyard is exposed to the south.  


== Today == 
 
Around 1540, the monastery was secularized. Since 1997, Goseck is owned by the »Landesstiftung Dome und Schlösser Sachsen-Anhalt«, a state foundation endowed by the State of Saxony-Anhalt . Today, a European Centre for Music and Culture (“Europäisches Musik und Kulturzentrum”) resides in Goseck and offers a range of cultural activities.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For further information: http://www.dome-schloesser.de/.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5140">'''Hierarchy of death''' is a phrase used by journalists, social scientists, and academics to describe disproportionate amounts of media attention paid to various incidents of death around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Keating |first=Joshua |date=2013-04-22 |title=Is it wrong to care more about 4 deaths in Boston than 80 in Syria? |publisher=Ideas.foreignpolicy.com |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/22/is-it-wrong-to-care-more-about-4-deaths-in-boston-than-80-in-syria/ |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Definitions of the hierarchy of death vary, but several themes remain consistent in terms of media coverage: domestic deaths trump foreign deaths, deaths in the [[developed world]] trump deaths in the [[developing world]], deaths of whites trump deaths of darker skinned people, and deaths in ongoing conflicts garner relatively little media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenslade |first=Roy |date=2007-04-19 |title=A hierarchy of death |publisher=Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/19/thirtytwodieinamericanuniv |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Karpf |first=Anne |date=2001-11-28 |title=Anne Karpf: The hierarchy of death |publisher=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/28/september11.usa |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldberg |first=Jeffrey |date=July 23, 2014 |title=Obsessing About Gaza, Ignoring Syria (And Most Everything Else) |publisher=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/obsessing-about-gaza-ignoring-syria-and-most-everything-else/374898/ |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=R.

==Commentary==
British media commentator [[Roy Greenslade]] has been credited with coining the term while writing on the newsworthiness of those who died during [[The Troubles]]. Greenslade continues to critique the phenomenon, including media reactions to the [[Boston Marathon bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 30, 2011 |title=Sian murder says a lot about media's values |publisher=London Evening Standard |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/markets/sian-murder-says-a-lot-about-medias-values-6386595.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bostonbombings&gt;{{cite web |date=April 24, 2013 |title=The hierarchy of death: Boston's bombings shock us more than the silent drone war in Pakistan.

[[NPR]] discussed the disparity in media coverage between the [[2015 Beirut bombings]] and the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]], which happened with a day of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/11/paris-beirut-media-coverage/416457/|title=Paris, Beirut, and the Language Used to Describe Terrorism|last=Ajaka|first=Nadine|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/11/17/456317759/is-there-a-hierarchy-of-the-importance-of-death-in-the-news-business|title=Is There A Hierarchy Of The Importance Of Death In The News Business?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High culture''' encompasses the [[culture|cultural products]] of aesthetic value, which a society collectively esteem as exemplary [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Raymond. ''Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society'' (1983) Rev. Ed. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also include intellectual works considered to be of supreme philosophical, historical, or literary value, as well as the education which cultivates such aesthetic and intellectual pursuits. In popular usage, the term ''high culture'' identifies the culture of an [[upper class]] (an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]]) or of a [[status class]] (the [[intelligentsia]]); and also identifies a society’s common repository of broad-range knowledge and tradition (e.g. folk culture) that transcends the social-class system of the society. Sociologically, the term ''high culture'' is contrasted with the term ''[[low culture]]'', the forms of [[popular culture]] characteristic of the less-educated social classes, such as the [[barbarians]], the [[Philistinism|Philistines]], and ''[[hoi polloi]]'' (the masses).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7uMOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68 |year=1989 |title=Edging Women Out: Victorian Novelists, Publishers and Social Change |isbn=978-0-415-03767-9 |author=Gaye Tuchman, Nina E.

==Concept==
{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2016}}
;Definition
In European history, '''high culture''' was understood as a cultural concept common to the humanities, until the mid-19th century, when [[Matthew Arnold]] introduced the term ''high culture'' in the book ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'' (1869). The Preface defines [[culture]] as "the disinterested endeavour after man’s perfection" pursued, obtained, and achieved by effort to "know the best that has been said and thought in the world." Such a literary definition of high culture also comprehends [[philosophy]]. Moreover, the philosophy of aesthetics proposed in high culture is a force for moral and political good. Critically, the term "high culture" is contrasted with the terms "[[popular culture]]" and "[[mass culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Volume 1. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Notes Towards the Definition of Culture'' (1948), [[T. S. Eliot]] said that high culture and popular culture are necessary and complementary parts of the culture of a society. In ''[[The Uses of Literacy]]'' (1957), [[Richard Hoggart]] presents the sociologic experience of the working-class man and woman in acquiring the cultural literacy, at university, which facilitates social upward mobility. In the U.S., [[Harold Bloom]] and [[F. R. Leavis]] pursued the definition of high culture, by way of the [[Western canon]] of literature.
[[File:TS Eliot.jpg|thumb|T. S. Eliot]]

Media theorist [[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]] writes that, unlike popular culture, "the classics—and soon to be classics—are" in their own right descriptions and explanations of the cultural systems that produced them." He says that "a crucial way in which mass culture differs from high art" is that individual works of mass culture are less interesting than the broader cultural trends which produced them.&lt;ref name="Johnson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Johnson|title=Everything Bad is Good for You: How Popular Culture is Making Us Smarter|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2CVF7E3hpn4C&amp;q=classics|date=6 April 2006|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193312-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History of high culture in the West'''

The high culture of the [[Western culture|West]] originated in the classical-world traditions of intellectual and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] life in [[Ancient Greece]] (from c. 8th century BC – AD 147) and [[Ancient Rome]] (753 BC – AD 476). In the classical [[Greco-Roman]] tradition, the ideal mode of language was published and preserved in works of elevated style (correct grammar, syntax, and diction). Certain forms of language used by authors in valorized epochs were held up in antiquity and the Renaissance as eternal valid models and normative standards of excellence; e.g. the Attic dialect of ancient Greek spoken and written by the playwrights and philosophers of Periclean Athens (fifth century BC); and the form of classical Latin used in the "Golden Age" of Roman culture (c. 70 B.C. - AD 18) represented by such figures as Cicero and Virgil.This form of education was known to the Greeks as παιδεία, which was translated by the Romans into Latin as ''humanitas'' &lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius. Attic Nights 13:17 http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/gellius/13*.html&lt;/ref&gt;'since it reflected a form of education aiming at the refinement of human nature, rather than the acquisition of technical or vocational skills. Indeed, the Greco-Roman world tended to see such manual, commercial, and technical labor as subordinate to purely intellectual activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''De Officiis''. 150 – http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0048%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D150&lt;/ref&gt; From the idea of the "free" man with sufficient leisure to pursue such intellectual and aesthetic refinement, arose the classical distinction between the "liberal" arts which are intellectual and done for their own sake, as against the "servile"or "mechanical" arts which were associated with manual labor and done to earn a living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/art4.htm|title=Jacques Maritain Center: Art and Scholasticism 4|website=maritain.nd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This implied an association between high culture and the upper classes whose inherited wealth provided such time for intellectual cultivation. The leisured gentleman not weighed down by the necessity of earning a living, was free to devote himself to activities proper to such a "free man"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_88|title=Moral letters to Lucilius|last=Seneca|publisher=|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; – those deemed to involve true excellence and nobility as opposed to mere utility.
 
During the Renaissance, the classical intellectual values of the fully rediscovered Græco–Roman culture were the cultural capital of the upper classes(and the aspiring), and aimed at the complete development of human intellectual, aesthetic, and moral faculties. This ideal associated with humanism (a later term derived from the humanities or ''studia humanitatis''), was communicated in Renaissance Italy through institutions such as the Renaissance court schools. Renaissance humanism soon spread through Europe becoming much of the basis of upper class education for centuries. For the socially ambitious man and woman who means to rise in society, ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' (1528), by [[Baldasare Castiglione]], instructs the reader to acquire and possess knowledge of the Græco–Roman Classics, being education integral to the social-persona of the [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]]. A key contribution of the Renaissance was the elevation of painting and sculpture to a status equal to the liberal arts (hence the visual arts lost for elites any lingering negative association with manual artisanship.) The early Renaissance treatises of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] were instrumental in this regard.

The evolution of the concept of high culture initially was defined in educational terms largely as critical study and knowledge of the Græco–Roman arts and [[humanities]] which furnished much of the foundation for [[European culture|European cultures]] and societies. However, aristocratic patronage through most of the modern era was also pivotal to the support and creation of new works of high culture across the range of arts, music, and literature. The subsequent prodigious development of the modern European languages and cultures meant that the modern definition of the term "high culture" embraces not only Greek and Latin texts, but a much broader canon of select literary, philosophical, historical, and scientific books in both ancient and modern languages. Of comparable importance are those works of art and music considered to be of the highest excellence and broadest influence (e.g. the Parthenon, the painting and sculpture of Michelangelo, the music of Mozart, etc). Together these texts and art works constitute the exemplary artifacts representing the high culture of the Western world. 
 
;Cultural traditions
In the Western and some East Asian traditions, art that demonstrates the imagination of the artist is accorded the status of high art. In the West this tradition began in Ancient Greece, was reinforced in the [[Renaissance]], and by [[Romanticism]], which eliminated the [[hierarchy of genres]] within the [[fine arts]], which was established in the Renaissance. In China there was a distinction between the [[literati painting]] by the [[scholar-official]]s and the work produced by common artists, working in largely different styles, or the decorative arts such as [[Chinese porcelain]] which were produced by unknown craftsmen working in large factories. In both China and the West the distinction was especially clear in [[landscape painting]], where for centuries imaginary views, produced from the imagination of the artist, were considered superior works.

;Cultural capital
In socially-stratified Europe and the Americas, a first-hand immersion to the high culture of the West, the [[Grand Tour|Grand Tour of Europe]], was a rite of passage that complemented and completed the book education of a [[gentleman]], from the nobility, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie, with a worldly perspective of society and civilisation. The post-university tour of the cultural centres of Europe was a social-class benefit of the [[cultural capital]] transmitted through the high-status institutions (schools, academies, universities) meant to produce the ideal gentleman of that society. 

The European concept of high culture included cultivation of refined etiquette and manners; the education of taste in the fine arts such as sculpture and painting; an appreciation of classical music and opera in its diverse history and myriad forms; knowledge of the humane letters (''literae humaniores'') represented by the best Greek and Latin authors, and more broadly of the liberal arts traditions (e.g. philosophy, history, drama, rhetoric, and poetry) of Western civilisation, as well as a general acquaintance with important concepts in theology, science, and political thought.

==High art==
[[File:The MET.jpg|thumb|The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], on [[Fifth Avenue]]]]
Much of high culture consists of the appreciation of what is sometimes called "high art". This term is rather broader than Arnold's definition and besides [[literature]] includes music, [[visual arts]] (especially [[painting]]), and traditional forms of the [[performing arts]] (including some [[film|cinema]]). The [[decorative art]]s would not generally be considered high art.&lt;ref&gt;Dormer, Peter (ed.), ''The Culture of Craft'', 1997, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0719046181}}, 9780719046186, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wSZASV70krMC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;lpg=PT66 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural products most often regarded as forming part of high culture are most likely to have been produced during periods of high [[civilization]], for which a large, [[sophistication|sophisticated]], and wealthy urban-based society provides a coherent and conscious aesthetic framework, and a large-scale milieu of training, and, for the [[visual arts]], sourcing materials and financing work. Such an environment enables artists, as near as possible, to realize their creative potential with as few as possible practical and technical constraints. Although the Western concept of high culture naturally concentrates on the Greco-Roman tradition, and its resumption from the [[Renaissance]] onwards, such conditions existed in other places at other times.

==Art music==
{{main|Art music}}
[[Art music]] (or serious music&lt;ref&gt;a b "Music" in Encyclopedia Americana, reprint 1993, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt; or erudite music) is an [[umbrella term]] used to refer to musical traditions implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition.&lt;ref name="DenisArnold"&gt;
Denis Arnold, "Art Music, Art Song", in The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J, (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111. {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of art music is a frequent and well-defined musicological distinction – musicologist Philip Tagg, for example, refers to art music as one of an "axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics". He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria, with high cultural music often performed to an audience whilst folk music would traditionally be more participatory.&lt;ref&gt;
Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", Popular Music 2 (1982): 41.
&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, "art music" frequently occurs as a contrasting term to "popular music" and to "traditional" or "folk music".&lt;ref name="DenisArnold" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Music" in ''Encyclopedia Americana'', reprint 1993, p. 647
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", ''Popular Music 2'' (1982): 37–67, here 41–42.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art film==
{{main|Art film}}
[[Art film]] is the result of [[filmmaking]] which is typically a serious, [[independent film]] aimed at a [[niche market]] rather than a [[mass market]] [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Art film definition – Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKfOywe?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critics and [[film studies]] scholars typically define an "art film" using a "...canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films",&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Wilinsky. {{Google books|id=0CDEQ6AEwAA|title=Sure Seaters: The Emergence of Art House Cinema}}. University of Minnesota, 2001 (Commerce and Mass Culture Series). See also review in {{Google books|id=gPMKAQAAMAAJ|page=171|Volume 32|text=canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films}}, ''[[Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television]]'', 2004. Retrieved 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; which includes, among other elements: a [[social realism]] style; an emphasis on the authorial expressivity of the director or writer; and a focus on the thoughts and dreams of characters, rather than presenting a clear, goal-driven story. According to the film scholar [[David Bordwell]], "art cinema itself is a [[film genre]], with its own distinct conventions."&lt;ref&gt;Keith, Barry. ''Film Genres: From Iconography to Ideology''. Wallflower Press: 2007. (page 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion of high culture==
[[File:The Ballet Rambert Visiting An Aircraft Factory in Britain TR969.jpg|thumb|right|Dancers from the [[Ballet Rambert]], under the auspices of CEMA, a government programme, perform ''[[Peter and The Wolf]]'' at an aircraft factory in the English Midlands during World War II.]]
The term has always been susceptible to attack for [[elitism]], and, in response, many proponents of the concept devoted great efforts to promoting high culture among a wider public than the highly educated [[bourgeoisie]] whose natural territory it was supposed to be. There was a drive, beginning in the 19th century, to open [[museum]]s and [[concert hall]]s to give the general public access to high culture. Figures such as [[John Ruskin]] and [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Lord Reith]] of the BBC in Britain, [[Leon Trotsky]] and others in Communist [[Russia]], and many others in America and throughout the western world have worked to widen the appeal of elements of high culture such as [[classical music]], art by [[old master]]s and the [[classic literature|literary classics]].

With the widening of access to university education, the effort spread there, and all aspects of high culture became the objects of academic study, which with the exception of the [[Classical studies|classics]] had not often been the case until the late 19th century. University [[liberal arts]] courses still play an important role in the promotion of the concept of high culture, though often now avoiding the term itself.

Especially in Europe, governments have been prepared to subsidize high culture through the funding of [[museum]]s, [[opera]] and [[ballet]] companies, [[orchestra]]s, cinema, public [[broadcasting]] stations such as [[BBC Radio 3]], [[Arte|ARTE]], and in other ways. Organizations such as the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], and in most European countries, whole ministries administer these programs. This includes the subsidy of new works by composers, writers and artists. There are also many private philanthropic sources of funding, which are especially important in the US, where the federally funded [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] also funds broadcasting. These may be seen as part of the broader concept of [[official culture]], although often a mass audience is not the intended market.

==Theories of high culture==
[[File:Ernest Renan 1876-84.jpg|thumb|[[Ernest Renan]] ([[Antoine Samuel Adam-Salomon]], 1870s)]]

The relations between high culture and mass culture are concerns of [[cultural studies]],  [[media studies]], and [[critical theory]], [[sociology]], [[Postmodernism]] and [[Marxist philosophy]]. In the essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1936), [[Walter Benjamin]] explored the relations of value of the arts (high and mass) when subjected to industrial reproduction. The critical theoreticians [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]] interpreted the high-art and mass-art cultural relations as an instrument of social control, with which the [[ruling class]] maintain their [[cultural hegemony]] upon society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = McGregor| first = Craig| authorlink =| title = Class in Australia | edition=1| year=1997| publisher  = Penguin Books Australia Ltd| location=Ringwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-14-008227-2| page = 301| quote= Élite culture is often an instrument of social control. . . .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Orientalist [[Ernest Renan]] and for the rationalist philosopher [[Ernest Gellner]], high culture was conceptually integral to the politics and ideology of [[nationalism]], as a requisite part of a healthy national identity. Gellner expanded the conceptual scope of the phrase in ''Nations and Nationalism'' (1983) stating that high art is "a literate, codified culture, which permits context-free communication" among cultures.

In ''[[La Distinction|Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste]]'' (1979), the sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] proposed that æsthetic taste (cultural judgement), derived from social class, in establishing definitions of high art by the practice of human activities such as [[etiquette|social etiquette]], [[gastronomy]], [[oenology]], [[military service]]. That in such activities of aesthetic judgement, the ruling-class person uses social codes unknown to middle- and the lower-class persons in the pursuit and practice activities of taste.

'''Human uses of birds''' have included both economic uses such as food and symbolic uses such as art, music and religion, for thousands of years.

In terms of economic uses, birds have been hunted for food since [[Palaeolithic]] times. They have been captured and bred as [[poultry]] to provide meat and eggs since at least the time of ancient Egypt. Some species have been used, too, to help locate or to catch food, as with [[cormorant fishing]] and the use of [[greater honeyguide|honeyguides]]. Feathers have long been used for bedding, as well as for [[quill pen]]s and for [[Fletching|fletching arrows]].
Today, many species face [[habitat loss]] and other threats caused by humans; [[bird conservation]] groups work to protect birds and to influence governments to do so.

Birds have appeared in the mythologies and religions of many cultures since ancient [[Sumer]]. For example, the dove was the symbol of the ancient [[Mesopotamian goddess]] [[Inanna]], the [[Canaan]]ite mother goddess [[Asherah]], and the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]]. [[Athena]], the Greek goddess of wisdom, had a [[little owl]] as her symbol, and, in ancient India, the [[peacock]] represented [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]]. Birds have often been seen as symbols, whether bringing bad luck and death, being sacred, or being used in [[heraldry]]. 
In terms of entertainment, [[Bird of prey|raptors]] have been used in [[falconry]], while [[aviculture|cagebirds]] have been kept for their [[bird vocalization|song]]. Other birds have been raised for the traditional sports of [[cockfight]]ing and [[pigeon racing]]. [[Birdwatching]], too, has grown to become a major leisure activity.
Birds feature in a wide variety of art forms, including in [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[poetry]] and [[prose]], [[film]] and [[fashion]]. [[Birds in music|Birds also appear in music]] as well as traditional [[dance]] and [[ballet]]. In certain cases, such as the [[bird-and-flower painting]] of China, birds are central to an artistic genre.

==Context==

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by birds in human culture, so defined.

==Economic uses==

Birds are important economically, providing substantial amounts of food, especially protein, largely but not exclusively from the domestic chicken;&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt;&lt;ref name=CIWF/&gt; feathers and down are used for bedding, insulation, and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sheikh |first1=Farhan |title=Poultry feathers-how many ways they can be used for? |url=http://thepoultryguide.com/uses-of-chicken-feathers/ |website=The Poultry Guide |date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As food===

[[File:Egyptian - Vase in the Shape of a Duck - Walters 48421 - Profile.jpg|thumb|left|Ducks were common in [[Ancient Egypt]], as depicted in this 3rd century BC [[faience]] vase.]]

[[Birds]] were among the wild animals hunted for food before the [[Neolithic revolution]] and the development of agriculture. For example, in the [[Epipaleolithic]] of the [[Levant]], between c. 14,500 and 11,500 BP, both [[waterfowl]] and [[bird migration|migratory birds]] were eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cummings |first1=Vicki |last2=Jordan |first2=Peter |last3=Zvelebil |first3=Marek|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology and Anthropology of Hunter-Gatherers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nl2yAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT239 |year=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-102526-6 |page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have studied the return in terms of energy from captured food compared to the energy expended to capture it; birds provide a smaller return than larger game such as deer, but better than many plant materials. For example, waterfowl captured in a drive can yield a return of around 2,000 kcal/hour, whereas an antelope can yield as much as 31,000 kcal/hour, and wild rye around 1,000 kcal/hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly, Robert L. |title=The Lifeways of Hunter-Gatherers: The Foraging Spectrum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDAWBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53 |year=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-02487-8 |pages=53–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battery hens -Bastos, Sao Paulo, Brazil-31March2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Battery hens: [[poultry]] is a major source of food, the [[chicken]] alone providing 20% of the world's animal protein.&lt;ref name=Poultry/&gt;]]

Birds have been [[domestication|domesticated]] and bred as [[poultry]] for use as food for at least four thousand years. The most important species is the [[chicken]]. It appears to have been domesticated by 5000 BC in northeastern China, likely for cockfighting, and only later used for food.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Chicken Conquered the World |author1=Adler, Jerry |author2=Lawler, Andrew |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/ |newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine |date=June 1, 2012 |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Egypt]], poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and then bred in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1998 |author=Manuelian, Peter der |title=Egypt: The World of the Pharaohs |location=Cologne, Germany|publisher=Könemann |isbn=3-89508-913-3 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicken now provides some 20% of the animal protein eaten by the world's human population in the form of meat and [[egg]]s. [[Poultry farming|Chickens are often raised intensively]] in [[battery farm]]s; this facilitates production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds.&lt;ref name=CIWF&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ciwf.org.uk/farm-animals/chickens/egg-laying-hens/ |title=About egg laying hens |publisher=Compassion in World Farming |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species including [[ducks]], [[geese]], [[pheasants]], [[guineafowl]] and [[turkeys]] are significant economically around the world.&lt;ref name=Poultry&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Poultry |url=http://www.poultryclub.org/poultry/history-of-poultry/ |publisher=The Poultry Club of Great Britain |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less commonly raised species such as the [[ostrich]] are starting to be farmed for their meat, which is low in [[cholesterol]]; they have also been kept for their feathers, and for leather from their skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shanawany |first1=M.

Birds are hunted in many countries around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as [[mallard]], [[wigeon]], [[shoveler]] and [[teal]] have for centuries been captured by [[waterfowl hunting|wildfowlers]], while pheasants, [[partridges]], [[driven grouse shooting|grouse]], and [[snipe]] are among the terrestrial birds that are [[hunting|hunted]] for sport, generally with guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marchington |first1=John |title=History of Wildfowling |date=1980 |publisher=A &amp; C Black |isbn=978-0-713-62053-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other parts of the world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where [[cassowaries]], [[crowned pigeon]]s, [[hornbill]]s and [[megapode]]s are captured for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pangau-Adam |first1=Margaretha |last2=Noske |first2=Richard |editor1-last=Tideman |editor1-first=Sonia |editor2-last=Gosler |editor2-first=Andrew |title=Wildlife Hunting and Bird Trade in Northern Papua (Irian Jaya), Indonesia |work=Aboriginal stories: The riches and colour of Australian birds |date=2010 |publisher=Earthscan|pages=74–85 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim_Whiteside/publication/236596667_Aboriginal_stories_The_riches_and_colour_of_Australian_birds/links/0046352d335d8135ea000000/Aboriginal-stories-The-riches-and-colour-of-Australian-birds.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seabird]]s such as [[Muttonbirding|muttonbirds]], [[penguin]]s and [[auks]] have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the [[great auk]], extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Simeone, A.  |author2=Navarro, X. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Human exploitation of seabirds in coastal southern Chile during the mid-Holocene |journal=Rev.

[[Aviculture|Cagebirds]] such as [[domestic canary|canaries]], [[budgerigars]], [[cockatoo]]s, [[lovebird]]s, [[quail]]s, [[finch]]es, and [[parrot]]s are popular [[pet]]s, whether for their song, their behaviour, their colourful plumage, or their [[talking bird|ability to mimic speech]].

The nature writers Mark Cocker and [[Richard Mabey]], reviewing people's love of birds, observe that people are touched by feelings for birds in a variety of ways, such as enjoying the [[northern lapwing|lapwing's]] "joyous display",&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cocker |first1=Mark |last2=Mabey |first2=Richard |author2link=Richard Mabey |title=Birds Britannica |titlelink=Birds Britannica |date=2005 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |isbn=0-7011-6907-9 |pages=ix–x, 436–437 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "beauty and mystery" of the [[tawny owl]]'s call on a cold winter's night.&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; They argue that people feel the simple companionship of birds, are inspired by them to create art, let them mark the seasons and provide a sense of place, and use them "as symbols of joy and love".&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; A former statesman, [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon]], was able to express his feeling for birds in his 1927 book ''The Charm of Birds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Grey, Edward |authorlink1=Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon |title=The Charm of Birds |date=1927 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such feelings, in turn, have stimulated the intention to conserve birds and their habitats.&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; Around the same time as Grey was writing, the first conservation organisations were coming into being, starting in Britain, triggered by the rapid disappearance of familiar species as they were captured for their feathers or for food.&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; A substantial folklore rich in symbolism has accrued around birds; it was documented early in the 20th century as something that was already fading from memory. For example, the [[house sparrow]] has been associated with "sex and lechery"&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; since ancient Egypt, where libidinousness was written with the sparrow hieroglyph. In the same vein, in the classical era the sparrow was sacred to the goddess of love, [[Aphrodite]] or [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]]; the sparrow features in an erotic poem by Catullus for the same reason. [[Chaucer]] describes the summoner in his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' as being as "lecherous as a sparwe".&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ingersoll |first1=Ernest |title=Birds in Legend, Fable, and Folklore |date=1923 |publisher=Longmans Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong |first1=Edward A. |title=The Folklore of Birds|date=1958 |publisher=Collins ([[New Naturalist]] series)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown how important birds are to individual societies, touching on all aspects of life. In Andean societies such as the [[Moche culture|Moche]] (1–800 AD), [[Nazca people|Nazca]] (100–700 AD) and [[Chimu]] (1150–1450 AD), bright parrot and macaw feathers were traded from the Amazon rainforest to the mountains and the Pacific coast, while guano was collected as a fertiliser, and artists and craftsmen were inspired to create textiles, metal jewellery, and ceramics depicting condors, cormorants, ducks, hummingbirds, owls, vultures, and waders. Their religions, too, endowed birds with symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Birds of the Andes |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bird/hd_bird.htm |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Medieval Christian iconography, the [[cormorant]]'s "wing-drying" pose represents the Christian cross, and hence is a figure of Christ.

====Poetry====

Birds have been celebrated in [[poetry]] since ancient times, when for example the Roman poet [[Catullus]] wrote in one of his most famous works about a girl and her pet [[sparrow]] in ''[[Catullus 2|Passer, deliciae meae puellae]]'', "Sparrow, delight of my girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Phillimore, J.S. |title=Passer: Catull.

Birds featured in medieval poetry, for example forming the characters of the 1177 Persian poem ''[[The Conference of the Birds]]'', where the birds of the world assemble under the wisest bird, the [[hoopoe]], to decide who is to be their king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Conference of the Birds |author=Attar, Farid al-Din |authorlink=Farid al-Din Attar |editor1=Darbandi, Afkham |editor2=Davis, Dick |publisher=Penguin Classics |date=1984 |isbn=978-0-14-044434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, birds have appeared in books illustrated by some exceptional artists, producing images that were accurate and beautiful, and that made use of the latest available printing techniques. The [[wood engraver]] [[Thomas Bewick]]'s 1797–1804 ''[[A History of British Birds]]'' brought affordable illustrations to the public for the first time, and the book formed in effect the first [[field guide]] to birds,&lt;ref name=Uglow&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/oct/14/art.biography | agency=[[The Guardian]] | title=Small wonders | date=14 October 2006 | accessdate=12 January 2013 | author=Uglow, Jenny |authorlink=Jenny Uglow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcastle"&gt;{{cite web|title=1st December – The Partridge|url=https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/speccoll/tag/thomas-bewick/|publisher=Newcastle University|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[John James Audubon]]'s enormous&lt;ref&gt;The first [[Book size|double elephant folio]] edition was 39.5 inches high by 28.5 inches wide. {{cite web |url=http://minniesland.com/prints/audubon_folio_birds_havell.htm |title=Prints: Audubon's Folio Birds Havell Edition (1827-1838) |publisher=minniesland.com |accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and impressive images of birds in his 1827–1838 ''[[Birds of America (book)|Birds of America]]'' are among the most admired by art critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smart |first1=Alastair |title=The best birds in art |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/10816680/The-best-birds-in-art.html |accessdate=22 April 2016 |agency=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by collectors: early editions fetch among the highest prices paid for any printed books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/12/books | work=The Economist | title=Book value | date=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ornithologist [[John Gould]]'s bird illustrations, in books such as ''A Century of Birds hitherto unfigured from the Himalaya Mountains'' (1830–1833) with 80 plates, and his 7-volume ''The Birds of Australia'' (1840–1848) with 600 plates, related directly to his research, were both beautiful and scientifically useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Karen S.|title=John Gould: Bird Illustration in the Age of Darwin|url=https://exhibits.lib.ku.edu/exhibits/show/gould/about/kucollections|publisher=University of Kansas Gould Collections|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds are popular characters in children's books, which are often handsomely illustrated. [[Beatrix Potter]]'s 1908 ''[[The Tale of Jemima Puddle-duck]]'' created an enduringly popular bird heroine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Taylor, Judy |year=1996 |origyear=1986 |title=Beatrix Potter: Artist, Storyteller and Countrywoman |publisher=Frederick Warne |isbn=0-7232-4175-9 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors followed with many bird characters in books for children of different ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lewis |first1=Gill |title=Gill Lewis's top 10 birds in books |url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jul/31/top-ten-birds-childrens-books-gill-lewis |work=The Guardian |date=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In books for adults, birds may have symbolic or psychological significance. For instance, [[Paul Gallico]]'s 1940 ''[[The Snow Goose: A Story of Dunkirk]]'' was a parable about the regenerative power of friendship in wartime; the goose symbolises both the hero, Rhayader, a wounded artist, and the world wounded by war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/19/winter-reads-snow-goose-paul-gallico |author=Allardice, Lisa |title=Winter reads: The Snow Goose by Paul Gallico |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. H. White]]'s 1951 ''The Goshawk'' describes the author's "monstrous and often cruel battles" to train his bird of prey, while [[Helen Macdonald (writer)|Helen Macdonald]]'s 2014 ''[[H is for Hawk]]'', which references White's book, tells how her obsession with the same species as a falconer helped her through the loss of her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cooke |first1=Rachel |title=H is for Hawk review – Helen Macdonald's taming of a goshawk called Mabel reads like a thriller |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/h-is-for-hawk-review-helen-macdonald-taming-goshawk-mabel |work=The Guardian |date=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music====

[[File:Léon Bakst 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Ballerina in ''[[The Firebird]]'' by [[Léon Bakst]], 1910]]

[[Birds in music|In music]], [[birdsong]] has influenced composers and musicians in several ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and [[Beethoven]] did, along with many later composers; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, first seen in the work of [[Ottorino Respighi]]; or as [[Beatrice Harrison]] did in 1924 with a [[nightingale]], and [[David Rothenberg]] did in 2000 with a [[laughingthrush]], they can duet with birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Head, Matthew |title=Birdsong and the Origins of Music |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |volume=122 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.1093/jrma/122.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clark, Suzannah |year=2001 |title=Music Theory and Natural Order from the Renaissance to the Early Twentieth Century |journal=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-77191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ledger&gt;{{cite news |last=Reich |first=Ronni |title=NJIT professor finds nothing cuckoo in serenading our feathered friends |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2010/10/njit_professor_finds_nothing_c.html |accessdate=19 June 2011 |newspaper=Star Ledger |date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two groups of scientists, namely Luis Felipe Baptista and Robin A. Keister in 2005, and Adam Tierney and colleagues in 2011, have argued that [[birdsong]] has a similar structure to music. Baptista and Keister argue that the way birds use variations of [[rhythm]], relationships of [[musical pitch]], and combinations of [[musical note|note]]s is somewhat musical, perhaps because some birds exploit variation in song to avoid monotony, or [[mimicry|mimic]] other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baptista |first1=Luis Felipe |last2=Keister |first2=Robin A. |title=Why Birdsong is Sometimes Like Music |journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine |date=2005 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=426–443 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2005.0066 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/185549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tierney argues that the similar motor constraints on human and avian song drive these to have similar song structures, including "arch-shaped and descending melodic contours in musical phrases", long notes at the ends of phrases, and typically small differences in pitch between adjacent notes.&lt;ref name=Tierney&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tierney |first1=Adam T. |last2=Russo |first2=Frank A. |last3=Patel |first3=Aniruddh D. |title=The motor origins of human and avian song structure |journal=PNAS |date=2011 |volume=108 |issue=37 |pages=15510–15515 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1103882108 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/37/15510.full.pdf |pmid=21876156 |pmc=3174665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dance====
[[File:17 Years of Sekar Jepun 2014-11-01 42 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|A dancer of the [[Bali]]nese Sekar Jepun troupe performing the [[Cendrawasih (dance)|cendrawasih]] ([[bird-of-paradise]]) dance]]

Birds feature as central characters in [[dance]] traditions around the world.
For example, [[Goldie's bird of paradise]] is celebrated in Papua New Guinea in a "beautiful"&lt;ref name=LeCroy&gt;{{cite journal |last1=LeCroy |first1=Mary |last2=Kulupi |first2=Alfred |last3=Peckover |first3=W. S. |title=Goldie's Bird of Paradise: Display, Natural History and Traditional Relationships of People to the Bird |journal=The Wilson Bulletin|date=September 1980 |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=289–301 |url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v092n03/p0289-p0301.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; dance by two men who dress in grass skirts with the bird's plumes on the rump; they carry [[cassowary]] feathers in their hands and on their armbands, and imitate the bird's calls while they dance. It is performed on important occasions, carrying "special magic",&lt;ref name=LeCroy/&gt; and the performers are obliged to prepare for a week, avoiding certain foods, and undergoing a prolonged submergence in a cold stream to prepare their minds. The dance is preceded by a "magic chant" to the bird of paradise.&lt;ref name=LeCroy/&gt;
In [[Balinese dance]], the [[Cendrawasih (dance)|cendrawasih]] dance illustrates the [[bird-of-paradise]]'s mating rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Tari Cendrawasih Keelokan Gerak dan Busana |trans-title=Cendrawasih Dance: The Beauty of Costume and Movement |language=Indonesian |work=Pikiran Rakyat  |url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/269737 |date=12 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TtXit61n?url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/269737 |archivedate=7 November 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Africa, the [[Ewe people]] of Ghana, who were said to have been guided from Dahomey to Ghana by a bird, incorporate the flapping of the bird's wings in dances such as ''Agbadza'', ''Atsiagbekor'', and ''Gakpa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Welsh-Asante |first=Kariamu |title=African Dance: An Artistic, Historical, and Philosophical Inquiry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnsWhJGkXo8C&amp;pg=PA14 |year=1996 |publisher=Africa World Press |isbn=978-0-86543-197-3 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ballet]], [[Tchaikovsky]]'s classical 1895 ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1910 ''[[The Firebird]]'' have central bird characters.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, Roland John. ''Tchaikovsky's Ballets: Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, Nutcracker''. Oxford University Press 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The dramatic arts====
[[File:Alabastron (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ancient Greek]] bird: an [[alabastron]], 600 BC]]

In [[theatre]], [[Aristophanes]]'s 414 BC [[Greek comedy|comedy]] ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ὄρνιθες}} ''Ornithes'') is an acclaimed fantasy with effective mimicry of birds. The play's chorus consists of characters playing many identifiable species, including the [[kingfisher]], [[Streptopelia|turtledove]], and [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|sparrowhawk]]; birds feature as messengers and dancers, and several Athenians are compared to specific birds.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Birds and Other Plays''. Barrett, D.; Sommerstein, A. Penguin Classics, 1978, page 149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Drama''. [[Peter Levi|Levi, Peter]] in 'The Oxford History of the Classical World'. Boardman, J.; Griffin, J.; Murray, O. (eds), Oxford University Press, 1986, page 178&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[film]], birds can feature as the major driving force in a story, as in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s acclaimed 1963 ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]''. Loosely based on [[Daphne du Maurier]]'s [[The Birds (story)|story of the same name]], it tells the tale of sudden attacks on people by violent flocks of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=David |authorlink=David Thomson (film critic) |title='Have You Seen…?' A Personal introduction to 1,000 Films |year=2008 |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0-375-71134-3 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bird plays the role of an outlet for a person's feelings in [[Ken Loach]]'s much admired&lt;ref name=BFI/&gt; 1969 ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]''. The film is based on [[Barry Hines]]'s 1968 novel ''[[A Kestrel for a Knave]]'', and tells the story of a young boy who [[Bildungsroman|comes of age]] by training a [[kestrel]] that he has taken from the nest.&lt;ref name=BFI&gt;{{cite web |title=Kes (1969) |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6adf17e2 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds feature also in the mass media with iconic [[animated cartoon]] characters such as [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Donald Duck]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Blitz | first=Marcia | title=Donald Duck | year=1979 | publisher=[[Harmony Books]] | isbn=0-517-52961-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warner Bros.]]'s [[Tweety Pie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hartl |first1=John |title=Warner Bros. cartoons get respect, with Museum of History &amp; Industry show |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/warner-bros-cartoons-get-respect-with-museum-of-history-industry-show/ |work=The Seattle Times |date=21 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walter Lantz]]'s [[Woody Woodpecker]]. The species involved are not always discernible, though Woody has been claimed to be based on the [[acorn woodpecker|acorn]] or [[pileated woodpecker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zickefoose |first=Julie |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101665227 |title=Woody The Acorn (Not Pileated) Woodpecker |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species, such as the [[barn swallow]] and [[European starling]], they have caused population decreases or [[extinction]] in many other species. Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times, including the [[dodo]] and the [[great auk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fuller, Errol |authorlink=Errol Fuller |date=2000 |title=Extinct Birds |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-850837-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 750–1800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of [[Melanesia]]n, [[Polynesia]]n, and [[Micronesia]]n islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steadman, D. |date=2006 |title=Extinction and Biogeography in Tropical Pacific Birds |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-77142-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many bird populations are declining worldwide, with 1,227 species listed as [[threatened species|threatened]] by [[BirdLife International]] and the [[IUCN]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BirdLife International announces more Critically Endangered birds than ever before |publisher=[[BirdLife International]] |date=14 May 2009 |url=http://www.birdlife.org/news/pr/2009/05/red_list.html |accessdate=15 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8045971.stm |first=Mark |last=Kinver |title=Birds at risk reach record high |publisher=BBC News Online |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effects are not all negative; for example, [[wind farm]]s produce [[renewable energy]], helping to mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can [[Bird migration perils|kill many birds]] in collisions.&lt;ref name=RSPBwindfarms/&gt; For example, at the [[Altamont Pass Wind Farm|Altamont Pass]] in California, the [[golden eagle]] has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DRIESSEN: Big Wind tax credit exterminates endangered species |author=Paul Driessen |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/dec/22/big-wind-tax-credit-exterminates-endangered-specie/ |newspaper=[[Washington Times]] |date=22 December 2012 |quote=In an 86-square-mile area blanketed by the Altamont wind facility, no eagles have nested for more than 20 years even though the area is prime habitat, Mr. Wiegand says. Overall, there has been an 80 percent population decline for the golden eagle in Southern California, he notes. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there is a [[trade-off]] in the siting of any wind farm.&lt;ref name=RSPBwindfarms&gt;{{cite web |title=Wind Farms |url=https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/our-positions-and-campaigns/positions/windfarms/ |publisher=[[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments and [[conservation biology|conservation]] groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that [[In-situ conservation|preserve]] and [[ecological restoration|restore]] bird habitat, or by establishing [[Ex-situ conservation|captive populations]] for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the [[California condor]] and [[Norfolk parakeet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1017/S0030605306000950 | last1=Butchart | first1=S. | last2=Stattersfield | first2=A. | last3=Collar | first3=N. | year=2006 | title=How many bird extinctions have we prevented? | url=http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/08/butchart_et_al_2006.pdf | journal=Oryx | volume=40 | issue=3| pages=266–279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]], founded as the Plumage League in 1889 to protect birds such as the [[egret]] from hunting for their plumes, used in fashion, has grown to have over a million members; it has been followed by similar societies in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/index.asp |title=History of the RSPB |publisher=[[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] |accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more specialised organisation, the [[Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust]] founded in 1946, works to conserve waterfowl and their [[wetland]] habitats, with projects around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our projects |url=https://www.wwt.org.uk/conservation/wwt-projects/ |publisher=[[Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust]] |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1986">'''Imitation''' is the doctrine of [[artistic creativity]] according to which the creative process should be based on the close imitation of the [[masterpiece]]s of the preceding [[author]]s. This concept was first formulated by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the first century BCE as ''[[Dionysian imitatio|imitatio]]'', and has since dominated for almost two thousand years the Western [[history of the arts]] and [[classicism]];&lt;ref name="Shroder72p282"&gt;Shroder (1972) p.282 quote: {{quotation|The doctrine of imitation, to which Nodier indirectly refers, had of course dominated classicism from its inception, when Du Bellay recommended it in the ''Defense et illustration de la langue francaise''. The rejection of that doctrine was a basic tenet of romanticism; as Hugo put it in his preface to the 1826 edition of ''Odes et ballades, 'celui qui imite un poete ''romantique'' devient necessairement ''classique'', puisqu'il imite''.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 18th century, [[Romanticism]] reversed it with the creation of the institution of [[romantic originality]].&lt;ref name="Shroder72p282"/&gt; In the 20th century, the [[modernist]] and [[postmodern]] movements in turn discarded the romantic idea of creativity, and heightened the practice of imitation, copying, plagiarism, rewriting, appropriation and so on as the central [[Literary technique|artistic device]].

An '''intangible cultural heritage''' ('''ICH''') is a practice, representation, expression, knowledge, or skill, as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts, and cultural spaces that are considered by [[UNESCO]] to be part of a place's cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; 
Intangible cultural heritage is considered by Member States of [[UNESCO]] in relation to the tangible [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] focusing on intangible aspects of culture. In 2001, [[UNESCO]] made a survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Meeting of 2001
|publisher=UNESCO
|accessdate=20 June 2007 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; among States and NGOs to try to agree on a definition, and the [[Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=home
|title=Official website
|publisher=UNESCO
|accessdate=20 June 2007 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; was drafted in 2003 for its protection and promotion.

==Definition==

The Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/convention|title = UNESCO|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; defines 
the intangible cultural heritage as the practices, representations, expressions, as well as the knowledge and skills (including instruments, objects, artifacts, cultural spaces), that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognise as part of their cultural heritage. It is sometimes called living cultural heritage, and is manifested inter alia in the following domains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/services/documentation/archives/multimedia/?id_page=13|title=Definition of Intangible Heritage|first=|last=LOMITKO|date=1 October 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Oral traditions and expressions, including language as a vehicle of the intangible cultural heritage; 
* Performing arts; 
* Social practices, rituals and festive events; 
* Knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe; 
* Traditional craftsmanship

[[File:No-Maske Zo-onna Museum Rietberg RJP 4024.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Noh]] mask; Japan was the first country to [[Cultural Properties of Japan#Present 1950 Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties|introduce legislation]] to protect and promote its [[Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan|intangible heritage]]&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt;]]

[[Cultural heritage]] in general consists of the products and processes of a [[culture]] that are preserved and passed on through the generations. Some of that heritage takes the form of [[cultural property]], formed by tangible artefacts such as buildings or works of art. Many parts of culture, however are intangible, including [[song]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[drama]], [[skill]]s, cuisine, crafts and festivals. They are forms of culture that can be recorded but cannot be touched or stored in physical form, like in a museum, but only experienced through a vehicle giving expression to it. These cultural vehicles are called "Human Treasures" by the [[UN]].

According to the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, the intangible cultural heritage (ICH) – or living heritage – is the mainspring of humanity's [[cultural diversity]] and its maintenance a guarantee for continuing creativity.  It is defined as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intangible Cultural Heritage means the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artifacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. For the purposes of this Convention, consideration will be given solely to such intangible cultural heritage as is compatible with existing international human rights instruments, as well as with the requirements of mutual respect among communities, groups and individuals, and of sustainable development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Oral history===
Intangible cultural heritage is slightly different from the discipline of [[oral history]], the recording, preservation and interpretation of historical information (specifically, [[oral tradition]]), based on the personal experiences and opinions of the speaker.  ICH attempts to preserve cultural heritage 'with' the people or community by protecting the processes that allow traditions and shared knowledge to be passed on while oral history seeks to collect and preserve historical information obtained from individuals and groups.

===Food heritage===
With sustainable development gaining momentum as a priority of UNESCO heritage policies, an increasing number of food-related nominations are being submitted for inscription on the lists of the Convention for the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://frictions.hypotheses.org/184|title=At the UNESCO feast: introduction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mediterranean diet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=French|author=SILVA, A. J. M.|title=Le régime UNESCO (Discours et pratiques alimentaires en Méditerranée vol. III)|place=Charleston|editor=Create Space|year=2016|isbn=1532997116|url=https://www.academia.edu/27222415/Le_r%C3%A9gime_UNESCO_Discours_et_pratiques_alimentaires_en_M%C3%A9diterran%C3%A9e_vol._III_}}&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional Mexican cuisine and the Japanese dietary culture of washoku are just some examples of this booming phenomenon.

===Dance heritage===
The UNESCO lists of intangible cultural heritage also include a variety of dance genres, often associated with singing, music and celebrations, from all over the world. The lists include: celebratory and ritual dances, such as ‘Ma'di bowl lyre music and dance’ from Uganda and ‘Kalbelia folk songs and dances of Rajasthan’ from India and social dances, such as rumba from Cuba. Also, some dances are localised and practised mainly in their country of origin, such as Sankirtana, a performing art that includes drumming and singing, from India. 

Other dance forms&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worlddanceheritage.org/international-heritage/ Dance as a form of intangible heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;, however, even if they are officially recognised as heritage from their country of origin, are practised and enjoyed all over the world. For example, flamenco from Spain and tango, from Argentina and Uruguay, have a very international dimension. Dance is a very complex phenomenon, which involves culture, traditions, the use of human bodies, artefacts (such as costumes and props), as well as a specific use of music, space and sometimes light. As a result, a lot of tangible and intangible elements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/drs.2016.0147 Lo Iacono, Valeria and Brown, David - ''Beyond Binarism: Exploring a Model of Living Cultural Heritage for Dance''. Dance Research Journal, Vol. 34, April 2016]
&lt;/ref&gt; are combined within dance, making it a challenging but extremely interesting type of heritage to safeguard.

===Digital heritage===
[[Digital heritage]] is a representation of heritage in the digital realm.

===Digital intangible heritage===

[[Digital intangible heritage]] is a sub-category of Intangible Cultural Heritage.&lt;ref name="nova"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://multi-science.atypon.com/doi/abs/10.1260/2047-4970.4.1.71|title=Transmitting Al Ardha: Traditional Arab Sword Dance|first=Muqeem|last=Khan|date=1 March 2015|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Heritage in the Digital Era|volume=4|issue=1|pages=71–86|via=multi-science.atypon.com (Atypon)|doi=10.1260/2047-4970.4.1.71}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oral continuity==
[[Image:A traditional male folk group from Skrapar.JPG|thumb|Albanian polyphonic folk group wearing [[qeleshe]] and [[fustanella]] in [[Skrapar]]]]
Intangible cultural heritage is passed orally within a community, and while there may be individuals who are known tradition bearers, ICH is often broader than one individual's own skills or knowledge.  A 2006 report by the government of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] said, regarding oral culture in their area, "The processes involved in the continuation of this traditional knowledge constitute one of the most interesting aspects of our living heritage. Each member of the community possesses a piece of the shared knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Tremolada|first2=Riccardo|title=Desirability of Commodification of Intangible Cultural Heritage: The Unsatisfying Role of Intellectual Property Rights|journal=Transnational Dispute Management|date=March 15, 2014|volume=11|issue=2|ssrn=2472339|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crucial knowledge is passed on during community activities, frequently without any conscious attention to the process."&lt;ref&gt;"Creative Newfoundland and Labrador: The Blueprint for Development and Investment in Culture" Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, 2006, page 34.|url=http://www.tcii.gov.nl.ca/artsculture/pdf/culturalplan2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
Prior to the UNESCO Convention, efforts had already been made by a number of states to safeguard their intangible heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/tk/en/databases/creative_heritage/docs/subtle_power.pdf |title=The Subtle Power of Intangible Heritage: Legal and Financial Instruments for Safeguarding Intangible Heritage |author=Deacon, Harriet (''et al.'') |publisher=[[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|Human Sciences Research Council]] |year=2004 |isbn=0796920745 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan, with its [[Cultural Properties of Japan#Present 1950 Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties|1950 Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties]], was the first to introduce legislation to preserve and promote intangible as well as tangible culture: [[Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Intangible Cultural Properties]] are [[Cultural Properties of Japan|designated]] and "holders" recognized of these craft and performance traditions, known informally as [[Living National Treasures of Japan|Living National Treasures]].&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cultural Protection Policy in Korea: Intangible Cultural Properties and Living National Treasures |author=Yang Jongsung |publisher=Jimoondang International |year=2003 |isbn=1931897050 |pages=33ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kurin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurin|first=Richard|title=Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage in the 2003 UNESCO Convention: a critical appraisal|journal=Museum International|date=1 May 2004|volume=56|issue=1-2|pages=66–77|doi=10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1350-0775.2004.00459.x/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, including South Korea ([[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea]]), the Philippines, the United States, Thailand, France, Romania, the Czech Republic, and Poland, have since created similar programs.&lt;ref name=Kurin/&gt;

In 2003 UNESCO adopted the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.  This went into effect on 20 April 2006.  The Convention recommends that countries and scholars develop inventories of ICH in their territory, as well as work with the groups who maintain these ICH to ensure their continued existences; it also provides for funds to be voluntarily collected among UNESCO members and then disbursed to support the maintenance of recognized ICH.&lt;ref name=Kurin/&gt; UNESCO has also created other intangible culture programs, such as a list called Proclamation of [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].  This list began in 2001 with 19 items and a further 28 were listed in 2003 and another 43 in 2005. In part, the original list was seen as a way to correct the imbalance in the World Heritage List, since it excluded many Southern Hemisphere cultures which did not produce monuments or other physical cultural manifestations.&lt;ref name = Kurin/&gt; It was superseded in 2008 by the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].

Recently there has been much debate over protecting intangible cultural heritage through intellectual property rights, as well as the desirability to do so through this legal framework and the risks of [[commodification]] derived from this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=2705698 Farah, Paolo Davide and Tremolada, Riccardo ''Conflict between Intellectual Property Rights and Human Rights: A Case Study on Intangible Cultural Heritage'' (December 19, 2015). Oregon Law Review, Vol. 94, No. 1, 2015]
&lt;/ref&gt; The issue still remains open in legal scholarship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">The '''International National Trusts Organisation''' ('''INTO''') is a network of [[national trust]]s and similar non-governmental organizations committed to preserving [[cultural heritage]], "built and natural, tangible and intangible," including architecturally or historically significant items, and areas of natural beauty. INTO's mandate includes developing and promoting [[best practices]], supporting existing national trust organizations, establishing new trusts, and advocating for [[heritage conservation]]. INTO was formally established in December 2007 at the 12th International National Trusts Conference in New Delhi, India. It operates as a non-profit corporation registered in England and Wales, with headquarters in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.icr.su/news/index.php?news=2827 | title="Our heritage, our future.

According to INTO chairman [[Simon Molesworth]], an impetus for the formation of INTO came from the requests of some developing nations for help in preserving their cultural heritage in the midst of rapid development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/world/asia/03iht-letter.1.9003740.html | title=Growth threatens thousands of heritage sites | publisher=New York Times | date=3 January 2008 | accessdate=19 February 2015 | author=Gentleman, Amelia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INTO membership represents over 50 countries, and includes England's [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], the first such trust, established in 1895.&lt;ref name=movement /&gt;&lt;ref name=into-members&gt;{{cite web | url=http://internationaltrusts.org/into-members | title=INTO Members | publisher=International National Trusts Organisation | accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This conception started to emerge among Korean [[intellectual]]s after the [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905|Japanese-imposed Protectorate]] of 1905,&lt;ref&gt;Andre Schmid, ''Korea Between Empires, 1895-1919'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2002), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; when the Japanese were trying to persuade Koreans that both nations were of the same [[yellow race|racial stock]].&lt;ref name=myers /&gt;&lt;ref name=ucb /&gt; The notion of the Korean ''minjok'' was first made popular by essayist and historian [[Shin Chaeho]] in his ''[[Doksa sillon|New Reading of History]]'' (1908), a [[history of Korea]] from the mythical times of [[Dangun]] to the fall of [[Balhae]] in 926 CE. Shin portrayed the ''minjok'' as a warlike race that had fought bravely to preserve Korean [[Identity (social science)|identity]], had later declined, and now needed to be reinvigorated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheila Miyoshi Jager]], ''Narratives of Nation Building in Korea'' (2003), pp. 15-16; Andre Schmid, "Rediscovering Manchuria" (1997), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|period of Japanese rule]] (1910&amp;ndash;1945), this belief in the uniqueness of the Korean ''minjok'' gave an impetus for [[resistance movement|resisting]] Japanese [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] policies and [[history|historical]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Hyung-il Pai, ''Constructing "Korean" Origins: A Critical Review of Archaeology, Historiography, and Racial Myth in Korean State-Formation Theories''.

==History==
{{see also|Korean nationalist historiography}}

===Early usage and origins===
Contrary to popular belief in the Koreas, the contemporary Korean ideology of a "pure Korean race" began only in the early 20th century when the Japanese annexed Korea&lt;ref name=myers /&gt; and launched a campaign to persuade them that they were of the same pure racial stock as the Japanese themselves.&lt;ref name=ucb /&gt;

In the colonial period, the Imperial Japanese's assimilation policy claimed that Koreans and Japanese were of common origin but the former always subordinate. The pure blood theory was used to justify colonialist policies to replace Korean cultural traditions with Japanese ones in order to supposedly get rid of all distinctions and achieve equality between Koreans and inlanders.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;[http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802/ Ethnic pride source of prejudice, discrimination] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720053258/http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802 |date=2011-07-20 }}, Gi-Wook Shin, Asia-Pacific Research Center of Stanford University, 2 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The policy included changing Korean names into Japanese, exclusive use of Japanese language, school instruction in the Japanese ethical system, and Shinto worship.&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt; [[Brian Reynolds Myers]], a professor at [[Dongseo University]], argues that seeing the failure of the pure [[Cultural assimilation|assimilationist]] policy, Japanese imperial ideologues changed their policy into creating a Korean ethnic-patriotism on par with the Japanese one. They encouraged Koreans to take pride in their Koreanness, in their history, heritage, culture and "dialect" as a brother nation going back to a common ancestry with the Japanese. Thus, Korean race nationalism can be seen as a deliberate and direct creation of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese empire]].&lt;ref name="myers"/&gt;{{page number needed|date=December 2016}}

===Independence===
[[File:Baitou Mountain Tianchi.jpg|thumb|right|Heaven Lake of [[Baekdu Mountain]] where [[Hwanung]], [[Dangun]]'s father, is said to have descended from heaven, constitutes a foundation for the legend of blood purity in Korean]]

[[Shin Chaeho]] (1880–1936), the founder of the nationalistic historiography of modern Korea and a [[Korean independence movement]] activist, published his influential book of reconstructed history ''[[Joseon Sanggosa]]'' (''The Early History of Joseon'') in 1924–25, proclaiming that Koreans are descendants of [[Dangun]], the legendary ancestor of Korean people, who merged with Buyo of [[Manchuria]] to form the [[Goguryeo]] people.&lt;ref name=gries&gt;The Koguryo Controversy,
National Identity, and Sino-Korean Relations Today [http://www.ou.edu/uschina/gries/articles/texts/Gries2005KoguryoEAIQ.pdf], Peter Hays Gries, Institute for US-China Issues, The University of Oklahoma&lt;/ref&gt;

Borrowing from the Japanese theory of nation, Shin Chaeho located the martial roots of the Korean in Goguryeo, which he depicted as [[militarist]] and expansionist which turned out to inspire pride and confidence in the resistance against the Japanese.&lt;ref name=gries /&gt; In order to establish Korean uniqueness, he also replaced the story of [[Gija Joseon]], whose founder ([[Jizi|Gija]]) was the paternal uncle or brother of the Chinese [[Shang]] emperor [[King Zhou of Shang|Zhou]], with the Dangun legend&lt;ref&gt;Andre Schmid, "Rediscovering Manchuria: Som Cj’aeho and the Politics of Territorial History in Korea," in The Journal of Asian Studies, 56, no. 1 February 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and asserted that it was an important way to establish Korea’s uniqueness.&lt;ref name=gries /&gt;

After independence in the late 1940s, despite the split between North and South Korea, neither side disputed the ethnic homogeneity of the Korean nation based on a firm conviction that they are purest descendant of a legendary genitor and half-god figure called Dangun who founded [[Gojoseon]] in 2333 BCE based on the description of the ''[[Dongguk Tonggam]]'' (1485).&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbpia.co.kr/view/ar_view.asp?pid=694&amp;isid=30674&amp;arid=657709&amp;topMenu=&amp;topMenu1= Old Choson and the Culture of the Mandolin-shaped Bronze Dagger], Kim Jung-bae&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
In both Koreas, pure blood theory is a common belief,&lt;ref name=soksoo&gt;Kim Sok-soo, professor at Kyungpook National University, cited in Park Chung-a, "[http://www.dhseol.org/activity/ein2006_06.html Myth of Pure-Blood Nationalism Blocks Multi-Ethnic Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725232752/http://www.dhseol.org/activity/ein2006_06.html |date=2011-07-25 }}," ''The Korea Times'', August 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; with even some South Korean presidents subscribing to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-north-koreas-motives-and-why-some-south-koreans-admire-the-north-83639|title=What the West gets wrong about North Korea's motives, and why some South Koreans admire the North|first=B.R.|last=Myers|publisher=The Conversation|date=September 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916082701/http://theconversation.com/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-north-koreas-motives-and-why-some-south-koreans-admire-the-north-83639|archivedate=2017-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debates on this topic can be found sporadic in the South, whereas the public opinion in the North is hard to access. In a nationalistic view, to impugn or challenge the theory would have been tantamount to betraying Koreanness in the face of the challenge of an alien ethnic nation.&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;

Some Korean scholars observed that the pure blood theory served as a useful tool for the South Korean government to make its people obedient and easy to govern when the country was embroiled in ideological turmoil.&lt;ref name=soksoo /&gt; It was especially true in the dictatorial leaderships by former presidents [[Syngman Rhee]] and [[Park Chung-hee]] when nationalism was incorporated into anti-Communism.&lt;ref name=soksoo /&gt;

===Role in contemporary South Korean society===
In South Korea, the notion of "pure blood" results in discrimination toward people of both "foreign-blood" and "mixed blood".&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; Those with this "mixed blood" or "foreign blood" are sometimes referred to as ''Honhyeol'' ({{Korean|혼혈|{{lang|ko|[[wikt:混#Korean|混]][[wikt:血#Korean|血]]}}}}) in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lim|first=Timothy|title=Rethinking Belongingness in Korea: Transnational Migration, ‘Migrant Marriages,’ and the Politics of Multiculturalism|url=https://www.academia.edu/3605631/Rethinking_Belongingness_in_Korea_Transnational_Migration_Migrant_Marriages_and_the_Politics_of_Multiculturalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Korean nationality law is based on [[jus sanguinis]]&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;&lt;ref name=gv /&gt; instead of [[jus solis]], which is a territorial principle that takes into account the place of birth when bestowing nationality. In this context, most South Koreans have stronger attachment to South Koreans residing in foreign countries and foreigners of South Korean descent, than to naturalized South Korean citizens and expatriates residing in South Korea.&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;&lt;ref name=gv /&gt; In 2005, the opposition [[Grand National Party]] suggested a revision of the current South Korean nationality law to allow South Korean nationality to be bestowed to people who are born in South Korea regardless of the nationalities of their parents but it was discarded due to unfavorable public opinion against such a measure.&lt;ref name="Park" /&gt;


According to Jon Huer, a columnist for the ''Korea Times'': {{quote|In trying to understand [South] Korea and [South] Koreans, we must recognize how important blood is to [South] Korea. [South] Koreans love blood, both in the real sense and metaphorically. They like to shed blood, sometimes their own in cut fingers and sometimes animal blood, in protest. They hold "blood relations" as supreme, above other links and connections. They often add "flesh" and "bone" to their rhetorical statements and preferences. In short, [South] Korea is quite fond of thinking of itself and its people in terms of blood...&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/06/272_47907.html|title=Korean Blood, Real and Imagined|date=3 July 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
====Challenges and the future====
Emma Campbell from the [[Australian National University]] argues that the conceptions of South Korean nationalism is evolving among young people and that a new form is emerging that has globalised cultural characteristics.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=Emma |date=22 June 2015 |title=The end of ethnic nationalism? Changing conceptions of national identity and belonging among young South Koreans |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nana.12120/full |journal=[[Nations and Nationalism (journal)|Nations and Nationalism]] |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=483–502 |doi=10.1111/nana.12120 |access-date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics challenge the role of ethnicity in South Korean nationalism.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt; According to Campbell’s study for which she interviewed 150 South Koreans in their twenties, the desire for reunification is declining. However, these who are in favor of a [[Korean unification]] state reasons different from [[ethnic nationalism]]. The respondents stated that they only wanted unification if it would not disrupt the life in the South or if North Korea achieves economic parity with the South. A small number of respondents further mentioned that they support a "unification on the condition that it did not take place in their lifetime."&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt; Another reason stated for the wish for unification was the access to North Korea’s natural resources and cheap labor.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt; This notion of evolving nationalism has been further elaborated by the meaning of ''uri nara'' ({{lang-ko|우리나라}} ''my country'' [sic!]) for young South Koreans, which only refers to South Korea for them instead to the whole Korean peninsula.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt;&lt;!-- p. 488-489 --&gt; Campbell’s interviews further showed that many young South Koreans have no problems to accepting foreigners as part of ''uri nara''.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt;&lt;!-- p. 492 --&gt;

Myers noted in a 2010 ''New York Times'' editorial that there was relatively little public outrage in South Korea over the [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|sinking of the ROKS ''Cheonan'']] earlier that year, which he attributed partly to a feeling of sympathy towards North Korea among South Koreans, resulting from a closer identification with the Korean race than with the South Korean state.&lt;ref name=KoreaShrug&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/opinion/28myers.html |title=South Korea's Collective Shrug |date=27 May 2010 |work=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |first=Brian Reynolds |last=Myers |authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers |accessdate=April 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419024409/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/opinion/28myers.html |archivedate=April 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers also stated that race nationalism in South Korea undermines the South Korean citizenry's patriotism towards South Korea by increasing sympathy towards North Korea, thus threatening the country's national security in the face of North Korean aggression, a sentiment shared by ''Korea Times'' columnist Jon Huer.&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"/&gt; He stated that South Koreans' race nationalism "is no problem when you have a nation state like Japan or Denmark, but is a problem when you have a state divided."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2011/08/01/51/0302000000AEN20110801002700315F.HTML|title=(Yonhap Feature) Brian Myers: Korea's most dangerous writer? - YONHAP NEWS|website=english.yonhapnews.co.kr|quote=This is no problem when you have a nation state like Japan or Denmark, but is a problem when you have a state divided.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers has also stated that conversely, North Korea does not suffer from this dilemma as by and large the North Korean people tend to equate the "Korean race" and the country of North Korea as being one and the same, unlike in South Korea where the "Korean race" and South Korea are largely seen as different entities, the former positively, the latter negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freekorea.us/2017/08/01/propaganda-in-the-age-of-kim-jong-un-a-discussion-with-professor-b-r-myers/#sthash.eScL76im.dpbs|title=Propaganda in the age of Kim Jong-Un: A discussion with Professor B.R.

[[File:Hines Ward vs. Chiefs.jpg|thumb|upright|American football player [[Hines Ward]]'s visit to South Korea in 2006 has stirred debate if the country's society should be more accepting of "mixed blood" people.]]

As part of the deterioration of relations between North Korea and the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, North Korea  forced its male citizens who had married Soviet and Eastern European women to divorce, whereupon the women, a few hundred, were expelled from the country.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Lankov, The Real North Korea. Life and politics in the failed Stalinist utopia (Oxford 2015) page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  North Korea is alleged to have abducted foreign women in the 1970s to marry to foreign men that immigrated to North Korea in order to keep these men from having children with North Korean women.&lt;ref name="United Nations Human Rights Council 2014"/&gt; North Korea is accused of killing babies born to North Korean mothers and Chinese fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3204509.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Asia-Pacific - N Korea 'kills detainees' babies'|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, American football player [[Hines Ward]], who was born in Seoul to a South Korean mother and a [[African American|black American]] father, became the first South Korean-born American to win the NFL Super Bowl's MVP award. This achievement threw him into the media spotlight in South Korea.&lt;ref name=finder&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06099/680735-195.stm| title=Hines Ward scores big for social change| author=Chuck Finder| work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]| date=2006-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he travelled to South Korea for the first time, he raised unprecedented attention to the acceptance of "mixed-blood" children. He also donated US$1 million to establish the "Hines Ward Helping Hands Foundation", which the media called "a foundation to help mixed-race children like himself in South Korea, where they have suffered discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06150/694237-66.stm| title=Ward kicks off his new charity| author=[[Associated Press]]| work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]| date=2006-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hines Ward was granted "honorary" South Korean citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?no=283952&amp;rel_no=1|title=MVP Ward Visit Exposes Korean Racism - OhmyNews International|website=english.ohmynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while some South Koreans are fascinated by the bi-racial sportsman, the majority of ordinary mixed-race people and migrant workers face various forms of discrimination and prejudice.&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; In 2007, the "Korean pure blood theory" became an international issue when the U.N. Committee on the International Convention Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination urged better education on the pure blood theory is needed especially for judicial workers such as police officers, lawyers, prosecutors and judges.&lt;ref name=kbs&gt;[http://english.kbs.co.kr/news/newsview_sub.php?menu=4&amp;key=2007081906 U.N.

In 2007 the South Korean government passed the [[Act on Treatment of Foreigners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moleg.go.kr/english/korLawEng?pstSeq=47580|title=Korean Laws in English - Act on the Treatment of Foreigners in Korea|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/5575/south-korea/south-korea-overview.html|title=Minority Rights Group International : South Korea : South Korea Overview|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613001710/http://www.minorityrights.org/5575/south-korea/south-korea-overview.html|archivedate=13 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hurights&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/newsinbrief-en/section1/2008/10/south-korea-support-for-multicultural-families-act-enacted.html|title=South Korea; Support for Multicultural Families Act Enacted - ヒューライツ大阪|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2007, the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] praised the Act on Treatment of Foreigners, but also expressed a number of concerns. The Committee was concerned "about the persistence of widespread societal discrimination against foreigners, including migrant workers and children born from inter-ethnic unions, in all areas of life, including employment, marriage, housing, education and interpersonal relationships." It also noted that the terminology such as "pure blood" and "mixed blood" used in South Korea, including by the government, is widespread, and may reinforce concepts of [[Racial superiority|racist superiority]]. The committee recommended improvement in the areas of treatment of migrant workers, abuse of and violence against foreign women married to South Korean citizens, and trafficking of foreign women for the purpose of sexual exploitation or domestic servitude.&lt;ref name=uncom&gt;http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/473424062.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It also noted that contrary to popular domestic perception, South Korea was no longer "ethnically homogenous".&lt;ref name=nytimes2009&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/world/asia/02race.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=2 November 2009|location=New York|title=Race|publisher=New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legislation aimed at improving the integration of ethnic minorities into South Korean society, the [[Support for Multicultural Families Act]], was passed in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moleg.go.kr/english/korLawEng?pstSeq=58481|title=Korean Laws in English - SUPPORT FOR MULTICULTURAL FAMILIES ACT|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and revised in 2011).&lt;ref name=hurights/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Policies/view?articleId=89160|title=Gov’t extends definition of multicultural families|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2009 statistics published by South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, there were 144,385 couples of international marriage in South Korea as of May 2008. 88.4% of immigrants were female, and 61.9% were from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.naver.com/view.nhn?doc_id=39555627&amp;dir_id=0&amp;page=0&amp;query=%EB%8B%A4%EB%AC%B8%ED%99%94%20%ED%86%B5%EA%B3%84|title=2009년 다문화가족 통계현황 (09년 4월현재):네이버 전문정보|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently{{When|date=January 2016}} it has been argued that South Korean society had already become a multicultural society, although foreigners make up for 3.4% of the South Korean population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sung-won|first1=Eum|title=Number of foreign residents in S.

Existing provisions in South Korean criminal law may be used to punish acts of racial discrimination, but were never used for that purpose&lt;ref name=uncom/&gt; until 2009, when the first case of a South Korean citizen verbally insulting a foreigner have been brought to court.&lt;ref name=nytimes2009/&gt;

In 2010, the South Korean government changed the oath of enlistment of Korean soldiers, so that they do not swear allegiance anymore to the Korean race, stating that this shows openness to multiculturalism.&lt;ref name=OathChosunIlbo&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/04/18/2011041801112.html |title=New Pledge of Allegiance to Reflect Growing Multiculturalism |quote=The military has decided to omit the word 'minjok,' which refers to the Korean race, from the oath of enlistment for officers and soldiers, and replace it with 'the citizen.'

In 2017, [[Korean Americans|Korean American]] actress [[Jamie Chung]], who had auditioned for a role in the movie [[Crazy Rich Asians (film)|Crazy Rich Asians]] but was turned down for allegedly not being [[Han Chinese|"ethnically Chinese"]], called the movie's casting of [[Multiracial|biracial]] actor [[Henry Golding (actor)|Henry Golding]] as "bullshit" in an interview; Golding, who is of English and [[Iban people|Malaysian Iban]] descent, had been cast as the [[Chinese Singaporean]] character Nick Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jamie-chung-on-the-double-edged-sword-of-being-a-minority-in-hollywood/|title=Jamie Chung on the "double-edged sword" of being a minority in Hollywood|publisher=|accessdate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chung's remarks were heavily criticized, with many accusing her of being bigoted or racist against [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]] and promoting [[racial purity]] by assuming Golding was not "Asian enough" to play an Asian character, despite the actor's cultural ties and upbringing in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/crazy-rich-asians-henry-golding-casting_us_5a1f172ce4b0d52b8dc2632e|title='Crazy Rich Asians' Star Claps Back At Criticism That He's 'Not Asian Enough'|first=Kimberly|last=Yam|date=November 30, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=February 5, 2018|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16028">A '''legendary progenitor''' is a [[legend]]ary or [[mythological]] figure  held to be the [[common ancestor]] of a dynasty,&lt;ref name="Berend2007"/&gt; people, tribe or ethnic group.

==Overview==
[[Masculinity]], [[femininity]] and ''"ghenos"'' or [[Kinship|lineage]] linked to legendary progenitors were fundamental concepts of [[family]] identity in the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and [[Ancient Greek]] eras. The Greeks demonstrated the principles of family functionality in the mythological lives of [[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Hestia]] and [[Hermes]]. These included communal dining, and ''"charis"'' a form of [[Principle of charity|charity]] that Vittoro Cigoli and Eugena Scabini described as being "deployed to oppose the core of violence inherent in the family relationship". Etrusco-Roman culture, developed from the Greek where each ''"gens"'' (family or house) had their own deified hero, prince or demi-god along with various household deities. The expansion of family trees to include heroic or legendary ancestors was used to boost social status and amass personal finances. Rome's patriarchal families, along with later [[Europe]]an dynasties engaged in power struggles, such as that to be elected [[Pope]] based on this change in family culture.&lt;ref name="CigoliScabini2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vittorio Cigoli|author2=Eugenia Scabini|title=Family Identity: Ties, Symbols, And Transitions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bmip0m4k8y0C&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=2 December 2012|date=1 April 2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|isbn=978-0-8058-5231-8|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peoples from all over the world have supposed themselves descended from various different eponymic or mythical progenitors. The [[Italy|Italian]]s claimed ancestry from [[Italus]], [[Lydia]]ns from [[Lydus]], [[Phoenicia]]ns associated with [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], [[Sicily|Sicilian]]s legendary progenitor was [[Siculus]], [[Pelasgians]] revered [[Pelasgus]], [[Dorians]] traced lineage to [[Dorus]], [[Aeolians]] were linked to [[Aeolus]] and [[Hellenes]] looked up to [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]. Legendary progenitors also gave their names to places, [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] was alleged to have been built by [[Menes]] and [[Ninevah]] by [[Ninus]].&lt;ref name="Taylor2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Isaac Taylor|title=Words And Places Or Etymological Illustrations Of History, Ethnology And Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-4rutCY2csC&amp;pg=PA207|accessdate=2 December 2012|date=30 January 2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4179-7157-2|pages=207–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later times, [[place name]]s in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] were given the names of legendary [[Tribal chief|chief]]tains or [[Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies|Anglo-Saxon King]]s. [[Isaac Taylor]] suggests that "minute fragments of historic truth have been conserved". He notes however that the "greatest caution must be exercised as to the conclusions which we allow ourselves to draw. The traditions are generally vague and obscure and the personages whose names are associated with these sites have often only a mythical, or, to speak technically, an ''eponymic'' existence."&lt;ref name="Taylor2005"/&gt;

==Europe==

In various [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] myths, [[Melampus]] is the "legendary founder and progenitor of a great and long-continued family of [[prophet]]s". Along with his brother [[Bias]], they became kings of territory in the Argeian and was acknowledged as a leader in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]]. His grandson is recorded as the prophet [[Theoklymenos]].&lt;ref name="Esq.1854"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Grote, Esq.|title=History of Greece; I. Legendary Greece, II. Grecian History to the Reign of Peisistratus At Athens.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4hBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA122|accessdate=2 December 2012|year=1854|publisher=National Academies|pages=122–|id=NAP:34576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Niccolò Machiavelli]] discussed how in [[Ancient Rome]], both [[Aeneas]], the [[Troy|Trojan]] and [[Romulus]] were both who said to have been the legendary founders. He considered how people's view of history could be influenced by the preference of one progenitor over another, saying "if whoever examines the building of [[Rome]] takes Aeneas for its first progenitor (primo progenitore), it will be of those cities built by foreigners, while if he takes Romulus it will be of those built by men native to the place". Machiavelli does not take a preference and suggests Rome had "a free beginning, without depending on anyone".&lt;ref name="Benner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Erica Benner|title=Machiavelli's Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IKMh7mCI-MC&amp;pg=PA419|accessdate=2 December 2012|date=26 October 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-14177-0|pages=419–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of women who engaged in war, found throughout [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], studied in fields such as [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[film studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[women's studies]]. A ''mythological'' figure does not always mean a ''fictional'' one, but rather, someone of whom stories have been told that have entered the cultural heritage of a people. Some women warriors are documented in the written record and as such form part of [[history]] (e.g. the [[Ancient Briton]] queen [[Boudica]], who led the [[Iceni]] into battle against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]). However, to be considered a warrior, the woman in question must have belonged to some sort of [[military]], be it recognized, like an organized [[army]], or unrecognized, like [[revolutionaries]].

 All boundless as her beauty was her strength was peerless too,&lt;br /&gt;
 And evil plight hung o'er the knight who dared her love to woo.&lt;br /&gt;
 For he must try three bouts with her; the whirling spear to fling;&lt;br /&gt;
 To pitch the massive stone; and then to follow with a spring;&lt;br /&gt;
 And should he beat in every feat his wooing well has sped,&lt;br /&gt;
 But he who fails must lose his love, and likewise lose his head."

*[[Lagertha]]: Lagertha was, according to legend, a Viking shieldmaiden and ruler from what is now Norway, and the onetime wife of the famous Viking Ragnar Lodbrok.

She was authorized to use the marines' colours and sergeant's chevrons in her woman clothes.
* La Galana ('[[Juana Galán]]') was another woman who fought in the [[Spanish War of Independence]]. She defended Valdepeñas, armed with a baton and aided by the rest of the women in the village because there were not enough men in [[Valdepeñas]] due to the war circumstances. They threw boiling water and oil through the windows. French soldiers were delayed in arriving at the [[Battle of Bailén|Battle of Bailen]] because of this, so Spanish forces won. Also see [[Valdepeñas Uprising]] for more information about this [[guerrilla action]].

*[[Queen Zenobia]] of [[Palmyra]]

===Rashidun Caliphate===
[[Khawlah bint al-Azwar]] was the daughter of one of the chiefs of [[Bani Assad]] tribe, and her family embraced Islam in its first days. The recorded history of that era mentions repeatedly the feats of Khawla in battles that took place in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Moslem army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her. She was a brunette, tall, slim and of great beauty, and she was also a distinguished poet.

[[Nusaybah bint Ka’ab]], also known as [[Umm Ammarah]] (Ammarah's mother), a Hebrew woman by origin from the Banu Najjar tribe, was an early convert to Islam. Nusaybah was attending [[the Battle of Uhud]] like other women, and her intention was to bring water to the soldiers, and attend the wounded while her husband and son fought on the side of the Moslems. But after the Moslem archers disobeyed their orders and began deserting their high ground believing victory was at hand, the tide of the battle changed, and it appeared that defeat was imminent. When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism. During the battle her son was wounded and she cut off the leg of the aggressor.

Ishtar is a goddess of fertility, sexual love, and war.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In the Babylonian pantheon, she "was the divine personification of the planet Venus".&lt;ref&gt;Guirand, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Semiramis]] was a legendary Assyrian empress-regnant who first came to prominence for her bravery in battle and greatly expanded her empire.

===Old Testament===
*[[Deborah]], a prophetess mentioned in the ''[[Book of Judges]]'', was a poet who rendered her judgments beneath a [[palm tree]] between [[Ramah in Benjamin|Ramah]] and [[Bethel]] in the land of [[Benjamin]]. After her victory over Sisera and the Canaanite army, there was peace in the land for forty years.

===Phoenician mythology===
*[[Ashtart]] [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] "ʻštrt" (ʻAshtart); and Hebrew עשתרת (Ashtoreth, singular, or Ashtarot, plural); Greek ([[Astarte]]) is the  Phoenician counterpart to the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian]] [[Inanna]] and to the cognate Babylonian goddess Ishtar as well as the Greek Aphrodite. She is a goddess of fertility, sexual love, and war. Ashtoreth is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as a foreign, non-Judahite goddess, the principal goddess of the homeland of the Phoenicians which is in modern-day [[Lebanon]], representing the productive power of nature. [[Herodotus]] wrote that the religious community of Aphrodite originated in Phoenicia (modern day Lebanon) and came to Greeks from there. He also wrote about the world's largest temple of Aphrodite, in one of the Phoenician cities.
*Tanit is a Phoenician lunar goddess, worshiped as the patron goddess at Carthage. Her shrine excavated at Sarepta in southern Phoenicia (Carthage) revealed an inscription that identified her for the first time in her homeland (Phoenicia of the Levant) and related her securely to the Phoenician goddess Astarte/Ashtart. In Egyptian, her name means Land of Neith, Neith being a war goddess. Long after the fall of Carthage, Tanit is still venerated in North Africa under the Latin name of Juno Caelestis, for her identification with the Roman goddess Juno. Hvidberg-Hansen (Danish professor of Semitic philology), notes that Tanit is sometimes depicted with a lion's head, showing her warrior quality. In modern times the name, with the spelling "Tanith", has been used as a female given name, both for real people and, more frequently, in occult fiction. From the 5th century BC  onwards, Tanit is associated with that of Ba`al Hammon. She is given the epithet pene baal ("face of Baal") and the title rabat, the female form of rab (chief).

===Hinduism===
*[[Durga]] ({{lang-sa|"the inaccessible"&lt;ref&gt;"Durga." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 25 February  2007 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9363243/Durga"&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}} or "the invincible",&lt;ref&gt;"Durga" Sanatan Society &lt;http://www.sanatansociety.org/hindu_gods_and_goddesses/durga.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-bn|দুর্গা}}) is a form of [[Devi]], the supreme [[goddess]] of [[Hinduism]]. According to the narrative from the [[Devi Mahatmya]] of the [[Markandeya Purana]], the form of Durga was created as a warrior goddess to fight a demon. The nine-day holiday dedicated to Durga, ''The [[Durga Puja]],'' is the biggest annual festival in [[Bengal]] and other parts of Eastern India and is celebrated by Hindus all over the world.
*[[Kālī]] ({{lang-sa|काली}}, {{IPA-sa|kɑːliː|IPA}}; {{lang-bn|কালী}}; {{lang-pa|ਕਾਲੀ}};  {{lang-si|කාලි}}; {{lang-te|కాళికాదేవి}}; {{lang-kn|ಕಾಳಿ ಮಾತಾ}}; {{lang-ta|காளி}}), also known as '''{{IAST|Kālikā}}''' ({{lang-sa|कालिका}}, {{lang-bn|কালিকা}}), is the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[goddess]] associated with empowerment, [[shakti]]. The name Kali comes from ''kāla'', which means black, time, death, lord of death, and thus another name for [[Shiva]]. Kali means "the black one".  Although sometimes presented as dark and violent, her earliest incarnation as a figure of annihilation still has some influence. In Kāli's most famous myth, [[Durga]] and her assistants, the [[Matrikas]], wound the demon [[Raktabija]], in various ways and with a variety of weapons in an attempt to destroy him.  They soon find that they have worsened the situation, for, with every drop of blood that is spilled from Raktabija, he reproduces a clone of himself.  The battlefield becomes increasingly filled with his duplicates.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kinsley p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Durga, in need of help, summons Kāli to combat the demons.  It is said, in some versions, that the Goddess Durga actually assumes the form of Goddess Kāli at this time. Kali destroys Raktabija by sucking the blood from his body and putting the many Raktabija duplicates in her gaping mouth. Pleased with her victory, Kali then dances on the field of battle, stepping on the corpses of the slain. Her consort Shiva lies among the dead beneath her feet, a representation of Kali commonly seen in her iconography as ''Daksinakali''.
* Other warrior goddesses include [[Chamunda]] ("the killer of demon Chanda and Munda") and the goddess group [[Matrikas]] ("Mothers").
*[[Vishpala]] (in ''The [[Rigveda]]'') is a warrior queen who, after having lost a leg in battle had an iron prosthesis made. Afterwards, she returned to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpoc.org/library/1976_05_015.asp|title=A Brief Review of the History of Amputations and Prostheses Earl E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9082">The market for '''luxury goods in China''' composes a significant proportion of all luxury goods sales worldwide.  In 2012, China surpassed Japan as the world's largest luxury market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China bans television ads for bling|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/08/business/china-bans-luxury-product-ads/index.html?hpt=hp_bn5|accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a blue paper on commercial development in China, released in 2010 by the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] (CASS), China's luxury goods market had increased to US$9.4 billion by the end of 2009. This accounted for 27.5% of the world's luxury goods market,&lt;ref name="China to be world's biggest luxury goods market"&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/90860/6991640.html China to be world's biggest luxury goods market in five years: blue paper]&lt;/ref&gt; an increase from 25% in 2008.&lt;ref name="people's daily"&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90778/90857/90860/6710402.html China becomes world's 2nd largest luxury market], [[People's Daily Online]], July 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On current growth rates, the luxury goods market in China is expected to grow to [[US$]]14.6 billion by 2014.&lt;ref name="korea it times"&gt;[http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/8980/keywords-learn-china Keywords to learn China], ''[[The Korea IT Times]]'', May 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market characteristics==
Chinese luxury goods consumers are younger than their [[Europe]]an counterparts, belonging to the 18-50 age group, compared to Europe's consumers who are generally in the over 40 age group. For this reason, China's luxury goods market is expected to grow faster than that of Europe's.&lt;ref name="korea it times"/&gt; Many of the young luxury goods buyers are self-employed or professionals. According to the consulting firm [[McKinsey &amp; Company]], 80% of Chinese luxury goods buyers are under 45, compared with 30% of luxury goods buyers in the United States and 19% in Japan.&lt;ref name="China appetite"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30670835/ns/business-world_business/ China still has an appetite for luxury goods]&lt;/ref&gt; Retail sales in China account for only 7% of global retail sales of luxury consumer goods; however, Chinese buyers account for 25% of global retail sales of luxury consumer goods. Many shops in international travel destinations have specialized staff devoted to Chinese customers.&lt;ref name=Caixin022613 /&gt; 

According to 2007 Global Luxury Survey by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, most luxury goods buyers in China buy luxury products as a [[status symbol]]. The top five luxury watch brands in the country are [[Rolex]], [[Omega SA|Omega]], [[Cartier SA|Cartier]], [[Vacheron Constantin]], and [[Breitling SA|Breitling]].&lt;ref name="2007 Global Luxury Survey"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1659346_1659333,00.html Global Luxury Survey: China], ''[[TIME]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a confidential report titled ''"China Luxury Market study 2010"'' in November 2010, the management consulting firm [[Bain &amp; Company]] noted the top three luxury brands in China are [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Chanel]] and [[Gucci]]. According to the report, watches and bags led the growth of the luxury market in 2010.

Following a ban instituted in October, 2012 on government agencies purchasing luxury goods, often used as "gifts", sales of luxury goods in China remained strong, but slowed, even falling slightly for some luxury retailers in the 4th quarter of 2012.&lt;ref name=Caixin022613&gt;{{cite news|title=China's Frills and Posh Market Springs a Leak: Wealthy Chinese consumers continue to drive global demand for luxury goods, but the engine is losing steam|url=http://english.caixin.com/2013-02-26/100494654.html|accessdate=February 26, 2013|newspaper=Caixin|date=February 26, 2013|author=Qu Yunxu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luxury cars==
Major global luxury brands like [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[BMW]], [[Audi]], and [[Lexus]] have operations in China. Audi, which has dominated China's luxury car market for more than two decades, is the market leader in the luxury car segment, with China being Audi's second largest market in the world. However Audi's market share in this category is gradually falling as BMW and Mercedes-Benz are adopting new strategies to boost sales. According to data from [[Global Insight]], Audi's market share in China decreased from 66% in 2004 to 42% in 2009, while the market share of BMW and Mercedes-Benz increased from 7% to 23%, and 9% to 16%, respectively. BMW is enlarging its current plant in China and building a second one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-21/audi-s-two-decade-china-dominance-threatened-by-bmw-mercedes.html Audi’s Two-Decade China Dominance Threatened by BMW, Mercedes], April 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audi is still the dominant choice of car in the government fleet market.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/business/global/in-china-car-brands-evoke-an-unexpected-set-of-stereotypes.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all|title=In China, Car Brands Evoke an Unexpected Set of Stereotypes|author=ANDREW JACOBS|author2=ADAM CENTURY  |date= November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMW sales are growing but is perceived to be for the newly rich.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Mercedes is seen to be for old folks.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Brands such as BMW and Audi are designing customized cars for the Chinese luxury car market. BMW designed a model with a longer wheelbase especially for government officials in order to give the back seat passenger more space. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/business/21573141-chinas-luxury-car-market-prizebut-not-local-firms-still-racing-ahead&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stephan Winkelmann, CEO of [[Lamborghini]], "China's super car market is growing faster than our expectations, while the Western markets are declining. The strong demand will soon make China our second biggest market after the United States. If the high taxes on luxury cars are removed, China could very well become the biggest market."&lt;ref name="Rich Chinese"&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/90860/6967022.html Rich Chinese fueling luxury car market growth], ''[[People's Daily Online]]'', April 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013 the trend continued as the number of luxury cars and [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s shown expanded at the Shanghai auto show and plans were announced by both foreign and domestic auto manufacturers to introduce new models in China and increase production of larger cars.&lt;ref name=NYT42113&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese Auto Buyers Grow Hungry for Larger Cars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/automobiles/autoshow/chinese-auto-market-shifts-toward-larger-cars.html|accessdate=April 22, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 21, 2013|author=Keith Bradsher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13249">'''Meta-reference''' is a special type of [[self-reference]] that can occur in all media or medial artefacts, for instance literature, film, painting, TV series, comic strips, or video games. It includes all references to, or comments on, a specific medium, medial artefact, or the media in general. These references and comments originate from a logically higher level (a 'meta-level') within any given artefact, and draw attention to -- or invite reflection about -- media-related issues (e.g. the production, performance, or reception) of said artefact, specific other artefacts (as in [[parody]]), or to parts, or the entirety, of the medial system. It is, therefore, the recipient's awareness of an artefact's medial quality that distinguishes meta-reference from more general forms of [[self-reference]]. Thus, meta-reference triggers media-awareness within the recipient, who, in turn "becomes conscious of both the medial (or 'fictional' in the sense of artificial and, sometimes in addition, 'invented') status of the work" as well as "the fact that media-related phenomena are at issue, rather than (hetero-)references to the world outside the media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies.|last=Wolf|first=Werner|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although certain devices, such as [[Mise en abyme (in literature and other media)|mise en abyme]], may be conducive to meta-reference, they are not necessarily metareferential themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Wolf|first=Werner|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, innately metareferential devices, such as [[metalepsis]], are to be seen as special cases of meta-reference. The terms meta-reference and [[metalepsis]] can, therefore, not be used synonymously.

== History of the concept and the term ==
While meta-reference as a concept is not a new phenomenon and can be observed in very early works of art and media not tied to specific purposes (e.g. Homer's invocation of the muses at the beginning of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' in order to deliver the epic better), the term itself is relatively new.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Werner|first=Wolf|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier discussions of metareferential issues often opt for more specific terminology tied to the respective discipline. Notable discussions of meta-reference include, but are not limited to, William H. Gass's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fiction and the Figures of Life|last=Gass|first=William|publisher=Knopf|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Scholes's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scholes|first=Robert|date=1970|title=Metafiction|url=|journal=Iowa Review|volume=1|pages=100-115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; exploration of [[metafiction]], Victor Stoichita's examination of early modern meta-painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Self-Aware Image. An Insight into Early Modern Meta-Painting|last=Stoichita|first=Victor|publisher=Studies in Baroque Art|year=2015|isbn=978-1909400115|location=Antwerp|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lionel Abel's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metatheatre. A New View of Dramatic Form.|last=Abel|first=Lionel|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigation of [[metatheatre]]. In the context of drama, meta-reference has also become colloquially known as the breaking of the [[fourth wall]]. The first study to underscore the problem resulting from the lack of cohesive terminology, as well as the necessity to acknowledge metareference as transmedial and trans-generic phenomenon, was published in 2007 by Hauthal et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/155834217|title=Metaisierung in Literatur und anderen Medien : theoretische Grundlagen, historische Perspektiven, Metagattungen, Funktionen|date=2007|publisher=De Gruyter|others=Hauthal, Janine.|isbn=3110199459|location=Berlin|oclc=155834217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publications by Nöth and Bishara&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/471132600|title=Self-reference in the media|date=2007|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|others=Bishara, Nina, 1977-, Nöth, Winfried.|isbn=3110194643|location=Berlin|oclc=471132600}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Wolf&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/436342321|title=Metareference across media : theory and case studies|date=2009|publisher=Rodopi|others=Wolf, Werner, 1955-, Bantleon, Katharina., Thoss, Jeff., Bernhart, Walter.|isbn=9789042026704|location=Amsterdam|oclc=436342321}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed suit, raised similar concerns, included case studies from various media, coined and helped establish the more uniform umbrella term meta-reference as define above.

== Examples ==
While every medium has the potential for meta-reference, some media can transport meta-reference more easily than others. Media that can easily realise its meta-referential potential includes, for instance, literature, painting, and film. Although music can be meta-referential even outside the confines of lyrics, meta-reference in music is much harder to create or detect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Michaelsen|first=René|date=|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|editor-last=Wolf|editor-first=Werner|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=235-259|chapter=Exploring Metareference in Instrumental Music -- The Case of Robert Schumann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Self-Reference in the Media|last=Wolf|first=Werner|date=|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|year=2007|isbn=978-3-11-019464-7|editor-last=Nöth|editor-first=Winfried|location=Berlin|pages=303-325|chapter=Metafiction and Metamusic: Exploring the Limits of Metareference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music, therefore, would be a less typical medium for the occurrence of meta-reference. Nöth argues in this context that although non-verbal media can be the home of meta-reference, the contained meta-reference can only be implicit because non-verbal media can only show similarites, but never point directly (or explicitly) to meta-referential elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Nöth|first=Winfried|date=|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|editor-last=Wolf|editor-first=Werner|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=889-121|chapter=Metareference from a Semiotic Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, argue that meta-reference is explicit as long as it is clear.

=== Literature ===
John Fowles begins chapter 13 of his novel ''The French Lieutenant's Woman'' with the words&lt;blockquote&gt;This ''story'' I am ''telling'' is all ''imagination''. These ''characters'' I create never existed outside my own mind. If I have pretended until now to know my ''characters''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' mind and innermost thoughts, it is because I am ''writing'' in [...] a ''convention'' universally accepted at the time of my ''story'': that the ''novelist'' stands next to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The French Lieutenant's Woman|last=Fowels|first=John|publisher=Vintage|year=2005|isbn=978-0-099-49707-3|location=London|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; [emphases added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is an example of explicit meta-reference because the text draws attention to the fact that the novel the recipient is reading is merely a fiction created by the author. It also foregrounds the convention that readers of realist fiction accept the presence of an all-knowing narrator, and breaks it by allowing the narrator to take centre stage which invites meta-reflections by the recipient.

=== Film ===
''[[The Truman Show]]'' is a movie that contains a high degree of meta-reference. Truman, the protagonist, is unaware that he is part of a reality TV show, but the audience knows about the artificiality of both Truman's life and, by extension, the movie that is being watched. This is underscored by putting emphasis on the production process of the fictional reality TV show, which makes the audience aware of the same features being used in the movie at the time of watching. Further examples of meta-reference in the movie include spotlights falling from the sky seemingly out of the blue, or a raincloud which is curiously only raining on Truman following him around on Seahaven Beach. Both instances point to the artificiality of Truman's life as well as the film itself.

=== Painting ===
[[File:Edouard Manet - The Balcony - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|214x214px|
Manet, ''The Balcony''
]]
An example of meta-reference in painting is ''Manet's Balcony'' by [[René Magritte]]. It comments on another painting, [[The Balcony (painting)|''The Balcony'']] by [[Édouard Manet]], by mimicking both the setting of the balcony as well as the poses of the depicted people, but places them in coffins. Thus, the recipient's attention is drawn to the fact that not only are the people in the painting long dead and only still 'alive' in the representation, but arguably also that the artist ([[Édouard Manet|Manet]]) and the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting style are just as dead as the portrayed individuals. Furthermore, it is foregrounded that the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting style is just a style that may be copied, which further emphasises the fact that both works are only paintings created in a specific way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3358">'''Narrativity''' is the extent to which a text tells a story,&lt;ref&gt;Sturgess, P. J. M. (1992). ''Narrativity: Theory and practice.'' Oxford, UK: Clarendon.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a storyteller's account of an event or a sequence of events leading to a transition from an initial state to a later state or outcome. There are four theoretical foundations of narrativity, represented by the notions of 
# [[narrative|narrative content]],
# [[narrative discourse]],
# [[Transportation theory (psychology)|narrative transportation]], and
# [[Transportation theory (psychology)|narrative persuasion]].
Narrative content and discourse are the linguistic antecedents of narrativity. Narrative content reflects the linear sequence of events as characters live through them—that is, the backbone and structure describing who did what, where, when, and why. Narrative discourse represents how the story is told—that is, storytellers' use of literary devices to expand on the narrative content, such as emotional change over the course of the story line and sequencing of events to create drama. Narrative transportation is the engrossing, transformational experience of being swept away by a story.&lt;ref&gt;van Laer, T., de Ruyter, K., Visconti, L. M., &amp; Wetzels, M. (2014). "The Extended Transportation-Imagery Model: A meta-analysis of the antecedents and consequences of story receivers' narrative transportation." ''Journal of Consumer Research, 40''(5), 797–817. {{ssrn|2033192}}. {{jstor|10.1086/673383}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative persuasion is the effect of narrative transportation, which manifests itself in story receivers' positive attitudes toward the story, story-consistent attitudes toward the experience described therein, and story-consistent intentions. The higher the quality of narrative content and discourse in a text, the greater its narrativity and its real-world implications, such as narrative transportation and persuasion, as van Laer, Escalas, Ludwig, and van den Hende&lt;ref&gt;van Laer, T., Escalas, J. E., Ludwig, S., &amp; van den Hende, E. A. (2018). "What happens in Vegas stays on TripAdvisor? A theory and technique to understand narrativity in consumer reviews." ''Journal of Consumer Research''. {{ssrn|2702484}}. {{doi|10.1093/jcr/ucy067}}&lt;/ref&gt; show.

== The theory of narrativity ==
The extent to which story receivers experience narrative transportation and are "lost" in the narrative world depends on the level of narrativity of a text. Narratologists distinguish two components of narrativity: content and discourse. The difference between narrative content and narrative discourse is the difference between what is conveyed and how it is conveyed. The features of narrative content align with the structural components of a story (i.e., characters and events). Literary devices, which grant storytellers the power to frame the narrative, are associated with narrative discourse. Variations in these narrative elements affect transportation into the narrative and subsequent persuasion, as the theory of narrativity proposes.

'''Native American identity in the United States''' is an evolving topic based on the struggle to define "[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]" or "(American) Indian" both for people who consider themselves Native American and for people who do not.  Some people seek an [[Identity (social science)|identity]] that will provide for a stable definition for legal, social, and personal purposes.  There are a number of different factors which have been used to define "Indianness," and the source and potential use of the definition play a role in what definition is used. Facets which characterize "Indianness" include [[culture]], [[society]], [[genes]]/[[biology]], [[law]], and [[self-identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Garroutte (2003), Paredes (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  An important question is whether the definition should be dynamic and changeable across time and situation, or whether it is possible to define "Indianness" in a static way.&lt;ref name="Peroff 1997 p487"&gt;Peroff (1997) p487&lt;/ref&gt;  The dynamic definitions may be based in how Indians adapt and adjust to dominant society, which may be called an "oppositional process" by which the boundaries between Indians and the dominant groups are maintained.  Another reason for dynamic definitions is the process of "[[ethnogenesis]]", which is the process by which the ethnic identity of the group is developed and renewed as social organizations and cultures evolve.&lt;ref name="Peroff 1997 p487"/&gt;  The question of identity, especially [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] identity, is common in many societies worldwide.&lt;ref name="Peroff 1997 p487"/&gt;

The future of their identity is extremely important to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s.  Activist [[Russell Means]] spoke frequently about the crumbling Indian way of life, the loss of traditions, languages, and sacred places. He was concerned that there may soon be no more Native Americans, only "Native American Americans, like [[Polish American]]s and [[Italian American]]s." As the number of Indians has grown (ten times as many today as in 1890), the number who carry on tribal traditions shrinks (one fifth as many as in 1890), as has been common among many ethnic groups over time.  Means said, "We might speak our language, we might look like Indians and sound like Indians, but we won’t be Indians."&lt;ref&gt;Peroff (1997) p492&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
There are various ways in which Indian identity has been defined.  Some definitions seek universal applicability, while others only seek definitions for particular purposes, such as for tribal membership or for the purposes of legal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  The individual seeks to have a personal identity that matches social and legal definitions, although perhaps any definition will fail to categorize correctly the identity of everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Garroutte (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

American Indians were perhaps clearly identifiable at the turn of the 20th century, but today the concept is contested.  Malcolm Margolin, co-editor of ''News From Native California'' muses, "I don’t know what an Indian is... [but] Some people are clearly Indian, and some are clearly not."&lt;ref&gt;Peroff (1997) p489 quoting Fost (1991) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cherokee]] Chief (from 1985–1995) [[Wilma Mankiller]] echoes: "An Indian is an Indian regardless of the degree of Indian blood or which little government card they do or do not possess."&lt;ref&gt;Sheffield p107-108 quoted from Hales 1990b: 3A - Hales, Donna. 1990a "Tribe Touts Unregistered Artists", Muskogee (Okla.) ''Daily Phoenix'', September 3, 1990 1A 10A&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, it is difficult to know what might be meant by any Native American ''racial'' identity.  Race is a disputed term, but is often said to be a [[Race (human classification)|social (or political)]] rather than [[Race (biology)|biological construct]].  The issue of Native American racial identity was discussed by [[Steve Russell (writer)|Steve Russell]] (2002, p68), "American Indians have always had the theoretical option of removing themselves from a tribal community and becoming legally white.  American law has made it easy for Indians to disappear because that disappearance has always been necessary to the '[[Manifest Destiny]]' that the United States span the continent that was, after all, occupied."  Russell contrasts this with the reminder that Native Americans are "members of communities before members of a race."&lt;ref&gt;Russell (2002) p68 is quoting López (1994) p55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional===
[[File:teepee-logcabin.jpg|thumb|250px|Reservation life has often been a blend of the traditional and the contemporary. In 1877, this Lakota family living at South Dakota's Rose Bud Agency had both [[tipi]]s and log cabins.]]
Traditional definitions of "Indianness" are also important.  There is a sense of "peoplehood" which links Indianness to sacred traditions, places, and shared history as indigenous people.&lt;ref name="Peroff 1997 p487"/&gt;  This definition transcends academic and legal terminology.&lt;ref name="Peroff 1997 p487"/&gt;  Language is also seen as an important part of identity, and learning [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native languages]], especially for youth in a community, is an important part in tribal survival.&lt;ref&gt;Etheridge (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Indian artists find traditional definitions especially important. [[Crow Nation|Crow]] poet [[Henry Real Bird]] offers his own definition, "An Indian is one who offers tobacco to the ground, feeds the water, and prays to the four winds in his own language."  Pulitzer Prize-winning [[Kiowa]] author [[N. Scott Momaday]] gives a definition that is less spiritual but still based in the traditions and experience of a person and their family, "An Indian is someone who thinks of themselves as an Indian.  But that's not so easy to do and one has to earn the entitlement somehow.  You have to have a certain experience of the world in order to formulate this idea.  I consider myself an Indian; I've had the experience of an Indian.  I know how my father saw the world, and his father before him."&lt;ref&gt;Bordewich (1996) p67&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructed as an imagined community ===
Some social scientists relate the uncertainty of Native American identity to the theory of the constructed nature of identity.  Many social scientists discuss the construction of identity.  [[Benedict Anderson]]'s "[[imagined communities]]" are an example.  However, some see construction of identity as being part of how a group remembers its past, tells its stories, and interprets its [[myths]].  Thus [[cultural identity]] is made within the discourses of history and culture.  Identity thus may not be a fact based in the essence of a person, but a positioning, based in politics and social situations.&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1997) p53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood quantum===
A common source of definition for an individual's being Indian is based on their blood (ancestry) quantum (often one-fourth) or documented Indian heritage.  Almost two-thirds of all Indian federally recognized Indian tribes in the United States require a certain blood quantum for membership.&lt;ref&gt;Garroutte (2003) p16&lt;/ref&gt; Indian heritage is a requirement for membership in most American Indian Tribes.&lt;ref name="Peroff 1997 p487"/&gt;  The [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934 used three criteria: tribal membership, ancestral descent, and blood quantum (one half).  This was very influential in using blood quantum to restrict the definition of Indian.&lt;ref&gt;Brownell (2001) p284&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of blood quantum is seen by some as problematic as Indians [[interracial marriage|marry out to other groups]] at a higher rate than any other [[demography of the United States|United States ethnic or racial category]].  This could ultimately lead to their absorption into the rest of multiracial American society.&lt;ref&gt;Peroff (1997) p487 gives the rate of interracial marriage for Native Americans as 75%, whites as 5% and blacks as 8%&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residence on tribal lands===
[[File:Bia-map-indian-reservations-usa.png|left|thumb|300px|BIA map of reservations in the United States]]
Related to the remembrance and practice of traditions is the residence on tribal lands and [[Indian reservation]]s.  Peroff (2002) emphasizes the role that proximity to other Native Americans (and ultimately proximity to tribal lands) plays in one's identity as a Native American.&lt;ref&gt;Peroff (2002) uses complexity theory methods to model the maintenance of traditions and self-identity based on proximity.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction by others===
[[File:Bismarck Indian School.jpg|thumb|left|Students at the Bismarck Indian School in the early twentieth century.]]
European conceptions of "Indianness" are notable both for how they influence how American Indians see themselves and for how they have persisted as stereotypes which may negatively affect treatment of Indians.  The [[noble savage]] stereotype is famous, but [[European colonization of the Americas|American colonists]] held other stereotypes as well.  For example, some colonists imagined Indians as living in a state similar to their own ancestors, for example the [[Pict]]s, [[Gaul]]s, and [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] before "[[Julius Caesar]] with his [[Roman legion]]s (or some other) had ... laid the ground to make us tame and civil."&lt;ref&gt;quoted from Robert Johnson, promoter for the fledgling Virginia Colony in Dyar (2003) p819&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and 20th century, particularly until [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]]'s tenure as Commissioner of Indian Affairs began in 1933, various policies of the United States federal and state governments amounted to an attack on Indian cultural identity and attempt to force assimilation.  These policies included but were not limited to the banning of traditional religious ceremonies; forcing traditional hunter-gatherer people to begin farming, often on land that was unsuitable and produced few or no crops; forced cutting of hair; coercing "conversion" to [[Christianity]] by withholding rations; coercing Indian parents to send their children to boarding schools where the use of [[Native American languages]] was not permitted; freedom of speech restrictions; and restricted allowances of travel between reservations.&lt;ref&gt;Russell (2002) p66-67&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Southwest sections of the U.S. under Spanish control until 1810, where the majority (80%) of inhabitants were Indigenous, Spanish government officials had similar policies.&lt;ref&gt;Russell (2002) p67&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States government definitions===
{{main|Native American recognition in the United States}}
[[File:IndianAct2.jpg|right|thumbnail|President Coolidge stands with four [[Osage Nation|Osage Indians]] at a White House ceremony]]
Some authors have pointed to a connection between social identity of Native Americans and their political status as members of a tribe.rev&lt;ref&gt; Ray (2007) p399&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 561 [[List of Native American Tribal Entities|federally recognized tribal governments]] in the United States, which are recognized as having the right to establish their own legal requirements for membership.&lt;ref&gt;This right was upheld by the US Supreme Court in [[Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez]] in 1978, which is discussed in Ray (2007) p403, see also {{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2005/January/200501281313241CJsamohT0.7689478.html|work=america.gov|title=The U.S. Relationship To American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes|accessdate=February 8, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519065837/https://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2005/January/200501281313241CJsamohT0.7689478.html|archivedate=May 19, 2009|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent times, legislation related to Indians uses the "political" definition of identifying as Indians those who are members of federally recognized tribes. Most often given is the two-part definition: an "Indian" is someone who is a member of an Indian tribe and an "Indian tribe" is any tribe, band, nation, or organized Indian community recognized by the United States.

The government and many tribes prefer this definition because it allows the tribes to determine the meaning of "Indianness" in their own membership criteria.  However, some still criticize this saying that the federal government's historic role in setting certain conditions on the nature of membership criteria means that this definition does not transcend federal government influence.&lt;ref name="Brownell 2001 p299"&gt;Brownell (2001) p299&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus in some sense, one has greater claim to a Native American identity if one belongs to a federally recognized tribe, recognition that many who claim Indian identity do not have.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel remarks that 1,878,285 people marked Native American as their ethnicity on the 1990 US Census, while the number of members of federally recognized tribes is much smaller, Nagel (1995) p948&lt;/ref&gt;  Holly Reckord, an anthropologist who heads the BIA Branch of Acknowledgment and Recognition, discusses the most common outcome for those who seek membership: "We check and find that they haven't a trace of Indian ancestry, yet they are still totally convinced that they are Indians.  Even if you have a trace of Indian blood, why do you want to select that for your identity, and not your Irish or Italian? It's not clear why, but at this point in time, a lot of people want to be Indian.".&lt;ref&gt;Bordewich (1996) 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990|Arts and Crafts Act]] of 1990 attempts to take into account the limits of definitions based in federally recognized tribal membership.  In the act, having the status of a state-recognized Indian tribe is discussed, as well as having tribal recognition as an "Indian artisan" independent of tribal membership.  In certain circumstances, this allows people who identify as Indian to legally label their products as "Indian made", even when they are not members of a federally recognized tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Brownell (2001) p313&lt;/ref&gt;  In legislative hearings, one Indian artist, whose mother is not Indian but whose father is [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] and who was raised on a Seneca reservation, said, "I do not question the rights of the tribes to set whatever criteria they want for enrollment eligibility; but in my view, that is the extent of their rights, to say who is an enrolled Seneca or [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] or [[Navajo people|Navajo]] or [[Cheyenne]] or any other tribe.  Since there are mixed bloods with enrollment numbers and some of those with very small percentages of genetic Indian ancestry, I don't feel they have the right to say to those of us without enrollment numbers that we are not of Indian heritage, only that we are not enrolled.... To say that I am not [Indian] and to prosecute me for telling people of my Indian heritage is to deny me some of my [[civil liberties]]...and constitutes racial discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;Brownell (2001) p314&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics believe that using federal laws to define "Indian" allows continued government control over Indians, even as the government seeks to establish a sense of deference to tribal sovereignty.  Critics say Indianness becomes a rigid legal term defined by the BIA, rather than an expression of tradition, history, and culture.  For instance, some groups which claim descendants from tribes that predate European contact have not been able to achieve federal recognition. On the other hand, Indian tribes have participated in setting policy with BIA as to how tribes should be recognized.  According to Rennard Strickland, an Indian Law scholar, the federal government uses the process of recognizing groups to "divide and conquer Indians: "the question of who is 'more' or 'most' Indian may draw people away from common concerns."&lt;ref&gt;Brownell (2001) p302&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-identification===
{{Further|List of people of self-identified Cherokee ancestry}}
In some cases, one's opinion about one's self is sufficient to define one as Indian.  One can often choose to identify as Indian without outside verification when filling out a census form, a college application, or writing a letter to the editor of a newspaper.&lt;ref name="Peroff 1997 p487"/&gt; A "self-identified Indian" is a person who may not satisfy the legal requirements which define a Native American according to the United States government or a single tribe, but who understands and expresses her own identity as Native American.&lt;ref&gt;Garroutte (2003) p82&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many people who do not satisfy tribal requirements identify themselves as Native American - whether due to biology, culture, or some other reason.  The [[United States census]] allows citizens to check any ethnicity without requirements of validation.  Thus, the census allows individuals to self-identify as Indian, merely by checking the racial category, "Native American/Alaska Native".&lt;ref&gt;Brownell (2001) p276-277 notes that much of the $180 billion dollars a year in federal money for the benefit of Indians are apportioned on the basis of this census population&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, about 60 percent of the more than 1.8 million persons identifying themselves in the census as American Indian were actually enrolled in a federally recognized tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton 1997, page 38&lt;/ref&gt;  Using self identification allows both uniformity and includes many different ideas of "Indianness".&lt;ref name="Brownell 2001 p315"&gt;Brownell (2001) p315&lt;/ref&gt;  It also avoids marginalizing the nearly half a million who receive no benefits because 
* they are not enrolled members of a federally recognized tribe, or
* they are full members of tribes which have never been recognized, or
* they are members of tribes whose recognition was terminated by the government during programs in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="Brownell 2001 p299"/&gt;

Identity is in some way a personal issue; based on the way one feels about oneself and one's experiences.  Horse (2001) describes five influences on self-identity as Indian:
*"The extent to which one is grounded in one’s Native American language and culture, one’s cultural identity";
*"The validity of one’s American Indian genealogy";
*"The extent to which one holds a traditional American Indian general philosophy or worldview (emphasizing balance and harmony and drawing on Indian spirituality)";
*"One’s self-concept as an American Indian"; and
*"One’s enrollment (or lack of it) in a tribe."&lt;ref&gt;Horse (2005) p65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Kansas]] sociologist Joane Nagel traces the tripling in the number of Americans reporting American Indian as their race in the U.S. Census from 1960 to 1990 (from 523,591 to 1,878,285) to federal Indian policy, American ethnic politics, and American Indian political activism.  Much of the population "growth" was due to "[[ethnic switching]]", where people who previously marked one group, later mark another.  This is made possible by our increasing stress on ethnicity as a social construct.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel (1995) p948&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, since 2000 [[self-identification]] in US censuses has allowed individuals to check multiple ethnic categories, which is a factor in the increased American Indian population since the 1990 census.&lt;ref&gt;Russell 149&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, self-identification is problematic on many levels.  It is sometimes said, in fun, that the largest tribe in the United States may be the "[[Poseur|Wantabes]]".&lt;ref name="Brownell 2001 p315"/&gt;

Garroutte identifies some practical problems with self-identification as a policy, quoting the struggles of Indian service providers who deal with many people who claim ancestors, some steps removed, who were Indian. She quotes a social worker, "Hell, if all that was real, there are more Cherokees in the world than there are [[Chinese people|Chinese]]."&lt;ref&gt;Garroutte (2003) p83&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Personal reasons for self-identification ====
Many individuals seek broader definitions of Indian for personal reasons.  Some people whose careers involve the fact that they emphasize Native American heritage and self-identify as Native American face difficulties if their appearance, behavior, or tribal membership status does not conform to legal and social definitions.  Some have a longing for recognition.  Cynthia Hunt, who self-identifies as a member of the [[state-recognized]] [[Lumbee]] tribe, says: "I feel as if I'm not a real Indian until I've got that BIA stamp of approval .... You're told all your life that you're Indian, but sometimes you want to be that kind of Indian that everybody else accepts as Indian."&lt;ref&gt;Brownell (2001) p275&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance that one "look Indian" can be greater than one's biological or legal status.  Native American Literature professor Becca Gercken-Hawkins writes about the trouble of recognition for those who do not look Indian; "I self-identify as Cherokee and [[Irish American]], and even though I do not look especially Indian with my dark curly hair and light skin, I easily meet my tribe's blood quantum standards.  My family has been working for years to get the documentation that will allow us to be enrolled members of the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]].  Because of my appearance and my lack of enrollment status, I expect questions regarding my identity, but even so, I was surprised when a fellow graduate student advised me—in all seriousness—to [[straighten my hair]] and work on a tan before any interviews.  Thinking she was joking, I asked if I should put a feather in my hair, and she replied with a straight face that a feather might be a bit much, but I should at least wear traditional Native jewelry."&lt;ref&gt;Gercken-Hawkins (2003) p200&lt;/ref&gt;

Cherokee/[[Choctaw]] author [[Louis Owens]] discusses his feelings about his status of not being a real Indian because he's not enrolled. "Because growing up in different times, I naively thought that Indian was something we were, not something we did or had or were required to prove on demand. Listening to my mother's stories about [[Oklahoma]], about brutally hard lives and dreams that cut across the fabric of every experience, I thought I was Indian."&lt;ref&gt;Eva Marie Garroutte opens with these lines in her book, ''Real Indians: identity and the survival of Native America''. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic struggles==
[[Florida State]] anthropologist J. Anthony Paredes considers the question of Indianness that may be asked about pre-ceramic peoples (what modern archaeologists call the [[Archaic period in the Americas|"Early" and "Middle Archaic" period]]), pre-maize burial mound cultures, etc.  Paredes asks, "Would any &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] high priest&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; have been any less awed than ourselves to come upon a so-called [[Paleo-Indian]] hunter hurling a spear at a woolly [[mastodon]]?"  His question reflects the point that indigenous cultures are themselves the products of millennia of history and change.&lt;ref&gt;Paredes (1995) p346&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of "Indianness" was different in colonial times.  Integration into Indian tribes was not difficult, as Indians typically accepted persons based not on ethnic or racial characteristics, but on learnable and acquirable designators such as "language, culturally appropriate behavior, social affiliation, and loyalty."&lt;ref name="Dyar 2003 p823"&gt;Dyar (2003) p823&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-Indian captives were often adopted into society, including, famously, [[Mary Jemison]].  As a side note, the "[[Running the gauntlet|gauntlet]]" was a ceremony that was often misunderstood as a form of torture, or punishment but within Indian society was seen as a ritual way for the captives to leave their European society and become a tribal member.&lt;ref name="Dyar 2003 p823"/&gt;

[[File:John Ross of the Cherokee.jpg|thumb|left|Cherokee chief John Ross]]
Since the mid-19th century, controversy and competition have worked both within and outside tribes, as societies evolved. In the early 1860s, novelist [[John Rollin Ridge]] led a group of delegates to [[Washington D.C.]] in an attempt to gain federal recognition for a "Southern Cherokee Nation" which was a faction that was opposed to the leadership of rival faction leader and Cherokee Chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]].&lt;ref name="Christiensen 1992"&gt;Christiensen 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, [[Arthur C. Parker]], [[Carlos Montezuma]], and others founded the [[Society of American Indians]] as the first national association founded and run primarily by Native Americans.  The group campaigned for full citizenship for Indians, and other reforms, goals similar to other groups and fraternal clubs, which led to blurred distinctions between the different groups and their members.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (2005) p141&lt;/ref&gt;  With different groups and people of different ethnicities involved in parallel and often competing groups, accusations that one was not a real Indian was a painful accusation for those involved.  In 1918, [[Arapaho]] Cleaver Warden testified in hearings related to Indian religious ceremonies, "We only ask a fair and impartial trial by reasonable white people, not half-breeds who do not know a bit of their ancestors or kindred. A true Indian is one who helps for a race and not that secretary of the [[Society of American Indians]]."

In the 1920s, a famous court case was set to investigate the ethnic identity of a woman known as "[[Princess Chinquilla]]" and her associate [[Red Fox James]] (aka Skiuhushu).&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (2005) p139&lt;/ref&gt; Chinquilla was a New York woman who claimed to have been separated from her Cheyenne parents at birth.  She and James created a fraternal club which was to counter existing groups "founded by white people to help the red race" in that it was founded by Indians.  The club's opening received much praise for supporting this purpose, and was seen as authentic; it involved a Council Fire, the peace pipe, and speeches by [[Robert Ely]], [[White Horse Eagle]], and [[American Indian Defense Association]] President Haven Emerson.  In the 1920s, fraternal clubs were common in New York, and titles such as "princess" and "chief" were bestowed by the club to Natives and non-Natives.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (2005) p143&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed non-Natives to "try on" Indian identities.

Just as the struggle for recognition is not new, Indian entrepreneurship based on that recognition is not new.  An example is a stipulation of the [[Creek Treaty of 1805]] that gave [[Creek people|Creeks]] the exclusive right to operate certain ferries and "houses of entertainment" along a federal road from [[Ocmulgee, Georgia]] to [[Mobile, Alabama]], as the road went over parts of Creek Nation land purchased as an easement.&lt;ref&gt;Paredes (1995) p357&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unity and nationalism==

[[File:Tecumseh02.jpg|right|thumb|1848 drawing of Tecumseh was based on a sketch done from life in 1808.]]
The issue of Indianness had somewhat expanded meaning in the 1960s with Indian nationalist movements such as the [[American Indian Movement]].  The American Indian Movement unified nationalist identity was in contrast to the "brotherhood of tribes" nationalism of groups like the [[National Indian Youth Council]] and the [[National Congress of American Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonney (1977) p210&lt;/ref&gt;  This unified Indian identity has been cited to the teachings of 19th century [[Shawnee]] leader [[Tecumseh]] to unify all Indians against "white oppression."&lt;ref&gt;Particularly cited is Tecumseh's concern with the alienation of Indian lands and his 1812 statement about Indian unity as discussed in Bonney (1977) p229&lt;/ref&gt; The movements of the 1960s changed dramatically how Indians see their identity, both as separate from whites, as a member of a tribe, and as a member of a unified category encompassing all Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Schulz (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Different tribes have unique cultures, histories, and situations that have made particular the question of identity in each tribe.  Tribal membership may be based on descent, blood quantum, and/or reservation habitation.

===Cherokee===

Historically, race was not a factor in the acceptance of individuals into [[Cherokee society]], since historically, the [[Cherokee people]] viewed their self-identity as a political rather than racial distinction.&lt;ref&gt;AIRFA Federal Precedence Applied in State Court {{cite web |url=http://www.nativeamericanchurch.net/stott.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929230402/http://www.nativeamericanchurch.net/stott.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Going far back into antiquity based upon existing social and historical evidence as well as oral traditions among the [[Cherokee]] themselves, the Cherokee society was best described as an Indian Republic. Race and [[blood quantum]] are not factors in [[Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma]] tribal citizenship eligibility. To be considered a citizen in the Cherokee Nation, an individual needs a direct Indian ancestor listed on the [[Dawes Rolls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherokee.org/home.aspx?section=services&amp;service=Registration&amp;ID=8sRG9ZCF7PE=|title=Cherokee Nation  &gt; Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribe currently has members who also have African, Latino, Asian, white and other ancestry, and an estimated 75% of tribal members are less than one-quarter Indian by blood.&lt;ref&gt;https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/politics/disappearing-indians-part-ii-the-hypocrisy-of-race-in-deciding-whos-enrolled/&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous [[Cherokee heritage groups]] operate in the [[Southeastern U.S.]].

Theda Perdue (2000) recounts a story from "before the American Revolution" where a black slave named Molly is accepted as a Cherokee as a "replacement" for a woman who was beaten to death by her white husband.  According to Cherokee tradition, vengeance for the woman's death was required for her soul to find peace, and the husband was able to prevent his own execution by fleeing to the town of [[Chota (Cherokee town)|Chota]] (where according to Cherokee Law he was safe) and purchasing Molly as an exchange.  When the wives family accepted Molly, later known as "Chickaw," she became a part of their clan (the [[Deer Clan]]), and thus Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Inheritance was largely matrilineal, and kinship and clan membership was of primary importance until around 1810, when the seven [[Cherokee clans]] began the abolition of blood vengeance by giving the sacred duty to the new Cherokee National government.  Clans formally relinquished judicial responsibilities by the 1820s when the Cherokee Supreme Court was established.   When in 1825, the National Council extended citizenship to biracial children of Cherokee men, the matrilineal definition of clans was broken and clan membership no longer defined Cherokee citizenship.  These ideas were largely incorporated into the 1827 Cherokee constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue (2000) p564&lt;/ref&gt;  The constitution did, state that "No person who is of negro or mulatlo [sic]parentage, either by the father or mother side, shall be eligible to hold any office of profit, honor or trust under this Government," with an exception for, "negroes and descendants of white and Indian men by negro women who may have been set free."&lt;ref&gt;Perdue (2000) p564-565&lt;/ref&gt; Although by this time, some Cherokee considered clans to be anachronistic, this feeling may have been more widely held among the elite than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue (2000) p566&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus even in the initial constitution, the Cherokee reserved the right to define who was and was not Cherokee as a political rather than racial distinction.  Novelist [[John Rollin Ridge]] led a group of delegates to Washington D.C. as early as the 1860s in an attempt to gain federal recognition for a "Southern Cherokee Nation" which was a faction that was opposed to the leadership of rival faction leader and Cherokee Chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]].&lt;ref name="Christiensen 1992"/&gt;

===Navajo===
Most of the 158,633 [[Navajo people|Navajo]]s enumerated in the 1980 census and the 219,198 Navajos enumerated in the 1990 census were enrolled in the [[Navajo Nation]], which is the nation with the largest number of enrolled citizens.  It is notable as there is only a small number of people who identify as Navajo who are not registered.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lumbee===

When the [[Lumbee]] of [[North Carolina]] petitioned for recognition in 1974, many federally recognized tribes adamantly opposed them.  These tribes made no secret of their fear that passage of the legislation would dilute services to historically recognized tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Brownell (2001) p304&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lumbee were at one point known by the state as the Cherokee tribe of Robeson County and applied for federal benefits under that name in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Barrett 2007"&gt;Barrett (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] has been at the forefront of the opposition of the Lumbee.  It is sometimes noted that if granted full federal recognition, the designation would bring tens of millions of dollars in federal benefits, and also the chance to open a casino along Interstate 95 (which would compete with a nearby Eastern Cherokee Nation casino).&lt;ref name="Barrett 2007"/&gt;

'''Piblokto''', also known as '''pibloktoq''' and '''Arctic hysteria''', is a condition most commonly appearing in [[Inughuit]] ([[Greenlandic Inuit]]) societies living within the [[Arctic Circle]]. Piblokto is a culture-specific hysterical reaction in [[Inuit]], especially women, who may perform irrational or dangerous acts, followed by amnesia for the event. Piblokto may be linked to repression of the personality of [[Inuit women]].&lt;ref&gt;Segen's Medical Dictionary. (2012). Farlex, Inc. [http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Pibloktoq ''Pibloktoq'']&lt;/ref&gt; The condition appears most commonly in winter.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Shelor, N., &amp; Abdelnour, M. (1972). [http://soar.wichita.edu/xmlui//handle/10057/1641 Nutritional ecology: a new perspective].&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be a form of a [[culture-bound syndrome]], although more recent studies (see ''Skepticism'' section) question whether it exists at all. Piblokto is also part of the glossary of cultural bound syndromes found in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV).&lt;ref&gt;Mezzich, Juan E. (2002). "International Surveys on the Use of ICD-10 and Related Diagnostic Systems" (guest editorial, abstract). Psychopathology. doi:10.1159/000065122. {{PMID|12145487}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Piblokto was first documented in 1892 and reports by European explorers describe the phenomenon as common to all [[Arctic]] regions. Explorers were the first to notice piblokto. Among these, Admiral [[Robert Peary]] provided a detailed look into the disorder during an expedition to [[Greenland]]. The acts Peary and his men witnessed among the Inuit women provided entertainment, and, having sent the women's male counterparts out on missions, Peary's men reaped the sexual benefits of being the only males present.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Anthony F.C. and Robert E. Ackerman. (Anthropologica, 1960). Pibloktoq-An Interdisciplinary Approach to Mental Disorder among the Polar Eskimos of Northwest Greenland.Vol. II(2):249-260&lt;/ref&gt; Piblokto is not limited to the [[Circumpolar peoples|indigenous people]]; reports of stranded sailors during the 1800s exhibiting the same symptoms have been found. The disorder is said to have existed before Western contact and still occurs today.&lt;ref&gt;Lister,J. [http://soar-dev.wichita.edu/bitstream/handle/10057/1813/LAJ_v20_p111-129.pdf.txt?sequence=3 TWO PERSPECTIVES ON THE ETIOLOGY OF PIBLOKTOQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220023309/http://soar-dev.wichita.edu/bitstream/handle/10057/1813/LAJ_v20_p111-129.pdf.txt?sequence=3 |date=2015-02-20 }}.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, as discussed below, many scholars now hold that culture bound disorders may often be an artifact of colonial encounters, and contemporary discussions of piblokto in [[medical anthropology]] and [[cross-cultural psychiatry]] consider it to be an example of the suspect nature of [[culture bound syndromes]].&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Karen. 2013. A Disability of the Soul: An Ethnography of Disability and Mental Illness in Contemporary Japan. Cornell University Press. p98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Piblokto is most often found but not confined to the [[Inuit culture|Inughuit culture]] in the [[Polar regions of Earth|polar regions]] of northern Greenland. Similar symptoms have been reported in European sailors stranded in [[Arctic]] regions in the 1800s. Among the Inughuit, the attacks are not considered out of the ordinary. No native theory of the disorder is currently reported. This condition is most often seen in Inughuit women.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz, P. (2007) [http://www.sequeltsi.com/files/library/Understanding_Cultural_Identity.pdf Focusing on Culture and Ethnicity in America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326002708/http://www.sequeltsi.com/files/library/Understanding_Cultural_Identity.pdf |date=2012-03-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Piblokto is most common during long [[Polar night|Arctic nights]].&lt;ref&gt;Brill, A. (August 1913) [http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Citation/1913/08000/Piblokto_or_Hysteria_Among_Peary_s_Eskimos.2.aspx Piblokto or Hysteria Among Peary's Eskimos]. Volume 40. Issue 8. pp. 514-520.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
Piblokto is an abrupt dissociative episode with four phases: social withdrawal, excitement, convulsions and stupor, and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Fulk,M. (2012) [http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/328614.html Pibloktoq].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Although there is no known cause for piblokto, Western scientists have attributed the disorder to the lack of sun, the extreme cold, and the desolate state of most villages in the region. A reason for this disorder present in this culture may be due to the isolation of their cultural group.&lt;ref name = "ArcticHis"&gt;Ephron, Sarah. (July/August 2003) [http://www.sarahefron.com/stories/arctichysteria.shtml ''Arctic Hysteria''], from [http://www.uphere.ca Up Here Magazine]; archived at SarahEfron.com&lt;/ref&gt;

This culture-bound syndrome is possibly linked to [[vitamin A]] toxicity ([[hypervitaminosis A]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kontaxakis, V., Skourides, D., Ferentinos, P., Havaki-Kontaxaki, B., &amp; Papadimitriou, G.(2009)."Isotretinoid and Psychopathology: A Review", ''Annals of General Psychiatry'', 8 (2), doi: 10.1186/1744-859X-8-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "wiseGEEK"&gt;Smith, S. (2012, December 6). [http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-piblokto.htm What is Piblokto?] wiseGEEK: clear answers for common questions. Retrieved March 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The native [[Inuit cuisine|Inughuit diet]] or [[Eskimo]] nutrition provides rich sources of vitamin&amp;nbsp;A through the ingestion of livers, kidneys, and fat of arctic fish and mammals and is possibly the cause or a causative factor. This causative factor is through the disturbance that has been reported for males, females, adults, children, and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Landy,D. (1985) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4049004 Pibloktoq (hysteria) and Inuit nutrition: possible implication of hypervitaminosis A].&lt;/ref&gt; The ingestion of [[Offal|organ meats]], particularly the [[Liver (food)|livers]] of some Arctic mammals, such as the [[polar bear]] and [[bearded seal]], where the vitamin is stored in toxic quantities, can be fatal to most people.

Inughuit tradition states that it is caused by evil spirits possessing the living. [[Shamanism]] and [[animism]] are dominant themes in [[Inuit religion|Inughuit traditional beliefs]] with the [[angakkuq]] (healer) acting as a mediator with the supernatural forces. Angakkuit use trance states to communicate with spirits and carry out faith healing. There is a view among the Inughuit that individuals entering trance states should be treated with respect given the possibility of a new "revelation" emerging as a result. Treatment in piblokto cases usually involves allowing the episode to run its course without interference. While piblokto can often be confused with other conditions, (including [[epilepsy]]) in which failure to intervene can lead to the victim coming to harm, most cases tend to be more typical.

==Skepticism==
Although piblokto has a place in the historical record and official medical canons, a number of Arctic researchers and Arctic residents doubt its existence. The phenomena, they suggest, may be more rooted in the experience and behavior of the early European explorers than the Inuit themselves.&lt;ref name = "ArcticHis"/&gt;

In 1988 [[Parks Canada]] historian Lyle Dick began a substantial challenge to the concept that piblokto exists at all. Dick examined the original records of the European [[Arctic exploration|Arctic explorers]], and ethnographic and linguistic reports on Inughuit societies, and discovered that not only is the majority of academic speculation into piblokto based on reports of only eight cases, but the word "piblokto" / "pibloktoq" does not exist within [[Inuktun]] (the Inughuit language); possibly, Dick concluded, this may have been the result of errors in [[phonetic transcription]]. In a 1995 paper published in the journal ''[[Arctic Anthropology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dick|first=L|title="Pibloktoq"(Arctic Hysteria): A construction of European-Inuit relations.|journal=Arctic Anthropology|date=February 1995|volume=32|issue=2|pages=2|url=http://huie.hsu.edu:2308/ehost/detail?hid=23&amp;sid=fcfa52f5-9576-463b-9e9c-52ae709b9f3a%40sessionmgr15&amp;vid=3&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=9512292521|accessdate=March 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his 2001 book ''Muskox land: Ellesmere Island in the Age of Contact'', Dick suggests that piblokto is a "phantom phenomenon", arising more from the [[culture shock|Inuhuit reaction to European explorers in their midst]].&lt;ref name = "ArcticHis"/&gt;

Similarly, Hughes and Simons have described piblokto as a "catch-all rubric under which explorers lumped various Inuhuit anxiety reactions, expressions of resistance to [[patriarchy]] or [[sexual coercion]], and shamanistic practice".&lt;ref&gt;Simons, R. C., Hughes, C. C. The culture-bound syndromes: folk illnesses of psychiatric and anthropological interest. D. Reidel Publishing Company, (1985), Holland. p. 275, 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, rather than understanding piblokto as a strange cultural phenomenon, some critical scholars now understand it to be an expression of trauma of colonial violence, including rape. For example, transcultural psychiatry scholars Lawrence Kirmayer and Harry Minas write: 

″Most comprehensive psychiatric texts mention pibloktoq
as a culture-bound syndrome characterized by sudden wild and erratic
behaviour. Recently, the historian Lyle Dick collected all the published accounts
of pibloktoq, of which there are only about 25. It seems that psychiatric
case description transformed a situation of sexual exploitation of Inuit
women by explorers into a discrete disorder worthy of a new diagnostic
label. With hindsight, we can see how insensitivity to the impact of exploration
on other peoples distorted the picture when vital information on
social context was not included. The legacy of these colonialist blinkers is
still with us. . .″ &lt;ref&gt;Kirmayer, L. J. (2007). Cultural psychiatry in historical perspective. Textbook of cultural psychiatry, 3-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literary criticism]], '''purple prose''' is [[prose]] text that is so extravagant, ornate, or flowery as to break the flow and draw excessive attention to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Word a Day – purple prose |url=http://www.wordsmith.org/words/purple_prose.html |website=Wordsmith.org |accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purple prose is characterized by the excessive use of adjectives, adverbs, and [[metaphor]]s. When it is limited to certain passages, they may be termed '''purple patches''' or '''purple passages''', standing out from the rest of the work.

Purple prose is criticized for desaturating the meaning in an author's text by overusing melodramatic and fanciful descriptions. As there is no precise rule or absolute definition of what constitutes purple prose, deciding if a text, passage, or complete work has fallen victim is a somewhat subjective decision. According to [[Paul West (writer)|Paul West]], "It takes a certain amount of sass to speak up for prose that's rich, succulent and full of novelty. Purple is immoral, undemocratic and insincere; at best artsy, at worst the exterminating angel of depravity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=West|first1=Paul|title=IN DEFENSE OF PURPLE PROSE|journal=New York Times|date=15 December 1985|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/books/in-defense-of-purple-prose.html?pagewanted=2|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has been described as "an exercise in double-tracking one's public image: on the one hand, defining oneself through committed allegiance to a radical cause, but on the other, vitally, demonstrating this allegiance because it is the fashionable, ''[[:wiktionary:au courant|au courant]]'' way to be seen in moneyed, name-conscious Society."&lt;ref name=Molotov&gt;{{cite web |last=Bracewell |first=Michael |title=Molotov Cocktails |work=[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze Magazine]] |date=November–December 2004 |url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/molotov_cocktails |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201190439/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/molotov_cocktails |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike dedicated [[Activism|activists]], [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]], or [[Political dissent|dissenters]], those who engage in "radical chic" remain frivolous political agitators. They are [[Ideology|ideologically]] invested in their cause of choice only so far as it advances their social standing.

"[[Terrorism|Terrorist]] chic" is a modern expression with similar connotations. This derivative, however, de-emphasizes the [[Social commentary|class satire]] of Wolfe's original term, instead accentuating concerns over the [[semiotics]] of radicalism (such as the [[aestheticization of violence]]).

In languages such as [[American English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] the term has become widely used to indicate people identifying themselves as [[Socialism|socialists]] or radical leftists while conducting upper-class lifestyles.

==Origin and meaning==
The phrase "radical chic" originated in a 1970 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' article by [[Tom Wolfe]], titled "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's",&lt;ref name="nymag1970"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/docs/07/05/070529radical_chic.pdf|title=Radical Chic: that Party at Lenny's|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|date=8 June 1970|work=New York|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later reprinted in his books ''[[Radical Chic &amp; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers]]'' and ''[[The Purple Decades]]''. In the essay, Wolfe used the term to satirize composer [[Leonard Bernstein]] and his friends for their absurdity in hosting a fundraising party for the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]]—an organization whose members, activities, and goals were clearly incongruous with those of Bernstein's elite circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Foote |first=Timothy |title=Fish in the Brandy Snifter |date=1970-12-21 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904627,00.html? |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe's concept of radical chic was intended to lampoon individuals  (particularly [[Elitism|social elites]] like the [[jet set]]) who endorsed [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] radicalism merely to affect worldliness, assuage [[white guilt]], or garner prestige, rather than to affirm genuine political convictions.

{{Quote|[Wolfe's] subject is how culture's patrician classes – the wealthy, fashionable intimates of high society – have sought to luxuriate in both a vicarious glamour and a monopoly on virtue through their public espousal of street politics: a politics, moreover, of minorities so removed from their sphere of experience and so absurdly, diametrically, opposed to the islands of privilege on which the cultural aristocracy maintain their isolation, that the whole basis of their relationship is wildly out of kilter from the start. ... In short, Radical Chic is described as a form of highly developed decadence; and its greatest fear is to be seen not as prejudiced or unaware, but as middle-class.|Michael Bracewell|"Molotov Cocktails"&lt;ref name=Molotov /&gt;}}

==Background==
The concept of "fashionable" espousal of radical causes by members of wealthy society in this case had been argued against by Bernstein's wife, [[Felicia Montealegre]], prior to the publication of "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's", a fact Wolfe details in it. The essay appeared in the June 8, 1970 issue of ''New York'', 20 weeks after the actual fund raiser at the Bernstein residence was held on January 14. The first report of the event appeared the following day in a piece by ''[[The New York Times]]'' style reporter [[Charlotte Curtis]], who was in attendance. Curtis wrote in part: "Leonard Bernstein and a Black Panther leader argued the merits of the Black Panther party's philosophy before nearly 90 guests last night in the Bernsteins' elegant Park Avenue duplex." According to Wolfe, the release of the story worldwide was followed by strong criticism of the event: "The English, particularly, milked the story for all it was worth and seemed to derive one of the great cackles of the year from it."&lt;ref name=nymag1970 /&gt;

The negative reaction prompted publication of an op-ed in the ''Times'' on January 16 entitled "False Note on Black Panthers" that was severely critical of the Black Panther Party and Bernstein:

{{Quote|Emergence of the Black Panthers as the romanticized darlings of the politico-cultural jet set is an affront to the majority of black Americans. ... the group therapy plus fund-raising soiree at the home of Leonard Bernstein, as reported in this newspaper yesterday, represents the sort of elegant slumming that degrades patrons and patronized alike. It might be dismissed as guilt-relieving fun spiked with social consciousness, except for its impact on those blacks and whites seriously working for complete equality and social justice.&lt;ref name="nyt_false_note"&gt;{{cite news|title=False Note on Black Panthers|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 16, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Felicia Montealegre wrote and personally delivered a response to this op-ed to the ''Times'' offices.&lt;ref name="nymag_html"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|title=Tom Wolfe on Radical Chic and Leonard Bernstein's Party for the Black Panthers|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/46170/index15.html|work=Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's|publisher=New York|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her response she wrote:

{{Quote|As a civil libertarian, I asked a number of people to my house on Jan. 14 in order to hear the lawyer and others involved with the Panther 21 discuss the problem of civil liberties as applicable to the men now waiting trial, and to help raise funds for their legal expenses. ... It was for this deeply serious purpose that our meeting was called. The frivolous way in which it was reported as a "fashionable" event is unworthy of the Times, and offensive to all people who are committed to humanitarian principles of justice.&lt;ref name=nymag_html /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt_letter"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Felicia M.|title=Letters to the Editor of The Times: Panthers' Legal Aid|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/21/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html |accessdate=4 June 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 21, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Terrorist chic==

'''Terrorist chic''' (also known as "terror chic" or "militant chic") is a more recent and specific variation of the term. It refers to the [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of symbols, objects, and aesthetics related to radical [[Militant (word)|militants]], usually in the context of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Daly |first=Susan |title=Is the war over for terrorist chic? |work=[[Independent.ie]] |publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]] |date=2008-11-08 |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/news-gossip/is-the-war-over-for-terrorist-chic-1528669.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[fashion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Herr |first=Cheryl |title=Terrorist Chic and Marching Season Style |work=[[The Vacuum]] |publisher=Factotum |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.thevacuum.org.uk/issues/issues0120/issue17/is17artterchi.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such imagery is deployed [[Subversion (politics)|subversively]], the process exemplifies aestheticization of propaganda. Regardless, because terrorist chic derives its [[iconography]] from groups and individuals often associated with violent conflict or [[terrorism]], the term carries a greater pejorative tone than "radical chic."

Instances of terrorist chic have variously been interpreted as morally irresponsible, earnestly [[Counterculture|counter-cultural]], ironically [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hip]], or benignly apolitical. According to Henry K. Miller of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', the most well-known example is the ubiquitous appearance of [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara in popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Henry K |title=Fatal attraction |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=2002-10-28 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200210280033 |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cases that have been labeled terrorist chic include: the Prada-Meinhof fashion line (a pun on [[Prada]] and the [[Red Army Faction|Baader-Meinhof Gang]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Connolly |first=Kate |title=Astrid Proll's journey to Terror Chic |work=[[The Observer]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=2002-10-06 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/06/germany.kateconnolly |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smiley |first=Shannon |title=Germany Debates 'Terrorist Chic': Art and Fashion Stir Memories of Leftist Violence in '70s |work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] |date=2005-02-20 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38447-2005Feb19.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fashion of combining [[keffiyeh]]s and military-style clothing such as camo prints and heavy boots, outside the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hernandez |first=Daniel |title='Terrorist Chic' and Beyond |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |date=2006-04-09 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/apr/09/magazine/tm-terrorchic15 |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lando |first=Michal |title=US chain pulls 'anti-war' keffiyehs |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |publisher=Mirkaei Tikshoret Ltd. |date=2007-01-19 |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1167467767600&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |accessdate=2009-04-05 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting the sustained interest in Che, Bernstein suggested that "the end of the cold war and the failure of the third-world revolution" allowed for the "scrutiny of Guevara, [as] a symbol of both the idealism and the [[moral blindness]] of the decade of protest" to take place free in a context free "of ideological partisanship and rancor."&lt;ref name=NYT26nov1997 /&gt;

'''Repurposing''' is the process by which an object with one [[use value]] is transformed or redeployed as an object with an alternative use value.

==Description==
Repurposing is as old as [[human civilization]], with many contemporary scholars investigating that way that different societies re-appropriate the artifacts of older cultures in new and creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/04/medieval-recycling/ | title=Medieval Recycling | publisher=Harvard Gazette | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, repurposing has been celebrated by 21st century hobbyists and arts-and-crafts organizations such as [[Instructables]] and other [[Maker culture]] communities as a means of creatively responding to the ecological and economic crises of the 21st century.  Recent scholarship has attempted to relate these activities to American left- and right-[[libertarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Malewitz, R. (2014) {{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=22814 | title=The Practice of Misuse | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=3195 | title=Throwaways: Work Culture and Consumer Education | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repurposing is the use of a tool being re-channeled into being another tool, usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool-maker. Typically, repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk, garbage, or obsolete. A good example of this would be the [[Earthship]] style of house, that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose.  Examples of repurposing include using tires as [[boat fender]]s and [[steel drum]]s or plastic drums as [[feeding trough]]s and/or composting bins. [[Incinerator]] and power plant exhaust stack [[fly-ash]] is used extensively as an [[concrete additive|additive to concrete]], providing increased strength. This type of reuse can sometimes make use of items which are no longer usable for their original purposes, for example using worn-out clothes as [[Textile|rags]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diyncrafts.com/6081/repurpose/100-ways-repurpose-reuse-broken-household-items | title=100 Ways to Repurpose and Reuse Broken Household Items | publisher=DIY &amp; Crafts | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all repurposing is necessarily environmentally friendly, take for instance the idea of repurposing older work trucks for businesses in their infancy, in which their poor fuel economy can negate long term benefits since greater spending of money for fuel, and more fumes output to the sky can prove to be environmentally unfriendly, in which repurposing vehicles for [[Electric vehicle conversion|electric car conversion]] can be the recommended alternative to that, though its cost can be negligible upfront.

===Automobiles===

===Electronics===
*A [[USB dead drop]] can be mounted on a [[brick wall]] since this gives an opportunity to repurpose older USB flash drives with obsolete capacities to continue service for file transfer (especially anonymous ones) that don't demand more than one [[gigabyte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deaddrops.com/dead-drops/participate/ |title=How to make your own |publisher=Deaddrops.com |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Everdrive]] and other flash video game cartridges have offered opportunities to download [[ROM image]]s of video game cartridges onto [[SD card]]s while offering opportunities to repurpose real vintage video game consoles for retro gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130329014653/http://www.stoneagegamer.com/mega-everdrive-deluxe.html Stoneagegamer's article on the Everdrive]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Old Android smartphones, which tend to have little computing resources yet which are unused and probably contain a triaxial [[accelerometer]] of decent specifications, can be used as an amateur seismograph node for a distributed seismography project, e.g., [[Quake-Catcher Network]].
*Discarded or new consumer COTS surplus parabolic reflectors intended for use for C band satellite TV reception can be repurposed for a wide gamut of applications for which a consumer-grade reflector of low gain is adequate, incl. amateur microwave SETI (mainly [[Project Argus]]), Wi-Fi links, and microwave [[amateur radio]] [[radio beacons]].

===As a tactic for manufacturing goods===
* [[Right-hand-drive]] [[Jeep]] brand vehicles, such as the [[Jeep Wrangler]], which are initially slated for import to right-hand-drive countries, have had some specially designed versions repurposed for US and Canada [[postal service]] mail carrying, in which this tactic of repurposing can consolidate the overhead of retooling for specialty manufacturing of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rightdrivejeeps4postal.com/ US Drive Right: The Nation's Largest Seller Of Used Factory

===Manufacturing of recycled goods===
*[[Reusable packaging]] can be reused for a wide variety of other purposes.

{{Generations Sidebar}}
The '''Silent Generation''' is the demographic [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] following the cohort known in the United States as the [[G.I. Generation]]. There are no precise dates for when The Silent Generation starts or ends. Demographers and researchers typically use mid-to-late 1920s as starting birth years and early-to-mid 1940s as ending birth years for this cohort.

==Terminology==
It is unclear where the term originated, although it is widely accepted that the term "Silent Generation" comes from the focus on careers over activism. As young adults during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Era]], many members of the Silent Generation felt it was dangerous to speak out.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook to Life in America, Volume 8 Rodney P. Carlisle Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine first used the term "Silent Generation" in a November 5, 1951 article titled "The Younger Generation", although the term appears to precede the publication.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,856950,00.html "The Younger Generation", ''Time'', November 5, 1951]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/the-silent-generation-definition-characteristics-facts.html|title=The Silent Generation: Definition, Characteristics &amp; Facts|access-date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was originally applied to people in the United States and Canada but has been applied as well to those in [[Western Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[South America]]. It includes most of those who fought during the [[Korean War]]. In the United States, the generation was comparatively small because the financial insecurity of the 1930s and the war in the early 1940s caused people to have fewer children.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2014/08/13/the-silent-generation-the-lucky-few-part-3-of-7/|title=The Silent Generation, "The Lucky Few" (Part 3 of 7)|date=30 July 2014|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are noted as forming the leadership of the [[civil rights movement]] as well as comprising the “[[silent majority]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin|first=Dan|title=Closing The Book On The Silent Generation|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/silent-generation-it-over/|publisher=[[National Review]]|date=16 February 2016|access-date=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also been named the "Lucky Few" in the 2008 book ''The Lucky Few: Between the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Elwood|title=The Lucky Few: Between the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boom|date=2008|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media B.V.|isbn=978-1-4020-8540-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="springer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Elwood|title=The Lucky Few: Between the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boom|year=2008|publisher=Springer Science and Business Media|location=Berlin|isbn=978-1-4020-8540-6|pages=1|url=https://www.springer.com/social+sciences/population+studies/book/978-1-4020-8540-6?otherVersion=978-1-4020-8850-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Elwood D. Carlson PhD, the Charles B.

He calls the people of this generation "The Lucky Few", because even though they were born during the Great Depression and World War II, they moved into adulthood during the relatively prosperous 1950s and early 1960s. For men who served in the Korean War, their military service was not marked by high casualties as much as the previous generation. The Lucky Few also had higher employment rates than the generations before and after them, as well as better health and earlier retirement. African Americans in this generation also did better than earlier generations in education and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2008/luckyfew.aspx|title=The ‘Lucky Few’ Reveal the Lifelong Impact of Generation – Population Reference Bureau|website=www.prb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's McCrindle Research uses the name ''Builders'' to describe the Australian members of this generation, born between 1925 and 1945, and coming of age to become the generation "who literally and metaphorically built [the] nation after the austerity years post-Depression and World War II".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf Generations Defined].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23365">The '''societal marketing'''  is a marketing concept that holds that a company should make marketing decisions not only by considering consumers' wants, the company's requirements, but also  society's long-term interests.

The societal marketing concept holds that the organization's task is to determine the needs, wants, and interests of a [[target market]] and to deliver the desired satisfactions more effectively and efficiently than [[competitors]] in a way that preserves or enhances the well being of both the individual consumer and society in general. Therefore, marketers must endeavor to satisfy the needs and wants of their target markets in ways that preserve and enhance the well-being of consumers and society as a whole. {{ref|Kotler2000}} It is closely linked with the principles of [[corporate social responsibility]] and of [[sustainable development]].

==Definition==
Societal marketing can be defined as a "marketing with a social dimension or marketing that includes non-economic criteria". &lt;ref&gt; Handelman, Jay M. and Arnold, Stephen J., "The Role of Marketing Actions with a Social Dimension: Appeals to the Institutional Environment," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 63, No. 3, July, 1999, pp 33-48&lt;/ref&gt;  Societal marketing "concerns for society's long term interests".&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, G.R., "The Marketing Concept: Necessary but sufficient? An environmental view," ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 24, No. 8, pp.23-30, https://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000000612&lt;/ref&gt; It is about "the direct benefits for the organization and secondary benefit for the community". &lt;ref&gt;McColl-Kennedy, J., Kiel, G., Lusch, R. and Lusch, V., ''Marketing: Concepts and Strategies,'' Nelson Australia, Melbourne, 2001, &lt;/ref&gt; Societal marketing distinguishes between the consumer's immediate satisfaction and longer term consumer and social benefits. Accordingly, [[Andreas Kaplan]] defines societal management as "management that takes into account society's overall welfare in addition to mere profitability considerations." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | issue=4 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534| year=2014 | last1=Kaplan | first1=Andreas }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its a 3 dimensional concept of marketing ;Social welfare,Individual welfare,Company profits.

==Objectives== 
Various attempts to define the objectives of societal marketing have been noted,&lt;ref&gt;Gaski, J.F., "Dangerous Territory: The societal marketing concept revisited", ''Business Horizons,'' Vol. 28, No. 4, pp 42-47&lt;/ref&gt; such as:
* "[[Social responsibility]] implies that a business decision maker... is obliged to take actions that also protect and enhance society's interests.
* "Business has the responsibility to help [the consumer] ... It is the duty of business to promote proper consumption values."
* "Business leaders are mandated to adopt roles of leadership in  the advancement of our society to new levels of moral conduct."

==History==
The concept of societal marketing emerged in the early 1970s, promoting a more socially responsible, moral and ethical model of marketing in an effort to counter some of the more serious criticisms of marketing that had arisen out of the [[consumerism|consumerist]] movement around that time. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 36, No. 5/6, pp548-569, https://doi.org/10.1108/03090560210423014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Kotler]] is generally credited with introducing the societal marketing concept to the literature in a 1972 article "What Consumerism Means for Marketers" in the ''Harvard Business Review'' of 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell Reference, http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631233176_chunk_g978140510254422_ss1-48&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly Kotler believed that he had coined the term, "societal marketing" and was the first to codify it within the [[marketing literature]]. &lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., "What Consumerism Means for Marketers," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 50, No. 3, May-June, 1972, pp. 48-57 &lt;/ref&gt; Some marketing historians, notably Wilkie and Moore, have argued that a societal perspective was not new, and that evidence for it could be found in marketing theory and in marketing texts, since the discipline's inception in the early 1900s. &lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., "Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp 224-232 DOI: 10.1177/0276146706291067; Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development," ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp 116–146 &lt;/ref&gt; Kotler introduced both the concept of [[social marketing]] (extending marketing technologies into non-business areas) and societal marketing, arguing that the marketing concept and its technologies must be tempered and ultimately revised by adopting a more explicit social orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' 2002,  Vol 36, No. 5/6, pp 48-569&lt;/ref&gt; The novelty of Kotler's concept was the idea of "long-run consumer welfare", emphasizing that the short-term desires might not support the consumer's long term interests or be good for the society as a whole.

The societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Instead, marketing activities should strive to benefit society's overall well-being. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including: employees, customers, local communities, the wider public and government and consider the impact of their activities on all stakeholders. They ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society. Societal marketing developed into [[sustainable marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P and Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing,'' 9th ed., Prentice Hall, 2000; Griffin, R.W.  and Ebert, E.J., ''Business '' 5th edition, Prentice Hall, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Societal marketing requires businesses to include social, ethical and ecological considerations in product and market planning. &lt;ref&gt;Abratt, Russell and Sacks, Diane, "Perceptions of the Societal Marketing Concept", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 23, No. 6, 1989, pp. 25–33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
Kotler identified four categories of products, classified in terms of long term benefits and immediate satisfaction: &lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., "What Consumerism Means for Marketers," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 50, May-June, pp. 54-56&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Papierosa 1 ubt 0069.jpeg|thumb|Cigarettes are typically classified as a '' pleasing products'' since they deliver immediate benefits with long-term social harm]]
#Deficient products, which bring neither long-run or short term benefits
#Pleasing products, which bring a high level of immediate [[Customer satisfaction|satisfaction]], but can cause harm to the society in the long run
#Salutary products, which bring low short term satisfaction, but benefit the society on the long run
#Desirable products, which combine long-run benefit and immediate satisfaction

Kotler's concept of societal marketing suggested that for the well-being of society, deficient products should be eliminated from the market, pleasing and salutary products should go through a product modification process to acquire desirable status, by incorporating missing short term benefits into salutary products and long term benefits into pleasing products, and the companies' ultimate goal should be to develop desirable products. Rather than focusing on selling a products, which can be good or bad for the consumers,  companies should focus on consumer and society's well-being.

==Examples==
Most companies recognize that socially responsible activities improve their image among customers, [[stockholders]], the [[financial community]], and other relevant publics. Ethical and socially responsible practices are simply good business, resulting not only in favorable image, but ultimately in increased sales.

*[[The Body Shop]]: The Body Shop International plc is the original, natural and ethical beauty brand. The company uses only plant based materials for its products. It is against [[Animal testing]], supports community trade, activate Self Esteem, Defend Human Rights, and overall protection of the planet. They have also their own charity, The Body Shop Foundation, to assist those working to achieve progress in the areas of human and civil rights, environmental and animal protection. Thus Body shop is really following the concept of Societal Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;The Body Shop, www.thebodyshop.com/_en/_ww/services/aboutus_company.aspx)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Avon Products|AVON]] Product inc. has started an initiative known as Avon [[breast cancer]] awareness crusade in 1993 in partnership with National Alliance of breast cancer Foundation (NABCO).They started selling pink ribbon pins which depicts the international symbol for breast cancer for$2 and donates $1 to NABCO. Through the crusade Avon sale representatives have raised billion of dollars for breast cancer education and access to early detection services for underserved woman. In addition, Avon's 45,000 US sales people have been trained to discuss breast cancer and importance of early detection with their customers and distributed 80 million flyers on breast cancer detection.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal marketing v social marketing==
Societal marketing should not be confused with [[social marketing]]. Societal marketing is a philosophy or mindset that informs marketing decisions whereas social marketing is a distinct branch within the marketing discipline. Societal marketing is concerned with the consideration of the social and ethical aspects of marketing planning. Social marketing is concerned with facilitating social change. A key difference is that the greater 'social good' is the ''principal'' consideration in social marketing while social benefits are one of a number of considerations in societal marketing.  

On the other hand, social marketing is a sub-branch of marketing that began in 1971, with the publication of an article by Kotler and Zaltman, emphasising a planned approach to achieving social change. It is primarily concerned with encouraging pro-social behaviours (e.g. recycling, sun-safety, safe driving practices) and discouraging anti-social behaviours (e.g. littering, drink-driving). &lt;ref&gt;Kotler P and Zaltman G., "Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change,"  ''Journal of Marketing, Vol. 35. No. 3, 1971, pp 3-12&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as an "adaptation of commercial marketing technologies to programs designed to influence the voluntary behavior of target audiences to improve their personal welfare and that of the society of which they are a part".&lt;ref&gt;Andreasen, A., ''Marketing Social Change: Changing Behavior to Promote Health, Social Development and the Environment,'' San Francisco: Jossey Bass, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social marketing uses more traditional commercial techniques and strategies, focusing on persuasion, to achieve goals for the greater social good. Its [[Advertising campaign|campaigns]] can either encourage [[merit good]]s, as for example fund raising for not-for-profit organizations or dissuade the use of [[demerit good]]s promoting society's well being, as non-smoking campaigns or promote the use of seat belts. Another characteristic of social marketing is that is planned to influence individual behaviour to improve well-being. It includes more than just [[advertising]] in traditional mass media, and may extend to educational programs and formal enforcement regimes in the case of road safety campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Belz, Frank Martin and Peattie, Ken, ''Sustainability Marketing,'' John Wiley and Sons, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It planned campaigns, implemented by governmental and non-governmental organisations. A clear example that differentiates societal from social marketing is a marketing campaign on non-smoking. A smoking cessation advertisement is an example of social marketing, but if the marketing strategies and techniques used in that campaign focus on increasing the well-being of society, that same campaign can be an example of societal marketing.

The societal marketing concept was a forerunner of sustainable marketing in integrating issues of social responsibility into commercial [[marketing strategies]]. In contrast to that, social marketing uses commercial marketing theories, tools and techniques to influence social change. Social marketing applies a "customer orientated" approach and uses the concepts and tools used by commercial marketers in pursuit of social goals like Anti-Smoking-Campaigns or fund raising for NGOs.

== Corporate social responsibility (CSR)==
Unlike societal marketing, CSR has existed for many years. Another difference is that CSR "focuses more in a [[corporate]] level and stakeholders", &lt;ref&gt; Belz, Frank Martin and Peattie, Ken, ''Sustainability Marketing,'' John Wiley and Sons, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; while societal marketing is more concerned about the consumer and their long term benefits. CSR social and environmental concerns are integrated into all business operations. CSR is mainly run by companies, while social marketing mainly by Government or Non profits organizations. One example of CSR among companies is what [[Häagen-Dazs]] is doing with their "microsite" to raise awareness to the general public about the preservation of the honeybee.

==Branding==
Corporations are the one who are striving during the whole time for improvements. They are turning to all kind of forms of [[corporate societal marketing]] programs to help build and repair their brand images.

Corporate Social Marketing, or CSM, usually refers to marketing efforts that have at least one social related objective, such as charity founding, among its goals. Typical examples are releasing a certain percentage of the final sale product to a charity related to the product, or sponsoring events that encourage social well-being such as the Olympic Games. Corporate Social Marketing benefits a company in many ways, but its main goal is to improve the image the public has of the company. A company that appears committed to improving the lives or others, the environment or other worthy causes is seen in a better light than one who doesn't, and more and more business are hoping to benefit from that.

So, it can be so, that CSM programs are becoming extremely popular because the leaders believe that it is a good business to be viewed as a socially responsible company.&lt;ref&gt;Business in the Community, "Businesses Use Marketing Muscle to Tackle Social Issues", in ''Cause-related Marketing Website,''&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though past research suggests that CSM may be effective in improving [[brand equity]] and increasing market share, there are limits to the effectiveness of these initiatives.

An example of his is how corporate social initiatives adversely affected purchase intentions if consumers perceived that the company would forgo product quality in order to be socially responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Sankar and Bhattacharya, C.B., "Does Doing Good Always Lead to Doing better, Consumer Reactions to Corporate Societal Responsibility," ''Journal of Marketing Research,'' Vol 38, May, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the nature of the CSM program, the intent of the corporation may not be as obvious to the consumers. This happens if the benefits to the corporation are not apparent or conflicts with what the consumer already believes about a specific firm or industry.

Since firms exist to make a profit, consumers may spend considerable energy in an attempt to infer motives related to the profit-oriented goals. As an example, a consumer may be suspicious of a tobacco company that undertakes a campaign to prevent underage smoking. If this is successful, the company would be affected and the cigarette sales will be lowered. So, in this situation, consumers' suspicions may lead them to infer motives that would actually protect the companies financial condition – as they are trying to improve their image to sell more cigarettes to adults. However, if a tobacco company undertook a CSM Campaign, that would sustain their business consumers may be able to infer profit motives more easily and then have a more favorable attitude toward the partnership. Therefore, it can be concluded that the attitude of the consumers could be better if they knew more about the motives of the companies and they were more obvious.

Another aspect that may cause suspicion with consumers is the amount of harm that a company has already done, either because of unsafe products or harmful production practices. It is logical that consumers are more suspicious to companies that sell harmful products. Again examples are the tobacco companies and alcohol companies as well. They will meet resistance from consumers when they undertake socially-oriented campaigns aimed at mitigating the effects of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeffler, Steve and Keller, Kevin Lane, "Building Brand Equity through Corporate Societal Marketing", ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 21, No. 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; That is why when different industries are separated, two very general dimensions are used – the harmful nature of the products and the harmful nature of the production methods.

This classification can briefly show how consumer are influenced by the various CSM efforts. Companies that work in this "dangerous" industries are not that successful always, because the consumers may be suspicious of any societal efforts the company attempts to undertake. Consumers will infer less society-serving motives and more self-serving motives for corporate societal marketing programs undertaken by firms that operate in mixed or sin industries.

Based on how easily consumers could infer profit-driven motives, are classified the types of CSM campaigns: Positively tied to product sales, positively tied to product sales, not directly tied to sales but aimed at sustaining the company's business, completely unrelated.

==Criticisms==
Societal marketing has been the subject of a number of criticisms: 

A key issue concerns the question of who decides what is in the public’s best interests. The moral agenda implicit in the societal marketing concept is underdeveloped and often implicit. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 36 Issue: 5/6, 2002, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; Gaski argued that marketers should step away from their classic goal of [[customer satisfaction]] and [[profit maximization]] while respecting the minimum governmental standards imposed by law and enter this [[public policy]] area, since marketers themselves would have to decide what actions are consistent with public welfare. Marketers might have neither the competence nor the right to determine the "public interest." Instead, it should be the customers who decide what is good for them, or their political representatives and dictate that to the industry. &lt;ref&gt;Gaski, J.F., "Dangerous Territory: The societal marketing concept revisited", ''Business Horizons,'' Vol. 28, No. 4, 1985, 42-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have argued that societal marketing is not a distinct concept, but rather it is a mere extension of the marketing concept. Others have pointed out that the literature in the field is vague, poorly defined and underdeveloped. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 36 Issue: 5/6, 2002, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; The societal marketing concept has become an excellent strategy for promotions with social dimensions and for exploring consumers' behavioural response to such corporate 'doing good'.

; Future development of the concept:
Societal marketing is gaining the marketers and consumer attention  and there is every reason to expect it to continue to evolve in practice. It focuses on providing win-win opportunities to companies, consumers and society. But achieving the compelling benefits for each party involved is very complicated. So much more research is needed. To achieve a win situation for organization involved, is dependent largely upon how the key constituents react. In this context, anticipating consumer reaction is really challenging which can be affected by number of factors that often vary across different segments. The several research questions remain to be answered like how different factors affects reaction to societal marketing and how do the various factors interact? How can societal initiatives be designed to leverage positive reaction and mitigate negative ones? &lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

For consumers to win, societal marketing must provide them with compelling benefits that increase their overall welfare. What benefits did societal marketing initiative actually provided to consumers? Are there direct benefits such as increased satisfaction with their interaction with commercial or nonprofit organization?
Determining whether there is a win situation for society by societal marketing initiative is the most difficult question to be answered. We turn to the two questions proposed by Bloom, Hussien and Szykmann (1995):  Is the society better off because of this program? Does corporate involvement result in better performance than if it would have been managed by NGOs or government agencies? 
Societal marketing is becoming globally popular but there exist a scarcity of research in this field. Therefore extensive future research is needed particularly investigating questions with respect to its impact on consumer attitudes to corporate image, product image and their purchase intention or brand choice as well as on positive impact on society.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Linguistics}}

'''Speech''' is human vocal [[communication]] using [[language]]. Each language uses [[phonetic]] combinations of a limited set of perfectly articulated and individualized [[vowel]] and [[consonant]] sounds that form the sound of its words (that is, all English words sound different from all French words, even if they are the same word, e.g., "role" or "hotel"), and using those words in their semantic character as  words in the [[lexicon]] of a [[language]] according to the [[Syntax|syntactic]] constraints that govern lexical words' function in a sentence. In speaking, speakers perform many different intentional [[Speech_act|speech act]]s, e.g., informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing, and can use [[Elocution|enunciation]], [[Intonation_(linguistics)|intonation]], degrees of [[Loudness|loudness]], [[Tempo|tempo]], and other non-representational or [[Paralanguage|paralinguistic]] aspects of vocalization to convey meaning.  In their speech speakers also unintentionally communicate many aspects of their social position such as sex, age, place of origin (through [[Accent_(sociolinguistics)|accent]]), physical states (alertness and sleepiness, vigor or weakness, health or illness), psychic states (emotions or moods), physico-psychic states (sobriety or [[Alcohol_intoxication|drunkenness]], normal consciousness and [[Trance|trance]] states), education or experience, and the like.  

Although people ordinarily use speech in dealing with other persons (or animals), when people [[Profanity|swear]] they do not always mean to communicate anything to anyone, and sometimes in expressing urgent emotions or desires they use speech as a quasi-magical cause, as when they encourage a player in a game to do or warn them not to do something.  There are also many situations in which people engage in solitary speech. People [[Talking to oneself|talk to themselves]] sometimes in acts that are a development of what some [[psychologist]]s (e.g., [[Lev Vygotsky]]) have maintained is the use in thinking of silent speech in an [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|interior monologue]] to vivify and organize [[cognition]], sometimes in the momentary adoption of a dual persona as self addressing self as though addressing another person.  Solo speech can be used [[Memorization|to memorize]] or to test one's memorization of things, and in [[Prayer|prayer]] or in [[Meditation|meditation]] (e.g., the use of a [[Mantra|mantra]]).

Researchers study many different aspects of speech:  speech production and [[speech perception]] of the [[sounds]] used in a [[language]], [[speech repetition]], [[speech error]]s, the ability to map heard spoken words onto the vocalizations needed to recreate them, which plays a key role in [[children]]'s enlargement of their [[vocabulary]], and what different areas of the [[human brain]], such as [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]], underlie speech. Speech is the subject of study for  [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[communication studies]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[speech pathology]], [[otolaryngology]], and [[acoustics]].  
Speech compares with [[written language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{American Heritage Dictionary|https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=speech|Speech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, which may differ in its vocabulary, syntax, and phonetics from the spoken language, a situation called [[diglossia]]. 

The evolutionary [[origin of language|origins of speech]] are unknown and subject to much debate and [[speculation]]. While [[Animal language|animals also communicate]] using vocalizations, and trained [[apes]] such as [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] and [[Kanzi]] can use simple [[Sign_language|sign language]], no animals' vocalizations are articulated phonemically and syntactically, and do not constitute speech.

== Production ==
{{main|Speech production|Linguistics}}

Speech production is a multi-step process by which thoughts are generated into spoken utterances. Production involves the selection of appropriate words and the appropriate form of those words from the lexicon and morphology, and the organization of those words through the syntax. Then, the phonetic properties of the words are retrieved and the sentence is uttered through the articulations associated with those phonetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levelt|first=Willem J. M.|date=|year=1999|title=Models of word production|url=|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=3|issue=6|pages=223–232|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01319-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]] ([[articulatory phonetics]]), [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] refers to how the tongue, lips, jaw, vocal cords, and other speech organs used to produce sounds are used to make sounds. Speech sounds are categorized by [[manner of articulation]] and [[place of articulation]]. Place of articulation refers to where the airstream in the mouth is constricted. Manner of articulation refers to the manner in which the speech organs interact, such as how closely the air is restricted, what form of airstream is used (e.g. [[Pulmonic consonant|pulmonic]], implosive, ejectives, and clicks), whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, and whether the nasal cavity is opened to the airstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Language &amp; Linguistics|last=Catford|first=J.C.|last2=Esling|first2=J.H.|publisher=Elsevier Science|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Kieth|edition=2nd|location=Amsteram|pages=425–442|chapter=Articulatory Phonetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is primarily used for the production of [[consonant]]s, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as [[Voicing (phonetics)|voicing]] and [[nasalization]]. For any [[place of articulation]], there may be several manners of articulation, and therefore several [[homorganic]] consonants.

Normal human speech is pulmonic, produced with pressure from the [[lung]]s, which creates [[phonation]] in the [[glottis]] in the [[larynx]], which is then modified by the [[vocal tract]] and mouth into different [[vowel]]s and [[consonant]]s. However humans can pronounce words without the use of the lungs and glottis in [[alaryngeal speech]], of which there are three types: [[esophageal speech]], pharyngeal speech and buccal speech (better known as [[Donald Duck talk]]).

=== Speech errors ===
{{main|Speech error}}

Speech production is a complex activity, and as a consequence errors are common, especially in children. Speech errors come in many forms and are often used to provide evidence to support hypotheses about the nature of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speech Errors as Linguistic Evidence|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria|publisher=Mouton|year=1973|isbn=|location=The Hague|pages=11–46|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, speech errors are often used in the construction of models for language production and [[Language acquisition|child language acquisition]]. For example, the fact that children often make the error of over-regularizing the -ed past tense suffix in English (e.g. saying 'singed' instead of 'sang') shows that the regular forms are acquired earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=Kim|last2=Juola|first2=Patrick|date=|year=1999|title=A connectionist model of english past tense and plural morphology|url=|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=23|issue=4|pages=463–490|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2304_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicoladis|first=Elena|last2=Paradis|first2=Johanne|date=|title=Acquiring Regular and Irregular Past Tense Morphemes in English and French: Evidence From Bilingual Children|url=|journal=Language Learning|volume=62|issue=1|pages=170–197|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2010.00628.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech errors associated with certain kinds of aphasia have been used to map certain components of speech onto the brain and see the relation between different aspects of production: for example, the difficulty of [[expressive aphasia]] patients in producing regular past-tense verbs, but not irregulars like 'sing-sang' has been used to demonstrate that regular inflected forms of a word are not individually stored in the lexicon, but produced from affixation of the base form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ullman|first=Michael T.|display-authors=etal|date=|year=2005|title=Neural correlates of lexicon and grammar: Evidence from the production, reading, and judgement of inflection in aphasia.|url=|journal=Brain and Language|volume=93|pages=185–238|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2004.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception==
{{main|Speech perception}}

Speech perception refers to the processes by which humans can interpret and understand the sounds used in language. The study of speech perception is closely linked to the fields of [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] in linguistics and cognitive psychology and perception in psychology. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand [[spoken language]]. Research into speech perception also has applications in building [[speech recognition|computer systems that can recognize speech]], as well as improving speech recognition for hearing- and language-impaired listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia |year=2013 |title=Introduction to Language Development |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Sage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speech perception is [[Categorical perception|categorical]], in that people put the sounds they hear into categories rather than perceiving them as a spectrum. People are more likely to be able to hear differences in sounds across categorical boundaries than within them. A good example of this is [[Voice-onset time|voice onset time]] (VOT). For example, Hebrew speakers, who distinguish voiced /b/ from voiceless /p/, will more easily detect a change in VOT from -10 ( perceived as /b/ ) to 0 ( perceived as /p/ ) than a change in VOT from +10 to +20, or -10 to -20, despite this being an equally large change on the VOT spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kishon-Rabin|first=Liat|last2=Rotshtein|first2=Shira|last3=Taitelbaum|first3=Riki|date=|year=2002|title=Underlying Mechanism for Categorical Perception: Tone-Onset Time and Voice-Onset Time Evidence of Hebrew Voicing|url=|journal=Journal of Basic and Clinical Physiology and Pharmacology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=117–134|doi=10.1515/jbcpp.2002.13.2.117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repetition==
{{main|Speech repetition}}

In speech repetition, speech being heard is quickly turned from sensory input into motor instructions needed for its immediate or delayed vocal imitation (in [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop|phonological memory]]). This type of mapping plays a key role in enabling children to expand their spoken vocabulary. Masur (1995) found that how often children repeat novel words versus those they already have in their lexicon is related to the size of their lexicon later on, with young children who repeat more novel words having a larger lexicon later in development. Speech repetition could help facilitate the acquisition of this larger lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masur|first=Elise|year=1995|title=Infants' Early Verbal Imitation and Their Later Lexical Development|url=|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|volume=41|issue=3|pages=286–306|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems involving speech==
{{See also|Speech-language pathology}}

There are several organic and psychological factors that can affect speech. Among these are:

#Diseases and disorders of the [[lung]]s or the [[vocal cords]], including [[paralysis]], respiratory infections (bronchitis), [[vocal fold nodules]] and [[cancer]]s of the lungs and throat.
#Diseases and disorders of the [[brain]], including [[alogia]], [[aphasia]]s, [[dysarthria]], [[dystonia]] and [[speech processing]] disorders, where impaired [[motor planning]], nerve transmission, phonological processing or perception of the message (as opposed to the actual sound) leads to poor speech production.
#Hearing problems, such as [[otitis media|otitis media with effusion]], and listening problems, [[auditory processing disorder]]s, can lead to phonological problems.
#Articulatory problems, such as [[relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], [[stuttering]], [[lisp (speech)|lisping]], [[cleft palate]], [[ataxia]], or [[nerve]] damage leading to problems in [[Manner of articulation|articulation]]. [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[tic]]s can also affect speech. Various [[congenital disorder|congenital]] and acquired [[tongue disease]]s can affect speech as can [[motor neuron disease]].
#In addition to [[dysphasia]], [[Anomic aphasia|anomia]] and [[auditory processing disorder]] can impede the quality of auditory perception, and therefore, expression.  Those who are [[deafness|Hard of Hearing]] or deaf may be considered to fall into this category.

==Brain physiology==

=== The classical model ===
[[File:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumb|180x180px|Broca's and Wernicke's areas.]]

The classical or [[Wernicke–Geschwind model|Wernicke-Geschwind model]] of the language system in the brain focuses on [[Broca's area]] in the inferior [[prefrontal cortex]], and [[Wernicke's area]] in the posterior [[superior temporal gyrus]] on the [[Lateralization of brain function|dominant hemisphere]] of the brain (typically the left hemisphere for language). In this model, a linguistic auditory signal is first sent from the [[auditory cortex]] to Wernicke's area. The [[lexicon]] is accessed in Wernicke's area, and these words are sent via the [[arcuate fasciculus]] to Broca's area, where morphology, syntax, and instructions for articulation are generated. This is then sent from Broca's area to the [[motor cortex]] for articulation.&lt;ref&gt;Kertesz, A. (2005). "Wernicke--GeschwindModel". In L. Nadel, ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Broca]] identified an approximate region of the brain in 1861 which, when damaged in two of his patients, caused severe deficits in speech production, where his patients were unable to speak beyond a few monosyllabic words. This deficit, known as Broca's or [[expressive aphasia]], is characterized by difficulty in speech production where speech is slow and labored, function words are absent, and syntax is severely impaired, as in [[telegraphic speech]]. In expressive aphasia, speech comprehension is generally less affected except in the comprehension of grammatically complex sentences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hillis, A. E., &amp; Caramazza, A. (2005). "Aphasia". In L. Nadel, ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science''. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Wernicke's area is named after [[Carl Wernicke]], who in 1874 proposed a connection between damage to the posterior area of the left superior temporal gyrus and aphasia, as he noted that not all aphasic patients had suffered damage to the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reader in the History of Aphasia: From '''sasi'''(Franz Gall to)|publisher=John Benjamins Pub Co|year=1995|isbn=90-272-1893-5|volume=4|location=Amsterdam|pages=69–89|chapter=The aphasia symptom-complex: A psychological study on an anatomical basis (1875)|author=Wernicke K.|editor=Paul Eling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage to Wernicke's area produces Wernicke's or [[receptive aphasia]], which is characterized by relatively normal syntax and prosody but severe impairment in lexical access, resulting in poor comprehension and nonsensical or [[Jargon aphasia|jargon speech]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modern research ===
Modern models of the neurological systems behind linguistic comprehension and production recognize the importance of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, but are not limited to them nor solely to the left hemisphere. &lt;ref name="Nakai_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Jeong|first2=JW|last3=Brown|first3=EC|last4=Rothermel|first4=R|last5=Kojima|first5=K|last6=Kambara|first6=T|last7=Shah|first7=A|last8=Mittal|first8=S|last9=Sood|first9=S|last10=Asano|first10=E|year=2017|title=Three- and four-dimensional mapping of speech and language in patients with epilepsy|journal=Brain|volume=140|pages=1351-1370|doi=10.1093/brain/awx051|pmid=28334963|last1=Nakai|first1=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, multiple streams are involved in speech production and comprehension.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4703">'''Symbolic boundaries''' are a theory of how people form social groups proposed by [[cultural sociology|cultural sociologists]].
Symbolic boundaries are “conceptual distinctions made by social actors…that separate people into groups and generate feelings of similarity and group membership.”&lt;ref name=LamontMolnar2002&gt;[[Michele Lamont|Lamont, Michele]] and Virag Molnar. 2002. "The Study of Boundaries in the Social Sciences" Annual Review of Sociology. 28:167-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic boundaries are a necessary but insufficient condition for social change. Only when symbolic boundaries are widely agreed upon can they take on a constraining character and become social boundaries.&lt;ref name=LamontMolnar2002/&gt;

==Durkheim==

[[Émile Durkheim]] saw the symbolic boundary between sacred and profane as the most profound of all social facts, and the one from which lesser symbolic boundaries were derived.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971[1915]) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ritual]]s - secular or religious - were for Durkheim the means by which groups maintained their symbolic/moral boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Allen, ''Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory'' (2009) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mary Douglas]] has subsequently emphasised the role of symbolic boundaries in organising experience, private and public, even in a secular society;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Douglas, ''Natural Symbols'' (2002) p. 50-1&lt;/ref&gt; while other neo-Durkheimians highlight the role of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviancy]] as one of revealing and making plain the symbolic boundaries that uphold moral order, and of providing an opportunity for  their communal reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Annalee R. Ward, '' Mouse Morality'' (2002) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; As Durkheim himself put it, "Crime brings together upright consciences and concentrates them...to talk of the event and wax indignant in common",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Worsley ed., ''The New Modern Sociology Readings'' (1991) p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; thereby reaffirming the collective barriers that have been breached.

==Transgressing boundaries==

[[Prejudice]] is often the result of crossing the symbolic boundaries that preserve a group's sense of itself - boundaries that as with a nation's frontiers may in fact be real as well as symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;C. Cunningham, ''Prejudice'' (2000) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; (The ancient ceremony of [[beating the bounds]] highlights that overlapping of real and symbolic bounds).&lt;ref&gt;[[François Laroque]], ''Shakespeare's Festive World'' (1991) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salman Rushdie]] has emphasised the role of the migrant as a [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] representative, transgressing symbolic boundaries, and (potentially at least) demonised by their upholders in the host nation as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Salman Rushdie, ''Imaginary Homelands'' (1991) p. 278-9 and p. 402&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marjorie Garber]] has explored the role of the [[Transvestism|transvestite]] in crossing the symbolic boundaries of gender - something which she considered tended to challenge those of race as well.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolic/social boundaries==

Symbolic boundaries are distinct from “social boundaries" that are "objectified forms of social differences manifested in unequal access to an unequal distribution of resources… and social opportunities.”&lt;ref name=LamontMolnar2002/&gt;

==Play==

[[Play (activity)|Playing]] may be seen as a way of testing social boundaries - the unspoken [[Frame analysis|frames]] set about social activities.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry Bloustien, ''Girl Making'' (2003) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Humour too provides a way of illuminating, testing and perhaps also shifting symbolic boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;P. Morey/A. Yaqin, ''Framing Muslims'' (2011) p. 199-204&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==

* [[Michael Jackson]], in Garber's opinion, erases and detraumatises not only the boundaries between male and female, youth and age, but also between black and white internalising cultural category crises.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Phillips, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wikipe-tan as the tooth fairy.png|thumb|Tooth Fairy - Artistic Impression]]
'''The Little Mouse''', or [[:fr:Petite souris|La Petite Souris]], is a fairy tale legend popular in most Francophone countries, most notably in [[France]], and [[Wallonia]]. The legend of the Little Mouse ties in with that of the [[Tooth Fairy]], the difference being that in this case, a little mouse sneaks in while the child is asleep, and replaces the lost baby tooth kept under his/her pillow with coins.

==Origin==

Similar legends exist in Hispanic culture, such as [[Ratoncito Pérez]] , as well as most South-Asian cultures from [[India]] to [[Japan]]. It was said in lore and mythology, that if the lost baby tooth of a child was found by an animal, the adult teeth that would follow would bear resemblance to the teeth of that animal. Hence, a mouse was often the animal of choice, because rodent teeth are sharp, and keep growing.

The most feasible origin of this legend, at least in the francophone context, dates back to 17th Century France, to a story penned by [[Marie-Catherine d'Aulnoy|Marie-Catherine Le Jumel de Barneville, baronne d’Aulnoy]] named ''[[The Little Good Mouse]]'' (( or 'La bonne petite souris'. Her story spoke of a fairy who transformed herself into a mouse to be able to defeat an evil king. The fairy, in her mouse form, hid herself under the pillow of the king and caused all his teeth to fall out.

== In popular culture  ==
Many interpretations of the Little Mouse or [[:fr:Petite souris|La Petite Souris]] have appeared in French popular culture. The mouse is often used to make children less frightened, particularly regarding concerns they may have about losing their baby teeth.In French-language media, the little mouse has also starred as the central character of quite a good number of children's books. To name a few as examples : 
* ''Petite Souris'' album by Céline Lamour-Crochet (Author), François Martin  (Illustrations)
* ''La petite souris et la dent'' by Virginie Hanna  (Author), Delphine Bodet  (Illustrations)
* A series of 7 books on ''La petite souris'' by [[:fr:François-Xavier Poulain|Francois-Xavier Poulain]] (Author), Olivier Bailly (Illustrations)

'''''Túath''''' (plural ''túatha'') is the [[Old Irish]] term for the basic political and jurisdictional unit of Gaelic Ireland. ''Túath'' can refer to both a geographical territory as well the people who lived in that territory.&lt;ref name=RIA&gt;{{Cite book| first = | last = The Royal Irish Academy | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1990 | month = | title = Dictionary of the Irish Language | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | publisher = Greystone Press | location = Antrim, N.Ireland | isbn =0-901714-29-1 | url=http://www.dil.ie/42241| page = 612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Social structure==

In ancient Irish terms, a household was reckoned at about 30 people per dwelling. A ''[[trícha cét]]'' ("thirty hundreds"), was an area comprising 100 dwellings or, roughly, 3,000 people. A ''túath'' consisted of a number of allied ''trícha céta'', and therefore referred to no fewer than 6,000 people. Probably a more accurate number for a ''túath'' would be no fewer than 9,000 people.&lt;ref name=Dillon&gt;{{Cite book| first = Myles | last = Dillon | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1994 | month = | title = Early Irish Literature | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | publisher = Four Courts Press | location = Blackrock, Dublin, Ireland | isbn = 1-85182-177-5 | url = | nopp = true| page = xiv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ''túath'' was a self contained unit, with its own executive, assembly, courts system and defence force. ''Túatha'' were grouped together into [[confederations]] for mutual defence. There was a hierarchy of ''túatha'' statuses, depending on geographical position and connection to the ruling dynasties of the region.&lt;ref name=NKPI&gt;{{cite web|last=Ó Corráin|first=Donnchadh||title=Nationality and Kingship in Pre-Norman Ireland|url=https://celt.ucc.ie/nation_kingship.html|work=CELT|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization of ''túatha'' is covered to a great extent within the [[Brehon law]]s, Irish laws written down in the 7th century, also known as the ''Fénechas''.&lt;ref name=Patterson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patterson|first1=Nerys t.|editor1-last=|editor1-first=|title= Cattle Lords and Clansmen: The Social Structure of Early Ireland|date=1994|publisher=University of Notre Dame Pess|location=|isbn= 978-0268161460|page=|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=JGIFDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT228&amp;lpg=PT228&amp;dq=gaelic+tuath+tricha+cet+organisation+medieval&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=334SDlStcJ&amp;sig=n-paEMSfvKL08slwCaviZ2nvQ3E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjphsyq78_dAhUiglwKHShTArc4ChDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=gaelic%20tuath%20tricha%20cet%20organisation%20medieval&amp;f=false|accessdate=|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old Irish political system was altered during and after the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Elizabethan conquest]], being gradually replaced by a system of [[barony (Ireland)|baronies]] and [[counties]] under the new colonial system. Due to a loss of knowledge, there has been some confusion regarding old territorial units in Ireland, mainly between ''trícha céta'' and ''túatha'', which in some cases seem to be overlapping units, and in others, different measurements altogether.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.historyireland.com/medieval-history-pre-1500/medieval-irish-political-and-economic-divisions/&lt;/ref&gt; The ''trícha céta'' were primarily for reckoning military units; specifically, the number of fighting forces a particular population could rally.&lt;ref name=Dillon/&gt; Some scholars equate the ''túath'' with the modern parish, whereas others equate it with the barony. This partly depends on how the territory was first incorporated into the county system. in cases where [[surrender and regrant]] was the method, the match between the old ''túath'' and the modern barony is reasonably equivalent. Whereas in cases like [[Ulster]], which involved large scale colonisation and confiscation of land, the shape of the original divisions is not always clear or recoverable.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.historyireland.com/medieval-history-pre-1500/medieval-irish-political-and-economic-divisions/&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Etymology==
	 
''Túath'' in Old Irish means both "the people", "country, territory", and "territory, petty kingdom, the political and jurisdictional unit of ancient Ireland".&lt;ref name=RIA/&gt; The word possibly derives from [[Proto-Celtic]] *''toutā'' ("tribe, tribal homeland"; cognate roots may be found in the Gaulish god name [[Toutatis]]), which is perhaps from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *''tewtéh₂'' ("tribesman, tribal citizen").{{cn|date=September 2018}} In [[Irish language|Modern Irish]] it is spelled ''tuath'', without the [[Acute accent|fada]] accent, and is usually used to refer to "rural districts" or "the country" (as in "the countryside"); however the historical meaning is still understood and employed, as well.&lt;ref name=ODonaill&gt;{{cite web|last=Ó Dónaill|first=Niall||title=Foclóir Gaeilge-Béarla|url=https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/Tuath

Casagrande views cities as complex energy organisms in which different overlapping layers of energy flows are determining the actions of the citizens as well as the development of the city. By mixing environmentalism and urban design Casagrande is developing methods of punctual manipulation of the urban energy flows in order to create an ecologically sustainable urban development towards the so-called 3rd Generation City (postindustrial city). The theory is developed in the [[Tamkang University]] of [[Taiwan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbandevelopmentbergen.blogspot.com/2010/04/interview-witm-m-casagrande-on-urban.html INTERVIEW WITH M.

Casagrande describes urban acupuncture as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''[a] cross-over architectural manipulation of the collective sensuous intellect of a city. City is viewed as multi-dimensional sensitive energy-organism, a living environment. Urban acupuncture aims into a touch with this nature.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ "Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal,"] – Kyle Miller, MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sensitivity to understand the energy flows of the collective [[Qi|chi]] beneath the visual city and reacting on the hot-spots of this chi. Architecture is in the position to produce the acupuncture needles for the urban chi.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epifanio.eu/nr14/eng/ruin_academy.html "Ruin Academy,"] – Marco Casagrande, Epifanio 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''A weed will root into the smallest crack in the asphalt and eventually break the city.  Urban acupuncture is the weed and the acupuncture point is the crack. The possibility of the impact is total, connecting human nature as part of nature.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Casagrande utilized the tenets of acupuncture: treat the points of blockage and let relief ripple throughout the body. More immediate and sensitive to community needs than traditional institutional forms of large scale urban renewal interventions would not only respond to localized needs, but do so with a knowledge of how citywide systems operated and converged at that single node. Release pressure at strategic points, release pressure for the whole city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Urban Applications'' 2013 {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416051344/http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ |date=16 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participatory planning==

In theory, urban acupuncture opens the door for uncontrolled creativity and freedom.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Citizens are enabled to join the creative [[participatory planning]] process, feel free to use city space for any purpose and develop their environment according to their will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadsbyggnad.lth.se/fileadmin/stadsbyggnad/images/_1_Sudes_Book/_1_B5_webversion1.pdf Compost City] – Guoda Bardauskaite'' p. 30-31, Sustainable Urban Design Journal 1 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This "new" post-industrialized city Casagrande, dubbed the Third Generation City, is driven by people who are concerned about the destruction that the modern machine is causing to nature including human nature. They want sustainable co-operation with the rest of the nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbaninteraction.net/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Raune Frankjær, Rethink: Urban Interaction'' 10/2012&lt;/ref&gt; In a larger context, a site of urban acupuncture can be viewed as communicating to the city outside like a natural sign of life in a city programmed to subsume it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/37444/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Kelly Chan, Architizer'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban acupuncture bears some similarities to the [[New Urbanism|new urbanist]] concept of Tactical Urbanism. The idea focuses on local resources rather than capital-intensive municipal programs and promotes the idea of citizens installing and caring for interventions. These small changes, proponents claim, will boost community morale and catalyze revitalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newurbannetwork.com/news-opinion/links/15079/urban-acupuncture-touted-cash-strapped-cities 'Urban acupuncture' touted for cash-strapped cities] – ''David West, New Urban Network'' 7/2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2016}} Boiled down to a simple statement, "urban acupuncture" means focusing on small, subtle, bottom-up interventions that harness and direct community energy in positive ways to heal urban blight and improve the cityscape.

This approach can provide a more realistic and less costly method for city planners and citizens as an effective way to make minor improvements in the communities in order to achieve a greater good in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fluxtrends.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=111&amp;limitstart=5 Urban Acupuncture] – ''  Mariam Mahomed, Urban Spaces

[[Jaime Lerner]], the former mayor of [[Curitiba]], suggests urban acupuncture as the future solution for contemporary urban issues; by focusing on very narrow pressure points in cities, we{{Who|date=July 2012}} can initiate positive ripple effects for the greater society.

He described in 2007:&lt;br /&gt;
"I believe that some medicinal "magic" can and should be applied to cities, as many are sick and some nearly terminal. As with the medicine needed in the interaction between doctor and patient, in urban planning it is also necessary to make the city react; to poke an area in such a way that it is able to help heal, improve, and create positive chain reactions. It is indispensable in revitalizing interventions to make the organism work in a different way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal] – Kyle Miller'' MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwanese architect and academic Ti-Nan Chi is looking with micro urbanism at the vulnerable and insignificant side of contemporary cities around the world identified as micro-zones, points for recovery in which micro-projects have been carefully proposed to involve the public on different levels, aiming to resolve conflicts among property owners, villagers, and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=16364 Chi Ti-Nan develops a project to preserve Hong Kong coastline Tai Long Sai Wan] – '' World Architecture News'' 4/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A loosely affiliated team of architects [[Wang Shu]], Marco Casagrande, [[Hsieh Ying-chun]] and [[Roan Ching-yueh]] (sometimes called WEAK!

==Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award==
The winner of the Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award (DBUAA) Cape Town 2012 is the neighbourhood project "Mothers Unite" demonstrating the power of urban acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mothersunite.org.za/2012/04/deutsche-bank-urban-age-award-19-april-2012/ Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award – 19 April 2012] – '' Mothers Unite'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers Unite was founded in 2007 and provides a safe haven from the gangsterism, drugs and violence that are part and parcel of street and home life in the area. Built with donated shipping containers, the village is made up of a library, kitchen, office, sheltered area, playground and food garden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.db.com/csr/en/social_investments/deutsche_bank_urban_age_award_2012_winner_announced.html Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award 2012 – winner announced] – '' Deutsche Bank Corporate Social Responsibility'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Edgar Pieterse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Durable urban change is often about carefully targeted micro interventions that can change the energies and dynamics of a surrounding neighbourhood. When one engages with the physical manifestations that the tenacity, blood, sweat, and tears of the protagonists of Mothers Unite and Masiphumelele Library (another of the eight finalists) have created, the power of urban acupuncture is apparent. These projects serve as reminders that through vision, commitment over the long haul, and principle-based partnerships, just about any problem can be confronted and addressed.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capetown2014.co.za/2012/04/mothers-unite-urban-acupuncture-for-an-urban-age/ Mothers Unite: Urban acupuncture for an urban age] – '' Cape Town 2014 Live Design.

==Urban ecological restoration==
In ecological restoration of industrial cities Urban Acupuncture can take form as spontaneous and often illegal urban farms and [[Community gardening|community gardens]] punctuating the more mechanical city and tuning it towards a more sustainable co-existence with the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/the-community-gardens-of-taipei/2010/12/04 Taipei Organic Acupuncture] – ''Marco Casagrande, P2P Foundation'' 12/2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
Urban Acupuncture areas can receive, treat and [[recycle]] the waste from the surrounding city acting as eco-valleys within the urban fabric. In River Urbanism the Urban Acupuncture areas can include underground [[stormwater]] reservoirs and act as [[flood]] relief for the surrounding city as a [[sponge]] and they can act as [[Biofilter|biological filters]] purifying water originated from polluted rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecture.org/internal/content/download.asp?wdoc=urbanecopuncture-marcocasagrande.doc Urban Ecopuncture] – ''Marco Casagrande, World Architecture'' 10/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Urban acupuncture is a point by point manipulation of the urban energy to create a sustainable town or city, which Marco Casagrande has dubbed '3rd Generation Cities'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainablecities.dk/en/city-projects/cases/amsterdam-urban-acupuncture-creates-new-life-in-the-suburbs Amsterdam: Urban Acupuncture creates new life in the suburbs] – ''Danish Architecture Centre, Sustainable Cities'' 6/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban acupuncture in art==

American artist [[Gordon Matta-Clark]] is credited with developing a system for identifying pockets of disrepair in the built environment—the first step in the framework of urban acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal] – Kyle Miller'' MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt; 
Artist [[Miru Kim]] explores industrial [[ruin]]s and structures making her look at the city as one living organism. She claims to feel not only the skin of the city, but also to penetrate the inner layers of its intestines and veins, which swarm with minuscule life forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/zh-tw/miru_kim_s_underground_art.html Miru Kim] – ''TED Talks'' 2/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to a public [[environmental art]] work, Cicada, Casagrande explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Cicada is urban acupuncture for Taipei city penetrating the hard surfaces of industrial laziness in order to reach the original ground and get in touch with the collective Chi, the local knowledge that binds the people of [[Taipei basin]] with nature. The [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] of Cicada is an accidental mediator between the modern man and reality. There is no other reality than nature.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/urban-design/marco-casagrande-cicada-installation-taipei.html Could Cities Benefit from Small-Scale, Local "Urban Acupuncture" Projects Like This?] – Kimberley Mok ''Treehugeer'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Environmental art as urban acupuncture is an artistic way of injecting a healthy dose of natural elements and human scale into the mechanized urban grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archetcetera.blogspot.com/2012/01/signs-of-life.html Signs of Life] – Phyllis Richardson ''Archetcetera'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yoruba tribal marks''' are [[scarification]]s which are specific identification and beautification marks designed on the face or body of the [[Yoruba people]]. The tribal marks are part of the [[Yoruba culture]] and are usually inscribed on the body by burning or cutting of the [[skin]] during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lefèber|first1=Yvonne|author2=Henk W.

The primary function of the tribal marks is for identification of a person's tribe, family or [[patrilineal]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Orie (2011), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/10/marked-life-tribal-marks-attractive-repulsive/|publisher=[[Vanguard News]]|title=Marked for life?

This practice was popular among Yoruba people of [[Nigeria]], [[Benin]], and [[Togo]]. During the [[Atlantic slave trade|trans-Atlantic slave trade]], tribal identification and facial stripes became important.&lt;ref&gt;Odunbaku (2012), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some repatriated slaves later reunited with their communities by looking at facial stripes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

However, the use of tribal marks is fading in Yoruba land.

==Background==
In traditional Yoruba societies, every child is born into a patrilineal clan called idile baba in Yoruba language. The clan share clan names (orile), oriki (poetry), taboos (eewo) and facial marks (ila). The facial marks on the child assigns the child full clan membership rights. The children with facial marks are called Okola. Families or individuals lacking the normal features consistent with the tribe are not considered as acquiring full standing as agents in Yoruba society. They would also lack the capacity for meaningful behavior, such as greeting, stating and commanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bello|first=Abiodun|url=http://newtelegraphonline.com/tribal-marks-a-peoples-identity/|title=Tribal marks, a people's identity|publisher=[[New Telegraph]]|date=10 February 2015|accessdate=19 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522014534/http://newtelegraphonline.com/tribal-marks-a-peoples-identity/|archivedate=22 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each [[List of tribes in Nigeria|tribe]] of the [[History of the Yoruba people|Yoruba ethnic group]] had different inscription patterns which appears in different sizes and shapes at different locations within the face or body.

===Pele===
The Pele style is three longitudinal lines, inscribed on the cheeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realnewsmagazine.net/lifestyle/killed-by-modernity/|title=Killed by modernity|work=realnewsmagazine.net|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odunbaku (2012), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pele have different variants. The variants includes; ''Pele Ife'', a three longitudinal line inscribed on the cheek. It is peculiar to the [[Ile Ife|Ile Ife people]]. ''Pele Ijebu'' and ''Pele Ijesha'' are other variants of Pele. Both variants are three short longitudinal lines inscribed on the cheeks.&lt;ref name="D.Adeleke2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abraham Ajibade Adeleke Ph.

===Owu===
Owu tribal marks consist of six incisions on each side of the cheeks and peculiar to the indigenes of Owu, an historical city in [[Abeokuta]], the capital of [[Ogun State, Nigeria]]. The Owu tribal mark was inscribed on the cheeks of [[Tribal chief|Chief]] [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], the former President of the [[Nigeria|Federal Republic of Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/tribal-marks-my-id-card-obasanjo/|title=Tribal marks my ID card - Obasanjo|work=|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gọmbọ===
The Gọmbọ style, also known as  Kẹkẹ, consists of multiple straight and curved lines about a half of an inch apart inscribed on the cheeks on both sides of the mouth.  Indigenes of [[Ogbomosho]] in [[Oyo State]] are usually identified by the Gombo or Kẹkẹ style of Yoruba tribal marks.

Abaja can be both a basic and also a complex style. In its basic form, it is either three or four horizontal stripes on the cheeks. 
The Abaja style also consists of twelve horizontal lines, six lines per cheek. It is often referred to as "Abaja Alaafin Mefa Mefa". This tribal mark is unique to the indigenes of [[Oyo, Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T5v11UywUbwC&amp;pg=PT198|title=Yoruba Traditions and African American Religious Nationalism|publisher=UNM Press|first=Tracey E.|last=Hucks|isbn=0826350771}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Abaja style of Yoruba tribal mark was inscribed on the cheeks of [[Lamidi Adeyemi III]], the [[Alaafin|Alaafin of Oyo]].

==Use of tribal marks today==
The use of tribal marks as a means of identification and beautification among the Yoruba tribe is no longer a norm and some Yoruba states have enacted certain laws that prohibit the use of the marks. Violators of the law are liable to fines or imprisonment (or both).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|pages=86|author1=Falola, Toyin  |author2=Ngom, Fallou |lastauthoramp=yes |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3YKMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86|title=Facts, Fiction, and African Creative Imaginations|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=1135212899}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Oyo State]], for example, the prohibition of tribal marks is an integral part of the state [[Children's rights movement|Child Rights Law]], a law that imposes a fine or one-month imprisonment or both for violation.&lt;ref name="Star Africa"&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Apa, Nigeria|Apa]]|title=The kick against aged tribal marks in Nigeria|url=http://en.starafrica.com/news/the-kick-against-aged-tribal-marks-in-nigeria.html|accessdate=19 May 2015|publisher=Star Africa|date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the law "No person shall tattoo or make a skin mark or cause any tattoo or skin mark to be made on a child".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.ng/news2013/index.php/en/editorial/item/12411-tribal-marks-in-modern-nigeria |title=Tribal marks in modern Nigeria: The burden, the anguish |author=Adeoye, Doyin |work=[[Nigerian Tribune|The Tribune]] |accessdate=19 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521160445/http://tribune.com.ng/news2013/index.php/en/editorial/item/12411-tribal-marks-in-modern-nigeria |archivedate=21 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
