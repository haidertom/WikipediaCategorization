      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4410">The '''Afo-A-Kom''' is a wooden sculpture, the foremost symbol of the [[Kom people (Cameroon)|Kom people]] of the [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|North West Region]] of [[Cameroon]]. In 1966 it was stolen from Kom's royal compound. Seven years later it was recognized in a U.S. art gallery, and after some dispute, it was returned to the Kom people.&lt;ref&gt;Afo-A-Kom.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afo-A-Kom, which means ''the Kom thing'' (also ''Mbang'' in the [[Kom language]]) is a 62.5 inch wooden stylized carving of a standing man, crowned and holding a scepter, behind a stool supported on three carved buffalo heads. The core is [[iroko]] wood. His face is sheathed in copper and much of the body is covered with reddish and blue beads. (See the Arthemis link below for a photo online.) The [[Fon (title)|Foyn/Fon]] (chief) cares for the statue, and it symbolizes "royal authority and the promise of continued succession."&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The carver of this statue is unknown but it is speculated that Afo-A-Kom was carved by the second traditional leader (Foyn) of the Kom people in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 1966, the Afo-A-Kom was stolen from its sacred grove at [[Laikom]] (the seat of the Kom people, where the Foyn resides) by one of the princes, then sold to a middle man who later sold it to an art dealer who took it to the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;Blakeslee.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p. 141-145.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kom people believe that the Afo-A-Kom possesses mystical powers and that shortly after it arrived in the US it began disturbing its new owners by destroying everything around it. Its new owner took it and threw it into the sea but only to get back home and see the Afo-A-Kom.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} He took it to a New York art gallery where he sold it for circa 15 million CFA. While there it was recognized, and American art collector [[Warren M. Robbins]] raised an alarm. He raised funds together with other Americans&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; and some Kom elite in the US{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} to purchase the stolen statue back from the Manhattan art gallery for under $30,000.&lt;ref&gt;Afo-A-Kom.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning the figure, Robbins was welcomed by the Fon of the Kom people Nsom Ngwe, and the President of Cameroon [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]], among other dignitaries.

During the reception of the statue in Yaounde, Ahidjo suggested to Fon Nsom Ngwe that Mbang be kept in the National Museum in Yaounde, but the Fon replied that if the President can provide enough space in Yaounde for him to go and bring the Kom people to stay with it there, then he would accept the president's proposal. Seeing that Kom and the Afo-A-Kom were inseparable, the president made it possible for the statue to be taken back to its habitual residence at Laikom. However, it was briefly put on display at the Tourism Office in Yaounde and later on transported by air to [[Bamenda]]. It was then ferried by a delegation of the dignitaries of the region back to Fundong where it was handed back to the Kom people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

It is now in the Laikom palace where it is put on display annually for the Kom people.&lt;ref&gt;Abang Njuosi.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="609">'''American mythology''' is the body of traditional stories pertaining to America's most legendary stories and folktale, dating back to the late 1700's when the first colonists settled. "American mythology" may also refer to the modern study of these representations, and to the subject matter as represented in the literature and art of other cultures in any period.

Stories from American mythology are the primary sources of inspiration for stories  and tall tales such as [[Bigfoot]], [[Paul Bunyan]], and [[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5591">'''Angelic tongues''' are the languages supposedly used by angels. It usually refers to sung praise in [[Second Temple period]] Jewish materials.

==Dead Sea Scrolls==
[[Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice]] is the principal source for angelic tongues at [[Qumran]]. The texts are fragmentary but appear to relate to praise tongues:
*[...] through the wonderful height [...] tongue of purity [...] gods (~yhla), seven [...] 4Q400 3 1, 1-2
* ...Psalm of praise, on the tongue of the fou[rth]...[Ps]alm of [tha]nksgiving, on the tongue of the fifth...[Psalm] of exultation, on the tongue of the sixth...Psalm of [singing, on the to]ngue of the seventh of the [chief] pri[nces,] a powerful song [to the God] of ho[lines] with its se[ven] wo[nd]er[ful songs] 4Q403 1 1, 1-6
* Proclaim his glory with the tongue of all who proclaim knowledge, his wonderful songs with the mouth of all who proclaim [him. For he is] God of all who sing {knowledge} for ever, and Judge in his power over all the spirits of understanding. 4Q4031 1 36-37
* ...The tongue of the first will be strengthened seven times with the tongue of the second to him....{this is repeated for the series up to the seventh}... 4Q403 1 2, 27-30

It is not clear whether the angelic tongues are coherent, intelligible to man. However, since Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice is itself related to sung praise at the Qumran community, there is a parallel with coherent angelic praise tongues in Testament of Job.&lt;ref&gt;Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, edited by James H. Charlesworth and Carol A. Newsom. Theological Studies 54  2003 649–653.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John C. Poirier ''Tongues of Angels: Concept of Angelic Languages in Classical Jewish and Christian Texts '' 2010. XI, 224 pages. WUNT II 287  p110 "Cf. Sheres and Blau 1995:84: "But the angels' speech [in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice] is not recorded. Why do we not hear what they are saying? One commentator has suggested that the big difference between the 'tongues of men and of angels' rendered their idiom unintelligible. Perhaps also, at such auspicious moments the sectarians themselves spoke in tongues (an ecstatic incomprehensible language), a chanting that would drown out what was going on. The sectarians' taste for the esoteric is evident elsewhere"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George J. Brooke, Hindy Najman, Loren T. Stuckenbruck ''The significance of Sinai: traditions about Sinai and divine Revelation in Judaism and Christianity.'' 2008 p57 "Participation in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice liturgy is reserved for those sufficiently righteous and ... in order to acquire “tongues of angels” would seem to have been such an elite."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loren T. Stückenbruck ''Angel veneration and Christology: a study in early Judaism and in the Christology of the Apocalypse of John, by Loren T. Stuckenbruck. WUNT 2/70'' 1995 p156 ''The Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice This brings us to a consideration of the angelic sabbath-liturgy (Shi- rot 'Olat ha-Shabbat), which was not fully published and ... and seven tongues, each being seven-fold more powerful than the next ...''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testament of Job==
The pseudepigraphical [[Testament of Job]] (ca.100 BCE–100CE) contains a conclusion which is believed to relate to the compiling of the hymnbook used by a [[Therapeutae]] community.&lt;ref&gt;''Testament of Job'' in Charlesworth J.H., The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha Vol.II, Doubleday 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Job gives one of his daughters "a cord" (a stringed instrument of some kind?) 
* "And she took on another heart—no longer minded toward earthly things—but ecstatically in the angelic dialect, sending up a hymn to God in accord with the style of the angels. And as she spoke ecstatically, she allowed “The Spirit” to be on her garment." (T. Job 48:2-3)&lt;ref&gt;http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/noncanon/ot/pseudo/test-job.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Job’s other daughters likewise took on “the dialect of archons”, “the dialect of those and the “dialect of the cherubim” (T. Job 49:1-50:3). The “cherubim” are also mentioned Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice as blessing God (4Q403 1 2, 15, cf. 4Q405 20 2, 3). 

There is parallel description of sung prophecy among the Therapeutae in [[Alexandria]] by [[Philo]], but no mention there of angelic tongues.&lt;ref&gt;Philo, On the Contemplative Life http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book34.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
A possible reference to Jewish practices of angelic tongues is 1Co13:1 "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal." The distinction "of men" and "of angels" may suggests that a distinction was known to the Corinthians. If a distinction is intended then 1Co14:10 "There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning" may imply that "tongues of men" were intelligible, whereas 1Co14:2 For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit." refers to angelic tongues. The problem with this is that the "angelic" tongues documented at Qumran and among the Therapeutae appear to be inspired, but coherent and intelligible, sung praise. Against this is the view of Dunn that "It is evident then that Paul thinks of [[glossolalia]] as language". {{dubious|date=December 2015}} &lt;ref&gt;James D. G. Dunn Jesus and the Spirit: "A Study of the Religious and Charismatic Experience of Jesus and the First Christians as Reflected in the New Testament," p. 244 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''animal epithet''' is a name used to label a person or group, by association with some perceived quality of an [[animal]]. [[Epithet]]s may be formulated as [[simile]]s, explicitly comparing people with the named animal, or as [[metaphor]]s, directly naming people as animals. Animal epithets may be [[pejorative]], readily giving offence, and they are sometimes used in political campaigns. One English epithet, lamb, is always used positively.

Animal similes and metaphors have been used since classical times, for example by [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]], to heighten effects in literature, and to sum up complex concepts concisely.

Surnames that name animals are found in different countries. They may be [[metonym]]ic, naming a person's profession, generally in the [[Middle Ages]]; [[toponym]]ic, naming the place where a person lived; or [[nickname]]s, comparing the person favourably or otherwise with the named animal.

==History==

[[File:Mnesterophonia Louvre CA7124.jpg|thumb|left|[[Odysseus]], slaughtering Penelope's suitors on his return home at the end of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', is compared by [[Homer]] to a lion.&lt;ref name=Campbell2014/&gt; Bell-[[krater]], c. 330 BC]]

In the cultures of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], animal stereotypes grew until by the time of [[Virgil]], animal epithets could be applied to anything from an abstract concept like love or fear, to a whole civilisation. An author could use an animal's name to emphasise a theme or to provide an overview of a complex epic tale. For example, [[Homer]] uses animal similes in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', where the lion symbolises qualities such as bravery. This leads up to the lion [[simile]] at the end of the ''Odyssey'', where in Book 22 [[Odysseus]] kills all Penelope's suitors. In the ''Iliad'', Homer compares the [[Troy|Trojans]] to [[stridulating]] [[grasshopper]]s, which the classicist Gordon Lindsay Campbell believes to imply that they make a lot of noise but are weaker and less determined than they think. In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Book 4, Virgil compares the world of [[Dido]], queen of [[Carthage]], with a colony of [[ant]]s. Campbell argues that Dido's people are hardworking, strong, unfailingly loyal, organised, and self-regulating: just the sort of world that the hero Aeneas would like to create. But, Campbell argues, the simile also suggests that Carthage's civilisation is fragile and insignificant, and could readily be destroyed.&lt;ref name=Campbell2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Gordon Lindsay |title=The Oxford Handbook of Animals in Classical Thought and Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_OWkBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT147 |year=2014 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-103516-6 |pages=145–147, and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insults==

Animal epithets may be [[pejorative]], indeed in some cultures highly offensive.&lt;ref name="Herzfeld2016"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herzfeld |first=Michael|title=Cultural Intimacy: Social Poetics and the Real Life of States, Societies, and Institutions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lSpCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-29755-0 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epithets are sometimes used in political campaigns; in 1890, the trades unionist [[Chummy Fleming]] marched with a group of unemployed people through the streets of Melbourne, displaying a banner with the message "Feed on our flesh and blood you capitalist [[hyena]]s: it is your funeral feast".&lt;ref name="Scates1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scates |first=Bruce |title=A New Australia: Citizenship, Radicalism and the First Republic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zkgeEmlRjEgC&amp;pg=PA32 |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57296-5 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the ideological divide, the Cuban government described the revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] as a "communist [[rat]]" in 1958.&lt;ref name="Reid-Henry2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid-Henry |first=Simon |title=Fidel and Che: A Revolutionary Friendship |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aorld6QRmYgC&amp;pg=PT141 |year=2009 |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |isbn=978-1-84894-138-0 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epithets are not limited to mammals; for instance, comparing someone to a [[snail]] means they are (extremely) slow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pamatier, Robert Allen |title=Speaking of Animals: A Dictionary of Animal Metaphors |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSr4fO2zYrIC&amp;pg=PA351 |year=1995 |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=978-0-313-29490-7 |page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; while calling them a [[slug]] implies they are lazy and loathsome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slug|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/slug|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=12 July 2017|quote=2. A slow, lazy person. "'Even though you're dying to bitchslap your clueless roommate, loser boyfriend or loathsome slug of a boss, play nice.'"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frog is pejorative for French people in English, from the use of frogs' legs in French cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Why do the French call the British 'the roast beefs'? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2913151.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=3 April 2003 |accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taboos===
Edmund Leach argued in a classic 1964 paper that animal epithets are insulting when the animal in question is [[taboo]], making its name suitable for use as an obscenity. For example, Leach argues that calling a person "a son of a bitch" or "you swine" means that the "animal name itself is credited with potency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leach |first1=Edmund |editor=Lenneberg, E. H. |title=Anthropological Aspects of Language: Animal Categories and Verbal Abuse |work=New directions in the study of language |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, John Halverson argued that Leach's argument about taboos was "specious", and his "categorisation of animals in terms of 'social distance' and edibility is inconsistent in itself and corresponds neither to reality nor to the scheme of social distance and human sexuality it is claimed to parallel". Halverson disputed the association of animal epithets with potency, noting that calling a timid person a mouse, or a person who does not face reality an ostrich, or a silly person a goose, does not mean that these names are potent, taboo, or sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halverson |first1=John |title=Animal Categories and Terms of Abuse |journal=Man |date=December 1976 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=505–516 |jstor=2800435}} (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Timothy Jay argues, citing Leach, that the use of animal epithets as insults is partly down to taboos on eating pets or unfamiliar wild animals,&lt;!--this obviously doesn't explain use of farmyard animal names, then!--&gt; and partly down to our stereotypes of animals' habits, such as that pigs "are dirty, fat, and eat filth".  Jay further cites [[Sigmund Freud]]'s view that obscenities that name animals, such as cow, cock, dog, pig, and bitch, gain their power by reducing people to animals.&lt;ref name="Jay1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jay |first=Timothy |title=Why We Curse: A neuro-psycho-social theory of speech |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcJHAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196 |year=1999 |publisher=John Benjamins |isbn=978-90-272-9848-5 |pages=196–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Bróna |title=Corpus and Sociolinguistics: Investigating age and gender in female talk |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZV4zAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 |year=2010 |publisher=John Benjamins |isbn=978-90-272-8861-5 |pages=170–}}&lt;!--cites and relies on Jay--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphors and similes==

The use of metaphors from zoology, such as referring to politicians as rats or hyenas, is what the linguistic researcher Aida Sakalauskaite calls "zoometaphors"&lt;ref name=Sakalauskaite&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sakalauskaite |first1=Aida |title=Zoometaphors in English, German, and Lithuanian: A Corpus Study |date=2010 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley (PhD Thesis) |url=http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/etd/ucb/text/Sakalauskaite_berkeley_0028E_10322.pdf |accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Grzegorz A. Kleparski calls "zoosemy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kleparski, G.A. |date=1990 |title=Semantic Change in English: A Study of Evaluative Developments in the Domain of Humans |publisher=Wydawnictwo KUL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kiełtyka, R. and G.A. Kleparski. 2005. "The scope of English zoosemy: the case of domesticated animals" [in:] Kleparski. G.A. (ed.). Studia Anglica Resoviensia 3, 76-87.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of [[metaphor]]s from [[zoology]]. In each of three different languages, English, German, and Lithuanian, the most common animal categories are farmyard animals (40% in English), [[Canidae]] (including dog and wolf, 6% in English), and birds (10% in English). Grammatically, metaphor, as in "sly fox", is not the only option: speakers may also use [[simile]], as in "deaf as an ass". In German, 92% of animal epithets are metaphors, 8% similes, whereas in English, 53% are similes, 47% metaphors.&lt;ref name=Sakalauskaite/&gt;

The Hungarian linguists Katalin Balogné Bérces and Zsuzsa Szamosfalvi found in a preliminary survey of Serbian usage that the most commonly used "animal vocatives" were, in order, 1. pig, 2. chick(en), 3. dog/puppy, 4. cow, 5. monkey, 6. hen, 7. rat, 8. turkey, 9. mouse, 10. snake, 11. cat/kitten, 12. fox, 13. lamb, 14. vixen, 15. worm. Of these, using the classification devised by Sabina Halupka-Resetar, and Biljana Radic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halupka-Resetar |first1=Sabina |last2=Radic |first2=Biljana |title=Animal names used in addressing people in Serbian |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2003 |volume=35 |pages=1891–1902 |doi=10.1016/s0378-2166(03)00052-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; lamb was always used positively; cow and vixen referred to a person's appearance; pig indicated a person's eating habits; calling someone a fox or a turkey related to their intelligence, or lack of it; and names like cat, snake, worm, monkey, dog, mouse, chicken, lamb and rat were used to indicate a person's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bérces |first1=Katalin Balogné |last2=Szamosfalvi |first2=Zsuzsa |title=Animal Names Used in Addressing People (in English) |url=https://linguistlist.org/issues/20/20-295.html |accessdate=1 July 2016 |date=28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surnames==
[[File:The Painter and His Pug by William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|upright|The painter [[William Hogarth]]'s name is a [[metonym]] for a swineherd. Self-portrait with his dog, 1745]]

Some English surnames from the [[Middle Ages]] name animals. These have different origins. Some, like Pigg (1066), Hogg (1079) and Hoggard, Hogarth (1279) are [[metonym]]s for a swineherd,&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, pages 234, 351&lt;/ref&gt; while Oxer (1327) similarly denotes an [[ox]]herd&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 334&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shepherd]] (1279 onwards) means as it sounds a herder of sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, pages 404–405&lt;/ref&gt;

Surnames that mention animals can also be [[toponym]]ic, the names Horscroft, Horsfall, Horsley and Horstead for example all denoting people who came from these villages associated with [[horse]]s. The surname Horseman (1226 onwards) on the other hand is a metonym for a rider, mounted warrior, or horse-dealer, while the surnames Horse and Horsnail could either be nicknames or metonyms for workers with horses and [[farrier|shoers of horses]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Some surnames, like Bird, dating from 1193 onwards, with variants like Byrd and Bride, are most likely [[nickname]]s for a [[bird]]like person, though they may also be metonyms for a birdcatcher; but Birdwood is toponymic, for a person who lived by a wood full of birds.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eagle]] from 1230 is a nickname from the bird,&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 148&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Weasel]], Wessel from 1193 and [[Stag]]g from 1198 are certainly nicknames from those animals.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, pages 423, 480&lt;/ref&gt; It is not always easy to tell whether a nickname was friendly, humorous or negative, but the surname [[Stallion]], with variants Stallan, Stallen and Stallon, (1202 onwards) is certainly pejorative, meaning "a begetter, a man of lascivious life".&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 423&lt;/ref&gt;

Surnames behave in similar ways in other languages; for example in [[France]], surnames can be toponymic, metonymic, or may record nicknames ("sobriquets"). [[Poisson (disambiguation)|Poisson]] ([[Fish]]) is a metonym for a fishmonger or fisherman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patronyme Poisson : Nom de famille |url=http://www.genealogie.com/nom-de-famille/POISSON.html |publisher=Genealogie.com |accessdate=27 July 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loiseau (The bird) and Lechat (The cat) are nicknames, Lechat indicating either a flexible man or a hypocrite, Loiseau suggesting a lightly-built birdlike person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patronyme Lechat : Nom de famille |url=http://www.genealogie.com/nom-de-famille/Lechat.html |publisher=Genealogie.com |accessdate=27 July 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patronyme Loiseau : Nom de famille |url=http://www.genealogie.com/nom-de-famille/Loiseau.html |publisher=Genealogie.com |accessdate=27 July 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sweden]], the surname [[Falk (name)|Falk]] ([[Falcon]]) is common;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efternamn, topp 100 (2015) |url=http://www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Befolkning/Amnesovergripande-statistik/Namnstatistik/30898/30905/Samtliga-folkbokforda--Efternamn-topplistor/31063/ |publisher=Statistiska centralbyrån (Statistics Sweden) |accessdate=26 July 2016 |language=Swedish |date=22 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729032257/http://www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Befolkning/Amnesovergripande-statistik/Namnstatistik/30898/30905/Samtliga-folkbokforda--Efternamn-topplistor/31063/ |archivedate=29 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is found among Swedish nobility from 1399.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hildebrand, Bengt |title=Falck och Falk, släkter |url=https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=15008 |work=Svenskt biografiskt lexikon |publisher=Riksarkivet (Swedish national archive) |accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lamb jacket with leopard print.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A leopard print jacket]]

'''Animal print''' is a clothing and fashion style in which the garment is made to resemble the pattern of the skin and fur of an animal such as a [[leopard]], [[cheetah]], [[zebra]], [[tiger]], [[spotted hyena]], [[striped hyena]], [[African wild dog]], [[giraffe]] or [[monkey]]. Animal print is also used for room decoration, [[handbag]]s and [[footwear]] and even some jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashion-era.com/trends_2009/2008-9-winter-animal-autumn-fashion.htm Leopard print clothes &amp;#124; Animal Fashion Trends Autumn 2008 Winter 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; A major difference between animal prints and [[fur clothing]] is that animal prints today very often use [[fake fur]] instead of animal [[Coat (animal)|coat]].

==History==

Animal prints have long been a popular style for many reasons. For one, they are generally expensive and considered rather [[Exoticism|exotic]]; hence they are a symbol of wealth and status. Throughout history, kings and other high people have used animal print rugs and such as a sign of status just as mounted animals are kept as [[trophies]]. Animal print became popular for women in the United States in the late 1960s &lt;ref name="The history of animal print"&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of animal prints|url=https://belldininews.wordpress.com/2011/05/13/the-history-of-animal-print/}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Bohemian style|Bohemian movement]].

==Other uses==
Besides a distinctive natural animal pattern on clothing, "animal prints" may also refer to art prints of animals, printed on canvas or paper. The art prints may replicate the same skin or fur pattern found on the animal, but a flat photographic representation printed on artistic media, such as for as wall decorations. The prints are not limited to just the animal's skin or fur pattern, but may be any part of the animal and still be called an animal print.&lt;ref name="Animal Prints"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Prints|url=http://animalprints.co/|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal print applications extend beyond clothing and art prints and are commonly used for other decorations, including rugs, wallpaper, or painted surfaces. In addition, animal prints may be used in designs for race cars, airplanes, signage, building exteriors, or safety gear such as helmets the NFL team, [[Cincinnati Bengals]], uses.

Other companies like [[Kate Spade New York]] have begun incorporating the animal print design into accessories such as [[iPad]] hard cases and folios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 4 Cool Kate Spade iPad Mini Case Models - Lure of Mac|url = http://lureofmac.com/kate-spade-ipad-mini-case/|website = Lure of Mac|access-date = 2016-02-18|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashis Nandy''' ({{lang-bn|আশিস নন্দী}}; born 1937) is an Indian [[Political psychology|political psychologist]], [[social theorist]], and critic. A trained [[clinical psychologist]], Nandy has provided theoretical critiques of [[European colonialism]], development, modernity, secularism, [[Hindutva]], science, technology, [[nuclearism]], cosmopolitanism, and utopia. He has also offered alternative conceptions relating to cosmopolitanism and critical traditionalism. In addition to the above, Nandy has offered an original historical profile of India's commercial cinema as well as critiques of state and violence.

He was Senior Fellow and Former Director of the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] (CSDS) for several years. Today, he is a Senior Honorary Fellow at the institute and apart from being the Chairperson of the Committee for Cultural Choices and Global Futures, also in New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/NANDY.HTM Ashis Nandy] [[Emory University]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csds.in/faculty_ashis_nandy.htm Ashis Nandy – Senior Honorary Fellow] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504181121/http://www.csds.in/faculty_ashis_nandy.htm |date=4 May 2009 }} [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] (CSDS) website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nandy had received the [[Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize – Laureates for 2007 | url = http://www.asianmonth.com/prize/english/18/index.html | publisher = The Fukuoka Asian Culture Prizes | accessdate = 19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 he appeared on the list of the [[Top 100 Public Intellectuals Poll]] of the [[Foreign Policy]] magazine, published by The [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Top 100 Public Intellectuals| url = https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4314#bios |date = May 2008| publisher = Foreign Policy | accessdate=19 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081205141738/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4314| archivedate= 5 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Nandy was born in a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Christians in India|Christian]] family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 25, yet no Christian| url = http://www.heraldofindia.com/article.php?id=332| publisher = [[The Herald of India]]| accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = A short pause| url = http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/jan/12nandy.htm|date = 12 January 1999| publisher = [[Rediff]]| accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Bhagalpur]], Bihar, in 1937. He is the eldest of three sons of Satish Chandra Nandy and Prafulla Nalini Nandy, and brother of [[Pritish Nandy]]. Later, his family moved to [[Calcutta]]. Nandy's mother was a teacher at [[La Martiniere Calcutta|La Martiniere School]], [[Calcutta]] and subsequently became the school's first Indian vice principal. When he was 10, British India was partitioned into two sovereign countries – India and Pakistan. He witnessed the time of conflicts and atrocities that followed.

Nandy quit medical college before joining [[Hislop College]], [[Nagpur]] to study social sciences. Later he took a master's degree in sociology. However, his academic interest tended increasingly towards clinical psychology and he did his PhD in psychology at Dept. of Psychology, [[Gujarat University]], [[Ahmedabad]].

While a professed non-believer, Nandy identifies with the [[Bengali Christian]] community.&lt;ref&gt;"But as a Christian, do you identify with your community? Yes, I do, even though I am not a believer. I have been a nonbeliever from my teens, much to the sorrow of my parents, who were devout Christians. But I am a product of the Bengali Christian family and culture. I identify with it. I don’t disown it, particularly because it is such a small community. I do not belong to the majority community, which is 82% of the country’s population but some of them still feel and behave like a minority. [Laughs]" {{cite web|title = Ashis Nandy on being an Indian Christian, Julio Ribeiro's pain and why he opposes conversion| url = http://scroll.in/article/718353/Ashis-Nandy-on-being-an-Indian-Christian,-Julio-Ribeiro's-pain-and-why-he-opposes-conversion|date = 4 April 2015| publisher = Scroll.in| accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Nandy joined the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] (CSDS), Delhi, as a young faculty member. While working there, he developed his own methodology by integrating [[clinical psychology]] and sociology. Meanwhile, he was invited by a number of universities and research institutions abroad to carry out research and to give them lectures.  He served as the Director of CSDS between 1992 and 1997. He also serves on the Editorial Collective of [[Public Culture]], a reviewed journal published by Duke University Press.

Nandy has coauthored a number of human rights reports and is active in movements for peace, alternative sciences and technologies, and cultural survival. He is a member of the Executive Councils of the [[World Futures Studies Federation]], the [[Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative]], the International Network for Cultural Alternatives to Development, and the [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]]. Nandy has been a Woodrow Wilson Fellow at the [[Wilson Center]], Washington, D.C., a Charles Wallace Fellow at the [[University of Hull]], and a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Humanities, [[University of Edinburgh]]. He held the first UNESCO Chair at the Center for European Studies, [[University of Trier]], in 1994. In 2006 he became the National Fellow of the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]].

Professor Nandy is an intellectual who identifies and explores numerous and diverse problems. He has written extensively in last two decades. His 1983 book, titled ''The Intimate Enemy: Loss and Recovery of Self Under Colonialism'', talked about the psychological problems posed at a personal level by colonialism, for both coloniser and colonised. Nandy argues that the understanding of self is intertwined with those of race, class, and religion under colonialism, and that the Gandhian movement can be understood in part as an attempt to transcend a strong tendency of educated Indians to articulate political striving for independence in European terms. Through his prolific writing and other activities supported by his belief in non-violence, Professor Nandy has offered penetrating analysis from different angles of a wide range of problems such as political disputes and racial conflicts, and has made suggestions about how human beings can exist together, and together globally, irrespective of national boundaries.

==Controversies==
During the [[Jaipur Literature Festival]] held in January 2013, Nandy participated in a panel where he was quoted to have made controversial statements on corruption among "lower" [[caste]]s in India. It was reported that he said,

{{quote|text=It is a fact that most of the corrupt come from OBCs and Scheduled Castes and now increasingly the Scheduled Tribes. I will give an example. One of the states with the least amount of corruption is state of West Bengal when the CPI(M) was there. And I must draw attention to the fact that in the last 100&amp;nbsp;years, nobody from OBC, SC and ST has come anywhere near to power. It is an absolutely clean state.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2008}}


'''Biculturalism''' in [[sociology]] describes the co-existence, to varying degrees, of two originally distinct [[culture]]s.

Official policy recognizing, fostering, or encouraging '''biculturalism''' typically emerges in countries that have emerged from a history of national or ethnic conflict in which neither side has gained complete victory. This condition usually arises from [[Colonialism|colonial settlement]]. Resulting conflicts may take place either between the colonisers and [[indigenous people]]s (as in [[Fiji]]) and/or between rival groups of colonisers (as in, for example, [[South Africa]]). A deliberate policy of biculturalism influences the structures and decisions of governments to ensure that they allocate political and [[economic power]] and influence equitably between people and/or groups identified with each side of the cultural divide. 

Examples include the conflicts between [[Anglophone Canadians|Anglophone]] and [[French Canadian|Francophone Canadians]], between Anglophone White [[South Africa]]ns and [[Boer]]s, and between [[Tangata whenua]] (i.e. [[Māori people|Māori]]) and Tangata tiriti [[New Zealand]]ers—i.e. settlers and their descendants whose right to be in New Zealand derives from the [[Treaty of Waitangi|''Tiriti'' (Treaty) of Waitangi]]. The latter group is sometimes referred to generally as "non-Māori"; their ancestors trace to the Pacific (known as Pasifika); Asia (people from eastern Asia, including from Mongolia, China, Japan, Indo-China and the Philippines are usually referred to as Asians; those from the rest of Asia normally are associated with their country or region of origin within Asia); North and South America; Europe (often called [[Pākehā]]), and Africa. The term biculturalism was originally adopted in Canada, most notably by the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] (1963–1969), which recommended that Canada become [[official bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]].

Because the term biculturalism suggests, more or less explicitly, that only two cultures merit formal recognition, advocates of [[multiculturalism]] (for which biculturalism formed a precedent) may regard bicultural outlooks as inadequately [[progressivism|progressive]] by comparison. This was the case in Canada were [[Ukrainian Canadian]]s activists such as [[Jaroslav Rudnyckyj]] and [[Paul Yuzyk]] and other "third force"{{Explain|date=October 2017}} successfully pressured the Canadian government to adopt multiculturalism as official policy in 1971.

In the context of relations between the cultures of [[deaf]]ness and non-deafness, people find the word "biculturalism" less controversial because the distinction between spoken [[language]] and [[sign language]] commonly seems like a genuine binary distinction—transcending the distinctions between various spoken languages.

In the context of the United States of America, bicultural distinctions have traditionally existed between the US and Mexico, and between the White and the African-American population of the US.

Countries which formally recognize biculturalism include:

* [[Belgium]], divided basically between speakers of French and of Dutch
* [[Vanuatu]], formerly a [[Condominium (international law)|condominion]] with both French and British politico-administrative traditions
* the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], retrospectively termed "The Commonwealth of Both Peoples"
* [[Switzerland]], overwhelmingly German and French in language (though with recognition of Italian and Romansch)
* [[Paraguay]], with a population 90% of which speaks Guaraní and 99% of which speaks Spanish
* [[New Zealand]], where the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] forms the basis of a relationship between [[the Crown]] and [[Māori people|Māori]] [[iwi]] (tribes) through which [[Māori language|te reo Māori]] is recognised as an official language, and Māori have protected representation in [[Parliament]] through the [[Māori electorates]]

Biculturalism can also refer to individuals (see [[bicultural identity]]).

'''Brain fag syndrome''' ('''BFS''') was described by RH Prince in 1960.&lt;ref name=Ola&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ola BA, Morakinyo O, Adewuya AO |title=Brain Fag Syndrome - a myth or a reality |journal=Afr J Psychiatry (Johannesbg) |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=135–43 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19582315 |doi= 10.4314/ajpsy.v12i2.43731|url=https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajpsy/article/view/43731}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first discovered in [[Education in Nigeria|Nigeria]],&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt; describing high school and university students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors= ((Katona CLE)), Robertson MM |year= 2005 |title= Psychiatry at a Glance | location =  Oxford |publisher=  Blackwell Publishing Limited |isbn= 1-4051-2404-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; with symptoms including somatic, sleep-related and cognitive complaints, head and neck pains, difficulty in concentrating and retaining information, and eye pain.&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt; It is caused by excessive external pressure to be successful among the young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byng|first=Patricia R. Casey, Richard|title=Psychiatry in primary care|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521759823|page=386|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Se0_vaxMhEcC&amp;pg=PA386|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
BFS is classified in the fourth revision of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV) as a [[culture-bound syndrome]].&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt;  Individuals with ''symptoms'' of brain fag must be differentiated from those with the ''syndrome'' according to the Brain Fag Syndrome Scale (BFSS);&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt; Ola ''et al'' said it would not be "surpris[ing] if BFS was called an equivalent of either depression or anxiety".&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt;

==Causes==
Morakinyo found in 20 persons with BFS an achievement drive that was [[anxiety]]-related that led to the use of psychostimulants and consequent [[sleep deprivation]] which contributed to cognitive disruption;&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt;  Omoluabi related BFS to test anxiety.&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt;

==Treatment==
[[File:Dont stop tobacco but take Baco=Curo, the only scientific cure for the tobacco habit back.jpg|thumbnail|19th-century American trade card, listing a cure for "brain fag" among other things]]
Anumonye reported treatment success with lorazepam; others found benefit with antidepressants and relaxation exercises.&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
BFS has been reported in other [[Africa]]n cultures,&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt; and also in Brazil, Argentina, and Ethiopian Jews.&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt;   Historic higher reported prevalence among males may be due to more males being present in higher education in African countries.&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt;  Studies since the 1990s have not verified gender differences.&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt;  Other studies found a possible association with low [[socioeconomic status]], an association with average or higher intelligence, and a high association with [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt;  Individuals with BFS have been found to have problems with isolation, poor study habits, and the use of [[psychostimulant]]s as well as physical changes including in muscle tension and heart rate.&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt;

==History==
Prince named the condition based on the term ''brain fag'' used by students who believed their symptoms were attributed to "brain fatigue".&lt;ref name=Ola/&gt; However, this term was used in the United States and Europe dating back to 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Lewis Hind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LnFAAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=brain-fag&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= The Consolations of an Injured Critic|journal=The Art Journal|volume= 72|year=1839|page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5978">'''Bundling''', or '''tarrying''', is the traditional practice of wrapping two people in a bed together, usually as a part of [[courting]] behavior. The tradition is thought to have originated either in the [[Netherlands]] or in the [[British Isles]] and later became common in [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial United States]],&lt;ref&gt;History of Sex, Love and Sexuality 1750 America and Bundling, The People's Almanac [http://www.trivia-library.com/a/history-of-sex-love-sexuality-1750-america-and-bundling.htm 1975 - 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Stiles | first=Henry Reed | year=2005 | title=Bundling: Its Origin, Progress and Decline | edition=reprint | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | isbn=978-1-4179-8628-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Pennsylvania Dutch Country]]. Some [[Nebraska Amish]] may still practice it. When used for courtship, the aim is to allow [[intimacy]] without [[sexual intercourse]].

==Origin==
It is possible the precedent for bundling came from the [[Bible|biblical]] story of Ruth and Boaz, in which Ruth, a young widow, and Boaz, an older wealthy landowner, spend a night together in a grain storage room while not touching; the pair later get married.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Ruth.3:9-14;Ruth.4:13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courtship practice==
Traditionally, participants were adolescents, with a boy staying at the residence of the girl. They were given separate blankets by the girl's parents and expected to talk to one another through the night. Occasionally a ''bundling board'' or bundling sack was placed between the boy and girl to discourage sexual conduct.

== In United States ==
In [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial United States]], [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and other preachers condemned bundling;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marsden|first=George|title=Jonathan Edwards: A Life|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300129946|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeGd_Ry34_MC&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;ots=gv6GO_MWjE&amp;dq=%22jonathan%20edwards%22%20bundling&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jonathan%20edwards%22%20bundling&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet the practice continued into the period of the early Republic, when if beds were scarce, travelers occasionally were permitted to bundle with locals.  This seemingly strange practice allowed extra money to be made by renting out half a bed.  Some hotels rented rooms for the night, shared by many occupants, and sharing a bed entailed an additional fee.

It is possible that, as late as the mid-19th century, bundling was still practiced in [[New York (state)|New York]] state and perhaps in [[New England]], though its popularity was waning.  The court case of ''Graham v. Smith'', 1 Edm.Sel.Cas. 267 (N.Y. 1846), for example, initially argued before Judge Edmunds in the Orange Circuit Court of New York, concerned the [[Seduction (tort)|seduction]] of a 19-year-old woman; testimony in the case established that bundling was a common practice in certain rural social circles at the time. By the 20th century, bundling seems to have disappeared almost everywhere, except for the more conservative   [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] [[Subgroups of Amish|affiliations]], where it is still in use in the 21st century, regardless of location.&lt;ref&gt;Shachtman, pp. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The writer [[Washington Irving]], in chapter 7 of ''[[Knickerbocker's History of New York]]'' as well as other of his works, refers to bundling as a Yankee practice.
&lt;blockquote&gt;This amazing increase may, indeed, be partly ascribed to a singular custom prevalent among them, commonly known by the name of bundling—a superstitious rite observed by the young people of both sexes, with which they usually terminated their festivities, and which was kept up with religious strictness by the more bigoted part of the community.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In the media==

'''Cheli''', according to the [[Real Academia Española|Royal Spanish Academy]], is the jargon with elements of certain traditional working class districts of [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], such as [[Lavapiés]] and [[Atocha (Arganzuela)|Atocha]] in the southern part of the old city (close to [[cockney]] culture of [[London]]'s [[East End of London|East End]]), together with marginal and counter-cultural elements.&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario de la Real Academia de la Lengua, http://www.rae.es/rae.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheli, mainly a juvenile jargon, especially strong in the early 1980s, is linked to the movement called ''[[La Movida Madrileña|movida]]'' in [[Madrid]]. It is still used by some people and despite its limited semantic fields, related to marginality, parties, drugs, nightlife and friendship, several words have been accepted by the [[Real Academia Española|Royal Spanish Academy]], due to its wide expansion.

'''''Ciubotaru v. Moldova''''' (application No. 27138/04) was a case decided by [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2010. Ciubotaru sought to have his ethnicity changed from [[Moldova]]n to [[Romania]]n on his birth and marriage certificates, which Moldova refused. The Court found that Moldova's procedure for changing ethnicity of record violated [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8 (right to private life)]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

==Background==
In 2002, when applying to have his old [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] identity card replaced with a Moldovan one, Mr. Ciubotaru submitted that his ethnicity was Romanian. As he was told that his application would not be accepted unless he indicated Moldovan ethnicity, as in his and his parents' Soviet documents, he complied.

Afterwards he requested the relevant State authority to change his ethnic identity entry from “Moldovan” to “Romanian”. His request was refused with the argument that since his parents had not been recorded as ethnic Romanians in their birth and marriage certificates, it was impossible for him to be recorded as an ethnic Romanian. He was advised to search the archives for traces of Romanian origin of his ancestors. Appeals to domestic courts were refused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867119&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Judgment (Paras. 6-13)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==

The Court found for Ciubotaru. The Court explained that it understood that authorities should be able to refuse a claim to change ethnicity of record when the claim is based purely on unsubstantiated subjective grounds. However, Moldova's legal requirements created insurmountable barriers on an individual wishing to record an ethnicity other than the ethnicity that Soviet authorities defined for the individual's parents. The Court also found that Ciubotaru's claim was based on more than merely subjective grounds, as Ciubotaru could produce objectively verifiable links with [[Romanians|Romanian ethnic groups]]. Evidence such as language, name, and empathy cannot be relied on under Moldovan law in force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867119&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Judgment (Paras. 57-58)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court concluded, that the procedure of changing ethnicity record violated Article 8 (right to private life) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and ordered Moldova to pay the applicant 5,000 [[Euros]].

==Concurrence==

Judge Mijović filed a concurring opinion, pointing that ''I consider self-identification primarily as a matter of personal perception rather than a matter based on objective grounds, and that is why I do not share the Chamber's reasoning in the judgment''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867119&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Judgment (concurring opinion of Judge Mijović)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clip show''' is an episode of a [[Television program|television series]] that consists primarily of excerpts from previous episodes. Most clip shows feature the format of a [[frame story]] in which cast members recall past events from past installments of the show, depicted with a clip of the event presented as a [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]].  Clip shows are also known as '''cheaters''', particularly in the field of animation. Clip shows are often played before [[series finale]]s, or once [[100 episodes|syndication becomes highly likely]]. Other times, however, clip shows are simply produced for budgetary reasons (i.e. to avoid additional costs from shooting in a certain setting, or from casting actors to appear in new material).

==Origin==
Clip shows have their origin in theatrical [[short film]]s and [[Serial (film)|serials]]. Every serial chapter always had a brief recap showing where the previous chapter left off, but, beginning in 1936, entire chapters were largely devoted to material that audiences had already seen. In these '''recap chapters''' (also called "economy chapters"),
previous chapters were summarized for those who may have missed some episodes (which were unlikely to be rerun). The practice began with the [[Republic Pictures]] serial ''[[Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island]]''. Adverse weather conditions slowed the filming of this outdoor adventure budgeted for 12 chapters, and screenwriter Barry Shipman was forced to create two more chapters to recoup the lost production costs. Shipman wrote a few scenes in which the screen characters recount their adventures to date, and [[stock footage]] from previous chapters is shown instead of new sequences. Shipman's brainstorm was a convenient way to economize on production, and soon Republic made the recap chapter standard procedure.

Movie studios often resorted to old footage to save money. The most famous example is the short comedies of [[The Three Stooges]] which, from 1949 until 1957, borrowed lengthy sequences and often entire storylines from old shorts. Only a few new scenes would be filmed as a framework for the old footage. This practice was  adopted because the studios could charge more money for "new" films than for old ones.

Animation studios were also known to periodically make cartoon shorts - often referred to as "cheaters" - made up primarily of clips for earlier cartoons in order to save money. Examples of this include ''[[Betty Boop's Rise to Fame]]'' ([[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer]]/[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], 1934), ''[[What's Cookin' Doc?]]'' (1944, [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Schlesinger]]/[[Warner Bros.]]) and a regular yearly series of ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry]]'' "cheaters" such as ''[[Smitten Kitten]]'' (1952, [[MGM cartoon studio|MGM]]).

==Variations==
One variant of the modern clip show is the '''compilation episode''', using clips from the most popular episodes, assembled together in one episode, sometimes without a frame story as such.

Another format is to have a host who describes various characters and characteristics of the show to introduce various clips from past episodes. For example, a special one-hour clip show episode of ''[[All in the Family]]'' featured actor [[Henry Fonda]] discussing the main characters on the show followed by relevant clips from previous episodes; a similar two-part clip show appeared on ''[[Three's Company]]'', hosted by [[Lucille Ball]]. This format was parodied in a clip show for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ("[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]"), in which fictional actor [[Troy McClure]]&amp;mdash;a recurring ''Simpsons'' character&amp;mdash;introduced the clips.

A third variation, used in a two-part clip show episode of ''[[Cheers]]'' featured the entire cast of the show, including former cast members, sitting on a stage while being interviewed by talk host [[John McLaughlin (host)|John McLaughlin]] about their characters on the show, with clips of previous episodes mixed in. A similar clip episode of ''[[Barney Miller]]'' aired after the death of cast member [[Jack Soo]], with flashbacks introduced by the rest of the cast highlighting Soo's character [[Detective Sergeant]] Nick Yamana.

''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'' had a flashback episode 2 episodes in to the series. The two main leads reminisce on the previous episode and other adventures they went on. The episode was highly praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=98, Clerks: The Animated Series |url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/98.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2017-04-18 |date=2009-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119005244/http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/98.html |archivedate=2009-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' episode "The Ember Island Players", the show's main characters watch a play about themselves based upon the events of the series thus far. Although the episode contains no actual footage from previous episodes, the actors recount many scenes from the series and show all the significant plot events. "The Ember Island Players" was the last episode before the four-part series finale.

The [[NBC]] sitcom [[Community (TV series)|''Community'']] used the clip show format with the episode "[[Paradigms of Human Memory]]", but rather than using clips from previous episodes, the cut-away scenes in that episode were all newly shot. In some cases the clips were set in events of previous episodes, and in other cases the clips showed events that had never before occurred on the show, such as visiting an Old West ghost town, taking over for a glee club killed in a bus crash or going on a fishing trip. The creator of ''Community'', [[Dan Harmon]], used the same format in another one of his shows, ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', where all the clips were completely new and related to the episode, 'Total Rickall', in some way.

In [[anime]], a common type of episode is the '''Recap episode''', which presents clips from previous episodes in a manner to remind viewers of the story so far and help newer viewers catch up on the plot and details.

==Rationale==
While clip shows do reduce production costs, they were originally employed in an era when there were far fewer program outlets and it was less likely that episodes from previous seasons would be aired again. Clip shows typically received strong [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], and it was expected for any successful comedy series to feature clip shows regularly in its later years. However, the episodes were subject to some ridicule due to their forced or "corny" framing devices (such as a family sitting peacefully around a fireplace) and the frequently awkward transitions between the frame story and the clips (such as characters staring into space while the screen blurs to represent "remembering").{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Daytime [[soap operas]] frequently present clip shows as a way to commemorate a show's milestone anniversary or the death of a long-running character. Many fans take advantage of the shows in order to see vintage clips of a particular soap opera. One example was an episode of ''[[As the World Turns]]'' in which seven of the longest running characters were stranded in a forest and remembered some of their best moments, all in honor of ''AtWT''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 50th anniversary.

Another common rationale for a clip show is the lack of a new show to air, due to failure to meet production schedules. For example, the computer-animated series ''[[Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles]]'' used clip shows four times for this purpose, interrupting in-progress story arcs. Similarly, the ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' season 3 episode "The Straight Poop" helped to fill out a production schedule that was rife with delays: in 15 weeks since that season began, only 8 episodes of the "weekly" series had been broadcast. ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'' resorted to producing ''five'' clip shows (using material from only 25 episodes) over the course of its first two seasons.

Other times budgetary considerations force clip shows. At the end of its second season, ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' had one more episode to shoot. However, [[Paramount Television|Paramount]] cut that show's budget to make up for an episode earlier in the season that had gone over budget—and, similarly, over schedule, leaving only three days for [[principal photography]]. Because the season had gotten off to a slow start due to a [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|writers' strike]], the producers had no scripts set aside for future use as they normally would have.&lt;ref name="ST:TNG 365"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Block|first1=Paula M.|last2=Erdmann|first2=Terry J.|last3=Moore|first3=Ronald D.|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation 365|date=2012|publisher=Abrams|isbn=9781613124000|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCbTA9wMmEAC&amp;pg=PT330|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was "[[Shades of Gray (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Shades of Gray]]", in which the "clips" were the induced dreams of a comatose [[William T. Riker]]. The episode is widely considered among the worst of any ''[[Star Trek]]'' series.&lt;ref name="ST:TNG companion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nemecek|first1=Larry|title=The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion: Revised Edition|date=2003|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=9780743476577|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ah1k_EsaOHsC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clip shows today tend to offset such criticism by trying to make the frame tale surrounding the clips compelling, or by presenting clip shows without any framing device. A show might also diffuse the awkwardness by indulging in [[self-parody]], explicitly acknowledging or intentionally over-playing the device. Many series have included parody clip shows using "clips" from episodes which never happened.  The ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[City on the Edge of Forever (South Park)|City on the Edge of Forever]]" shows scenes from previous episodes, but the details are always wrong, and in the end, everyone gets ice cream.  As another example, ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'' ran a clip show as its second episode, even though there was only one prior episode from which to pull material.  The aforementioned ''Moonlighting'' clip episode, in typical fashion for the show, used a framing story that broke the [[fourth wall]] to determine if the characters themselves were the source of the show's notorious production delays, and ended with the characters promising a "new episode next week!".

The clip show has been employed more seriously as a means to bring viewers up to date on highly serialized dramas, such as on ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' and [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|the reimagined ''Battlestar Galactica'']]. Many [[anime]] dramas used similar techniques, particularly when a series ran for more episodes in one season than could be reasonably rerun (such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'' running for 49 episodes, which were originally aired weekly).

Sometimes clip shows air before or during a [[series finale]] as a way for audiences to reminisce about their favorite moments. Some examples of shows that have used clip shows in this sense are: ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Frasier]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''/''[[Stargate Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Cheers]]''.

Clip shows are also a way to compile the best episodes or sketches from a series to air in a single, concise package when rerunning a whole episode or series is implausible. The annual Scottish New Year special ''[[Scotch and Wry]]'' was condensed into four feature film-length episodes for home video release. ''[[Carson's Comedy Classics]]'' compiled memorable sketches from the first 20 seasons of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' for airing in syndication. Surviving content from [[Bozo the Clown]] and other Chicago children's television programs was incorporated into ''[[Bozo, Gar and Ray: WGN TV Classics]]'', an annual holiday special.

In the [[comic book]] fan community, the apparent [[death]] and subsequent return of a long-running [[Character (arts)|character]] is often called a '''comic book death'''. A comic book death is generally not taken seriously by readers and is rarely permanent or meaningful other than for story or thematic purposes.

==Context==
Commenting on the impact and role of comic book character deaths, writer [[Geoff Johns]] said:&lt;ref&gt;IGN Geoff Johns: Inside Blackest Night&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Death in superhero comics is cyclical in its nature, and that's for a lot of reasons, whether they are story reasons, copyright reasons, or fan reasons.}}

The phenomenon of comic book death is particularly common for superhero characters. Writer [[Danny Fingeroth]] suggests that the nature of superheroes requires that they be both [[ageless]] and [[immortality|immortal]].&lt;ref&gt;James R.

A common expression regarding comic book death was once "The only people who stay dead in comics are [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]], [[Jason Todd]], and [[Uncle Ben]],"&lt;ref name="opinionjournal2007"&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110009780 Captain America, RIP], para. 5, ''Wall Street Journal'', March 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the seminal importance of those characters' deaths to the title character:  [[Captain America]]'s [[sidekick]] (retconned dead in 1964), Batman's second [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (dead in 1988), and [[Spider-Man]]'s uncle (dead since 1962), respectively. This long-held tenet was broken in 2005, when Jason Todd returned to life as the [[Red Hood (Jason Todd)|Red Hood]] and Bucky was reported to have survived the accident that seemingly killed him, brought back in 2005 as the [[Winter Soldier (comics)|Winter Soldier]], remaining in the shadows for decades. Barnes apparently died again in 2011 after a short tenure as Captain America,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Fraction, Matt]]|penciller=[[Immonen, Stuart]]|inker=von Grawbadger, Wade|story=Chapter 3: The Hammer That Fell On Yancy Street|title=Fear Itself|issue=3|date=August 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to be revived by [[Nick Fury]]'s Infinity Formula.&lt;ref&gt;''Fear Itself'' #7.1 (2011), Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because death in comics is so often temporary, readers rarely take the death of a character seriously—when a character dies, the reader feels very little sense of loss, and simply left wondering how long it will be before they return to life.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/comic-book-deaths/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbr.com/the-most-memorable-shocking-comic-book-deaths/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/logan-how-handled-death-comic-books-981835&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.se/books?id=raV6qalYZKwC&amp;pg=PA194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
Although several comic book deaths are well-known, two of the best-known are the 1980 "death" of [[Jean Grey]] in Marvel's "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix Saga]]" and that of [[Superman]] in [[DC Comics|DC]]'s highly publicized 1993 "[[The Death of Superman|Death of Superman]]" storyline. There is one major distinction between the two, however—whereas it was never intended that Superman's death be permanent, but rather that he would return to life at the conclusion of the story,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/03/29/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-96/| title = Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed # 96| author = Brian Cronin| date = March 29, 2007| publisher = Comic Book Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean's passing was intended to be permanent, as the editor [[Jim Shooter]] felt that would be the only satisfactory outcome given that she had committed [[mass murder]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Dark Phoenix Tapes", ''Phoenix: The Untold Story'' #1 (April 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ginocchio|first=Mark|title=10 Amazing Storylines Derailed by Editorial Politics|url=http://whatculture.com/comics/10-amazing-comic-storylines-derailed-editorial-politics.php/8|work=What Culture|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the story was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] a few years later to facilitate Jean's return.

In 2007, the death of [[Captain America]] made real-world headlines&lt;ref name="opinionjournal2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsweek.com/comics-captain-america-1941-2007-95787&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=2934283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/08/books/08capt.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/08/usa.arts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18520433&lt;/ref&gt; when he met his apparent end, but Steve Rogers returned in ''[[Captain America: Reborn]]'' in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/06/15/captain.america/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/captain-america-steve-rogers-coming-back-life-years-marvel-comics-killed-article-1.376815&lt;/ref&gt;

==In universe acknowledgement==
Comic book characters themselves have made comments about the frequency of resurrections. [[Professor X]] has commented "in mutant heaven there are no pearly gates, but instead revolving doors."&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' #70 page 17, panel 1&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Siryn]] was made aware of [[Banshee (comics)|her father]]'s death, she refused to [[Mourning|mourn]] him, giddily claiming that since her father has died as an [[X-Men|X-Man]], he was likely going to be soon resurrected, shocking her friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[David, Peter]] (w), [[Olivetti, Ariel]] (a). "Two Meetings, One In Person, One Not", ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (vol 3) #7 (July 2006). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father is later restored to life but is recruited by the [[Apocalypse Twins]] as part of their new [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers'' #9 (June 2013). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The obituary writer of the in-universe newspaper the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' once bemoaned to reporter [[Ben Urich]] about how many retractions he has had to write after each resurrection of a superhero or [[supervillain]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Unlimited'' vol.1 #18. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

}} "The colours represent creative energy, and the layers of the tower imply that a conlang is built piece by piece, never completed. The tower itself also alludes to the Tower of Babel, as it has long been a tradition to demonstrate a constructed language by translating the Babel legend. The Conlang flag was decided on by a vote between many competing designs, and one of my own contributions to the conlanging world is that I was the person who facilitated this election. The winning design was drawn by Christian Thalmann, who introduced the layers. The idea of including the Tower of Babel on the flag had been introduced by Jan van Steenbergen, and the idea of placing the sun on the horizon behind it by Leland Paul. The idea of having the rising sun on the flag had been introduced by David Peterson, who saw it as representing the rise of conlanging from obscurity to popularity and notoriety."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''constructed language''' (sometimes called a '''conlang''') is a [[language]] whose [[phonology]], [[grammar]], and [[vocabulary]] are, instead of having developed [[natural language|naturally]], consciously devised for communication between intelligent beings, most commonly for use by humanoids. Constructed languages may also be referred to as '''artificial''', '''planned''' or '''invented languages'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ishtar for Belgium to Belgrade |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=554&amp;_t=ishtar_for_belgium_to_belgrade |publisher= European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases [[fictional language|fictional languages]].  There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as to ease human [[communication]] (see [[international auxiliary language]] and [[code]]), to give [[fiction]] or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism, for experimentation in the fields of [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], and [[machine learning]], for [[artistic language|artistic creation]], and for [[language game]]s. 

The expression ''planned language'' is sometimes used to indicate international auxiliary languages and other languages designed for actual use in human communication. Some prefer it to the adjective ''artificial'', as this term may be perceived as pejorative. Outside [[Esperanto culture]], the term [[language planning]] means the prescriptions given to a natural language to standardize it; in this regard, even a "natural language" may be artificial in some respects, meaning some of its words have been crafted by conscious decision. [[Linguistic prescription|Prescriptive grammar]]s, which date to ancient times for classical languages such as Latin and Sanskrit, are rule-based codifications of natural languages, such codifications being a middle ground between naïve natural selection and development of language and its explicit construction.  The term ''glossopoeia'' &lt;!--, coined by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], {see talk page; can anyone cite a use by Tolkien? Sarah Higley uses the word but does not attribute its coinage to him.}--&gt; is also used to mean language construction, particularly construction of [[artistic language]]s.&lt;ref name="higley2007"&gt;Sarah L. Higley: ''Hildegard of Bingen's Unknown Language''.  Palgrave Macmillan, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conlang speakers are rare. For example, the Hungarian census of 2001 found 4570 speakers of [[Esperanto]], 10 of [[Romanid]], two each of [[Interlingua]] and [[Ido (language)|Ido]] and one each of [[Idiom Neutral]] and [[Mundolinco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepszamlalas2001.hu/hun/kotetek/18/tables/load2_39_1.html Ethnic affiliation, attachment of cultures, languages and language systems Hungarian statistical office]&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian census of 2010 found 992 speakers of Esperanto, nine of Ido, one of Edo and no speakers of [[Slovio]] or Interlingua.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sezonoj.ru/2011/12/censo/ Russian census (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planned, constructed, artificial==
The terms "planned", "constructed", and "artificial" are used differently in some traditions. For example, few speakers of [[Interlingua]] consider their language artificial, since they assert that it has no invented content: Interlingua's vocabulary is taken from a small set of natural languages, and its grammar is based closely on these source languages, even including some degree of irregularity; its proponents prefer to describe its vocabulary and grammar as standardized rather than artificial or constructed.  Similarly, [[Latino sine flexione]] (LsF) is a simplification of Latin from which the [[inflection]]s have been removed. As with Interlingua, some prefer to describe its development as "planning" rather than "constructing". Some speakers of [[Esperanto]] and [[Esperantido]]s also avoid the term "artificial language" because they deny that there is anything "unnatural" about the use of their language in human communication.

By contrast, some philosophers have argued that all human languages are conventional or artificial. [[François Rabelais]], for instance, stated: "C'est abus de dire que nous avons une langue naturelle; les langues sont par institution arbitraires et conventions des peuples."  (''It's an abuse to say that we have a natural language; languages are arbitrary and conventions of peoples by institution.'')&lt;ref&gt;[[François Rabelais]], Œvres complètes, III, 19 (Paris: Seuil, 1973), cited in Claude Piron, ''Le Defi des Langues'' (L'Harmattan, 1994) {{ISBN|2-7384-2432-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An artificial language can also refer to a language that emerges naturally out of experimental studies within the framework of [[artificial language|artificial language evolution]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Furthermore, fictional and experimental languages can be naturalistic in that they are meant to sound natural and have realistic amounts of irregularity. If a naturalistic conlang is derived ''a posteriori'' from a real-world natural language, a real-world reconstructed [[proto-language]] (such as [[Vulgar Latin]] or [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]) or a fictional proto-language, it should imitate natural processes of [[phonology|phonological]], lexical, and [[grammar|grammatical]] change. In contrast with Interlingua, they are not usually intended for easy learning or communication, and most artlangers do not consider Interlingua to be naturalistic in the sense in which this term is used in artlang criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0908E&amp;L=CONLANG&amp;D=0&amp;T=0&amp;P=5208 "Re: "Naturalistic" for auxlangers vs artlangers?"]  AUXLANG mailing list post by Jörg Rhiemeier, 30 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a naturalistic fictional language tends to be more difficult and complex. While Interlingua has simpler grammar, syntax, and orthography than its source languages (though more complex and irregular than Esperanto or its descendants), naturalistic fictional languages typically mimic behaviors of natural languages like [[irregular verbs]] and nouns and complicated phonological processes.

==Overview==

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}

In terms of purpose, most constructed languages can broadly be divided into:

*''[[Engineered language]]s'' (''engelangs'' {{IPA|/ˈɛnd͡ʒlæŋz/}}), further subdivided into logical languages (''loglangs''), [[philosophical language]]s and [[experimental language]]s; devised for the purpose of experimentation in [[logic]], [[philosophy]], or [[linguistics]];
*''[[International auxiliary language|Auxiliary language]]s'' (''auxlangs'') devised for international communication (also IALs, for International Auxiliary Language);
*''[[Artistic language]]s'' (''artlangs'') devised to create aesthetic pleasure or humorous effect, ''just for fun''; usually secret languages and mystical languages are classified as artlangs.

The boundaries between these categories are by no means clear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Glosso/Glossopoeia.html The "Conlang Triangle"] by Raymond Brown.  Accessed 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  A constructed language could easily fall into more than one of the above categories. A logical language created for [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] reasons would also be classifiable as an artistic language, which might be created by someone with philosophical motives intending for said conlang to be used as an auxiliary language. There are no rules, either inherent in the process of language construction or externally imposed, that would limit a constructed language to fitting only one of the above categories.

A constructed language can have native speakers if young children learn it from parents who speak it fluently. According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there are "200–2000 [[native Esperanto speakers|who speak Esperanto as a first language]]". A member of the [[Klingon Language Institute]], [[d'Armond Speers]], attempted to raise his son as a native (bilingual with English) [[Klingon language|Klingon]] speaker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.08/mustread.html?pg=8 Gavin Edwards: ''Babble On Revisited'', Wired Magazine, Issue 7.08, August 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2018}}

As soon as a constructed language has a community of fluent speakers, especially if it has numerous native speakers, it begins to evolve and hence loses its constructed status. For example, [[Modern Hebrew]] and its pronunciation norms were developed from existing traditions of [[Hebrew]], such as [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] and [[Biblical Hebrew]] following a general [[Sephardic]] pronunciation, rather than engineered from scratch, and has undergone considerable changes since the state of [[Israel]] was founded in 1948 (Hetzron 1990:693). However, linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] argues that Modern Hebrew, which he terms "Israeli", is a Semito-European hybrid based not only on Hebrew but also on [[Yiddish]] and other languages spoken by revivalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns], Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Journal of Language Contact, Varia 2, pp. 40-67 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckermann therefore endorses the translation of the Hebrew Bible into what he calls "Israeli".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1242212397385&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Let my people know!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916161700/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1242212397385&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=2011-09-16 }}, Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Jerusalem Post, May 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Esperanto]] as a living spoken language has evolved significantly from the prescriptive blueprint published in 1887, so that modern editions of the ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', a 1903 collection of early texts in the language, require many footnotes on the syntactic and lexical differences between early and modern Esperanto.&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', ed. L. L. Zamenhof, 1903; 18th edition with footnotes by Gaston Waringhien, UEA 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of constructed languages often have many reasons for using them. The famous but disputed [[linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is sometimes cited; this claims that the language one speaks influences the way one thinks. Thus, a "better" language should allow the speaker to think more clearly or intelligently or to encompass more points of view; this was the intention of [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] in creating [[Láadan]], a feminist language&lt;ref name="foer-2012" /&gt; embodied in her [[feminist science fiction]] series ''[[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|Native Tongue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"My hypothesis was that if I constructed a language designed specifically to provide a more adequate mechanism for expressing women's perceptions, women would (a) embrace it and begin using it, or (b) embrace the idea but not the language, say "Elgin, you've got it all wrong!" and construct some other "women's language" to replace it."  {{cite web|title=Interview With Suzette Haden Elgin |last=Glatzer |first=Jenna |work= |url=http://www.absolutewrite.com/novels/suzette_haden_elgin.htm |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612005757/http://www.absolutewrite.com/novels/suzette_haden_elgin.htm |archivedate=2007-06-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A constructed language could also be used to ''restrict'' thought, as in [[George Orwell]]'s [[Newspeak]], or to ''simplify'' thought, as in [[Toki Pona]]. In contrast, linguists such as [[Steven Pinker]] argue that ideas exist independently of language. For example, in the book ''[[The Language Instinct]]'', Pinker states that children spontaneously re-invent slang and even grammar with each generation. These linguists argue that attempts to control the range of human thought through the reform of language would fail, as concepts like "freedom" will reappear in new words if the old words vanish.

Proponents claim a particular language makes it easier to express and understand concepts in one area, and more difficult in others.  An example can be taken from the way various [[programming language]]s make it easier to write certain kinds of programs and harder to write others.

Another reason cited for using a constructed language is the telescope rule, which claims that it takes less time to first learn a simple constructed language and then a natural language, than to learn only a natural language. Thus, if someone wants to learn English, some suggest learning [[Basic English]] first. Constructed languages like Esperanto and Interlingua are in fact often simpler due to the typical lack of [[regular and irregular verbs|irregular verbs]] and other grammatical quirks. Some studies have found that learning Esperanto helps in learning a non-constructed language later (see [[propaedeutic value of Esperanto]]).

[[Codes for constructed languages]] include the [[ISO 639-2]] "&lt;tt&gt;[[Codes for constructed languages|art]]&lt;/tt&gt;" for conlangs; however, some constructed languages have their own [[ISO 639]] language codes (e.g. "&lt;tt&gt;eo&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;epo&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Esperanto]], "jbo" for [[Lojban]], "&lt;tt&gt;ia&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;ina&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Interlingua]], "&lt;tt&gt;tlh&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Klingon language|Klingon]] and "&lt;tt&gt;io&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;ido&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Ido (language)|Ido]]).

==''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' languages==

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}

An ''a priori'' constructed language is one whose features (including vocabulary, grammar, etc.) are not based on an existing language, and an ''a posteriori'' language is the opposite. This categorization, however, is not absolute, as many constructed languages may be both ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' depending on which linguistic factors of them are observed.

===''A priori'' language===

An ''a priori'' language (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''a priori'', "from the former") is any constructed language of which all or a number of features are not based on existing languages, but rather invented or elaborated as to work in a different way or to allude different purposes. Some ''a priori'' languages are designed to be [[international auxiliary language]]s that remove what could be considered an unfair learning advantage for native speakers of a source language that would otherwise exist for ''a posteriori'' languages. Others, known as [[philosophical language|philosophical]] or [[taxonomic languages]], try to categorize their vocabulary, either to express an underlying philosophy or to make it easier to recognize new vocabulary.

====Experimental====
There have been many languages constructed to test linguistic hypotheses (such as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]) and/or to explore innovative or invented linguistic features. They are therefore necessarily designed with ''a priori'' features. Examples include [[Ithkuil]], [[Kotava]], [[Lojban]] (and its predecessor [[Loglan]], both of which are also schematic), and even the fictional-setting [[Láadan]].

====Artistic====
Most [[artistic language]]s, i.e. those created for amusement or to serve as natural languages of fictional worlds, are largely ''a priori'' in both vocabulary and grammar. Among classical "fictional natural languages" are [[Klingon language|Klingon]] from the science-fiction franchise ''[[Star Trek]]'' and [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|the languages created]] by fantasy writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Other examples include [[Dothraki]] and [[Valyrian]] from ''[[Game of Thrones]]', '[[The 100 (TV series)|Trigedasleng]] from [[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]], [[Atlantean language|Atlantean]] from ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', [[Kēlen]] by Sylvia Sotomayor and [[aUI (language)|aUI]] by W. John Weilgart. [[Láadan]] is both experimental and artistic.

===''A posteriori'' language===
An '''''a posteriori'' language''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''a posteriori'', "from the latter"), according to [[Louis Couturat]], is any constructed language whose elements are borrowed from or based on existing languages. The term can also be extended to [[controlled language|controlled versions]] of existing languages, and is most commonly used to refer to vocabulary despite other features. In distinguishing whether the language is ''a priori'' or ''a posteriori'', the prevalence and distribution of respectable traits is often the key. They may be controlled, naturalistic or schematic.

====Controlled====
A [[controlled language]] is a version of a [[natural language]] with improvements intended to make it easier to learn and to use, such as reduced vocabulary, simplified grammar, etc. These include:
*[[Latino sine flexione]]
*Controlled versions of English:
**[[Basic English]] 
**[[Special English]]
**[[Globish (Gogate)|Globish]]

====Naturalistic====
Naturalistic languages are constructed languages which largely imitate the grammar and vocabulary of a particular group of related languages within a [[language family|family]], thus being potentially [[zonal constructed language|zonal]], i.e. auxiliary between speakers of these languages.
*[[Occidental language|Occidental]] (also called Interlingue)
*[[Interlingua de IALA]]
*[[Interslavic language|Interslavic]]
*[[Folkspraak]]
*[[Lingua Franca Nova]]

===Schematic===
A constructed language is considered schematic when it features a more original grammar, which is usually precise and regular to avoid ambiguities and other obstacles to an easy study, and a vocabulary coming from languages of different families, to make it as recognizable as possible for potential [[international auxiliary language|international auxiliary]] purposes. For that they can be described as half ''a priori'', half ''a posteriori''. There have been many attempts of developing languages with these characteristics, including:
*[[Volapük]]
*[[Esperanto]] and the [[Esperantido]]s:
**[[Ido (language)|Ido]]
**[[Mundolinco]]
*[[Lojban]] (and [[Loglan]])
*[[Glosa]] (and [[Interglossa]])
*[[Lingwa de planeta]]
*[[Sambahsa]]
*[[Toki Pona]]
*[[Sona language (artificial)|Sona]]

==History==

===Ancient linguistic experiments===
Grammatical speculation dates from [[Classical Antiquity]], appearing for instance in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' in Hermogenes's contention that words are not inherently linked to what they refer to; that people apply "a piece of their own voice&amp;nbsp;... to the thing". [[Athenaeus]] of Naucratis, in Book III of [[Deipnosophistae]], tells the story of two figures: Dionysius of Sicily and Alexarchus. Dionysius of Sicily created [[neologism]]s like ''menandros'' "virgin" (from ''menei'' "waiting" and ''andra'' "husband"), ''menekratēs'' "pillar" (from ''menei'' "it remains in one place" and ''kratei'' "it is strong"), and ''ballantion'' "javelin" (from ''balletai enantion'' "thrown against someone"). Incidentally, the more common Greek words for those three are ''parthenos'', ''stulos'', and ''akon''. [[Alexarchus of Macedon]], the brother of King Cassander of Macedon, was the founder of the city of Ouranopolis. Athenaeus recounts a story told by Heracleides of Lembos that Alexarchus "introduced a peculiar vocabulary, referring to a rooster as a "dawn-crier," a barber as a "mortal-shaver," a drachma as "worked silver"...and a herald as an ''aputēs'' [from ''ēputa'' "loud-voiced"]. "He once wrote something...to the public authorities in Casandreia...As for what this letter says, in my opinion not even the [[Apollo|Pythian god]] could make sense of it." While the mechanisms of grammar suggested by classical philosophers were designed to explain existing languages ([[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Sanskrit]]), they were not used to construct new grammars. Roughly contemporary to Plato, in his descriptive grammar of Sanskrit, [[Pāṇini]] constructed a set of rules for explaining language, so that the text of his grammar may be considered a mixture of natural and constructed language.

===Early constructed languages===
[[File:68r.jpg|thumb|Page 68r of the [[Voynich manuscript]]. This three-page foldout from the manuscript includes a chart that appears astronomical.]]

A legend recorded in the seventh-century [[Irish language|Irish]] work [[Auraicept na n-Éces]] claims that [[Fénius Farsaid]] visited [[Shinar]] after the [[confusion of tongues]], and he and his scholars studied the various languages for ten years, taking the best features of each to create ''in Bérla tóbaide'' ("the selected language"), which he named [[Old Irish|''Goídelc'']]—the Irish language. This appears to be the first mention of the concept of a constructed language in literature.

The earliest non-natural languages were considered less "constructed" than "super-natural", mystical, or divinely inspired. The [[Lingua Ignota]], recorded in the 12th century by St. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] is an example, and apparently the first entirely artificial language.&lt;ref name="foer-2012"&gt;Joshua Foer, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/12/24/121224fa_fact_foer "John Quijada and Ithkuil, the Language He Invented"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Dec. 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a form of private mystical [[cant (language)|cant]] (see also [[Enochian|language of angels]]). An important example from Middle-Eastern culture is [[Balaibalan]], invented in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="higley2007"/&gt;  [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] grammatical speculation was directed at recovering the original language spoken by [[Adam and Eve]] in [[Paradise]], lost in the [[confusion of tongues]]. The first [[Christian]] project for an ideal language is outlined in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', where he searches for the ideal [[Italian language|Italian]] vernacular suited for literature. [[Ramon Llull]]'s ''[[Ramon Llull#Ars generalis ultima (Ars Magna)|Ars Magna]]'' was a project of a perfect language with which the infidels could be convinced of the truth of the Christian faith. It was basically an application of [[combinatorics]] on a given set of concepts.{{Vague|date=October 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} During [[the Renaissance]], Lullian and Kabbalistic ideas were drawn upon in a magical context, resulting in [[cryptography|cryptographic]] applications. The [[Voynich manuscript]] may be an example of this.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Perfecting language===
Renaissance interest in [[Ancient Egypt]], notably the discovery of the ''[[Hieroglyphica]]'' of [[Horapollo]], and first encounters with the [[Chinese script]] directed efforts towards a perfect written language. [[Johannes Trithemius]], in ''Steganographia'' and ''Polygraphia'', attempted to show how all languages can be reduced to one. In the 17th century, interest in [[Magical thinking|magical]] languages was continued by the [[Rosicrucians]] and [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] (like [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and his [[Enochian]]). [[Jakob Boehme]] in 1623 spoke of a "natural language" (''Natursprache'') of the senses.

[[Musical language]]s from the Renaissance were tied up with [[mysticism]], magic and [[alchemy]], sometimes also referred to as the [[language of the birds]]. The [[Solresol]] project of 1817 re-invented the concept in a more pragmatic context.

===17th and 18th century: advent of philosophical languages===
The 17th century saw the rise of projects for "philosophical" or "a priori" languages, such as:

*[[Francis Lodwick]]'s ''A Common Writing'' (1647) and ''The Groundwork or Foundation laid (or So Intended) for the Framing of a New Perfect Language and a Universal Common Writing'' (1652)
* Sir [[Thomas Urquhart]]'s ''Ekskybalauron'' (1651) and ''Logopandecteision''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/urquhart/index.html|title=Logopandecteision|work=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1652)
* [[George Dalgarno]]'s ''Ars signorum'', 1661
* [[John Wilkins]]' ''Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language'', 1668

These early taxonomic conlangs produced systems of hierarchical classification that were intended to result in both spoken and written expression.  [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] had a similar purpose for his ''lingua generalis'' of 1678, aiming at a lexicon of characters upon which the user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically, as a side-effect developing [[binary calculus]]. These projects were not only occupied with reducing or modelling grammar, but also with the arrangement of all human knowledge into "characters" or hierarchies, an idea that with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] would ultimately lead to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''.  Many of these 17th−18th centuries conlangs were [[Pasigraphy|pasigraphies]], or purely written languages with no spoken form or a spoken form that would vary greatly according to the native language of the reader.&lt;ref name="einstein1884"&gt;[[Leopold Einstein]], "Al la historio de la Provoj de Lingvoj Tutmondaj de Leibnitz ĝis la Nuna Tempo", 1884.  Reprinted in ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', UEA 1992 [1903].&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz and the encyclopedists realized that it is impossible to organize human knowledge unequivocally in a tree diagram, and consequently to construct an ''a priori'' language based on such a classification of concepts. Under the entry ''Charactère'', [[D'Alembert]] critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century. After the ''Encyclopédie'', projects for ''a priori'' languages moved more and more to the lunatic fringe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Individual authors, typically unaware of the history of the idea, continued to propose taxonomic philosophical languages until the early 20th century (e.g. [[Ro (language)|Ro]]), but most recent [[engineered language]]s have had more modest goals; some are limited to a specific field, like mathematical formalism or calculus (e.g. [[Lincos (artificial language)|Lincos]] and [[programming language]]s), others are designed for eliminating syntactical ambiguity (e.g., [[Loglan]] and [[Lojban]]) or maximizing conciseness (e.g., [[Ithkuil]]&lt;ref name="foer-2012" /&gt;).

===19th and 20th centuries: auxiliary languages===
{{main article|International auxiliary language}}
Already in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' attention began to focus on ''a posteriori'' auxiliary languages. [[Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve]] in the article on ''Langue'' wrote a short proposition of a "laconic" or regularized grammar of [[French (language)|French]]. During the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such International Auxiliary Languages (IALs) were proposed, so that [[Louis Couturat]] and [[Léopold Leau]] in ''Histoire de la langue universelle'' (1903) reviewed 38 projects.

The first of these that made any international impact was [[Volapük]], proposed in 1879 by [[Johann Martin Schleyer]]; within a decade, 283 Volapükist clubs were counted all over the globe. However, disagreements between Schleyer and some prominent users of the language led to schism, and by the mid-1890s it fell into obscurity, making way for [[Esperanto]], proposed in 1887 by [[L. L. Zamenhof|Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof]], and its [[Esperantido|descendants]].  [[Interlingua]], the most recent auxlang to gain a significant number of speakers, emerged in 1951, when the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] published its [[Interlingua–English Dictionary]] and an accompanying [[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|grammar]]. The success of Esperanto did not stop others from trying to construct new auxiliary languages, such as Leslie Jones' [[Eurolengo]], which mixes elements of English and Spanish.

[[Loglan]] (1955) and its descendants constitute a pragmatic return to the aims of the ''a priori'' languages, tempered by the requirement of usability of an auxiliary language. Thus far, these modern ''a priori'' languages have garnered only small groups of speakers.

[[Robot Interaction Language]] (2010) is a spoken language that is optimized for communication between machines and humans. The major goals of ROILA are that it should be easily learnable by the human user, and optimized for efficient recognition by computer [[speech recognition]] algorithms.

===Artlangs===
{{main article|Artistic language}}
Language can be artistic to the extent that artists use language as a source of creativity in art, poetry, calligraphy or as a metaphor to address themes as cultural diversity and the vulnerability of the individual in a globalizing world. 

Some people prefer however to take pleasure in constructing, crafting a language by a conscious decision for reasons of literary enjoyment or aesthetic reasons without any claim of usefulness. Such [[Artistic language|artistic languages]] begin to appear in Early Modern literature (in [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]], and in [[Utopia]]n contexts), but they only seem to gain notability as serious projects beginning in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="higley2007" /&gt;  ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'' (1912) by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] was possibly the first fiction of that century to feature a constructed language. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] developed a family of related fictional languages and discussed artistic languages publicly, giving a lecture entitled "''[[A Secret Vice]]''" in 1931 at a congress. (Orwell's Newspeak is considered a satire of an [[International auxiliary language|IAL]] rather than an artistic language proper.)

By the beginning of the first decade of the 21st century, it had become common for science-fiction and fantasy works set in other worlds to feature constructed languages, or more commonly, an extremely limited but defined vocabulary which ''suggests'' the existence of a complete language, and constructed languages are a regular part of the genre, appearing in ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Lord of the Rings]] ([[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish]])'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Game of Thrones]] ([[Dothraki language]] and [[Valyrian languages]])'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' and the ''[[Myst]]'' series of computer adventure games.

==Modern conlang organizations==
Various paper zines on constructed languages were published from the 1970s through the 1990s, such as ''Glossopoeic Quarterly'', ''Taboo Jadoo'', and ''The Journal of Planned Languages''.&lt;ref name="rosta2007"&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/ge/bhaelvhua/vhurtaethuan.html "How did you find out that there were other conlangers?"] Conlang list posting by And Rosta, 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
The Conlang Mailing List was founded in 1991, and later split off an AUXLANG mailing list dedicated to international auxiliary languages. &lt;!-- to do: find exact date of Conlang/Auxlang split --&gt;  In the early to mid-1990s a few conlang-related zines were published as email or websites, such as ''Vortpunoj''&lt;ref name="vortpunoj"&gt;[http://revo.bierfaristo.com/vortpunoj.html Archives of ''Vortpunoj''] at Steve Brewer's website&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Model Languages''.  The Conlang mailing list has developed a community of [[List of language inventors|conlangers]] with its own customs, such as translation challenges and [[translation relay]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0003/languages.php Audience, Uglossia, and Conlang: Inventing Languages on the Internet] by Sarah L. Higley. M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 3.1 (2000). ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050616085932/http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0003/languages.php |date=June 16, 2005 }}, media-culture.org.au site sometimes has problems.)&lt;/ref&gt; and its own terminology.  Sarah Higley reports from results of her surveys that the demographics of the Conlang list are primarily men from North America and western Europe, with a smaller number from Oceania, Asia, the Middle East, and South America, with an age range from thirteen to over sixty; the number of women participating has increased over time.

More recently founded online communities include the [[Zompist]] Bulletin Board (ZBB; since 2001) and the Conlanger Bulletin Board.  Discussion on these forums includes presentation of members' conlangs and feedback from other members, discussion of natural languages, whether particular conlang features have natural language precedents, and how interesting features of natural languages can be repurposed for conlangs, posting of interesting short texts as translation challenges, and meta-discussion about the philosophy of conlanging, conlangers' purposes, and whether conlanging is an art or a hobby.&lt;ref name="higley2007"/&gt;  Another 2001 survey by Patrick Jarrett showed an average age of 30.65, with the average time since starting to invent languages 11.83 years.&lt;ref name="jarrett2001"&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/bhe/gherque/chivirchein.html "Update mailing list statistics—FINAL"], Conlang list posting by Patrick Jarrett, 13 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent thread on the ZBB showed that many conlangers spend a relatively small amount of time on any one conlang, moving from one project to another; about a third spend years on developing the same language.&lt;ref name="avg_age"&gt;[http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=28831 "Average life of a conlang"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614035040/http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=28831 |date=2011-06-14 }} thread on Zompist Bulletin Board, 15 August 2008; accessed 26 August 2008.&lt;br/&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/wu/seifi/phirqondal.html "Average life of a conlang"] thread on Conlang mailing list, 27 August 2008 (should be archived more persistently than the ZBB thread)&lt;/ref&gt;{{portal|Constructed languages}}

'''Cultural consensus theory''' is an [http://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/sbp09/Presentations/paper%20presentations/William%20BatchelderCCTSBP092009(1).pdf approach to information pooling] (aggregation, data fusion) which supports a framework for the measurement and evaluation of beliefs as [[cultural]]; shared to some extent by a group of individuals.  Cultural consensus models guide the aggregation of responses from individuals to estimate (1) the culturally appropriate answers to a series of related questions (when the answers are unknown) and (2) individual competence (cultural competence) in answering those questions.  The theory is applicable when there is sufficient agreement across people to assume that a single set of answers exists.  The agreement between pairs of individuals is used to estimate individual cultural competence.  Answers are estimated by weighting responses of individuals by their competence and then combining responses.

== Theory ==
Cultural consensus theory assumes that  [[cultural]] beliefs are learned and shared across people and that there is a common understanding of what the world and society are all about.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engaging Society: The Sociologist in a War Zone|last=Carroll|first=John|publisher=Ateneo University Press|year=2006|isbn=9789715505055|location=Manila|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the amount of information in a culture is too large for any one individual to master, individuals know different subsets of the cultural knowledge and vary in their cultural competence.  Cultural beliefs are beliefs held by a majority of culture members.  Given a set of questions, on the same topic, shared cultural beliefs or norms regarding the answers can be estimated by aggregating the responses across a sample of culture members.  When agreement is close to absolute, estimating answers is straightforward.  The problem addressed by cultural consensus theory is how to estimate beliefs when there is some degree of heterogeneity present in responses.  In general, cultural consensus theory provides a framework for determining whether responses are sufficiently homogeneous to estimate a single set of shared answers, and then estimating the answers and individual cultural competence in answering the questions.

Cultural consensus models do not create consensus or explain why consensus exists; they simply facilitate the discovery and description of possible consensus.  A high degree of agreement among raters must be present in responses in order to use consensus theory – only with high agreement does it make sense to aggregate responses to estimate beliefs of the group.  Although there are statistical methods to evaluate whether agreement among raters is greater than chance ([[Binomial test]], [[Friedman test]], or [[Kendall's W|Kendall’s coefficient of concordance]]), these methods do not provide a best estimate of the “true” answers nor do they estimate competence of the raters.  Cultural consensus theory is able to estimate competence from the agreement between subjects and then, answers are estimated by “weighting” individual responses by competence prior to aggregation.

A very important feature in the [[Aggregate data|aggregation of responses]] is that the combined responses of individuals will be more accurate than the responses of each individual included in the aggregation. [[Reliability theory]] in psychology (specifically, the reliability coefficient and the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula]]) provides a mathematical estimate of the accuracy or validity of aggregated responses from the number of units being combined and the level of agreement among the units.  In this case, accuracy of aggregated responses can be calculated from the number of subjects and the average [[Pearson correlation coefficient]] between all pairs of subjects (across questions).

==Usage==
To use cultural consensus theory, at least three assumptions must be met:
# Informants must be asked a series of questions. The questions should all be on the same topic and at the same level of difficulty. This assumption concerns the homogeneity of items&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Culturally-Aware Intelligent Systems and in Cross-Cultural Psychological Studies|last=Faucher|first=Colette|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn=9783319670225|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and means that items should represent only one topic or domain of knowledge and that competency should be consistent across items, so that if someone does well on one subset of questions, they should also do well on another subset of questions. Responses to questions are not corrected, recoded, transformed, or reflected as they are with knowledge tests and attitudinal scales because the purpose is to use the original responses to estimate culturally correct answers.
# Each informant should provide answers independently of all other informants. This means that answers should be provided by individuals and not groups, and without consultation with others. Consensus models are not appropriate for group interviews.
# The cultural consensus model is applicable only if there is a single set of answers to the questions. This means that there must be a high level of consistency (agreement) in responses among informants, which some refer to as common truth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Research methods and Applications in Environmental Studies|last=Matthias|first=Ruth|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781783474639|location=Cheltenham, UK|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aggregation of responses is not a valid estimate unless there is reasonable consistency in the underlying data. An initial step in applying consensus theory is to check whether there is a high degree of agreement among the informants (e.g., to verify that there is only one response pattern present). 

==Models of the theory==
Cultural consensus theory encompasses formal and informal models. Practically speaking, these models are often used to estimate cultural beliefs, including the degree to which individuals report such beliefs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The formal cultural consensus model models the decision-making process for answering questions.&lt;ref name="RWB86"&gt;Romney AK, Weller SC., Batchelder WH.  Culture as consensus: A theory of culture and informant accuracy.  Am Anthro. 1986;88(2):313–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BR88"&gt;Batchelder WH, Romney AK.  Test theory without an answer key. Psychometrika. 1988;53(1):71–92.&lt;/ref&gt;  This version is limited to categorical-type responses:  multiple-choice type questions (including those with dichotomous true/false or yes/no responses) and responses to open-ended questions (with a single word or short phrase response for each question). This version of the model has a series of additional assumptions that must be met, i.e., no response bias.&lt;ref name="RWB86" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weller, SC and Mann NC. Assessing rater performance without a “gold standard” using consensus theory.  Medical Decision Making 1997; 17:71–79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal model has direct parallels in signal detection theory and latent class analysis.  An informal version of the model is available as a set of analytic procedures and obtains similar information with fewer assumptions.&lt;ref name="RBW87"&gt;Romney AK, Batchelder WH, Weller SC.  Recent applications of cultural consensus theory.  Am Behavioral Scientist.  1987; 31:163–177.&lt;/ref&gt;  The informal model parallels a factor analysis on people (without rotation) and thus has similarities to [[Q methodology|Q factor analysis (as in Q Methodology)]].  The informal version of the model can accommodate interval estimates and ranked response data.  Both approaches provide estimates of the culturally correct answers and estimates of individual differences in the accuracy of reported information. 

One specific method of the formal version used in the analysis of data is the mathematical model, which is a set of logical axioms as well as derived propositions and assumptions that explain how empirical variables fit in the model's parameters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The informal model, on the other hand, uses reliability analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Social Sciences: Methods and Research Design|last=Vaccaro|first=Ismael|last2=Smith|first2=Eric Alden|last3=Aswani|first3=Shankar|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521110846|location=Cambridge|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competence==
Cultural competence is estimated from the similarity in responses between pairs of subjects since the agreement between a pair of respondents is a function of their individual competencies.  In the formal model, similarity is the probability that matched responses occur (match method.&lt;ref name="RWB86"/&gt; or the probability of particular response combinations occur (covariance method&lt;ref name="BR88" /&gt;).  Simple match or covariance measures are then corrected for guessing and the proportion of positive responses, respectively.  In the informal model, similarity is calculated with a [[Pearson correlation coefficient]].&lt;ref name="RBW87" /&gt;

A [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of agreement coefficients between all pairs of subjects is then factored with a minimum residual factoring method ([[Factor analysis#Types of factoring|principal axis factoring without rotation]]) to solve for the unknown competence values on the main diagonal.  (For the informal model, the maximum likelihood factor analysis algorithm is preferred, but principal axis factoring can be used as well.)  To determine whether the solution meets cultural consensus criteria, that only a single factor is present, a goodness of fit rule is used.  If the ratio of the first to second [[eigenvalues]] is large with subsequently small values and all first factor loadings are positive, then it is assumed that the data contain only a single factor or a single response pattern.

===Individual competence===
'''Individual competence values are used to weight the responses and estimate the culturally correct answers'''.  In the formal model, a confidence level ([[Bayesian probability|Bayesian adjusted probabilities]]) is obtained for each answer from the pattern of responses and the individual competence scores.  In the informal model, responses are also weighted, using a [[linear model]].  When factoring a [[correlation matrix]], the estimated answers appear as the first set of factor scores.  Also, note that factor scores are usually provided as standardized variables (mean of zero), but may be transformed back to your original data collection units.

==Analysis==
When used as a method for analysis, the cultural consensus theory allows the following: the determination whether the observed variability in knowledge is cultural; the measurement of cultural competence that each individual possesses; and, the determination of culturally correct knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cultural Consensus analyses may be performed with software applications.  The formal consensus model is currently only available in  the software packages [http://www.analytictech.com/anthropac/apacdesc.htm ANTHROPAC] or [http://www.analytictech.com/ucinet/ UCINET].  Analysis procedures for the informal model are available in most statistical packages. The informal model can be run within a factor analysis procedure, requesting the minimum-residual (principal axis factoring) algorithm method that solves for the missing diagonal without rotation. However, when factor analysis is used for consensus applications, ~~the data must be transposed, so that questions are the unit of analysis (the rows in a data matrix) and people are the variables~~ (the columns in the data matrix).

An advantage of cultural consensus is the availability of necessary sample size information and that necessary sample sizes do not need to be very large.  Sample size determination in a consensus analysis is similar to other types of analyses; namely, that when variability is low, power is high and small samples will suffice.  Here, variability is the agreement (competence) among subjects.  For the formal model, sample size can be estimated from the level of agreement (e.g., assuming a low average competence level of .50), the proportion of items to be correctly classified (assuming a high level, .95), and high confidence (.999) a minimum sample size of 29 (per subgroup) is necessary.[1,5]  For higher levels of competence and lower levels of accuracy and confidence, smaller samples sizes are necessary.  Similarly, sample size can be estimated with reliability theory and the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula|Spearman–Brown prophecy formula]] (applied to people instead of items).  For a relatively low level of agreement (an average correlation of .25 between people, comparable to an average competence of .50) and a high degree of desired validity (.95 correlation between the estimated answers and the true answers), a study would require a minimum sample size of 30 subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Weller SC: Cultural consensus theory: Applications and frequently asked questions.  Field Methods 2007; 19(4): 339–368.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, cultural consensus theory offers a framework for estimating cultural beliefs.  A formal model is based on the decision-making process model of how questions are answered (with parameters for competence, response bias and guessing).  The model proceeds from axioms and uses mathematical proofs to arrive at estimates of competence and answers to a series of questions.  The informal model is a set of statistical procedures that provides similar information.  Given a series of related questions, the agreement between people’s reported answers is used to estimate their cultural competence.  Cultural competence is how much an individual knows or shares group beliefs.  Since the extraction of individual competencies depends upon having a single factor solution, the ratio of the first and second eigenvalues (&gt; 3:1) serves as a goodness-of-fit indicator that a single factor is present in the pattern of responses.  Culturally correct answers are estimated by weighting and combining individuals’ responses.

Anne is played by [[Margaret Tyzack]] in the 1969 [[BBC]] television serial ''[[The First Churchills]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_first_churchills_1971/| title=The First Churchills (1971)| publisher=rottentomatoes.com| access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Spriggs]] portrayed her in the 2004 BBC drama documentary ''[[Wren: The Man Who Built Britain]]''. In the 1984 comedy ''[[Yellowbeard]]'' she was played by [[Peter Bull]] (in his last film role) as a fat, senile woman, dominated by Sarah Churchill. 

Anne is a character in the novel ''[[The Man Who Laughs]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]], and was portrayed on screen by [[Anna Kallina]] in the 1921 Austrian silent adaptation ''[[The Grinning Face]]'' and by [[Josephine Crowell]] in the [[The Man Who Laughs (1928 film)|1928 silent adaptation]]. She is also a character in the play ''[[Le Verre d'eau]]'' by [[Eugène Scribe]]; [[Gunnel Lindblom]] portrayed her in the 1960 Swedish TV adaptation ''Ett Glas vatten'', [[Liselotte Pulver]] in the 1960 West German film adaptation ''[[Das Glas Wasser]]'', [[Judit Halász]] in the 1977 Hungarian TV adaptation ''Sakk-matt'', and [[Natalya Belokhvostikova]] in the 1979 Soviet film adaptation ''[[Stakan vody]]'' (Стакан воды).

The titular play ''[[Queen Anne (play)| Queen Anne]]'', written by the playwright [[Helen Edmundson]], dramatizes the relationship between Anne and [[Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough]], as well as the court politics and succession issues of Anne's court. It was first produced by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] at the [[Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon]] between November, 2015 and January, 2016, before opening at the [[Theatre Royal, Haymarket]] in London, where it ran between June and September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org.uk/whats-on/queen-anne/ |title=Queen Anne &amp;#124; Royal Shakespeare Company &amp;#124; Theatre |publisher=Rsc.org.uk |date=2015-05-05 |accessdate=2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rsc.org.uk/queen-anne/about-the-play&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural radicalism''' (Danish: ''Kulturradikalisme'') was a movement in first [[Denmark|Danish]], but later also [[Norway|Norwegian]] culture. It was particular strong in the [[Interwar Period]], but its philosophy has its origin in the 1870s and a great deal of modern social commentary still refer to it.

At the time of the height of the cultural radical movement it was referred to as modern. The words cultural radical and cultural radicalism was first used in an essay by Elias Bredsdorff in the [[broadsheet newspaper]], ''[[Politiken]]'', in 1956. Bredsdorff described cultural radicals as people who are socially responsible with an international outlook.

Cultural radicalism has usually been described as the heritage of [[Georg Brandes]]'s [[Modern Breakthrough]], the foundation and early editorials of the newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'', the foundation of the political party ''[[Radikale Venstre]]'', to the magazine ''Kritisk Revy'' by [[Poul Henningsen|Poul Henningsen (PH)]]. By opponents of cultural radicalism though, it often simply refers to the liberal intellectual elite.

The values most commonly associated with cultural radicalism are among others: [[criticism of religion]], opposition to [[social norms]], criticism of [[Victorian morality|Victorian sexual morality]], [[anti-militarism]] and an openness to new cultural input other than the classic western (e.g. [[jazz]], modern architecture, art, literature and theater).

==Internationally==
''Cultural radicalism'' is also used outside of Denmark. In Scandinavia, it often refers to the Danish movement, but elsewhere, the concept may just share the etymology. In [[Sweden]], cultural radicalism has been seen as opposition to the Swedish church and to the [[Neo-Victorian]] sexual moral. In [[Norway]] the movement has been associated with the magazine [[Mot Dag]] in 1930s and its authors such as [[Sigurd Hoel]] and [[Arnulf Øverland]]. In the US, ''cultural radicalism'' is sometimes used as the opposite of [[cultural conservatism]], especially in the context of [[culture wars]].

[[Togo]]'s culture reflects the influences of its 37 tribal ethnic groups, the largest and most influential of which are the [[Ewe (people)|Ewe]], [[Mina people|Mina]], and [[Kabye people|Kabye]].  French is the official language of Togo, but many native [[African languages]] are spoken there as well. Despite the influence of Western religion, more than half of the people of Togo follow native [[Animism|animistic]] practices and beliefs.

Ewe statuary is characterized by its famous statuettes which illustrate the worship of the twins, the ''ibéji''. Sculptures and hunting trophies were used rather than the more ubiquitous African masks. The wood-carvers of [[Kloto]] are famous for their "chains of marriage": two characters are connected by rings drawn from only one piece of wood.

The dyed fabric batiks of the artisanal center of Kloto represent stylized and colored scenes of ancient everyday life. The loincloths used in the ceremonies of the tisserands of Assahoun are famous. Works of the painter Sokey Edorh are inspired by the immense arid extents, swept by the harmattan, and where the laterite keeps the prints of the men and the animals. The plastics technician [[Paul Ahyi]] is internationally recognized today. He practises the "zota", a kind of pyroengraving, and his monumental achievements decorate [[Lomé]].

[[File:EL open.jpg|thumb|An open volume of ''Encyclopedia Lituanica'' with picture of publisher Juozas Kapočius on the left]]
'''''Encyclopedia Lituanica''''' (likely named after ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' or ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Antanas Klima, ''[http://www.lituanus.org/1979/79_4_01.htm Two Lithuanian Encyclopedias completed]'', Lituanus: Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences '''25'''(4), Winter 1979. ISSN 0024-5089. Accessed August 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; is a six-volume (about 3600-page) [[English language]] [[encyclopedia]] about [[Lithuania]] and Lithuania-related topics. It was published between 1970 and 1978 in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] by [[Lithuanian-American|Lithuanian emigrants]] who had escaped [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Occupation of Baltic states|occupation]] at the end of [[World War II]]. To this day, it remains the only such comprehensive work on Lithuania in the English language.

The encyclopedia was published by the same emigrants who had published ''Lietuvių enciklopedija'', a 35-volume general encyclopedia in the [[Lithuanian language]], in 1953-1966. Later, two volumes of additions and supplements were added and the 37th and last volume was published in 1985. The undertaking was made extremely complicated by the fact that most sources and resources were behind the [[iron curtain]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. Some of the entries in ''Encyclopedia Lituanica'' come from this earlier work, which had about two-fifths of its content devoted to Lithuania-related topics. Thus a majority of entries were first written in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and later translated into English. However, observers note a good quality of translations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Valdis Zeps]], ''Review: Encyclopedia Lituanica'', The Slavic and East European Journal, Vol. 17, No. 1 (Spring, 1973), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; 

The encyclopedia was published by [[Lithuanian Encyclopedia Press]], founded and owned by [[Juozas Kapočius]]. He was awarded the [[Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paulauskas.president.lt/ordinai/table_e.phtml Awarded Persons Database], Orders, Medals and Other Awards, Administration of the Office of the President. Accessed August 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It was edited by [[Simas Sužiedėlis]], and at the end of the last volume it lists 197 contributors; only a handful of them are non-Lithuanians.

An '''epilogue''' or '''epilog''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐπίλογος ''epílogos'', "conclusion" from ἐπί ''epi'', "in addition" and λόγος ''logos'', "word") is a piece of writing at the end of a work of literature, usually used to bring closure to the work.&lt;ref name="EpiDevice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://literarydevices.net/epilogue/ | title=Literary Devices: Definition and Examples of Literary Terms: Epilogue|date=2014| publisher=Literary Devices | work=Literary Devices Website | accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is presented from the perspective of within the story. When the author steps in and speaks indirectly to the reader, that is more properly considered an [[afterword]]. The opposite is a [[prologue]]&amp;mdash;a piece of writing at the ''beginning'' of a work of literature or drama, usually used to open the story and capture interest.&lt;ref name="ProDevice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://literarydevices.net/epilogue/ | title=Literary Devices: Definition and Examples of Literary Terms: Prologue|date=2014| publisher=Literary Devices | work=Literary Devices Website | accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some genres, for example [[television programs]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[video games]], call the epilog an "outro" patterned on the use of "intro" for "introduction".

==In literature==
[[Image:Grandville, Autre Monde, Epilog.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Illustration from ''Un Autre Monde'' epilogue, by [[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville|Grandville]].]]

An epilogue is the final [[chapter (books)|chapter]] at the end of a [[narrative|story]] that often serves to reveal the fates of the [[Character (arts)|character]]s. Some epilogues may feature [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] only tangentially related to the subject of the story. They can be used to hint at a sequel or wrap up all the loose ends. They can occur at a significant period of time after the main [[plot (narrative)|plot]] has ended. In some cases, the epilogue is used to allow the main character a chance to "speak freely".

An epilogue can continue in the same narrative style and perspective as the preceding story, although the form of an epilogue can occasionally be drastically different from the overall story. It can also be used as a [[sequel]].

==In film==
In [[film]]s, the final scenes may feature a montage of images or clips with a short explanation of what happens to the characters. A few examples of such films are ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'', ''[[American Graffiti]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]'', ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', ''[[Remember the Titans]]'', and ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]''.

There are many films which do not only include a few glimpses of the character's future, but also are based on an epilogue. Most epilogues in films are shown in a dramatic fashion, usually in silence, to commemorate an important happening, for example, the fate of a character in the film.

The epilogue of ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'' shows a happy ending, an alternative to the actual ending. 

In many [[documentaries]] and [[biopics]], the epilogue is text-based, explaining what happened to the subjects after the events covered in the film.

==In video gaming==
In [[Video game|video gaming]], epilogues can occur at the end of the story, usually after the [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]] have rolled. An epilogue in a game functions similarly to an epilogue in [[film]] and [[literature]], providing closure to the end of a story.

However, the way in which an epilogue is interacted with in a video game can then determine how a story ends, in works of fiction that contain [[Types of fiction with multiple endings#Video games|multiple endings]]. For example, there are four possible endings to ''[[Spec Ops: The Line]]'', and three of the endings are chosen by what the player does in the epilogue.

In games that feature the [[Permadeath|permanent death]] of [[Player character|playable characters]], an epilogue can chronicle what has happened to the various characters that have survived the events of the game, depicting how their situation has changed after the story has come to a conclusion. For example, the 2015 video game ''[[Until Dawn]]'' features those who survived recounting their experiences to the Police after being rescued. This system can also be expanded on. In most games of the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series, relationships can be built between characters, allowing for unique outcomes to happen for characters depending on the actions of the player throughout the campaign.

A [[visual novel]] can also feature a type of epilogue, which will wrap up all of the scenarios encountered by a player, most often after the game has been fully completed by reaching all of the multiple endings; as is the case with ''[[Tsukihime]]'', featuring an epilogue that expands on the endings of all completable routes, as well as providing context for the rest of the game by explaining events in the prologue.

==In television==
For many years ''[[The Epilogue]]'', a reflective 5-minute [[sermonette]], was the last programme of the day broadcast on a Sunday evening by [[BBC]] radio and later television. The format was picked up by the independent broadcaster [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1956 and was adopted across its various franchises until 1988.

'''Episodic storytelling''' is when a story is narrated through [[episode|episodes]], as opposed to chapters, which are typically seen in novels. The term used in [[literature]] to refer to a body of work composed of episodes or similar installments is [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]]. [[episodic fiction|Serials]] are also known as [[episodic fiction]]. 

Multiple episodes are usually grouped together into a [[Serial (radio and television)|series]] through a unifying [[story arc]]. Episodes may not always contain the same characters, but each episode draws from a broader group of characters, or cast, all of whom exist in the same [[story world]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1919">'''Fasting spittle'''&amp;nbsp;– [[saliva]] produced first thing in the morning, before breakfast&amp;nbsp;– has been used to treat a wide variety of diseases for many hundreds of years. Spittle cures are usually considered to be more effective if [[fasting]] spittle is used.{{sfnp|Roud|2006|loc=wart cures: fasting spittle|ps=none}}

An early recorded use of spittle as a cure comes from the [[Gospel of Mark|Gospel of St Mark]], believed to have been written in about 70&amp;nbsp;AD:
{{bq|text=And they bring unto him [Jesus] one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech&amp;nbsp;... And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. {{bibleverse||Mark|7:32–5}}}}
Writing at about the same time as Mark, the Roman [[natural philosopher]] [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] commented in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' that fasting spittle was efficacious in the treatment of [[ophthalmia]], and that the fasting spittle of a woman was particularly beneficial for treating bloodshot eyes.{{r|OpieTatem}}

In European academic traditions, '''fine art''' is art developed primarily for [[aesthetics]] or beauty, distinguishing it from [[applied art]], which also has to serve some practical function, such as [[pottery]] or most metalwork.

Historically, the five main fine arts were [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[music]], and [[poetry]], with performing arts including [[theatre]] and [[dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35561/35561-h/35561-h.htm#ar209|title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=11|volume=10|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the fine arts commonly include additional forms, such as [[film]], [[photography]], [[video production]]/[[Video editing|editing]], [[design]], [[sequential art]], [[conceptual art]], and [[printmaking]].

One definition of ''fine art'' is "a visual art considered to have been created primarily for [[aesthetic]] and intellectual purposes and judged for its beauty and meaningfulness, specifically, painting, sculpture, drawing, watercolor, graphics, and architecture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fine+art |title=Fine art &amp;#124; Define Fine art at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, there are conceptual differences between the ''fine arts'' and the ''applied arts''. As originally conceived, and as understood for much of the modern era, the perception of aesthetic qualities required a refined judgment usually referred to as having good [[taste (sociology)|taste]], which differentiated fine art from popular art and entertainment.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|title=Aesthetic Judgment|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "fine" does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This definition originally excluded the applied or [[decorative arts]], and the products of what were regarded as [[craft]]s.  In contemporary practice these distinctions and restrictions have become essentially meaningless, as the concept or intention of the artist is given primacy, regardless of the means through which this is expressed.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==History==
{{Main article|Art history}}
{{History of art sidebar}}
According to some writers the concept of a distinct category of fine art is an invention of the [[early modern period]] in the West.  Larry Shiner in his ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' (2003) locates the invention in the 18th century:
"There was a traditional “system of the arts” in the West before the eighteenth century. (Other traditional cultures still have a similar system.) In that system, an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner, a work of art was the useful product of skilled work, and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life. “Art”, in other words, meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word techne, or in English “skill”, a sense that has survived in phrases like “the art of war”, “the art of love”, and “the art of medicine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519|title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's ''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''|journal=Contemporary Aesthetics|author=Clowney, David|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar ideas have been expressed by [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], and [[Terry Eagleton]] (e.g. The Ideology of the Aesthetic), though the point of invention is often placed earlier, in the [[Italian Renaissance]].

==Cultural perspectives==
The separation of arts and crafts that often exists in Europe and the US is not shared by all other cultures. In [[Japanese aesthetics]], the activities of everyday life are depicted by integrating not only art with craft but man-made with nature. Traditional [[Chinese art]] distinguished within [[Chinese painting]] between the mostly landscape [[literati painting]] of [[scholar gentlemen]] and the artisans of the schools of court painting and sculpture. A high status was also given to many things that would be seen as craft objects in the West, in particular ceramics, [[hardstone carving|jade carving]], weaving, and embroidery. [[Latin American art]] was dominated by European colonialism until the 20th-century, when indigenous art began to reassert itself inspired by the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Movement]], which reunited arts with crafts based upon socialist principles. In Africa, [[Yoruba art]] often has a political and spiritual function. As with the art of the Chinese, the art of the Yoruba is also often composed of what would ordinarily be considered in the West to be craft production. Some of its most admired manifestations, such as sculpture and textiles, fall in this category.

==Visual arts==
=== Two-dimensional works ===

====Painting and drawing====
{{Main article|Painting|Drawing}}
Drawing is a form of visual expression  and is one of the major forms of the visual arts. Common instruments include: [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[chalk]], [[pastel]]s, [[marker pen|marker]]s, [[stylus]], or various metals like [[silverpoint]].  There are a number of subcategories of drawing, including [[cartooning]] and creating [[comics]]. There remains debate whether the following is considered a part of “drawing” as “fine art”: "[[doodling]]", drawing in the fog a [[shower]] and leaving an imprint on the [[bathroom]] [[mirror]], or the [[surrealism|surrealist]] method of "[[entopic graphomania]]", in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and the lines are then made between the dots.

==== Mosaics ====
{{Main article|Mosaic}}
[[File:Christ Hagia Sofia.jpg|thumb|upright|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]] from [[Hagia Sophia]]]]
Mosaics are images formed with small pieces of stone or glass, called ''[[tessera]]e''.  They can be decorative or functional.  An artist who designs and makes mosaics is called a mosaic artist or a mosaicist.

==== Printmaking ====
{{Main article|Printmaking}}
[[File:Dürer Melancholia I.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Melencolia I]]'', 1514, [[Dürer]]]]
Printmaking is the process of making artworks by [[printing]], normally on [[paper]]. Except in the case of [[monotyping]], the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print. Each print is considered an original, as opposed to a copy. The reasoning behind this is that the print is not a reproduction of another [[work of art]] in a different medium — for instance, a painting — but rather an image designed from inception as a print. An individual print is also referred to as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, known technically as a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]]. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for [[engraving]] or [[etching]]; stone, used for [[lithography]]; blocks of wood for [[woodcut]]s, linoleum for [[linocut]]s and fabric in the case of [[screen-printing]]. But there are many other kinds, discussed below. Multiple nearly identical prints can be called an [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]. In modern times each print is often signed and numbered forming a "limited edition." Prints may also be published in book form, as [[artist's book]]s. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.

==== Calligraphy ====
{{Main article|Calligraphy}}
[[File:Folio from a Koran (8th-9th century).jpg|thumb|''Folio from a Koran'' (8–9th century), [[Abbasid]] [[Kufic]] Calligraphy]]
Calligraphy is a type of visual art. A contemporary definition of calligraphic practice is "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious and skillful manner".&lt;ref name="Mediavilla"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mediavilla, C.|year=1996|title=Calligraphy|publisher=Scirpus Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern calligraphy ranges from functional hand-lettered inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the abstract expression of the handwritten mark may or may not compromise the legibility of the letters.&lt;ref name="Mediavilla"/&gt; Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may create all of these; characters are historically disciplined yet fluid and spontaneous, improvised at the moment of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2006|title=Kalligrafie: Intensiv Training|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt Mainz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2005|title=Kalligrafie:Erste Hilfe und Schrift-Training mit Muster-Alphabeten|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt Mainz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=*[[Hermann Zapf|Zapf, H.]]|year=2007|title=Alphabet Stories: A Chronicle of Technical Developments|publisher=Cary Graphic Arts Press|location=Rochester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Photography ====
{{Main article|Fine-art photography}}
[[File:Adams The Tetons and the Snake River.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Ansel Adams]], ''The Tetons and the Snake River'', 1942]]
''Fine art photography'' refers to photographs that are created to fulfill the creative vision of the artist. Fine art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism and commercial photography.  Photojournalism visually communicates stories and ideas, mainly in print and digital media. Fine art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist’s vision, but has also been important in advancing certain causes.

=== Three-dimensional works ===
====Architecture====
{{Main article|Architecture}}
[[File:Pantheon Dome.JPG|thumb|[[Pantheon, Rome|The Pantheon]]]]
[[Architecture]] is frequently considered a fine art, especially if its [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] components are spotlighted — in contrast to [[structural engineering|structural-engineering]] or [[construction management|construction-management]] components. Architectural works are perceived as cultural and political [[symbol]]s and works of art. Historical [[civilization]]s often are known primarily through their architectural achievements. Such buildings as the [[pyramids]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[Rome|Roman]] [[Colosseum]] are cultural symbols, and are important links in public consciousness, even when [[scholars]] have discovered much about past civilizations through other means. Cities, regions and cultures continue to identify themselves with, and are known by, their architectural monuments.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Tower Bridge]], the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the [[Colosseum]] are representative of the buildings used on advertising brochures.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pottery====
One field where "fine" remains a valid technical term is [[pottery]], especially in [[archaeology]].  "Fine wares" are high-quality pottery, often painted, moulded or otherwise decorated, and in many periods distinguished from "coarse" wares, which are basic utilitarian pots used by the mass of the population, or in the kitchen rather than for more formal purposes.

====Sculpture====
{{Main article|Sculpture}}
[[File:Ife sculpture Inv.A96-1-4.jpg|thumb|upright|Head [[Ife]] [[Terracotta]], [[Nigeria]], 12th–14th century]]
[[Sculpture]] is [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Visual arts|artwork]] created by shaping hard or [[plastic]] material, commonly [[Stone sculpture|stone]] (either [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[marble]]), [[metal]], or [[wood]]. Some sculptures are created directly by [[Wikt:carving|carving]]; others are assembled, built up and [[Kiln|fired]], [[Welding|welded]], [[Molding (process)|molded]], or [[Casting|cast]]. Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the [[plastic arts]]. The majority of [[public art]] is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a [[garden]] setting may be referred to as a [[sculpture garden]].

====Conceptual art====
{{Main article|Conceptual art}}
[[File:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|left|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]], 1973]]
Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.
The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of ''idea-based art'' that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text. However, through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, its popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], developed as a synonym for all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/conceptual-art''Conceptual art'' Tate online glossary] tate.org.uk. Retrieved August 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
[[File:Pushkin (by Mate).jpg|thumb|[[Vasily Mate]], ''Portrait of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'' (1899)]]
{{Main article|Poetry}}
Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, "making") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as sound symbolism, phonaesthetics and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|year=2013|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[File:Fela Kuti.jpg|left|thumb|[[Fela Kuti]] in 1970]]
{{Main article|Music}}
Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").

==Performing Arts==
===Dance===
{{Main article|Dance}}
''Dance'' is an art form that generally refers to [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the body, usually rhythmic, and to music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance |title=britannica |publisher=britannica |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]], [[social interaction]] or presented in a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or performance setting.
Dance is also used to describe methods of [[nonverbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s ([[bee dance]], [[Fixed action pattern|patterns of behaviour]] such as a mating dance), [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects ''(the leaves danced in the wind)'', and certain musical genres. In sports, gymnastics, [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are ''dance disciplines'' while the ''[[Kata]]s'' of the [[martial arts]] are often compared to dances.

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre}}
[[File:Royal Opera House and ballerina.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Opera House]], London]]
Modern Western [[theatre]] is dominated by [[realism (arts)|realism]], including [[drama]] and [[comedy]].  Another popular Western form is [[musical theatre]].  Classical forms of theatre, including [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]], classic [[English drama]] ([[Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] included), and [[Theatre of France|French theater]] ([[Molière]] included), are still performed today. In addition, performances of classic Eastern forms such as [[Noh]] and [[Kabuki]] can be found in the West, although with less frequency.

===Film===
{{Main article|Film|Art film}}
''Fine arts film'' is a term that encompasses motion pictures and the field of film as a fine [[art]] form. A ''fine arts movie theater'' is a venue, usually a building, for viewing such movies. [[Film]]s are produced by [[Video recording|recording]] images from the world with [[camera]]s, or by creating images using [[animation]] techniques or [[special effect]]s.  Films are [[cultural artifact]]s created by specific [[culture]]s, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important [[art]] form, a source of popular entertainment and a powerful method for [[documentary film|educating]] — or [[propaganda|indoctrinating]] — citizens. The visual elements of cinema give motion pictures a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] that [[translation|translate]] the dialogue.

[[Cinematography]] is the discipline of making [[Stage lighting|lighting]] and [[camera]] choices when recording photographic [[image]]s for the [[film|cinema]]. It is closely related to the art of [[photography|still photography]], though many additional issues arise when both the camera and elements of the scene may be in motion.

[[Independent filmmaking]] often takes place outside of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], or other major [[studio system]]s. An independent film (or ''indie film)'' is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a [[list of Hollywood movie studios|major movie studio]].  Creative, business, and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century.

===United States===
In the [[United States]] an academic course of study in fine art may include the [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Fine Art, or a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]], and/or a [[Master of Fine Arts]] degree — traditionally the [[terminal degree]] in the field. [[Doctor of Fine Arts]] degrees —earned, as opposed to [[honorary degree]]s— have begun to emerge at some US academic institutions, however.

==Theory==

===Background===
According to de Swaan, the global language system has been constantly evolving since the time period of the early 'military-agrarian' regimes.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt; Under these regimes, the rulers imposed their own language and so the first 'central' languages emerged, linking the peripheral languages of the agrarian communities via bilingual speakers to the language of the conquerors. Then was the formation of empires, which resulted in the next stage of integration of the world language system.

Firstly, Latin emerged from Rome. Under the rule of the [[Roman Empire]], under which an extensive group of states were ruled by, the usage of Latin stretched along the Mediterranean coast, the southern half of Europe, and more sparsely to the North and then into the Germanic and Celtic lands. Thus, Latin evolved to become a central language in Europe from 27 BC to 476 AD.

Secondly, there was the widespread usage of the pre-classical version of Han Chinese in contemporary China due to the unification of China in 221 BC by [[Qin Shi Huang]].

Thirdly, [[Sanskrit]] started to become widely spoken in South Asia from the widespread teaching of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] in South Asian countries.

Fourthly, the expansion of the Arabic empire also led to the increased usage of Arabic as a language in the Afro-Eurasian land mass.

Military conquests of preceding centuries generally determine the distribution of languages today.
Supercentral languages spread by land and sea. Land-bound languages spread via marching empires: [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hindi]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. However, when the conquerors were defeated and were forced to move out of the territory, the spread of the languages receded. As a result, some of these languages are currently barely supercentral languages and are instead confined to their remaining state territories, as is evident from German, Russian and Japanese.

On the other hand, sea-bound languages spread by conquests overseas: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Consequently, these languages became widespread in areas settled by European colonisers and relegated the indigenous people and their languages to peripheral positions.

Besides, the [[world-systems theory]] also allowed the global language system to expand further. It focuses on the existence of the core, semi-peripheral and peripheral nations. The [[core countries]] are the most economically powerful and the wealthiest countries. Besides, they also have a strong governmental system in the country, which oversees the bureaucracies in the governmental departments. There is also the prevalent existence of the [[bourgeois]], and core nations have significant influence over the non-core, smaller nations. Historically, the core countries were found in northwestern Europe and include countries such as England, France and the Netherlands. They were the dominant countries that had colonized many other nations from the early 15th century to the early 19th century.

Then is the existence of the [[periphery countries]], the countries with the slowest economic growth. They also have relatively weak governments and a poor social structure and often depend on primary industries as the main source of economic activity for the country.

The extracting and exporting of raw materials from the peripheral nations to core nations is the activity bringing about the most economic benefits to the country. Much of the population that is poor and uneducated, and the countries are also extensively influenced by core nations and the multinational corporations found there. Historically, peripheral nations were found outside Europe, the continent of colonial masters. Many countries in [[Latin America]] were peripheral nations during the period of colonization, and today peripheral countries are in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

Lastly, the presence of the [[semiperiphery countries]], those in between the core and the periphery. They tend to be those which started out as peripheral nations and are currently moving towards industrialization and the development of more diversified labour markets and economies. They can as well come about from declining core countries. They are not dominant players in the international trade market. As compared to the peripheral nations, semi-peripheries are not as susceptible to manipulation by the core countries. However, most of these nations have economic or political relations with the core. Semi-peripheries also tend to exert influence and control over peripheries and can serve to be a buffer between the core and peripheral nations and ease political tensions. Historically, Spain and Portugal were semi-peripheral nations after they fell from their dominant core positions. As they still maintained a certain level of influence and dominance in Latin America over their colonies, they could still maintain their semi-peripheral position.

According to [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], one of the most well-known theorists who developed the world-systems approach, a core nation is dominant over the non-core nations from its economic and trade dominance. The abundance of cheap and unskilled labour in the peripheral nations makes many large [[multinational corporations]] (MNCs), from core countries, often outsource their production to the peripheral countries to cut costs, by employing cheap labour. Hence, the languages from the core countries could penetrate into the peripheries from the setting up of the foreign MNCs in the peripheries. A significant percentage of the population living in the core countries had also migrated to the core countries in search of jobs with higher wages.

The gradual expansion of the population of migrants makes the language used in their home countries be brought into the core countries, thus allowing for further integration and expansion of the world language system. The semi-peripheries also maintain economic and financial trade with the peripheries and core countries. That allows for the penetration of languages used in the semi-peripheries into the core and peripheral nations, with the flow of migrants moving out of the semi-peripheral nations to the core and periphery for trade purposes.

Thus, the global language system examines rivalries and accommodations using a global perspective and establishes that the linguistic dimension of the world system goes hand in hand with the political, economic, cultural and ecological aspects. Specifically, the present global constellation of languages is the product of prior conquest and domination and of ongoing relations of power and exchange.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

===Q-value===
&lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; is the communicative value of a language ''i'', its potential to connect a speaker with other speakers of a constellation or subconstellation, "S".  It is defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;Q_i=p_i \times c_i = \left ( \frac{P_i}{N^S} \right ) \times \left ( \frac{C_i}{M^S} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

The prevalence &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; of language ''i'', means the number of competent speakers in ''i'',  &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;, divided by all the speakers, &lt;math&gt;N^S&lt;/math&gt; of constellation ''S''. Centrality, &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of multilingual speakers &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; who speak language ''i'' divided by all the multilingual speakers in constellation ''S'',  &lt;math&gt;M^S&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the Q-value or communication value is the product of the prevalence &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and the centrality &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; of language ''i''  in constellation ''S''.

Consequently, a peripheral language has a low Q-value and the Q-values increase along the sociology classification of languages, with the Q-value of the hypercentral language being the highest.

De Swaan has been calculating the Q-values of the official [[European Union]](EU) languages since 1957 to explain the acquisition of languages by EU citizens in different phases.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=de Swaan |first=Abram |editor-last=Ammon |editor-first=Ulrich |editorlink1=Ulrich Ammon |editor2-last=Mattheier |editor2-first=Klaus J. |editor3-last=Nelde |editor3-first=Peter H. |title=Sociolinguistica: International Yearbook of European Sociolinguistics, Vol. 21: Linguistic Consequences of the EU-Enlargement |publisher=Tübingen |date=2007 |pages=1–21 |chapter=The language predicament of the EU since the enlargements [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Ao2XIClUKd8C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=The+language+predicament+of+the+EU+since+the+enlargements.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=93hHwBadOP&amp;sig=DewiQDKr-XCxt81IDwkRxLRFa-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=plxAVOfjAc6RuATT1oGQDw&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=de%20swaan&amp;f=false] |isbn=978-3-484-60490-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, when there were only four language constellations, Q-value decreased in the order of French, German, Italian, Dutch. In 1975, the [[European Commission]] enlarged to include Britain, Denmark and Ireland. English had the highest Q-value followed by French and German.
In the following years, the European Commission grew, with the addition of countries like Austria, Finland and Sweden. Q-value of English still remained the highest, but French and German swapped places.

In EU23, which refers to the 23 official languages spoken in the [[European Union]], the Q-values for English, German and French were 0.194, 0.045 and 0.036 respectively.

===Theoretical framework===
De Swaan likens the global language system to contemporary political [[macrosociology]] and states that language constellations are a social phenomenon, which can be understood by using social science theories. In his theory, de Swaan uses the [[#Political Sociology of Language|Political Sociology of Language]] and [[#Political Economy of Language|Political Economy of Language]] to explain the rivalry and accommodation between language groups.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

====Political sociology====
This theoretical perspective centres on the interconnections among the state, nation and citizenship. Accordingly, bilingual elite groups try to take control of the opportunities for mediation between the monolingual group and the state. Subsequently, they use the official language to dominate the sectors of government and administration and the higher levels of employment. It assumes that both the established and outsider groups are able to communicate in a shared vernacular, but the latter groups lack the literacy skills that could allow them to learn the written form of the central or supercentral language, which would, in turn allow, them to move up the social ladder.

====Political economy====
This perspective centres on the inclinations that people have towards learning one language over the other. The presumption is that if given a chance, people will learn the language that gives them more communication advantage. In other words, a higher [[#Q-Value|Q-Value]]. Certain languages such as English or Chinese have high Q-values since they are spoken in many countries across the globe and would thus be more economically useful than to less spoken languages, such as Romanian or Hungarian.

From an economic perspective, languages are ‘hypercollective’ goods since they exhibit properties of [[collective goods]] and produce external network effects. Thus, the more speakers a language has, the higher its communication value for each speaker. The hypercollective nature and [[#Q-Value|Q-Value]] of languages thus help to explain the dilemma that a speaker of a peripheral language faces when deciding whether to learn the central or hypercentral language. The hypercollective nature and Q-value also help to explain the accelerating spread and abandonment of various languages. In that sense, when people feel that a language is gaining new speakers, they would assign a greater Q-value to this language and abandon their own [[firzt language|native]] language in place of a more central language. The hypercollective nature and Q-value also explain, in an economic sense, the ethnic and cultural movements for language conservation.

Specifically, a minimal Q-value of a language is guaranteed when there is a critical mass of speakers committed to protecting it, thus preventing the language from being forsaken.

===Characteristics===
The global language system theorises that language groups are engaged in unequal competition on different levels globally. Using the notions of a periphery, semi-periphery and a core, which are concepts of the [[world system theory]], de Swaan relates them to the four levels present in the hierarchy of the global language system: peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

De Swaan also argues that the greater the range of potential uses and users of a language, the higher the tendency of an individual to move up the hierarchy in the global language system and learn a more "central" language. Thus, de Swaan views the learning of [[second language]]s as proceeding up rather than down the hierarchy, in the sense that they learn a language that is on the next level up. For instance, speakers of Catalan, a peripheral language, have to learn Spanish, a [[#Central languages|central language]] to function in their own society, Spain. Meanwhile, speakers of Persian, a central language, have to learn Arabic, a [[#Supercentral languages|supercentral language]], to function in their region. On the other hand, speakers of a supercentral language have to learn the [[#Hypercentral languages|hypercentral language]] to function globally, as is evident from the huge number of non-native English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Vivian|title=Second language learning and language teaching|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Ma0uAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Second+Language+Learning+and+Language+Teaching+Fourth+Edition&amp;ots=uXerrKESf8&amp;sig=In7biboNQq0s5b_8fPB6y9fF4-s#v=onepage&amp;q=Second%20Language%20Learning%20and%20Language%20Teaching%20Fourth%20Edition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to de Swaan, languages exist in "constellations" and the global language system comprises a sociological classification of [[language]]s based on their social role for their speakers. The world's languages and multilinguals are connected in a strongly ordered, hierarchical pattern. There are thousands of peripheral or minority languages in the world, each of which are connected to one of a hundred central languages. The connections and patterns between each language is what makes up the global language system. The four levels of language are the peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral languages.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

[[File:Hierarchy of the global language system (adapted from de Swaan, 2001).jpg|thumb|This flowchart depicts the hierarchy of the languages in de Swaan's (2001) global language system theory.]]

====Peripheral languages====
At the lowest level, peripheral languages, or [[minority languages]], form the majority of languages spoken in the world; 98% of the world's languages are peripheral languages and spoken by less than 10% of the world’s population. Unlike central languages, these are "languages of conversation and narration rather than reading and writing, of memory and remembrance rather than record".&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt; They are used by native speakers within a particular area and are in danger of becoming extinct with increasing globalisation, which sees more and more speakers of peripheral languages acquiring more central languages in order to communicate with others.

====Central languages====
The next level constitutes about 100 central languages, spoken by 95% of the world's population and generally used in education, media and administration. Typically, they are the 'national' and [[official languages]] of the ruling state. These are the languages of record, and much of what has been said and written in those languages is saved in newspaper reports, minutes and proceedings, stored in archives, included in history books, collections of the 'classics', of folk talks and folk ways, increasingly recorded on electronic media and thus conserved for posterity.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

Many speakers of central languages are [[multilingual]] because they are either native speakers of a peripheral language and have acquired the central language, or they are native speakers of the central language and have learned a supercentral language.

====Supercentral languages====
At the second highest level, 13 supercentral languages are very widely spoken languages that serve as connectors between speakers of central languages: [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hindi]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

These languages often have colonial traces and "were once imposed by a colonial power and after independence continued to be used in politics, administration, law, big business, technology and higher education".&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

====Hypercentral languages====
At the highest level is the language that connects speakers of the supercentral languages. Today, [[English language|English]] is the only example of a hypercentral language as the standard for science, literature, business, and law, as well as being the most widely spoken [[Second language|second language]].

===Pyramid of languages of the world===
[[File:The world language hierarchy (adapted from Graddol, 1997).jpg|thumb|This pyramid illustrates the hierarchy of the world's languages as proposed by Graddol (1997) in his book, 'The future of English? A guide to forecasting the popularity of the English language in the 21st century', published by the British Council.]]

According to [[David Graddol]] (1997), in his book titled ''The Future of English'',  the languages of the world comprise a "hierarchical pyramid", as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maurais |first=Jacques |editor1-last=Maurais |editor1-first=Jacques |editor1link=Jacques Maurais |editor2-last=Morris |editor2-first=Michael A. |title=Languages in a Globalising World|date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=United Kingdom |pages=13–36 |chapter=Chapter 2:Towards a new global linguistic order? [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=NZ5LBcUMr28C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=graddol&amp;f=false] |isbn=0-521-82173-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The big languages''': [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]].
* '''Regional languages''' (languages of the [[United Nations]] are marked with asterisk): [[Arabic]]*, [[Chinese language|Chinese]]*, English*, French*, [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]]*, [[Spanish language|Spanish]]*.
* '''National languages''': around 80 languages serving over 180 nation states.
* '''Official languages within nation states''' (and other "safe" languages): around 600 languages worldwide (e.g. [[Marathi language|Marathi]]). 
* '''Local vernacular languages''': the remainder of the world's 6,000+ languages.

===Translation systems===
The global language system is also seen in the international translation process as explained by Johan Heilbron, a historical sociologist: "translations and the manifold activities these imply are embedded in and dependent on a world system of translation, including both the source and the target cultures".&lt;ref name=Heilbron&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heilbron|first1=Johan|title=Structure and Dynamics of the World System of Translation|url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/40619/12684038723Heilbron.pdf/Heilbron.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchical relationship between global languages is reflected in the global system for translations. The more "central" a language, the greater is its capability to function as a bridge or vehicular language to facilitate communication between peripheral and semi-central languages.&lt;ref name=Heilbron /&gt;

Heilbron's version of the global system of language in translations has four levels:

'''Level 1''': Hypercentral position — 
English currently holds the largest market share of the global market for translations; 55–60% of all book translations are from English. It strongly dominates the hierarchical nature of book translation system.

'''Level 2''': Central position — 
German and French each hold 10% of the global translation market.

'''Level 3''': Semi-central position — 
There are 7 or 8 languages "neither very central on a global level nor very peripheral",&lt;ref name=Heilbron/&gt; making up 1 to 3% of the world market (like Spanish, Italian and Russian).

'''Level 4''': Peripheral position — 
Languages from which "less than 1% of the book translations worldwide are made", including Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Despite having large populations of speakers, "their role in the translation economy is peripheral as compared to more central languages".&lt;ref name=Heilbron/&gt;

==Acceptance==
According to the [[Google Scholar]] website, de Swaan's book, ''Words of the world: The global language system'', has been cited by 546 other papers, as of 16 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Swaan|first1=Abram|title=Words of the world: The global language system|url=https://scholar.google.com.sg/scholar?q=abram+de+swaan+global+language+system&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5|website=Google Scholar|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there have also been several concerns regarding the global language system:

===Importance of Q-value===
Van Parijs (2004)&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2007" /&gt; claimed that 'frequency' or likelihood of contact is adequate as an indicator of language learning and language spread. However, de Swaan (2007) argued that it alone is not sufficient. Rather, the [[#Q-value|Q-value]], which comprises both frequency (better known as prevalence) and 'centrality', helps to explain the spread of (super)central languages, especially former colonial languages in newly independent countries where in which only the elite minority spoke the language initially. Frequency alone would not be able to explain the spread of such languages, but [[#Q-value|Q-value]], which includes centrality, would be able to.

In another paper, Cook and Li (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Vivian |editor-last=Cook |editor-first=Vivian |editor1link= Vivian Cook (academic) |editor2-last=Li |editor2-first=Wei |title=Big Contemporary Applied Linguistics: Language Teaching and Learning, Vol. 1 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=2009 |pages=54–74 |chapter=Chapter 3: Language user groups and language teaching [https://books.google.com.sg/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=_5evAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Contemporary+Applied+Linguistics+cook&amp;ots=glSUNb01Ei&amp;sig=zQc-xnrhpNkI_4iTwlaR51x8L7E#v=onepage&amp;q=swaan&amp;f=false] |isbn=978-0-8264-9680-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the ways to categorise language users into various groups. They suggested two theories: one by Siegel (2006) who used 'sociolinguistic settings', which is based on the notion of dominant language, and another one by de Swaan (2001) that used the concept of hierarchy in the global language system. According to them, de Swaan's hierarchy is more appropriate, as it does not imply dominance in power terms. Rather, de Swaan's applies the concepts of geography and function to group languages and hence language users according to the global language system. De Swaan (2001) views the acquisition of [[second language]]s (L2) as typically going up the hierarchy.

However, Cook and Li argues that this analysis is not adequate in accounting for the many groups of L2 users to whom the two areas of territory and function hardly apply. The two areas of territory and function can be associated respectively with the prevalence and centrality of the [[#Q-value|Q-value]]. This group of L2 users typically doez not acquire an L2 going up the hierarchy, such as users in an intercultural marriage or users who come from a particular cultural or ethnic group and wish to learn its language for identity purposes. Thus, Cook and Li argue that de Swaan's theory, though highly relevant, still has its drawbacks in that the concept behind [[#Q-value|Q-value]] is insufficient in accounting for some L2 users.

===Choice of supercentral languages===
There is disagreement as to which languages should be considered more central. The theory states that a language is central if it connects speakers of "a series of central languages". [[Robert Phillipson]] questioned why [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is included as one of the supercentral languages but [[Bengali language|Bengali]], which has more speakers, is not on the list.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillipson|first1=Robert|title=English in Globalization: Three Approaches|journal=Journal of Language, Identity &amp; Education|date=2004|volume=3|issue=1|pages=73–78|doi=10.1207/s15327701jlie0301_4|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327701jlie0301_4?journalCode=hlie20#.VDN8XfmSzuw|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inadequate evidence for a system===
Michael Morris argued that while it is clear that there is language hierarchy from the "ongoing interstate competition and power politics", there is little evidence provided that shows that the "global language interaction is so intense and systematic that it constitutes a global language system, and that the entire system is held together by one [[global language]], English". He claimed that de Swaan's case studies demonstrated that hierarchy in different regions of the world but did not show the existence of a system within a region or across regions. The global language system is supposed to be part of the international system but is "notoriously vague and lacking in operational importance"  and therefore cannot be shown to exist.  However, Morris believes that this lack of evidence could be from the lack of global language data and not negligence on de Swaan's part. Morris also believes that any theory on a global system, if later proved, would be much more complex than what is proposed by de Swaan. Questions on how the [[#Hypercentral language|hypercentral language]] English holds together the system must also be answered by such a global language system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Michael|title=Words of the World: The Global Language System by Abram De Swaan|journal=Language in Society|date=Sep 2004|volume=33|issue=4|pages=620–624|jstor=4169377|doi=10.1017/S0047404504334068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory built on inadequate foundations===
Robert Phillipson states that the theory is based on selective theoretical foundations. He claimed that there is a lack of consideration about the effects of [[globalization]], which is especially important when the theory is about a global system: "De Swaan nods occasionally in the direction of linguistic and cultural capital, but does not link this to class or linguistically defined social stratification ([[linguistic discrimination|linguicism]]) or linguistic inequality"  and that "key concepts in the [[sociolinguistics|sociology of language]], language maintenance and [[language shift|shift]], and language spread are scarcely mentioned".&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;

On the other hand, de Swaan's work in the field of sociolinguistics has been noted by other scholars to be focused on "issues of economic and political sociology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tonkin|first1=Humphrey|title=Abram de Swaan. Words of the World: The Global Language System|journal=Language Problems &amp; Language Planning|date=2005|volume=29|issue=2|pages=201–203|doi=10.1075/lplp.29.2.12ton}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "politic and economic patterns",&lt;ref name="LINGUIST List 13.3274"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Augustyn|first1=Prisca|title=Review: Sociolinguistics: De Swaan(2001)|url=http://linguistlist.org/issues/13/13-3274.html|website=http://linguistlist.org/|accessdate=21 October 2014|ref=LINGUIST List 13.3274}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may explain why he makes only 'cautious references to socio-linguistic parameters".&lt;ref name="LINGUIST List 13.3274" /&gt;

'''GuestToGuest''' is the largest [[home exchange]] network. It has 270,000 [[residence]]s listed in 187 countries. It is an example of the [[barter economy]]; there is generally no [[money]] exchanged between the host and the guest.

==How it works==
Registration is free. The company earns a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] of 3.5% of any [[security deposit]] posted. Members earn points for allowing people to stay at their home. These points can be used to stay at other homes. Exchanges can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/peer-to-peer-travel-websites/index.html | title=10 websites changing the way we travel | work=[[CNN]] | first=Mark | last=Johanson | date=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2011, Emmanuel Arnaud and 22 families experienced in [[home exchange]] established the company.

In 2013, Charles-Edouard Girard joined the company as chairman.

In November 2013, the company acquired Itamos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sharetraveler.com/guest-to-guest-interview/ | title=Interview with Guest to Guest Founder: Home Exchange with Guest Points | work=ShareTraveler | date=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the company raised €1 million from the Alyan Group investment fund, Aigis, and from [[angel investor]]s.&lt;ref name=alyan&gt;{{cite web | url=https://columbia.cbinsights.com/investor/alyan-group | title=CBS Insights: Alyan Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the company raised €4 million from Mutuelle d'assurance des instituteurs de France (MAIF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.tnooz.com/article/GuestToGuest-funding-MAIF/ | title=GuestToGuest nabs cash from peer-to-peer insurance specialist | work=Tnooz | date=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, the company raised nearly €1 million from existing investors.&lt;ref name=alyan/&gt;

In June 2016, the company acquired Trampolinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/d75d7bbaf34385d96c3b287b73b5047d | title=Trampolinn acquired by GuestToGuest | publisher=[[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, the company acquired HomeExchange.com, founded in 1992 by Ed Kushins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/GuesttoGuest-Expands-World-s-Largest-Home-Exchange-Community-and-Bolsters-U-S-Market-with-Purchase-of-HomeExchange-1001810611 | title=GuesttoGuest Expands World's Largest Home Exchange Community and Bolsters U.S. Market with Purchase of HomeExchange | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human uses of animals''' include both practical uses, such as the production of food and clothing, and symbolic uses, such as in art, literature, mythology, and religion. [[Animal|Animals]] used in these ways include [[fish in culture|fish]], [[crustaceans in culture|crustaceans]], [[insects in culture|insects]], [[molluscs in culture|molluscs]], [[mammals in culture|mammals]] and [[birds in culture|birds]],&lt;ref name="Fudge2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Humanimalia/&gt;&lt;ref name="Churchman1987"/&gt; as do other [[living things in culture|living things]]. 

Economically, animals provide much of the [[meat]] eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of mechanised transport, terrestrial mammals provided a large part of the power used for work and transport. Animals serve as [[model organism|models]] in [[biological research]], such as in [[genetics]], and in [[drug testing]].

Many species are kept as [[pet]]s, the most popular being [[mammals]], especially [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s. These are often [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]].

Animals such as [[horse]]s and [[deer]] are among the earliest subjects of [[art]], being found in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s such as at [[Lascaux]]. Major artists such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[George Stubbs]] and [[Edwin Landseer]] are known for their [[animal painter|portraits of animals]]. Animals further play a wide variety of roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion.

==Context==

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Anthropology]] has traditionally studied the roles of animals in human culture in two opposed ways: as physical resources that humans used; and as symbols or concepts through [[totemism]] and [[animism]]. More recently, anthropologists have also seen animals as participants in human social interactions.&lt;ref name="WhiteCandeaLazarRobbins2018"&gt;{{cite journal | last=White | first=Thomas | last2=Candea | first2=Matei | last3=Lazar | first3=Sian | last4=Robbins | first4=Joel | last5=Sanchez | first5=Andrew | last6=Stasch | first6=Rupert | editor-last=Stein | editor-first=Felix | editor-last2=Candea | editor-first2=Matei | editor-last3=Diemberger | editor-first3=Hildegard | title=Animals | journal=Cambridge Encyclopedia of Anthropology | date=2018-05-23 | doi=10.29164/18animals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical uses==

===As food===
{{main article|Animal husbandry|Fishing}}
[[File:Trawler filled with sardines ..JPG|thumb|left|Traditional [[fishing trawler]] filled with [[sardine]]s, India]]

The human population exploits a large number of animal species for food, both of [[domestication of animals|domesticated]] [[livestock]] species in [[animal husbandry]] and, mainly at sea, by hunting wild species.&lt;ref name=FAOFish&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/ |title=Fisheries and Aquaculture |publisher=FAO |accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

Marine fish of many species, such as [[herring]], [[cod]], [[tuna]], [[mackerel]] and [[anchovy]], are caught commercially, forming an important part of the diet, including [[protein]] and [[fatty acid]]s, of much of the world's population. A smaller number of species are [[fish farming|farmed commercially]], including [[salmon]] and [[carp]].&lt;ref name=FAOFish/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helfman|first1=Gene S.|title=Fish Conservation: A Guide to Understanding and Restoring Global Aquatic Biodiversity and Fishery Resources|date=2007|publisher=Island Press|isbn=978-1-59726-760-1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Review of Fisheries and Aquaculture |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i2727e/i2727e01.pdf|website=fao.org|publisher=FAO|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invertebrates including [[cephalopod]]s like [[squid]] and [[octopus]]; [[crustacea]]ns such as [[prawn]]s, [[crab]]s, and [[lobster]]s; and [[bivalve]] or [[gastropod]] molluscs such as clams, [[oyster]]s, [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockle]]s, and [[whelk]]s are all hunted or farmed for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Shellfish climbs up the popularity ladder | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-85675992.html | publisher=HighBeam Research | accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammals form a large part of the [[livestock]] raised for meat across the world. They include (2011) around 1.4 billion [[cattle]], 1.2 billion [[sheep]], 1 billion [[domestic pig]]s,&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{cite web|title=Graphic detail Charts, maps and infographics.

===For clothing and textiles===
[[File:BladeShearing.jpg|thumb|left|A [[sheep]] being [[shearing|shorn]] of its [[Wool|fleece]] with traditional blade shears]]

[[Textiles]] from the most utilitarian to the most luxurious are made from animal fibres such as [[wool]], [[camel]] hair, [[Angora wool|angora]], [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]], and [[mohair]]. [[Hunter-gatherers]] have used animal [[sinew]]s as lashings and bindings. [[Leather]] from cattle, pigs and other species is widely used to make shoes, handbags, belts and many other items.

[[Working animal|Working domestic animals]] including cattle, horses, yaks, camels, and elephants have been used for work and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery. In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas.

[[Vaccine]]s have been made using animals since their discovery by [[Edward Jenner]] in the 18th century. He noted that inoculation with live [[cowpox]] afforded protection against the more dangerous [[smallpox]]. In the 19th century, [[Louis Pasteur]] developed an attenuated (weakened) vaccine for [[rabies]]. In the 20th century, vaccines for the viral diseases [[mumps]] and [[polio]] were developed using animal cells grown [[in vitro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaccines and animal cell technology|url=http://www.actip.org/library/vaccines-and-animal-cell-technology/|publisher=Animal Cell Technology Industrial Platform|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasing variety of drugs are based on [[toxin]]s and other molecules of animal origin. The cancer drug [[Yondelis]] was isolated from the [[tunicate]] ''[[Ecteinascidia turbinata]]''. One of dozens of toxins made by the deadly cone snail ''[[Conus geographus]]'' is used as [[Prialt]] in pain relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicines by Design|url=https://publications.nigms.nih.gov/medbydesign/chapter3.html|publisher=National Institute of Health|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6334">'''Humanities in the United States''' refers to the study of [[humanities]] disciplines, such as literature, history, language, performing and visual arts or philosophy, in the [[United States|United States of America]].

Many American colleges and universities seek to provide a broad "[[liberal arts education]]", in which all [[college]] students to study the humanities in addition to their specific area of study. Prominent proponents of liberal arts in the United States have included [[Mortimer J. Adler]]&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J.; "A Guidebook to Learning: For the Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E.D. Hirsch]].  A liberal arts focus is often coupled with curricular requirements; colleges including [[Saint Anselm College]] and [[Providence College]] have mandatory two-year [[core curricula]] in the humanities for their students.

The 1980 United States Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities described the humanities in its report, ''The Humanities in American Life'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Through the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world in which irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conceptual validity==
The very concept of the ‘humanities’ as a  class or kind, distinct from the ’sciences’, has come under repeated attack in the twentieth century. [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|T.S. Kuhn]]’s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn, Thomas]], ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', The [[University of Chicago Press]], 1962&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the forces driving scientific progress often have less to do with objective inference from unbiased observation than with much more value-laden sociological and cultural factors. More recently, [[Richard Rorty]] has argued that the distinction between the sciences and the humanities is harmful to both pursuits, placing the former on an undeserved pedestal and condemning the latter to irrationality. Rorty’s position requires a wholesale rejection of such traditional philosophical distinctions as those between appearance and reality, subjective and objective, replacing them with what he endorses as a new ‘fuzziness’. This leads to a kind of pragmatism where "the oppositions between the humanities, the arts, and the sciences, might gradually fade away... In this situation, ‘the humanities’ would no longer think of themselves as such...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty|Rorty, Richard]], ''Science as Solidarity'', in ''Objectivity, Relativism and Truth: Philosophical Papers Volume I'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernism and postmodernism==
In the United States, the late 20th century saw a challenge to the "elitism" of the humanities, which [[Edward Said]] has characterized as a "conservative philosophy of gentlemanly refinement, or sensibility." Such [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] argued that the humanities should go beyond the study of "[[dead white males]]" to include work by women and people of color, and without religious bias. The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] has been a very influential part of this movement, stating in ''The Order of Things'' that "we can study only individuals, not human nature."  However some in the humanities believed that such changes could be detrimental; the result is said to be what [[E. D. Hirsch Jr.]] refers to as declining [[cultural literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kernan, Alvin, editor; ''What's Happened to the Humanities?'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, New Jersey, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==National institutions==
President [[Lyndon Johnson]] signed the [[National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/overview.html www.neh.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; creating the National Council on the Humanities, and funded the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) in 1969. NEH is an independent grant-making agency of the United States government dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities (see [[Public humanities]]).

NEH facilitated the creation of State Humanities Councils&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/statecouncils.html www.neh.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 56 [[U.S. state]]s and [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Each council operates independently, defining the "humanities" in relationship to the disciplines, subjects, and values valued in the regions they serve. Councils give grant funds to individuals, scholars, and nonprofit organizations dedicated to the humanities in their region. Councils also offer diverse programs and services that respond to the needs of their communities and according to their own definitions of the humanities.

==Career prospects==
Criticism of the traditional humanities/liberal arts degree program has been leveled by critics who see them as both expensive and relatively "useless" in the modern American job market, where several years of specialized study is required in most job fields. According to a 2018 report by the [[Humanities Indicators]], unemployment rates for humanities majors were slightly higher and their earnings were slightly lower than the averages for college degree recipients with similar degree levels (though both were still substantially better than for those without a college degree). Their overall levels of satisfaction with their jobs and their lives, however, were essentially the same as graduates from other fields, with more than 85% of humanities graduates reporting they were satisfied with their jobs. As of 2015, approximately five million people employed in management and professional jobs had bachelor’s degrees in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of the Humanities 2018: Graduates in the Workforce &amp; Beyond|last=|first=|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|year=2018|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=5-6, 12, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10098">[[File:Ukposter.jpg|thumb|Poster in the Ukrainian language about the beginning of the indigenization policy ([[Korenizatsiya]] in Russian, meaning "indigenization", literally "putting down roots") in [[Soviet Ukraine]] (see: ''[[Ukrainization]]''). The text translates to: "Son! Enroll in the school of [[Red Army]] commanders, and the defense of Soviet Ukraine will be ensured." First published in the USSR in 1921.]]
'''Indigenization''' is the act of making something more native; transformation of some service, idea, etc. to suit a local culture, especially through the use of more indigenous people in [[Public administration|administration]], employment, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The term is primarily used by [[anthropologist]]s to describe what happens when locals take something from the outside and make it their own (e.g. [[Africanization]], [[Americanization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indigenize|title=Definition of INDIGENIZE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In world politics, indigenization is the process in which non-Western cultures redefine their native land for better use in agriculture and [[mass marketing]]. Due to [[imperialism]] and the [[Motivation|impetus]] to [[Modernization theory|modernize]], many countries and cultures invoked Western values and ideals of [[liberalism]], [[democracy]] and [[independence]] in the past. But now, along with experiencing their own share of cultural confidence, they desire to revert to their traditional cultures and values.

However, the word indigenization is also used in almost the opposite sense, it means: to increase local participation in or ownership of, to indigenize foreign-owned companies, or to adapt (beliefs, customs, etc.) to local ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/indigenize|title=the definition of indigenize|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== History of the word ===
The word indigenization first appeared in a paper about studies conducted in India about [[Christian mission]]aries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/94473?redirectedFrom=indigenization+#eid|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|website=www.oed.com|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was used to describe the process of making Churches indigenous in [[South India|southern India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=J. F|year=1951|title=The Indian Research Series|url=http://www.internationalbulletin.org/issues/1951-00/1951-02-001-butler.pdf|journal=The Occasional Bulletin|volume=11|issue=2|pages=1–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, it spread to [[The Economist]] where it was used to describe managerial positions and to a book by John Spencer, named ''English Language in West Africa,'' where it was used to describe the adoption of English. Indigenization is often used to describe the adoption of [[colonialism|colonial]] culture in [[Africa]] because of the effects of colonialism by Europe in the 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== History of the use ===
Throughout history, the process of making something indigenous has taken different forms. Other words that describe similar processes of making something local are [[Africanization]], [[wikt:localization|Localization]], [[Glocalization]], and [[Americanization]]. However, these terms describe a specific case of the process of making something indigenous. These terms may be rejected in favor of the more general term of indigenization because the others may have too narrow of a scope. For example, [[Christianization]] was a form of indigenization by converting areas and groups to follow [[Christianity]].

== Types ==

=== Linguistics ===
In this context, indigenization is used to refer to how a language is adopted in a certain area such as [[African French|French in Africa]]. The term is used to describe the process of conveying a certain region’s culture and concepts in terms of the language that is being introduced.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A common case where a language needed to be indigenized was in Africa where the ex-colonizer's language required some references to [[Religion in Africa|African religion]] and [[Culture of Africa|culture]], even though in the original language there was no vocabulary for this. As this process is being carried out, there is usually a [[metalanguage]] created that is some combination of the original language and the introduced language. This language shares cultural aspects from both cultures, making it distinct and usually done in order to understand the foreign language in the context of the local region. Sometimes the term indigenization is preferred over other terms such as [[Africanization]] because it carries no negative connotations and does not imply any underlying meaning.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The African Palimpsest : Indigenization of Language in the West African Europhone Novel|last=Zabus|first=Chantal|publisher=Rodopi|year=1991|isbn=9051831978|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economy ===
Indigenization is seen as the process of changing someone to a person of more corroboration towards their surroundings. A large part of that process is the economy of said surroundings. Indigenization has played an important part in the economic roles of society.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Thanks to The [[Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act|Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act]], black people were offered a more distinguished position in the economy, with foreigners having to give up 51% of their business to black people.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/africa/zimbabwe-acts-against-foreign-business-owners|title=Zimbabwe acts against foreign business owners {{!}} The National|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Open Door Policy|China’s Open Door Policy]] is seen as a big step of indigenization for their economy, as it is opening its doors to the western world. This allowed different cultures to experience one another and opened up China’s businesses to the western world as well, which set [[China]] forth in a sort of [[Microeconomic reform|economic reform]].&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheung|first=Kwok|year=2006|title=The Politics of Indigenization: A Case Study of Development of Social Work in China|url=http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3161&amp;context=jssw|journal=The Journal of Sociology &amp; Social Welfare|volume=33|issue=2|pages=63–84|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social work ===
Another big part of indigenization is [[social work]], although it is unknown what the actual process is when social forces come into place.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Indigenization is seen by some as less of a process of naturalization and more of a process of culturally relevant social work. While indigenization wasn’t the standard, it was a way to not only accustom others to a surrounding point of view, but also helping understand both where these people came from and also their heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Law|first=Kim-yee|year=2014|title=Importing Western Values Versus Indigenization: Social work practice with Ethnic Minorities in Hong Kong|url=|journal=International Social Work|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1177/0020872813500804|via=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argue that while the indigenization of social work may work when it comes to foreigners being brought into Western cultures, it would not work as well non-Western cultures were those that were being taken in. They also argue that Western cultures seem to exaggerate the similarities and differences between Western and foreign cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenization Measures and Multinational Corporations in Africa|last=Ijalaye|first=David|publisher=Oceana Publications|year=1978|isbn=9024727332|location=New York|pages=41|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act ===
The [[Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act|Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act]] was passed by [[Parliament of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe Parliament]] in 2008. It is a set of regulations meant to regulate businesses, compelling foreign-owned firms to sell 51-percent of their business to blacks over the following years. Five-year jail terms are assigned to foreigners who do not submit an indigenisation plan or use locals as fronts for their businesses.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The intent of the law is to ensure the country’s black members fulfill a more prominent role in the economy. Controversy rose over this intent, with opponents stating that the law will scare away foreign investors. Indigenous [[Demographics of Zimbabwe|Zimbabweans]] are defined as "any person who, before the 18th April, 1980 [when [[Zimbabwe]] gained independence from [[British Empire|Britain]]], was disadvantaged by unfair discrimination on the grounds of his or her race, and any descendant of such person, and includes any company, association, syndicate or partnership of which indigenous Zimbabweans form the majority of the members or hold the controlling interest".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

This provision allows the minister of youth development, indigenization and economic empowerment, [[Saviour Kasukuwere]], to keep a database of indigenous businesses from which foreign interest can pick partners from. At the time of the law passing, the ruling party in Zimbabwe was [[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front|Zanu-PF]], lead by the president [[Robert Mugabe]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Saviour Kasukuwere is a member of this party, which brought up skepticism among economists who speculated that the database may be used by the party to give its allies the best deals. Mr. Kasukuwere stated that he will implement the law regardless of objections.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14329">{{hatnote|This article concerns the discipline of intellectual history, and not its object, the whole span of human thought. For clarifications about the [[Global intellectual history|latter topic]], please consult the writings of the [[Intellectual history#Prominent individuals|intellectual historians listed here]] and entries on individual thinkers.}}

'''Intellectual history''' refers to the [[historiography]] of ideas and thinkers.  This [[history]] cannot be considered without the knowledge of the humans who created, discussed, wrote about, and in other ways were concerned with ideas. Intellectual history as practiced by [[historian]]s is parallel to the [[history of philosophy]] as done by philosophers, and is more akin to the [[history of ideas]]. Its central premise is that ideas do not develop in isolation from the people who create and use them, and that one must study ideas not as abstract propositions but in terms of the culture, lives, and historical contexts that produced them.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, "The history of ideas: Precept and practice, 1950-2000 and beyond." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 67#1 (2006): 1-32. [http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history aims to understand ideas from the past by understanding them in context. The term "context" in the preceding sentence is ambiguous: it can be political, cultural, intellectual, and social. One can read a text both in terms of a chronological context (for example, as a contribution to a discipline or tradition as it extended over time) or in terms of a contemporary intellectual moment (for example, as participating in a debate particular to a certain time and place). Both of these acts of contextualization are typical of what intellectual historians do, nor are they exclusive. Generally speaking, intellectual historians seek to place concepts and texts from the past in multiple contexts.

It is important to realize that intellectual history is not just the history of intellectuals. It studies ideas as they are expressed in texts, and as such is different from other forms of [[cultural history]] which deal also with visual and other non-verbal forms of evidence. Any written trace from the past can be the object of intellectual history. The concept of the "[[intellectual]]" is relatively recent, and suggests someone professionally concerned with thought. Instead, anyone who has put pen to paper to explore his or her thoughts can be the object of intellectual history. A famous example of an intellectual history of a non-canonical thinker is [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s study of a 16th-century Italian miller, [[Menocchio]], in his seminal work ''The Cheese and the Worms''.

Although the field emerged from European disciplines of ''[[Kulturgeschichte]]'' and ''[[Geistesgeschichte]]'', the historical study of ideas has engaged not only western intellectual traditions but others as well, including those in other parts of the world. Increasingly, historians are calling for a [[Global intellectual history]] that will show the parallels and interrelations in the history of thought of all human societies. Another important trend has been the [[history of the book]] and of reading, which has drawn attention to the material aspects of how books were designed, produced, distributed, and read.

==Intellectual historiography==
Intellectual history as a self-conscious discipline is a relatively recent phenomenon. It has precedents, however, in the [[history of philosophy]], the [[history of ideas]], and in [[cultural history]] as practiced since [[Jacob Burckhardt|Burckhardt]] or indeed since [[Voltaire]]. The history of the human mind, as it was called in the eighteenth century, was of great concern to scholars and philosophers, and their efforts can in part be traced to [[Francis Bacon]]’s call for what he termed a literary history in his [[The Advancement of Learning]]. In economics, [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883-1946) was both a historian of economic thought himself,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[John Maynard Keynes]], ''Essays in Biography'', Macmillan, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; and the subject of study by historians of economic thought because of the significance of the [[Keynesian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt; E.g. [[Peter Clarke (historian)]], ''The Keynesian Revolution in the Making, 1924-1936'', 1988. [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the discipline of intellectual history as it is now understood emerged only in the immediate postwar period, in its earlier incarnation as "the [[history of ideas]]" under the leadership of [[Arthur Lovejoy]], the founder of the [[Journal of the History of Ideas]]. Since that time, Lovejoy's formulation of "unit-ideas" has been discredited and replaced by more nuanced and more historically sensitive accounts of intellectual activity, and this shift is reflected in the replacement of the phrase [[history of ideas]] by ''intellectual history''.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Richter,  "Begriffsgeschichte and the History of Ideas." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1987): 247-263. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709557 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history includes the history of thought in many disciplines, such as the [[history of philosophy]], and the [[history of economic thought]]. Analytical concepts - such as the nature of paradigms and the causes of paradigm shifts - have been borrowed from the study of other disciplines, exemplified by the use of the ideas of [[Thomas Kuhn]] about [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] to explain revolutions in thought in economics and other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt; E.g. Ghanshyam Mehta, ''The structure of the Keynesian Revolution'', 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain the [[history of political thought]] has been a particular focus since the late 1960s and is associated especially with [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|historians at Cambridge]], such as  [[John Dunn (political theorist)|John Dunn]] and [[Quentin Skinner]]. They studied European political thought in its historical context, emphasizing the emergence and development of such concepts as the state and freedom. Skinner in particular is renowned for his provocative methodological essays, which were and are widely read by philosophers and practitioners of other humanistic disciplines, and did much to give prominence to the practice of intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Richter, "Reconstructing the history of political languages: Pocock, Skinner, and the Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe." History and Theory (1990): 38-70. [http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/122486/bdf9f28ccd0e5fa91c1b6dae307c0eed.pdf?sequence=1 online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States, intellectual history is understood more broadly to encompass many different forms of intellectual output, not just the history of political ideas, and it includes such fields as the history of historical thought, associated especially with [[Anthony Grafton]] of [[Princeton University]] and [[J.G.A. Pocock]] of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Formalized in 2010, the History and Culture Ph.D. at [[Drew University]] is one of a few graduate programs in the US currently specializing in intellectual history, both in its American and European contexts. Despite the prominence of early modern intellectual historians (those studying the age from the [[Renaissance]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), the intellectual history of the modern period has also been the locus of intense and creative output on both sides of the Atlantic. Prominent examples of such work include [[Louis Menand]]'s ''[[The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America|The Metaphysical Club]]'' and [[Martin Jay]]'s ''[[The Dialectical Imagination]]''.

In continental Europe, equivalents of intellectual history can be found. An example is [[Reinhart Koselleck]]’s ''Begriffsgeschichte'' (history of concepts), though there are methodological differences between the work of Koselleck and his followers and the work of Anglo-American intellectual historians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61268">'''Library science''' (often termed '''library studies''', '''bibliothecography''', '''library economy''')&lt;ref name=note/&gt; is an [[interdisciplinary]] or [[Multidisciplinarity|multidisciplinary]] field that applies the practices, perspectives, and tools of [[management]], [[information technology]], [[education]], and other areas to [[library|libraries]]; the collection, organization, [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]], and [[dissemination]] of information resources; and the [[political economy]] of information. [[Martin Schrettinger]], a Bavarian librarian, coined the discipline within his work (1808–1828) ''Versuch eines vollständigen Lehrbuchs der Bibliothek-Wissenschaft oder Anleitung zur vollkommenen Geschäftsführung eines Bibliothekars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz79181.html|title=Deutsche Biographie –  Schrettinger, Martin|website=www.deutsche-biographie.de|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than classifying information based on nature-oriented elements, as was previously done in his Bavarian library, Schrettinger organized books in alphabetical order.&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, M (2005, June 12). Information schools: a monk, library science, and the information age. Retrieved from http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/huminfo.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The first American school for library science was founded by [[Melvil Dewey]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1887.&lt;ref name=oclc/&gt;&lt;ref name=deutsche/&gt;

Historically, library science has also included [[archival science]].&lt;ref name=harris/&gt; This includes how information resources are organized to serve the needs of select user groups, how people interact with classification systems and technology, how information is acquired, evaluated and applied by people in and outside libraries as well as cross-culturally, how people are trained and educated for careers in libraries, the [[ethics]] that guide library service and organization, the legal status of libraries and information resources, and the applied science of computer technology used in documentation and [[records management]].

There is no generally agreed-upon distinction between the terms ''library science'',and ''librarianship'', and to a certain extent they are interchangeable, perhaps differing most significantly in connotation. The term ''[[library science or library studies]]'' (LIS) is most often used;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/faq|title= Accreditation Frequently Asked Questions:What is the difference between the MLS, the MILS, the MLIS, etc.?|date=2017 |website=American Library Association |publisher=American Library Association|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; most librarians consider it as only a terminological variation, intended to emphasize the scientific and technical foundations of the subject and its relationship with information science. LIS should not be confused with [[information theory]], the mathematical study of the concept of information. ''Library philosophy'' has been contrasted with ''library science'' as the study of the aims and justifications of librarianship as opposed to the development and refinement of techniques.&lt;ref name=cossette/&gt;

==History==
{{globalize/US|date=November 2016}}

===17th century===
[[File:Gabriel Naude.jpg|thumbnail|Portrait of [[Gabriel Naudé]], author of ''Advis pour dresser une bibliothèque'' (1627), later translated into English in 1661]]

The earliest text on library operations, ''Advice on Establishing a Library'' was published in 1627 by French librarian and scholar [[Gabriel Naudé]].
Naudé wrote prolifically, producing works on many subjects including politics, religion, history, and the supernatural. He put into practice all the ideas put forth in ''Advice'' when given the opportunity to build and maintain the library of [[Cardinal Mazarin|Cardinal Jules Mazarin]].

===19th century===
[[File:Dewey relatv index.png|thumbnail]]
[[Martin Schrettinger]] wrote the second textbook (the first in Germany) on the subject from 1808 to 1829.

[[Thomas Jefferson]], whose library at [[Monticello]] consisted of thousands of books, devised a classification system inspired by the [[Baconian method]], which grouped books more or less by subject rather than alphabetically, as it was previously done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emblidge|first=D.|date=2014|title='Bibliomany has possessed me': Thomas Jefferson, the booksellers' customer extraordinaire|url=|journal=The International Journal of the Book |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=17–41 |doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jefferson collection provided the start of what became the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

The first American school of librarianship opened at [[Columbia University]] under the leadership of [[Melvil Dewey]], noted for his [[Dewey Decimal Classification|1876 decimal classification]], on 5 January 1887 as the School of Library Economy. The term ''library economy'' was common in the U.S. until 1942, with the ''library science'' predominant through much of the 20th century.

===20th century===
Later, the term was used in the title of [[S. R. Ranganathan]]'s ''The Five Laws of Library Science'', published in 1931, and in the title of [[Lee Pierce Butler]]'s 1933 book, ''An introduction to library science'' (University of Chicago Press).

S. R. Ranganathan conceived the [[five laws of library science]] and the development of the first major analytico-synthetic classification system, the [[colon classification]].&lt;ref name=rangan/&gt; In India, he is considered to be the father of library science, documentation, and information science and is widely known throughout the rest of the world for his fundamental thinking in the field.

In the United States, Lee Pierce Butler's new approach advocated research using [[quantitative research|quantitative methods]] and ideas in the [[social sciences]] with the aim of using librarianship to address society's information needs. He was one of the first faculty at the [[University of Chicago Graduate Library School]], which changed the structure and focus of education for librarianship in the twentieth century. This research agenda went against the more procedure-based approach of "library economy," which was mostly confined to practical problems in the administration of libraries.

[[William Stetson Merrill]]'s ''A Code for Classifiers'', released in several editions from 1914 to 1939,&lt;ref name=codef/&gt; is an example of a more pragmatic approach, where arguments stemming from in-depth knowledge about each field of study are employed to recommend a system of classification. While Ranganathan's approach was philosophical it was also tied more to the day-to-day business of running a library. A reworking of Ranganathan's laws was published in 1995 which removes the constant references to books. [[Michael Gorman (librarian)|Michael Gorman]]'s ''Our Enduring Values: Librarianship in the 21st Century'' features his eight principles necessary by library professionals and incorporate knowledge and information in all their forms, allowing for digital information to be considered.

In more recent years, with the growth of digital technology, the field has been greatly influenced by information science concepts. In the English speaking world the term "library science" seems to have been used for the first time in India&lt;ref&gt;Anwar, Mumtaz A. [http://cybra.p.lodz.pl/Content/1175/vol01no2/anwar_v01n2.html The Pioneers: Asa Don Dickinson]. ''World Libraries''. 1990–1991. Retrieved 1 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1916 book ''Punjab Library Primer'', written by Asa Don Dickinson and published by the [[University of the Punjab]], Lahore, Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, Asa D. [https://archive.org/details/punjablibrarypri00dickuoft Punjab Library Primer]. University of Panjab. 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; This university was the first in Asia to begin teaching "library science". The ''Punjab Library Primer'' was the first textbook on library science published in English anywhere in the world. The first textbook in the United States was the ''Manual of Library Economy'', published in 1929. In 1923, [[C. C. Williamson]], who was appointed by the Carnegie Corporation, published an assessment of library science education entitled "The Williamson Report," which designated that universities should provide library science training.&lt;ref name=rubin/&gt; This report had a significant impact on library science training and education. Library research and practical work, the area of information science, has remained largely distinct both in training and in research interests.

===21st century===
The digital age has transformed how information is accessed and retrieved. "The library is now a part of a complex and dynamic educational, recreational, and informational infrastructure."&lt;ref name=rubin2/&gt; Mobile devices and applications with wireless networking, high-speed computers and networks, and the computing cloud have deeply impacted and developed information science and information services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hu|first1=Sharon|title=Technology impacts on curriculum of library science (LIS) – a United States (US) perspective|journal=LIBRES: Library &amp; Information Science Research Electronic Journal|date=2013|volume=23|issue=2|pages=1–9|url=http://libres.curtin.edu.au/|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of the library sciences maintains its mission of access equity and community space, as well as the new means for information retrieval called information literacy skills. All catalogues, databases, and a growing number of books are all available on the Internet. In addition, the expanding free access to open source journals and sources such as Wikipedia have fundamentally impacted how information is accessed. [[Information literacy]] is the ability to "determine the extent of information needed, access the needed information effectively and efficiently, evaluate information and its sources critically, incorporate selected information into one’s knowledge base, use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose, and understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information, and access and use information ethically and legally."&lt;ref name=ala/&gt;

== Education and Training ==
{{main|Education for librarianship}}

Academic courses in library science include [[Librarian#Librarian roles and duties|collection management]], information systems and technology, research methods, [[information literacy]], [[Library catalog|cataloging]] and [[library classification|classification]], [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|preservation]], [[Librarian#Librarian roles and duties|reference]], [[statistics]] and [[management]]. Library science is constantly evolving, incorporating new topics like [[database management system|database management]], [[information architecture]] and [[information management]], among others. With the mounting acceptance of Wikipedia as a valued and reliable reference source, many libraries, museums and archives have introduced the role of [[Wikipedian in residence]]. As a result, some universities are including coursework relating to Wikipedia and Knowledge Management in their MLIS programs.

Most schools in the US only offer a master's degree in library science or an MLIS and do not offer an undergraduate degree in the subject. About fifty schools have this graduate program, and seven are still being ranked. Many have online programs, which makes attending more convenient if the college is not in a student's immediate vicinity. According to ''US News''{{'}} online journal, University of Illinois is at the top of the list of best MLIS programs provided by universities. Second is University of North Carolina and third is University of Washington. All the listings can be found [http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-information-science-rankings here.]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. News. (2014). Education. Retrieved From: http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-information-science-rankings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most professional library jobs require a professional post-baccalaureate degree in library science, or one of its equivalent terms. In the United States and [[Canada]] the certification usually comes from a master's degree granted by an [[American Library Association|ALA]]-accredited institution, so even non-scholarly librarians have an originally academic background. In the United Kingdom, however, there have been moves to broaden the entry requirements to professional library posts, such that qualifications in, or experience of, a number of other disciplines have become more acceptable. In Australia, a number of institutions offer degrees accepted by the [[Australian Library and Information Association|ALIA (Australian Library and Information Association)]]. Global standards of accreditation or certification in librarianship have yet to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Library Journal]]. (2016). "Librarians need Global Credentials". Retrieved from: http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2016/04/opinion/backtalk/librarians-need-global-credentials-backtalk&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[academic regalia in the United States]], the color for library science is [[lemon (color)|lemon]].

The Master of Library Science (MLIS) is the master's degree that is required for most professional librarian positions in the United States and Canada. The MLIS is a relatively recent degree; an older and still common degree designation for librarians to acquire is the Master of Library Science (MLS), or Master of Science in Library Science (MSLS) degree. According to the American Library Association (ALA), "The master’s degree in library and information studies is frequently referred to as the MLS; however, ALA-accredited degrees have various names such as Master of Arts, Master of Librarianship, Master of Library and Information Studies, or Master of Science. The degree name is determined by the program. The [ALA] Committee for Accreditation evaluates programs based on their adherence to the Standards for Accreditation of Master's Programs in Library and Information Studies, not based on the name of the degree

==Employment Outlook and Opportunities==
According to 'U.S. News &amp; World Report', library and information science ranked as one of the "Best Careers of 2008."&lt;ref name=usnews/&gt; The median annual salary for 2017 was reported by the U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] as $58,520 in the United States.&lt;ref name="bls-2017"/&gt; Additional salary breakdowns available by metropolitan area show that the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]-[[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]]-[[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] metropolitan area has the highest average salary at $86,380.&lt;ref name="bls-geographical breakdown"/&gt;  In December 2016, the BLS projected growth for the field at "9 percent between 2016 and 2026", which is "as fast as the average for all occupations".&lt;ref name="bls-2017"/&gt; The 2010-2011 Occupational Outlook Handbook states, "Workers in this occupation tend to be older than workers in the rest of the economy. As a result, there may be more workers retiring from this occupation than other occupations. However, relatively large numbers of graduates from MLS programs may cause competition in some areas and for some jobs."&lt;ref name="OOH-2010-11"/&gt;

==Gender and library science in the United States==
{{see also|Timeline of women in library science|Timeline of women in library science in the United States}}
Librarianship manifests a dual career structure for men and women in the United States. While the ratio of female to male librarians remains roughly 4:1,&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt;&lt;ref name=wiebe/&gt; top positions are more often held by men. In large academic libraries, there is less of a discrepancy; however, overall, throughout the profession, men tend to hold higher or leadership positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mestrovic Deyrup|first1=Marta|title=Is the Revolution Over? Gender, Economic and Professional Parity in Academic Library Leadership Positions|journal=College and Research Libraries|date=May 2004|volume=65|pages=242–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, however, have made continuous progress toward equality.&lt;ref name=wiebel/&gt; Women have also been largely left out of standard histories of U.S. librarianship, but Suzanne Hildenbrand's scholarly assessment of the work done by women has expanded the historical record.&lt;ref name=hilden/&gt; See also ''The Role of women in librarianship, 1876–1976: the entry, advancement, and struggle for equalization in one profession'', by Kathleen Weibel, Kathleen de la Peña McCook, and Dianne J. Ellsworth (1979), Phoenix, Ariz: Oryx Press.

=== Gender equality and library leadership ===
There was a "Women's Meeting" at the 1882 14th American Libraries Conference, where issues concerning the salaries of women librarians and what female patrons do in reading rooms were discussed.

During the first 35 years of the [[American Library Association]] its presidency was held by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALA's Past Presidents|url=http://www.ala.org/aboutala/history/past}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 [[Theresa Elmendorf]] became the first woman elected president of the ALA.&lt;ref name=thomison/&gt; She was ALA president from May 24, 1911, until July 2, 1912.&lt;ref name=ala2/&gt;

In 1919, an ALA resolution promoting equal pay and opportunities for women in librarianship was defeated by a large margin.

In 1970, Betty Wilson brought forth a resolution that would have had the ALA refrain from using facilities that discriminate against women. That resolution was also defeated by the membership.&lt;ref name="WomenArisen"&gt;Schuman, P., &amp; Weibel, K.(1979).The Women Arisen.American Libraries, 10(6), 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the ALA took a stand for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. The organization stated that they would no longer hold conferences in states that did not ratify the amendment, with the boycott measure set to take place in 1981.&lt;ref name="LibERA"&gt;Librarians for ERA. (1982). Wilson Library Bulletin, 57289-312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WomenAlabama"&gt;ALA women's rights stand: Alabama warns of impact. (1977). Library Journal, 102(18), 2105.&lt;/ref&gt; An ERA Task Force was formed in 1979 towards this goal and a sum of $25,000 was allocated towards task force operations in unratified states. At the time, a number of state library associations passed pro-ERA resolutions and formed committees on women in libraries.&lt;ref name="LibERA" /&gt;

In 2013–2014, 82% of graduates in Master of Library Science (MLS) programs were female.&lt;ref&gt;http://dpeaflcio.org/programs-publications/issue-fact-sheets/library-workers-facts-figures/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional association groups dedicated to librarianship and gender ===
There are multiple groups within the American Library Association, dedicated to discussing, critiquing, and furthering gender-related and feminist issues within the profession.

In 1969 the first women's rights task force was founded: the National Women's Liberation Front for Librarians (NWFFL or New-Waffle). It was also in 1969 that children's librarians, after being unable to find children's books that included working mothers, worked to remedy the situation and succeeded in their efforts.

The American Library Association's Social Responsibilities Round Table Feminist Task Force (FTF) was founded in 1970 by women who wished to address sexism in libraries and librarianship.&lt;ref name="libr.org"/&gt; FTF was the first ALA group to focus on women's issues.&lt;ref name="libr.org"/&gt; In recent years during Women's History Month (March), the FTF has dedicated their efforts to expanding women’s library history online, using the website Women of Library History.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenoflibraryhistory.tumblr.com/ Women of Library History]&lt;/ref&gt; The FTF also publishes the annual Amelia Bloomer Project list,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ameliabloomer.wordpress.com/ Amelia Bloomer Project list]&lt;/ref&gt; which includes some of the best feminist young adult literature of the year.

The Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship (COSWL) of the American Library Association,&lt;ref name=ala3/&gt; founded in 1976, represents the diversity of women's interest within ALA and ensures that the Association considers the rights of the majority (women) in the library field, and promotes and initiates the collection, analysis, dissemination, and coordination of information on the status of women in librarianship. The bibliographic history of women in U.S. librarianship and women librarians developing services for women has been well-documented in the series of publications initially issued by the Social Responsibilities Round Table Task Force on Women and later continued by COSWL.&lt;ref name=mess/&gt;

The ALA also has the Women &amp; Gender Studies Section (WGSS) of its Division "Association of College &amp; Research Libraries"; this section was formed to discuss, promote, and support women's studies collections and services in academic and research libraries.&lt;ref name=libr/&gt;

Finally, the ALA has the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Roundtable (GLBTRT). While the GLBTRT deals with sexuality, different than gender identity, much of the roundtable’s work is arguably feminist in nature, and concerned with issues of gender. The GLBTRT is committed to serving the information needs of the GLBT professional library community, and the GLBT information and access needs of individuals at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALA GLBT Roundtable|url=http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/glbtrt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Library science scholarship relating to issues of gender ===

Many scholars within the profession have taken up gender and its relationship to the discipline of library and information science. Scholars like [[Hope A. Olson]] and [[Sanford Berman]] have directed efforts at the problematic nature of [[cataloging]] and classification standards and schemes that are obscuring or exclusionary to marginalized groups. Others have written about the implications of gendered stereotypes in librarianship, particularly as they relate to [[library instruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pagowski|first1=Nicole|last2=DeFrain|first2=Erica|title=Ice Ice Baby: Are Librarian Stereotypes Freezing Us out of Instruction|url=http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2014/ice-ice-baby-2/|website=In the Library with the Lead Pipe|publisher=In the Library with the Lead Pipe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Library instruction]] also intersects with [[feminist pedagogy]], and scholars such as Maria Accardi have written about feminist pedagogical practices in libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Accardi|first1=Maria|title=Feminist Pedagogy for Library Instruction|date=July 2013|publisher=Library Juice Press|isbn=978-1-936117-55-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Library scholars have also dealt with issues of gender and leadership, having equitable gender representation in library collection development, and issues of gender and young adult and children’s librarianship.

=== Library policies relating to issues of gender ===
The ALA Policy Manual states under ''B.2.1.15 Access to Library Resources and Services Regardless of Sex, Gender Identity, Gender Expression, or Sexual Orientation (Old Number 53.1.15):'' "The American Library Association stringently and unequivocally maintains that libraries and librarians have an obligation to resist efforts that systematically exclude materials dealing with any subject matter, including sex, gender identity or expression, or sexual orientation. The Association also encourages librarians to proactively support the First Amendment rights of all library users, regardless of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. Adopted 1993, amended 2000, 2004, 2008, 2010." &lt;ref name=ala5/&gt; It also states under ''B.2.12 Threats to Library Materials Related to Sex, Gender Identity, or Sexual Orientation (Old Number 53.12)'', "The American Library Association supports the inclusion in library collections of materials that reflect the diversity of our society, including those related to sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression. ALA encourages all American Library Association chapters to take active stands against all legislative or other government attempts to proscribe materials related to sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression; and encourages all libraries to acquire and make available materials representative of all the people in our society. Adopted 2005, Amended 2009, 2010." &lt;ref name=ala6/&gt;

==Diversity in librarianship==
{{see also|Libraries and the LGBTQ community}}
The field of library science seeks to provide a diverse working environment in libraries across the United States. Ways to change the status quo include diversifying the job field with regards to age, class, disabilities, ethnicity, gender identity, race, sex, and sexual orientation. The demographics of America are changing; those who were once minorities will become the majority.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Qallaf, C. L. &amp; Mika, J. J. (2013). The Role of Multiculturalism and Diversity in Library and Information science: LIS Education and the Job Market. Libri: International Journal of Libraries &amp; Information Services. 63 (1), p. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Library facilities can best represent their communities by hiring diverse staffs.&lt;ref name="Andrade, R. 2011"&gt;Andrade, R. &amp; Rivera, A. (2011). Developing a Diversity-Competent Workforce: The UA Libraries’ Experience. Journal of Library Administration. 51:7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Library Association and many libraries around the country realize the issue of diversity in the workplace and are addressing this problem.

===Statistics===
The majority of librarians working in the U.S. are female, between the ages of 55–64, and Caucasian.&lt;ref name="ala.org"&gt;American Library Association. (2014) Diversity Counts. Web. Retrieved From: http://www.ala.org/offices/diversity/diversitycounts/divcounts&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 study by the American Library Association of research done from 2009 to 2010 shows that 98,273 of credentialed librarians were female while 20,393 were male. 15,335 of the total 111,666 were 35 and younger and only 6,222 were 65 or older. 104,393 were white; 6,160 African American, 3,260 American Pacific Islander; 185 Native American including Alaskan; 1,008 of two or more races, and 3,661 Latino. (ALA).&lt;ref name="ala.org"/&gt;

===Strategies===

====Scholarships/grants====
To help change the lack of diversity in library jobs in the U.S., more scholarships and grants are emerging. Most library and information science students do not belong to an [[underrepresented group]] and as a reaction to these research statistics, the field is creating ways to encourage more diversity in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Kumasi, K 2011 p.251-264"&gt;Kumasi, K &amp; Hill, R. F. (2011). Are We There Yet? Results of a Gap Analysis to Measure LIS Students’ Prior Knowledge and Actual Learning of Cultural Competence Concepts. Journal of Education for Library &amp; Information Science. 42(4), p.251-264.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====ALA Annual Research Diversity Grant Program=====
The ALA Annual Research Diversity Grant Program is a way to encourage innovation in scholars and professionals to provide insight into how to diversify the field. The ALA Grant is directed toward those who have valuable and original research ideas that can add to the knowledge of diversity in the field of Librarianship. The program awards up to three individuals once a year with a grant of $2,500 each.&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association. (2014). ALA Annual Research Diversity Grant Program. Web. Retrieved From: http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/diversityresearchstatistics/diversityresearch&lt;/ref&gt;  The applicants have submission guidelines, are given a timeline, and are shown the evaluation process online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/diversityresearchstatistics/diversityresearch&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural competencies====
One way to nurture cultural diversity in the library field is with cultural competencies. Scholars recommend defining skills needed to serve and work with others who belong to different cultures. It is suggested that these definitions be posted in job listings and be referred to when promoting and giving raises.&lt;ref name="Andrade, R. 2011"/&gt; In library and information science graduate programs, it is also suggested by scholars that there is a lack of classes teaching students cultural competences. It is important for more classes to teach about diversity and measure the outcomes.&lt;ref name="Kumasi, K 2011 p.251-264"/&gt;

====Recruitment====
Another strategy is to create interest in the field of library and information science from a young age. If minorities do not desire to become librarians, they will not seek to obtain an MLS or MLIS and therefore will not fill high job roles in libraries. A recommended solutions are to create a great experience for all racial group's early on in life.&lt;ref&gt;Hanken, T. (2010). Workforce Challenges with the Public Library Sector: Recruitment, Retention and Diversity. PA Times.&lt;/ref&gt; This may inspire more young children to become interested in this field.

===The Deaf Community and Library Science in the United States===
{{unbalanced|date=November 2016}}
Deaf people have the same needs as any other library visitors, and often have more difficulty accessing materials and services. Over the last few decades, libraries in the United States have begun to implement services and collections for D/deaf and HoH patrons and are working to make more of their collections, services, their communities, and even the world more accessible to this group of underserved people.

The history of the role of libraries in the Deaf community in the United States is a sordid one. The [[American Library Association]] readily admits that disabled people belong to a minority that is often overlooked and underrepresented by people in the library, and the Deaf community belongs in this minority group.&lt;ref name=ala7/&gt; However, in the last few decades, libraries across the United States have made great strides in the mission of making libraries more accessible to disabled people in general and to the Deaf community specifically. The Library Bill of Rights preamble states that "all libraries are forums for information and ideas" and as such libraries need to remove the physical and technological barriers which in turn would allow persons with disabilities full access to the resources available.&lt;ref name=ala8/&gt;

One notable American activist in the library community working toward accessibility for the deaf was [[Alice Lougee Hagemeyer]].&lt;ref name="Hagemeyer"&gt;{{cite https://www.gallaudet.edu/about/history-and-traditions/alice-hagemeyer/w/page/18570477/Alice%20Hagemeyer |title=historytrendsanddeafeducation / Alice Hagemeyer| |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2017-4-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deafpeople1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gallaudet.edu/about/history-and-traditions/alice-hagemeyer |title=Deaf Person of the Month |publisher=Deafpeople.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian librarian Karen McQuigg stated in 2003 that "even ten years ago, when I was involved in a project looking at what public libraries could offer the deaf, it seemed as if the gap between the requirements of this group and what public libraries could offer was too great for public libraries to be able to serve them effectively."&lt;ref name=mcquigg/&gt; Clearly, not even so long ago, there was quite a dearth of information for or about the deaf community available in libraries across the nation and around the globe.

New guidelines from library organizations such as [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) and the ALA were written in order to help libraries make their information more accessible to people with disabilities, and in some cases, specifically the deaf community. IFLA's ''Guidelines for Library Services to Deaf People'' is one such set of guidelines, was published to inform libraries of the services that should be provided for deaf patrons. Most of the guidelines pertain to ensuring that deaf patrons have equal access to all available library services. Other guidelines include training library staff to provide services for the deaf community, availability of text telephones or TTYs not only to assist patrons with reference questions but also for making outside calls, using the most recent technology in order to communicate more effectively with deaf patrons, including closed captioning services for any television services, and developing a collection that would interest the members of the deaf community.&lt;ref name=day/&gt;

Over the years, library services have begun to evolve in order to accommodate the needs and desires of local deaf communities. There is now a [http://www.ala.org/ascla/asclaourassoc/asclasections/lssps/lspdhhf/lspdhhf Library Service to People Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing Forum] for libraries to look at to find out what they can do to better serve their Deaf/HoH users.  At the Queen Borough Public Library (QBPL) in New York, the staff implemented new and innovative ideas in order to involve the community and library staff with the deaf people in their community. The QBPL hired a deaf librarian, Lori Stambler, to train the library staff about deaf culture, to teach sign language classes for family members and people who are involved with deaf people, and to teach literacy classes for deaf patrons. In working with the library, Stambler was able to help the community reach out to its deaf neighbors, and helped other deaf people become more active in their outside community.&lt;ref name=hollander/&gt;

==== Deaf libraries ====
The library at [[Gallaudet University]], the only deaf liberal arts university in the United States, was founded in 1876. The library's collection has grown from a small number of reference books to the world's largest collection of deaf-related materials, with over 234,000 books and thousands of other materials in different formats. The collection is so large that the library had to create a hybrid classification system based on the Dewey Decimal Classification System in order to make cataloging and location within the library easier for both library staff and users. The library also houses the university's archives, which holds some of the oldest deaf-related books and documents in the world.&lt;ref name=harringt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gallaudet.edu/library&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nashville, Tennessee, Sandy Cohen manages the Library Services for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (LSDHH). The program was created in 1979 in response to information accessibility issues for the deaf in the Nashville area. Originally, the only service provided was the news via a teletypewriter or TTY, but today, the program has expanded to serving the entire state of Tennessee by providing all different types of information and material on deafness, deaf culture, and information for family members of deaf people, as well as a historical and reference collection.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

==Theory and practice of library science==
Many practicing librarians do not contribute to LIS scholarship, but focus on daily operations within their own libraries or library systems. Other practicing librarians, particularly in academic libraries, do perform original scholarly LIS research and contribute to the academic end of the field.

Whether or not individual professional librarians contribute to scholarly research and publication, many are involved with and contribute to the advancement of the profession and of library science through local, state, regional, national and international library or information organizations.

Library science is very closely related to issues of [[knowledge organization]]; however, the latter is a broader term which covers how knowledge is represented and stored (computer science/linguistics), how it might be automatically processed (artificial intelligence), and how it is organized outside the library in global systems such as the internet. In addition, library science typically refers to a specific community engaged in managing holdings as they are found in university and government libraries, while knowledge organization in general refers to this and also to other communities (such as publishers) and other systems (such as the Internet). The library system is thus one socio-technical structure for knowledge organization.&lt;ref name=hoetz/&gt;

The terms information organization and knowledge organization are often used synonymously.&lt;ref name = "Bawden and Robinson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bawden|first1=David|last2=Robinson|first2=Lyn|title=Introduction to information science|date=2013|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers, Incorporated|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1555708610}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{rp|106}}  The fundamentals of their study (particularly theory relating to indexing and classification) and many of the main tools used by the disciplines in modern times to provide access to digital resources (abstracting, [[metadata]], resource description, systematic and alphabetic subject description, and terminology) originated in the 19th century and were developed, in part, to assist in making humanity's intellectual output accessible by recording, identifying, and providing bibliographic control of printed knowledge.&lt;ref Name = "Bawden and Robinson" /&gt; {{rp|105}}

Information has been published which analyses the relations between philosophy of information (PI), library and information science (LIS), and social epistemology (SE).&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.102.4609&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of libraries==

===Public library===
The study of librarianship for [[Public library|public libraries]] covers issues such as cataloging; [[Library collection development|collection development]] for a diverse community; [[information literacy]]; [[readers' advisory]]; community standards; public services-focused librarianship; serving a diverse community of adults, children, and teens; [[intellectual freedom]]; [[censorship]]; and legal and budgeting issues. The public library as a commons or public sphere based on the work of [[Jürgen Habermas]] has become a central metaphor in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=mccook2/&gt;

Most people are familiar with municipal public libraries, but there are many different types of public libraries that exist. There are four different types of public libraries: association libraries, municipal public libraries, school district libraries and special district public libraries. It is very important to be able to distinguish between the four. Each receives its funding through different sources. Each is established by a different set of voters. And, not all are subject to municipal civil service governance. Listed below is a chart from the New York State Library's library development website. This chart lists all of the information about the different public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lis510-libraries.wikispaces.com/Different+types+of+libraries|title=LIS510-Libraries – Different types of libraries|work=wikispaces.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School library/media center===
The study of school librarianship covers library services for children in schools through secondary school. In some regions, the local government may have stricter standards for the education and certification of school librarians (who are often considered a special case of teacher), than for other librarians, and the educational program will include those local criteria. School librarianship may also include issues of [[intellectual freedom]], [[pedagogy]], [[information literacy]], and how to build a cooperative [[curriculum]] with the teaching staff.

The study of academic librarianship covers library services for colleges and universities. Issues of special importance to the field may include [[copyright]]; technology, [[digital libraries]], and digital repositories; [[academic freedom]]; [[open access]] to scholarly works; as well as specialized knowledge of subject areas important to the institution and the relevant [[reference work]]s. Librarians often divide focus individually as liaisons on particular schools within a college or university.

Some academic librarians are considered [[Faculty (division)|faculty]], and hold similar academic ranks to those of professors, while others are not. In either case, the minimal qualification is a Master of Arts in Library Studies or Masters of Arts in Library Science. Some academic libraries may only require a master's degree in a specific academic field or a related field, such as educational technology.

===Archives===
The study of archives includes the training of [[archivist]]s, librarians specially trained to maintain and build [[archive]]s of [[document|records]] intended for [[historic preservation|historical preservation]]. Special issues include physical preservation, conservation and restoration of materials and [[mass deacidification]]; specialist catalogs; solo work; access; and appraisal. Many archivists are also trained historians specializing in the period covered by the archive.

The archival mission includes three major goals: To identify papers and records that have enduring value, to preserve the identified papers, and to make the papers available to others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52540188|title=Developing and maintaining practical archives : a how-to-do-it manual|last=S.|first=Hunter, Gregory|date=2003|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers|year=|isbn=1555704670|edition= 2nd|location=New York|pages=219–223|oclc=52540188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are significant differences between libraries and archives, including differences in collections, records creation, item acquisition, and preferred behavior in the institution. The major difference in collections is that library collections typically comprise published items (books, magazines, etc.), while archival collections are usually unpublished works (letters, diaries, etc.) In managing their collections, libraries will categorize items individually, but archival items never stand alone. An archival record gains its meaning and importance from its relationship to the entire collection; therefore archival items are usually received by the archive in a group or batch. Library collections are created by many individuals, as each author and illustrator creates their own publication; in contrast, an archive usually collects the records of one person, family, institution, or organization, and so the archival items will have fewer source authors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another difference between a library and an archive, is that library materials are created explicitly by authors or others who are working intentionally. They choose to write and publish a book, for example, and that occurs. Archival materials are not created intentionally. Instead, the items in an archive are what remain after a business, institution, or person conducts their normal business practices.The collection of letters, documents, receipts, ledger books, etc. were created with intention to perform daily tasks, they were not created in order to populate a future archive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As for item acquisition, libraries receive items individually, but archival items will usually become part of the archive's collection as a cohesive group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Behavior in an archive differs from behavior in a library, as well. In most libraries, patrons are allowed and encouraged to browse the stacks, because the books are openly available to the public. Archival items almost never circulate, and someone interested in viewing documents must request them of the archivist and may only view them in a closed reading room.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those who wish to visit an archive will usually begin with an entrance interview. This is an opportunity for the archivist to register the researcher, confirm their identity, and determine their research needs. This is also the opportune time for the archivist to review reading room rules, which vary but typically include policies on privacy, photocopying, the use of finding aids, and restrictions on food, drinks, and other activities or items that could damage the archival materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Special library===
[[Special library|Special libraries]] and special librarians include almost any other form of librarianship, including those who serve in medical libraries (and hospitals or medical schools), corporations, [[New agency|news agencies]], [[government organizations]], or other [[Research library|special collections]]. The issues at these libraries are specific to the industries they inhabit, but may include solo work, corporate financing, specialized collection development, and extensive self-promotion to potential patrons. Special librarians have their own professional organization, the [[Special Libraries Association|Special Library Association]].

National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.ucar.edu/# National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)]&lt;/ref&gt; is considered a special library. Its mission is to support, preserve, make accessible, and collaborate in the scholarly research and educational outreach activities of UCAR/NCAR.

Another is the Federal Bureau of Investigations Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fbilibrary.fbiacademy.edu/ The FBI Library]&lt;/ref&gt; According to its website, "The FBI Library supports the FBI in its statutory mission to uphold the law through investigation of violations of federal criminal law; to protect the United States from foreign intelligence and terrorist activities; and to provide leadership and law enforcement assistance to federal, state, local, and international agencies.

===Preservation===
{{main|Preservation (library and archival science)}}
Preservation librarians most often work in academic libraries. Their focus is on the management of preservation activities that seek to maintain access to content within books, manuscripts, archival materials, and other library resources. Examples of activities managed by preservation librarians include binding, conservation, digital and analog reformatting, [[digital preservation]], and environmental monitoring.

This is a list of monuments suffering damage from conflict in the [[Middle East]] during the 21st century. It is sorted by country.

==Afghanistan==
* The [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] were a spectacular legacy of [[Buddhism]] in [[Afghanistan]]. The sandstone sculptures were among the tallest standing Buddhas in the world (the largest at 53 metres). The 35 structures had survived more than 1,500 years. The [[Taliban]] stated that they considered the monuments [[idolatrous]] and destroyed them with dynamite over several weeks, starting on 2 March 2001.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"&gt;{{cite news |title=The greatest buildings you'll never see: 20 priceless monuments lost in conflict |author=Kieron Monks |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/11/05/world/gallery/precious-monuments-lost-in-middle-east-conflicts/index.html|network=cnn |date=29 June 2015 |accessdate=2 July 2015 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egypt==
* The [[Museum of Islamic Art, Cairo|Museum of Islamic Art]] in [[Cairo]] is home to one of the world's most impressive collections of Islamic art. It includes over 100,000 pieces that cover the entirety of [[Islamic history]]. The Cairo site was first built in 1881 and underwent a multi-million dollar renovation between 2003 and 2010.

: On January 24th, 2014 a car bomb attack targeting the Cairo police headquarters on the other side of the street caused considerable damage to the museum and destroyed many artifacts. It is estimated that 20-30% of the artifacts will need restoration. The blast also severely damaged the buildings facade, wiping out intricate designs in the Islamic style. The [[Egyptian National Library and Archives]] in the same building was also affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140124-cairo-egypt-museum-islamic-art-bomb-artifacts-destroyed/|title=Cairo Blast Rips Into Islamic Art Museum, Damaging Key Global Collection|date=26 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25877201 | work=BBC News | title=Cairo's Islamic Art Museum hit in blast | date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/26/unesco-islamic-museum-cairo-blast|title=Unesco to assess blast damage at Islamic museum in Cairo|first=Associated Press in|last=Cairo|date=26 January 2014|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraq==
* [[Great Mosque of Samarra]]. Once the largest [[mosque]] in the world, built in the 9th century on the [[Tigris River]] north of [[Baghdad]]. The mosque is famous for Malwiya Tower, a 52-meter minaret with spiraling ramps for worshipers to climb. The site was bombed in 2005, in an insurgent attack on a [[NATO]] position, destroying the top of the minaret and surrounding walls.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;
* [[Tomb of Jonah]]. The purported resting place of biblical prophet Jonah, along with a tooth by some believed to be from the whale that consumed him in the myth. The site dated to the 8th century BC, and was of great importance to [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] faiths. It was entirely blown up by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] militants in 2014 as part of their campaign against perceived apostasy.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;
* [[Nimrud]]. The ancient [[Assyria]]n city around Nineveh Province, Iraq was home to countless treasures of the empire, including statues, monuments and jewels. Following the 2003 invasion the site has been devastated by looting, with many of the stolen pieces finding homes in museum abroad.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;

[[File:Saint Elijah's Monastery 1.JPG|thumb|[[Dair Mar Elia]] monastery]]
* [[Dair Mar Elia]]. The Christian monastery near Mosul was founded in the late 6th century, and its sanctuary was built in the 11th century. The monastery was damaged during the invasion of 2003, before being completely destroyed by ISIL in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Martin|title=Isil extremists destroy Iraq’s oldest Christian monastery|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/isil-extremists-destroy-iraq-s-oldest-christian-monastery/|work=[[The Art Newspaper]]|date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lebanon==
* [[Old Beirut]] suffered through a brutal 15-year civil war, successive battles with [[Israel]], and sweeping urban development. It is referred to as the "Paris of the [[Middle East]]" and is known for its impressive landscape Ottoman, French and [[Art Deco]] architecture. Officials report that just 400 of 1200 protected historic buildings remain.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;

==Libya==
* [[Cyrene (Libya)]]. A key city for the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], established in [[630 BC]]. Famed as the basis for enduring myths and legends, such as that of the huntress heroine of the same name and bride of [[Apollo]]. The ruins were some of the best preserved from that period.

: In May 2011, a number of objects excavated from Cyrene in 1917 and held in the vault of the National Commercial Bank in [[Benghazi]] were stolen. Looters tunnelled into the vault and broke into two safes that held the artefacts which were part of the so-called 'Benghazi Treasure' . The whereabouts of these objects are currently unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/benghazi-treasure |title=Benghazi Treasure |publisher=Trafficking Culture Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Parts of the UNESCO World Heritage site of Cyrene were destroyed in August 2013 by locals to make way for homes and shops. Approximately 200 vaults and tombs were leveled, as well as a section of a viaduct dating to the third century BC. Artifacts were thrown into a nearby river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/news/1242-130823-libya-cyrene-necropolis |title=Destruction of Cyrene Necropolis |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |date= |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palestine==
* Al-Omari Mosque, Gaza. Ancient monument in the heart of Jabalya's old town that dates back to the [[Mamluk]] Era. The walls, dome and roof were destroyed by Israeli airstrikes during the 2015 fighting in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], along with dozens more historic sites.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt; Mosques were targeted by Israel due to their use as launch sites for rockets and mortars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/long-neglected-gaza-heritage-wilts-in-war|title=Long-neglected Gaza heritage wilts in war|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syria==
* [[Armenian Genocide Memorial Church (Der Zor)]]. Memorial site to the 1.5 million killed between 1915 and 1923, the Deir Ez-zor became a yearly destination for pilgrims from around the world. The site included a church, museum, and fire that burned continuously. On 21 September 2014, the memorial complex was blown up by militants of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hayrumyan|first1=Naira|title=Middle East Terror: Memory of Armenian Genocide victims targeted by ISIS militants|url=http://www.armenianow.com/commentary/analysis/57070/armenia_church_syria_isis_aram_catholicos|work=[[ArmeniaNow]]|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IS said to destroy Armenian Genocide memorial|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/is-reportedly-destroys-armenian-genocide-memorial/|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who destroyed the Armenian Genocide Martyrs’ Memorial Church in Deir Ezzor?|url=https://conflictantiquities.wordpress.com/2014/11/12/iraq-syria-islamic-state-destruction-deir-ez-zor-armenian-genocide-memorial-church-responsibility/|website=conflict antiquities|accessdate=20 March 2015|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ancient city of [[Bosra]]. Continually inhabited for 2,500 years, and became the capital of the Romans' Arabian empire/ The centerpiece is a magnificent Roman theatre dating back to the second century that survived intact until the current century. Archeologists have revealed the site is now severely damaged from mortar shelling.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;

[[File:Aleppo Citadel 04.jpg|right|thumb|The fortified entrance of the Citadel of Aleppo]]
* [[Citadel of Aleppo]]. The fortress spans at least four millennia, from the days of [[Alexander the Great]], through Roman, Mongol, and Ottoman rule. The site has barely changed since the 16th century and is one of Syria's most popular [[World Heritage sites]].&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;

: In August 2012, during the [[Battle of Aleppo (2012)|Battle of Aleppo]] of the [[Syrian civil war]], the external gate of the citadel was damaged after being shelled during a clash between the [[Free Syrian Army]] and the [[Syrian Army]] to gain control over the citadel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aleppo citadel hit by shelling, says opposition |agency=Agence France Presse |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2012/Aug-11/184198-aleppo-citadel-hit-by-shelling-says-opposition.ashx#axzz23BbEcFXx |newspaper=The Daily Star Lebanon |date=11 August 2012 |accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: During the conflict, the [[Syrian Army]] used the Citadel as a military base, with the walls acting as cover while shelling surrounding areas and ancient arrow slits in walls being used by snipers to target rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient Syrian castles serve again as fighting positions |author=Abigail Hauslohner and Ahmed Ramadan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/ancient-syrian-castles-serve-again-as-fighting-positions/2013/05/04/5d2bb176-b3f8-11e2-9a98-4be1688d7d84_story.html|newspaper=Washington Post |date=5 May 2013 |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abigail Hauslohner and Ahmed Ramadan"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient Syrian castles serve again as fighting positions |author=Abigail Hauslohner and Ahmed Ramadan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/ancient-syrian-castles-serve-again-as-fighting-positions/2013/05/04/5d2bb176-b3f8-11e2-9a98-4be1688d7d84_story.html|newspaper=Washington Post |date=5 May 2013 |accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this contemporary usage, the Citadel has received significant damage.

* [[Al-Madina Souq]]. The covered markets in the Old City are a famous trade center for the region's finest produce, with dedicated sub-souks for fabrics, food, and accessories. The tunnels became the scene of fierce fighting and many of the oldest are now damaged beyond recognition. This was described by UNESCO as a tragedy.&lt;ref name="Abigail Hauslohner and Ahmed Ramadan"/&gt;
* [[Deir ez-Zor suspension bridge]]. This French-built suspension bridge was a popular pedestrian crossing and vantage point for its views of the Euphrates River. The bridge was destroyed by [[Free Syrian Army]] militiamen during the [[Syrian civil war]] in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.breakingnews.sy/ar/article/16724.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque]]. Among Syria's most famous Ottoman-style mosques, which also shows [[Mamluk]] influence through its light and dark contrasts. As of 2007, activities in the mosque were organized by [[sheikh|shaykh]]s Haytham al-Sa'id and Ahmad Mithqan.&lt;ref&gt;Rougier, 2007, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Stamps depicting the mosque have been issued in several denominations.

: The Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque has been a symbol of anti-government rebels during the [[Syrian civil war]].&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{Cite news |first1=Albert |last1=Aji |first2=Bassem |last2=Mroue |title=Khalid Ibn Al-Walid Mosque In Homs' Khaldiyeh District |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/27/syrian-troops-homs-mosque_n_3663894.html |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |date=2013-07-27 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Syrian security forces killed 10 protesters participating in a funeral procession as they were leaving the mosque on 18 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/world/middleeast/20syria.html?_r=0|title=At Funerals for Protesters, More Syrians Are Fatally Shot|accessdate=8 September 2012|publisher=New York Times|date= 18 July 2011|first=Nada|last=Bakri}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque, which the [[Syrian government]] stated had been turned by the rebels into an "arms and ammunition depot", was abandoned by the rebels on 27 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2013/07/29/01003-20130729ARTFIG00374-syrie-l-armee-en-voie-de-controler-totalement-homs.php|title=Syrie : l'armée en voie de contrôler totalement Homs|accessdate=2013-07-30|publisher=Le Figaro|date=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelling by government forces damaged Khalid's tomb inside the mosque.

'''Marriage plot''' is a term used, often in academic circles, to categorize a [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]] that recurs in novels most prominently and more recently in films. Until the expansion of the definition of marriage to include [[same-sex couple]]s, this [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] centered exclusively on the courtship rituals between a man and a woman and the obstacles that faced the potential couple on its way to the nuptial payoff. The marriage plot became a popular source of entertainment in the 18th and 19th centuries with the rise of the [[middle class]] novel. The foremost practitioners of the form include some of the more illustrious names in English letters, among them [[Samuel Richardson]], [[Jane Austen]], [[George Eliot]] and the [[Brontë sisters]].

==Use in novels==
Post-1980 deconstructionist criticism has highlighted how the plot was a profitable publishing and ideological production that served to ensure the ascendancy of the [[middle class]]. The marriage plot was the liberal age's reformulation of the [[medieval romance]], which excluded all but aristocratic ladies and their chivalrous knights from its epics of love. The marriage plot promises to liberate romance by making it available to greater sections of society: the middle class and to some extent, the [[working class]]es, who are relegated to [[comic relief]] in 16th- and 17th-century theater, suddenly become serious moral subjects. Today, few doubt the ennobling qualities of love, but giving that nobility of soul to anyone but nobles was an innovation to be found foundationally in the marriage plot, perhaps pioneered by Richardson's ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'', wherein a lowly but virtuous maid is raised beyond her birth through her insistent [[chastity]] and her subsequent marriage to the lordly Mr. B.

==Use in film==
Film, which supplanted the novel as the most popular narrative form in the 20th century, did not abandon this innovation of the novel. Rather, the marriage plot has enjoyed a continued efflorescence, visible to this day in the popular film form known as the "[[romantic comedy]]". At its most formulaic, critics have asserted, the conventions of the marriage plot, with the cathartic closure that its marriage ending delivers to its believers, ultimately renounces politics and engagement in the world in favor of privacy and domestic bliss. We may see this, for instance, in the film ''[[You've Got Mail]]'', which resolves the political opposition between mega-bookstore boss [[Tom Hanks]] and bookshop-around-the-corner owner, [[Meg Ryan]], by uniting its lead characters in a union that effaces the unequal distribution of capital that originally put them at odds.

The '''Missionary Generation''' was the name given by [[sociology|sociologists]] to describe  the [[generation]] of people born in the United States from 1860 to 1882.  It is an identified cohort within the [[Strauss–Howe generational theory]].[[File:Pre-election suffrage parade NYC.jpg|thumb|250px|Suffragists marching in New York, 1915. Social Crusades were a defining feature.]]

==Characteristics==
Members of the Missionary Generation have been described as the "home-and-hearth children of the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era". They were an idealist generation and as young adults, their leaders were the first graduates of newly formed black and women's colleges.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

They rejected the strict [[Victorian era|Victorian]] values, questioned gender roles and feared society would become soulless, inhumane, and money-driven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socalledmillennial.com/generational-cycles/  Generational Cycles] at so-called Millennials.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their defining characteristics were missionary and social crusades, "[[Muckraker|muckrake]]" [[journalism]], [[prohibitionism]], [[Labor rights|workers' rights]], [[trade union]]ism and [[universal suffrage|women's suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://socalledmillennial.com/generational-cycles/ Generational Cycles].&lt;/ref&gt; In midlife, they developed [[Prohibition in the United States]], [[immigration control]], and organized [[Vice#Vice squad|vice squads]].

Because the [[Lost Generation]] were so decimated by [[World War I]], the leadership of the Missionary Generation lasted longer than previous generations and in the 1930s and 1940s, their elite became the "Wise Old Men" who enacted a "[[New Deal]]", [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], led the global war against [[fascism]], and reaffirmed America's highest ideals during a transformative era in world history.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

This generation is fully ancestral, with the last known member of the Missionary Generation, the American [[Sarah Knauss]], having died on December 30, 1999 at 119 years of age.

Sociologist [[Naomi Schaefer Riley]] believes that a new "Missionary Generation" is forming in the children of the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Jacobsen, Rhonda Jacobsen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BlrD54cE_1wC&amp;pg=PT111&amp;lpg=PT111&amp;dq=missionary+generation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mHLEgXrFhW&amp;sig=ZTiQgKRLue_R_u2TI0h3QmzCRvk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Sr0cVK7gCpfY8gXr_oDABw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=missionary%20generation&amp;f=false  The American University in a Postsecular Age] ([[Oxford University Press]], 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''narrative environment''' is a space, whether physical or [[Virtuality|virtual]], in which stories can unfold.  A virtual [[narrative]] environment might be the narrative framework in which game play can proceed. A physical narrative environment might be an exhibition area within a museum, or a foyer of a retail space, or the public spaces around a building - anywhere in short where stories can be told in space. It is also a term coined by the [[Central Saint Martin's College of Art and Design]] program in Narrative Whitby{{what?|date=January 2014}}, where the first Narrative Environment course was introduced in 2003. It is a full-time, 2 year Masters level course leading to an MA degree in Creative Practice for Narrative Environments.

Amongst the vast range of works and projects he undertook, Schaeffer is most widely and currently recognized for his accomplishments in [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[experimental music]],&lt;ref name="Schaeffer7" /&gt; at the core of which stands his role as the chief developer of a unique and early [[genre (music)|form]] of [[avant-garde music]] known as [[musique concrète]].&lt;ref name="Schaeffer1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pierre Schaeffer |work=Snyder, Jeff 2007: CsUNIX1/Lebanon Valley College: ¶1, 3 |url=http://csunix1.lvc.edu/~snyder/em/schaef.html |accessdate=3 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515172405/http://csunix1.lvc.edu/~snyder/em/schaef.html |archivedate=15 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre emerged in Europe from the utilization of new [[music technology]] developed in the post-[[Nazi Germany]] era, following the advance of [[electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] and acousmatic music.

Schaeffer's writings (which include written and radio-narrated essays, biographies, short novels, a number of musical [[treatises]] and several plays)&lt;ref name="Schaeffer2"&gt;{{cite web | title= Pierre Schaeffer | work= Encyclopædia Britannica: ¶2 | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/526992/Pierre-Schaeffer | accessdate=4 December 2008}} "Schaeffer taught electronic composition at the Paris Conservatory from 1968 until 1980. His writings include novels, short stories, and essays, as well as theoretical works in music, such as À la recherche d'une musique concrète (1952; 'In Search of a Concrete Music"'), Traité des objets musicaux (1966; 'Treatise on Musical Objects'), and the two-volume Machines à communiquer (1970–72; 'Machines for Communicating')."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaeffer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaeffer6"&gt;{{cite web | title= Les écrits de Pierre Schaeffer | work= Couprie, Pierre &amp; OLATS 2000 | url=http://www.olats.org/pionniers/pp/schaeffer/oeuvreSchaeffer.php | accessdate= 12 May 2009|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; are often oriented towards his development of the genre, as well as the [[music theory|theoretics]] and [[philosophy of music]] in general.&lt;ref name="Schaeffer3" /&gt;

Today, Schaeffer is considered one of the most influential experimental, electroacoustic and subsequently [[electronic musician]]s, having been the first composer to utilize a number of contemporary [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]] and [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] techniques that are now used worldwide by nearly all record production companies.&lt;ref name="Schaeffer7"&gt;{{cite web | title= Pierre Schaeffer &amp; Pierre Henry: Pioneers in Sampling | work= ''Unknown author'' (reproduction via Diliberto, John 2005: Electronic Musician) 1986: Electronic Musician | url= http://emusician.com/em_spotlight/Pioneers_Sampling/ | accessdate= 30 September 2009 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091207081234/http://emusician.com/em_spotlight/Pioneers_Sampling/ | archivedate= 7 December 2009 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His collaborative endeavors are considered milestones in the histories of [[Electronic music#History|electronic]] and [[Experimental music#History|experimental]] music.

== Life ==

=== Early life and education ===

Schaeffer was born in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in 1910.&lt;ref name="Schaeffer1"/&gt; His parents were both musicians (his father a violinist; his mother, a singer),&lt;ref name="Schaeffer3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Musique Concrète Revisited |work=Palombini, Carlos 1999: The Electronic Musicological Review: |url=http://www.rem.ufpr.br/REMv4/vol4/arti-palombini.htm |accessdate=5 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023035425/http://www.rem.ufpr.br/REMv4/vol4/arti-palombini.htm |archivedate=23 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at first it seemed that Pierre would also take on music as a career. However his parents discouraged his musical pursuits from childhood and had him educated in engineering.&lt;ref name="Schaeffer7"/&gt; He studied at several universities in this inclination, the first of which was [[Lycée Saint-Sigisbert]] located in his hometown of Nancy. Afterwards he moved westwards in 1929 to the [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris&lt;ref name="Schaeffer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaeffer4"&gt;{{cite web | title= Pierre Schaeffer: Profile on Discogs.com | work= Anonymous/Various, submitted 2003: Discogs.com | url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Pierre+Schaeffer | accessdate=4 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaeffer8"/&gt; and finally completed his education in the capital at the [[École supérieure d'électricité]], in 1934.&lt;ref name="Schaeffer8"&gt;{{cite web | title= Pierre Schaeffer Biographie | work= Couprie, Pierre &amp; OLATS 2000 | url= http://www.olats.org/pionniers/pp/schaeffer/biographieSchaeffer.php | accessdate= 6 December 2009|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schaeffer received a diploma in radio broadcasting from the École Polytechnique.&lt;ref name="Schaeffer10"/&gt; He may have also received a similar qualification from the [[École nationale supérieure des télécommunications]], although it is not verifiable as to whether or not he ever actually attended this university.&lt;ref name="Schaeffer10"&gt;{{cite web | title= Excerpt from ''Electronic Music, 1948–1953'' | work= Cross, Lowell [unverifiable date]: ''Forum: Electronic Music and Computer Research'' | url= http://www.arts.rpi.edu/rolnick/classes/computermusic/Cross%20Article.pdf | accessdate= 17 December 2009 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717095536/https://www.arts.rpi.edu/rolnick/classes/computermusic/Cross%20Article.pdf | archivedate= 17 July 2011 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First experimentations and work in broadcasting and engineering; marriage and fatherhood ===

Later in 1934 Schaeffer entered his first employment as an engineer, briefly working in [[telecommunications]] in [[Strasbourg]].&lt;ref name="Schaeffer8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaeffer5"&gt;{{cite book | title= Excerpt from ''Music of the Twentieth-century Avant-garde'' | work= Jonathan D. Kramer, spec. Martial Robert 2002: Google Books: pp. 432 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-M_jhnOuboC&amp;pg=PA432 | accessdate=26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 he began a relationship with a woman named Elisabeth Schmitt, and later in the year married her and with her had his first child, Marie-Claire Schaeffer.&lt;ref name="Schaeffer8"/&gt; He and his new family then officially relocated to Paris where he joined the Radiodiffusion Française (now called [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française]]; French for "French Radio and Television Broadcasting") in 1936 and began his work in radio broadcasting and presentation.&lt;ref name="Schaeffer4"/&gt; It was there that he began to move away from his initial interests in telecommunications and to pursue music instead, combining his abilities as an engineer with his passion for sound. In his work at the station, Schaeffer experimented with records and an assortment of other devices—the sounds they made and the applications of those sounds—after convincing the radio station's management to allow him to use their equipment. This period of experimentation was significant for Schaeffer's development, bringing forward many fundamental questions he had on the limits of modern [[musical expression]].&lt;ref name="Schaeffer4"/&gt;

[[Image:Psconcer.jpg|thumb|right|Schaeffer presenting the Acousmonium.]]

In these experiments, Pierre tried playing sounds backwards, slowing them down, speeding them up and juxtaposing them with other sounds,&lt;ref name="Schaeffer9"/&gt; all techniques which were virtually unknown at that time.&lt;ref name="Schaeffer4"/&gt; He had begun working with new contemporaries whom he had met through RTF, and as such his experimentation deepened. Schaeffer's work gradually became more [[avant-garde]], as he challenged traditional musical style with the use of various devices and practices. A unique variety of electronic instruments—ones which Schaeffer and his colleagues created, using their own engineering skills—came into play in his work, like the [[chromatic phonogene|chromatic, sliding and universal phonogenes]], [[Francois Bayle]]'s [[Acousmonium]] and a host of other devices such as [[gramaphones]] and some of the earliest [[tape recorders]].&lt;ref name="Schaeffer9"&gt;{{cite web |title=''A-Z of Instruments – Other'' |work=The Foundry Creative Media Company Ltd. 2005: sec. 2 |url=http://www.foundry.co.uk/musicfirebox/a-zofinstrumentb.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030422021238/http://www.foundry.co.uk/musicfirebox/a-zofinstrumentb.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 April 2003 |accessdate=7 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }} "Musique concrète was an experimental technique that combined pre-recorded sounds  natural as well as musical  to make musical compositions. Using only the earliest tape recorders, sounds were edited, played backwards and speeded up and down to create fascinating 'sound-scapes'. Pierre Henry was a prolific composer of musique concrète and collaborated with Schaeffer on many compositions. Luciano Berio and Steve Reich are also key figures in musique concrète composition. Karlheinz Stockhausen combined electronic and concrète sounds to become a leader of avant-garde music making."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beginnings of writing career ===

In 1938 Schaeffer began his career as a writer, penning various articles and essays for the ''Revue Musicale'', a French journal of music. His first column, ''Basic Truths'', provided a critical examination of musical aspects of the time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A known ardent [[Catholic]], Schaeffer began to write minor religiously-based pieces, and in the same year as his ''Basic Truths'' he published his first novel: ''Chlothar Nicole'' — a short [[Christian novel]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Club d'essai and the origin of musique concrète ===

With the rise of nuclear power after [[World War II]], Schaeffer became a notable activist in the [[anti-nuclear movement]], one of the main factors associated with his personal life other than his work in the field of music.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concrète ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
In 1949, Schaeffer met the percussionist-composer [[Pierre Henry]], with whom he collaborated on many different musical compositions, and in 1951, he founded the ''Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concrète'' (GRMC) in the French Radio Institution. This gave him a new studio, which included a [[tape recorder]]. This was a significant development for Schaeffer, who previously had to work with [[phonographs]] and [[Turntablism|turntables]] to produce music. Schaeffer is generally acknowledged as being the first composer to make music using [[magnetic tape]]. His continued experimentation led him to publish ''[[À la Recherche d'une Musique Concrète]]'' (French for "''In Search of a Concrete Music''") in 1952, which was a summation of his working methods up to that point. His only opera, ''Orphée 53'' ("''Orpheus 53''"), premiered in 1953.

Schaeffer left the GRMC in 1953 and reformed the group in 1958 as the ''Groupe de Recherche Musicale[s]'' (GRM) (at first without "s", then with "s"), where he briefly mentored the young [[Jean Michel Jarre]], among other students. His last "''etude''" (''study'') came in 1959: the "''Study of Objects''" (''Etudes aux Objets'').

In 1954 Schaeffer founded traditional music label [[Ocora]] ("Office de Coopération Radiophonique") alongside composer, pianist and musicologist [[Charles Duvelle]], with a worldwide coverage in order to preserve African rural soundscapes. Ocora also served as a facility to train technicians in African national broadcasting services. Today, it is still run by Duvelle.

In 1988, Schaeffer appeared in a [[New York Times]] article on the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]]. Schaeffer had led a 498-member rescue team in [[Leninakan]] to help find survivors in the aftermath of the quake.

=== Later life and death ===

Schaeffer became an [[associate professor]] at the [[Paris Conservatoire]] from 1968 to 1980 after creating a "class of fundamental music and application to the audiovisual."&lt;ref name="Schaeffer2"/&gt; He suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]] later in his life, and died from the condition in [[Aix-en-Provence]] in 1995.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} He was 85 years old. He is buried in Delincourt in the very nice and green Vexin region (55 minutes from Paris) where he used to have his countryside property.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Schaeffer was thereafter remembered by many of his colleagues with the title, "Musician of Sounds".{{Clarify|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--What is this supposed to mean?--&gt;

== Legacy ==

=== Musique concrète ===
{{Main|Musique concrète}}{{See also|Acousmatic music}}

[[Image:Steam Locomotive.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Schaeffer often created his "concrete music" with real-world sounds. The notable ''Railroad Study'' (French: "''[[Cinq études de bruits|Étude aux chemins de fer]]''"), for instance, featured recordings of the noises made by [[trains]] running along railroad tracks.]]

{{Rquote|right|Sound is the vocabulary of nature.|Pierre Schaeffer|}}

The term '''musique concrète''' (French for "'''real music'''", literally "'''concrete music'''"), was coined by Schaeffer in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', 985 pages, {{ISBN|0-19-861459-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schaeffer believed traditionally classical (or as he called it, "serious") music begins as an abstraction (musical notation) that is later produced as audible music. Musique concrète, by contrast, strives to start with the "concrete" sounds that emanate from base [[phenomena]] and then abstracts them into a composition. The term musique concrète is then, in essence, the breaking down of the structured production of traditional instruments, [[harmony]], rhythm, and even [[music theory]] itself, in an attempt to reconstruct music from the bottom up.

From the contemporary point of view, the importance of Schaeffer's musique concrète is threefold. He developed the concept of including any and all sounds into the vocabulary of music. At first he concentrated on working with sounds other than those produced by traditional musical instruments. Later on, he found it was possible to remove the familiarity of musical instrument sounds and abstract them further by techniques such as removing the attack of the recorded sound. He was among the first musicians to manipulate recorded sound for the purpose of using it in conjunction with other sounds in order to compose a musical piece. Techniques such as [[tape looping]] and tape splicing were used in his research, often comparing to [[sound collage]]. The advent of Schaeffer's manipulation of recorded sound became possible only with technologies that were developed after World War II had ended in Europe. His work is recognized today as an essential precursor to contemporary sampling practices. Schaeffer was among the first to use recording technology in a creative and specifically musical way, harnessing the power of [[electronic musical instrument|electronic]] and [[experimental musical instrument|experimental]] instruments in a manner similar to [[Luigi Russolo]], whom he admired and from whose work he drew inspiration.

Furthermore, he emphasized the importance of "playing" (in his terms, ''jeu'') in the creation of music. Schaeffer's idea of ''jeu'' comes from the French verb ''jouer'', which carries the same double meaning as the English verb [[play (activity)|play]]: 'to enjoy oneself by interacting with one's surroundings', as well as 'to operate a musical instrument'. This notion is at the core of the concept of musique concrète, and reflects on [[free improvisation|freely improvised sound]], or perhaps more specifically [[electroacoustic improvisation]], from the standpoint of Schaeffer's work and research.

=== Influences on music ===
Pierre's aforementioned student in GRM, [[Jean Michel Jarre]], went on to great international success in his own musical career. Jarre's 1997 album, [[Oxygene 7-13]], is dedicated to Schaeffer. [[Pierre Henry]] also made a tribute to the man, composing his ''Écho d'Orphée, Pour P. Schaeffer'' alongside him for Schaeffer's last work and second compilation, ''L'Œuvre Musicale''. His other notable pupils include [[Joanna Bruzdowicz]], [[Bernard Parmegiani]], [[Micheline Coulombe Saint-Marcoux]], [[Armando Santiago]], [[Elzbieta Sikora]].

Many [[rap]] albums, such as ''[[It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back]]'' by [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] and ''[[3 Feet High And Rising]]'' by [[De La Soul]] take ordinary sounds and use them to create a finished product.&lt;ref&gt;''The Effects of Musique Concrete'' at ''Musique Concrete'' – ''History and Figures'' {{cite web |url=http://wise.fau.edu/~hieronym/EMMusiqueConcrete.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618093101/http://wise.fau.edu/~hieronym/EMMusiqueConcrete.htm |archivedate=18 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pierre Schaeffer moved away from the musical universe in the 1980s, after criticizing the avant-garde of the 1950s that sought to break with tradition. He spoke on this point with the pianist Otavio Henrique Soares Brandão who, under his direction, conducted a reading of his book Treatise on Musical Objects. This reading aims at the creation of an innovative instrumental technique that does not break with tradition (1).
Pierre Schaeffer has written three texts on this subject:

=== Other ===
Today, in his honor, the [[Qwartz Electronic Music Awards]] has named several of its past events after Schaeffer. Pierre himself was a prize winner at the awards more than once.

== Works ==

=== Music ===
All of Schaeffer's musical compositions (''concrète'' or otherwise) were recorded before the advent of the CD, either on [[cassette tape|cassettes]] or a more archaic form of [[magnetic tape]] (therefore the term "[[discography]]" cannot be appropriately used here; rather his music in general). [[Mass-production]] for his work was limited at best, and each piece was, by Schaeffer's terms, intended to be released foremost as an exposé to the masses of what he believed was a new and somewhat revolutionizing form of music. The original production of his marketed work was done by the "''Groupe de Recherches Musicales''" (a.k.a. GRM; now owned and operated by INA or the ''[[Institut national de l'audiovisuel]]''), the company which he initially had formed around his creations. Other music was broadcast live (Pierre himself being notable on French radio at the time) and/or done in live "concert". Some individual tracks even found their way into the use of other artists, with Pierre's work being fronted in mime performances and [[ballets]]. Now after his death, various musical production companies, such as ''[[Disques Adès]]'' and ''[[Phonurgia Nova]]'' have been given rights to distribute his work.

Below is a list of Schaeffer's musical works, showing his compositions and the year(s) they were recorded.

=== Broadcast narratives ===
Apart from his published and publicized music, Schaeffer conducted several musical (and specifically musique concrète-related) presentations via French radio. Although these broadcasts contained musical pieces by Schaeffer they cannot be adequately described as part of his main line of musical output. This is because the radio "''essays''", as they were appropriately named, were mainly narration on Schaeffer's musical theories philosophies rather than compositions in and of themselves.

Schaeffer's radio narratives include the following:
* ''The Shell Filled With Planets'' (1944)
* ''Cantata to Alsace'' (1945)
* ''An Hour of the World'' (1946)
* ''From Claudel to Brangues'' (1953)
* ''Ten Years of Radiophonic Experiments from the 'Studio' to the 'Club' d'Essai: 1942–1952'' (1955)

A '''pitch''' is a concise verbal (and sometimes visual) presentation of an idea for a [[film]] or TV series generally made by a [[screenwriter]] or [[film director]] to a [[film producer]] or [[studio executive]] in the hope of attracting [[development (film)|development]] finance to pay for the writing of  a [[screenplay]].&lt;ref name="p58"/&gt;

"Pitch" is a contraction of the phrase "[[sales pitch]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karg, Van Over, Sutherland, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; A pitch is used throughout different stages of production, such as casting and distribution, as well as to urge film producers to further fund a project.&lt;ref name="p58"&gt;Steiff, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Filmmakers who devise a pitch tend to manufacture a production package, which is handed out to each potential investor during the pitch. The package contains the basic information for the filmmaker's project, such as a plot synopsis and budgeting values.&lt;ref&gt;Karg, Van Over, Sutherland, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, filmmakers will produce an independent [[pitch trailer]] as a part of the package to help potential financiers better visualize the project and the filmmaker's vision.

Though pitches are usually made on the basis of a full [[Script (recorded media)|script]] or [[teleplay]], [[animated cartoon|animated]] productions for both film and television are often pitched on the basis of [[storyboard]]s alone. For example, the animated television show ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' was pitched from a storyboard. Co-founders of the project, [[Dan Povenmire]] and [[Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]], needed to convince overseas executives for [[The Walt Disney Company]] to [[greenlight]] the series, so they drew a storyboard and recorded it as a reel. They then mixed it and dubbed it over with sound effects, voices, and narrative, then sent the recording to the executives, who accepted it.&lt;ref name="OP"&gt;{{cite video|title="Original Pitch" featurette, from Volume 1: "The Fast and the Phineas"|medium=DVD|date=2008|people=Povenmire, Dan|publisher=[[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television pitches can also be devised by the network or company that produces the program.&lt;ref name="raise"/&gt; Certain networks are pitched the idea of including a character in a series in order to boost ratings. Such pitches have been used with "Oliver" in ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' and "Luke" on ''[[Growing Pains]]''.&lt;ref name="Alberti, p. 144"&gt;Alberti, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Networks also try to force their ideas on series' producers through their pitches, though their approach is business-oriented and their ideas are generally not favored by writers and viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Alberti, pp. 145&amp;ndash;147&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the crew of the animated series ''[[Rugrats]]'' was approached by [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], which pitched the idea of a ''Rugrats'' [[Hanukkah]] special. [[Paul Germain]], co-creator of the series, responded by suggesting a [[passover]] special, which he dubbed a "funny idea."&lt;ref name="raise"&gt;{{cite news|title=How raising the Rugrats children became as difficult as the real thing|author=Swartz, Mimi|date=1998-10-30|publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]''|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; After they closed production for [[A Rugrats Passover|that special]], they began considering the Hanukkah special and eventually created it in 1996 as the episode "[[A Rugrats Chanukah]]."&lt;ref name="raise"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rites of Chanukah reach many|author=Ribadeneira, Diego|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|location=[[Boston, Massachusetts]]|date=1996-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''For current events, see [[Portal:Current events]]''

The term "'''present-day'''" (as an adjective) or "'''present day'''" (as a noun) is used to describe the approximate period of [[time]] that surrounds the [[present]]. Depending on the context, this period may be as narrow as referring to the immediate moment, or as broad as referring to the current [[year]] or [[decade]]. In general the term is used to refer to the [[wiktionary:contemporary|contemporary]] [[era]] at the time it is used.

== Media ==
When used in [[fiction|fictional]] or [[non-fiction|non-fictional]] media such as [[book|books]], [[film]], or [[television]], the term "present-day" is typically used to identify the time-period in which the depicted events are taking place, in one of the following ways:
#The events depicted take place at the literal time that the media is being viewed or read; in this case, the period referred to is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and depends upon when the media is experienced;
#The events depicted take place at the exact date in history when the media was published;
#The events depicted take place during the [[era]] during which the media was published, where the era may be identified in a way relevant to the rest of the elements in the media.{{vague|date=February 2015}}

Setting a fictional work in the "present-day" can have many intended effects on viewers or readers. In many cases it is a [[plot device]] used to engage the audience more quickly as the events are happening in a context that they can understand. In some cases, the intention is that portrayed events are to be understood as ''genuinely happening'' "right now"; the audience is meant to deliberately play into this [[suspension of disbelief]]. Many popular [[soap opera]]s are set in the present day, such as the [[England|English]] [[television series]] ''[[EastEnders]]''. Other more fanciful productions are also set in the present day to maintain intrigue in an audience, such as [[Stargate]] or [[X-Men]].

The use of the term "present-day" can also detract from media as, in the case of movies and books, it directly reveals the age of the media. For example, the movie, [[The Terminator]], has a title card near the beginning labelling it as taking place in the present day, even though the events are shown to occur in 1984 which was true to the initial release of the movie. This can have the effect of making the movie or book a lot less believable because it is labelled as the present day but the technologies and modern culture in the media effectively display the past and not the present, nullifying the effectiveness of the term 'present day'.

==Concept and etymology==
{{See also|Religio}}
''Religion'' (from O.Fr. ''religion'' religious community, from L. ''religionem'' (nom. ''religio'') "respect for what is sacred, reverence for the gods, sense of right, moral obligation, sanctity",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; "obligation, the bond between man and the gods"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;) is derived from the Latin ''[[Religio|religiō]]'', the ultimate origins of which are obscure. One possible interpretation traced to [[Cicero]], connects ''{{lang|la|lego}}'' read, i.e. ''re'' (again) with ''lego'' in the sense of choose, go over again or consider carefully. The definition of ''religio'' by [[Cicero]] is ''cultum deorum'', "the proper performance of rites in veneration of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De natura deorum'' II, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Julius Caesar used ''religio'' to mean "obligation of an oath" when discussing captured soldiers making an oath to their captors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Caesar |first1=Julius |last2=Translated by |first2=W.A. McDevitte and W.S. Bohn |title=The Works of Julius Caesar: Parallel English and Latin |date=2007 |publisher=Forgotten Books |isbn=9781605063553 |pages=377–378 |chapter=Civil Wars – Book 1|quote= Sic terror oblatus a ducibus, crudelitas in supplicio, nova religio iurisiurandi spem praesentis deditionis sustulit mentesque militum convertit et rem ad pristinam belli rationem redegit." – (Latin); "Thus the terror raised by the generals, the cruelty and punishments, the new obligation of an oath, removed all hopes of surrender for the present, changed the soldiers' minds, and reduced matters to the former state of war."- (English)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder, used the term ''religio'' on elephants in that they venerate the sun and the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Pliny the Elder |title=The Natural History |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D1 |publisher=Perseus – Tufts University |language=Book 8 Chapter 1|quote= maximum est elephans proximumque humanis sensibus, quippe intellectus illis sermonis patrii et imperiorum obedientia, officiorum quae didicere memoria, amoris et gloriae voluptas, immo vero, quae etiam in homine rara, probitas, prudentia, aequitas, religio quoque siderum solisque ac lunae veneratio." – (Latin); "The elephant is the largest of them all, and in intelligence approaches the nearest to man. It understands the language of its country, it obeys commands, and it remembers all the duties which it has been taught. It is sensible alike of the pleasures of love and glory, and, to a degree that is rare among men even, possesses notions of honesty, prudence, and equity; it has a religious respect also for the stars, and a veneration for the sun and the moon." – (English)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars such as [[Tom Harpur]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] favor the derivation from ''{{lang|la|ligare}}'' bind, connect, probably from a prefixed ''{{lang|la|re-ligare}}'', i.e. ''re'' (again) + ''ligare'' or to reconnect, which was made prominent by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], following the interpretation given by [[Lactantius]] in ''Divinae institutiones'', IV, 28.&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Pagan Christ: Recovering the Lost Light.'' Toronto. Thomas Allen, 2004. {{ISBN|0-88762-145-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[The Power of Myth]],'' with Bill Moyers, ed. Betty Sue Flowers, New York, Anchor Books, 1991. {{ISBN|0-385-41886-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval usage alternates with ''order'' in designating bonded communities like those of [[monastic orders]]: "we hear of the 'religion' of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]], of a knight 'of the [[Order of Aviz|religion of Avys]]'".&lt;ref name="Huizinga Middle"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huizinga |first1=Johan |title=The Waning of the Middle Ages |date=1924 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=86|title-link=The Autumn of the Middle Ages }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin root ''religio'' was understood as an individual virtue of worship in mundane contexts; never as doctrine, practice, or actual source of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Jon|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=MIchael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature: From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226317830|page=254|chapter=10. Science and Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, ''religio'' referred to broad social obligations towards anything including family, neighbors, rulers, and even towards God.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; ''Religio'' was most often used by the ancient Romans not in the context of a relation towards gods, but as a range of general emotions such as hesitation, caution, anxiety, fear; feelings of being bound, restricted, inhibited; which arose from heightened attention in any mundane context.&lt;ref name="religio roman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Carlin |last2=Boyarin |first2=Daniel |title=Imagine No Religion : How Modern Abstractions Hide Ancient Realities |date=2016 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=9780823271207 |chapter=1. 'Religio' without “Religion” |pages=15–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also closely related to other terms like ''scrupulus'' which meant "very precisely" and some Roman authors related the term ''supertitio'', which meant too much fear or anxiety or shame, to ''religio'' at times.&lt;ref name="religio roman" /&gt; When ''religio'' came into English around the 1200s as religion, it took the meaning of "life bound by monastic vows" or monastic orders.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huizinga Middle" /&gt; The compartmentalized concept of religion, where religious things were separated from worldly things, was not used before the 1500s.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; The concept of religion was first used in the 1500s to distinguish the domain of the church and the domain of civil authorities.&lt;ref name="50 great"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths about Religions|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=12–17|chapter=Myth 1: All Societies Have Religions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient Greece, the Greek term ''threskeia'' was loosely translated into Latin as ''religio'' in late antiquity. The term was sparsely used in classical Greece but became more frequently used in the writings of Josephus in the first century CE. It was used in mundane contexts and could mean multiple things from respectful fear to excessive or harmfully distracting practices of others; to cultic practices. It was often contrasted with the Greek word ''deisidaimonia'' which meant too much fear.&lt;ref name="threskeia greece"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Carlin |last2=Boyarin |first2=Daniel |title=Imagine No Religion : How Modern Abstractions Hide Ancient Realities |date=2016 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=9780823271207 |chapter=8. Imagine No 'Threskeia': The Task of the Untranslator  |pages=123–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern concept of religion, as an abstraction that entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines, is a recent invention in the English language since such usage began with texts from the 17th century due to the splitting of Christendom during the Protestant Reformation and globalization in the age of exploration which involved contact with numerous foreign cultures with non-European languages.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226184487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion enlightenment"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title='Religion' and the Religions in the English Enlightenment|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521892933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt;
Some argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply the term religion to non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;{{cite book|first1=Daniel|last1=Dubuisson|title=The Western Construction of Religion : Myths, Knowledge, and Ideology|date=2007|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=978-0801887567}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt; Others argue that using religion on non-western cultures distorts what people do and believe.&lt;ref name="Smith Meaning and End"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Wilfred Cantwell |title=The Meaning and End of Religion|date=1991|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0800624750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of religion was formed in the 16th and 17th centuries,&lt;ref name=Nongbri1&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept|page=152 |quote=Although the Greeks, Romans, Mesopotamians, and many other peoples have long histories, the stories of their respective religions are of recent pedigree.

Race, Nation, or Religion?''

Jewish ideologies of Peace and Peacemaking|pages=86-87|quote=Yet despite its ingrained theological tradition, one must acknowledge that the Jewish people did not begin to think of Judaism as a religion until fairly recently. To be clear, the contemporary religious category popularly known as Judaism can be traced back to an ancient Jewish culture traditionally entailing certain fixed ideas about God. That culture also involved unique rites and behaviors related to the worship of God later to be construed as key elements of the Jewish faith. But these cultural effects did not constitute a religion in the formal sense of the word (Nongbri 2013, 46-50). They entailed no compulsory system of belief or regulatory ritual program by which to measure one's Jewish identity. To be a Jew was primarily a matter of national or ethnic identification, a function of being born into a family of Jewish descent or choosing to disavow one's own ancestral culture to become a Jew. By and large, it was not a matter of confession or creed (Satlow 2006, 1-19). It was not until the nineteenth century that Jewish thinkers began to conceive of their ancestral culture in systematized religious terms. Seeking entry into a European civil society dominated by Christian values, many Jews touched by the liberal values of the European Enlightenment undertook to interpret their Judaism in terms analogous to Christianity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 1st century CE, Josephus had used the Greek term ''ioudaismos'', which some translate as Judaism today, even though he used it as an ethnic term, not one linked to modern abstract concepts of religion as a set of beliefs.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; It was in the 19th century that Jews began to see their ancestral culture as a religion analogous to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Burns Jewish" /&gt; The Greek word ''threskeia'', which was used by Greek writers such as Herodotus and Josephus, is found in the New Testament. ''Threskeia'' is sometimes translated as religion in today's translations, however, the term was understood as worship well into the medieval period.&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300154160}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Quran, the Arabic word ''[[Din (Arabic)|din]]'' is often translated as religion in modern translations, but up to the mid-1600s translators expressed ''din'' as law.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; 

The [[Sanskrit]] word [[dharma]], sometimes translated as religion, also means law. Throughout classical [[South Asia]], the [[Dharmaśāstra|study of law]] consisted of concepts such as [[Prāyaścitta|penance through piety]] and [[Ācāra|ceremonial as well as practical traditions]].

In other words, the category itself is a colonialist imposition that cannot work with any accuracy for Indian folk in the final analysis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though traditions, sacred texts, and practices have existed throughout time, most cultures did not align with western conceptions of religion since they did not separate everyday life from the sacred. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Confucianism, and [[world religions]] first entered the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015|page=101 |quote=The first recorded use of "Boudhism" was 1801, followed by "Hindooism" (1829), "Taouism" (1838), and "Confucianism" (1862) (see figure 6).

This construction of "religions" was not merely the production of European translation terms, but the reification of systems of thought in a way strikingly divorced from their original cultural milieu. The original discovery of religions in different cultures was rooted in the assumption that each people had its own divine "revelation," or at least its own parallel to Christianity. In the same period, however, European and American explorers often suggested that specific African or Native American tribes lacked religion altogether.

The indigenous religions of the Americas and Africa were not represented.

But these diverse identities were united, each an integral part of life; no part existed in a separate sphere identified as "religious." Nor were the diverse traditions lumped together under the term "Hinduism" unified by sharing such common features of religion as a single founder, creed, theology, or institutional organization.}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Hindu" has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people indigenous to the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=brian111&gt;{{citation|last=Pennington|first=Brian K.|title=Was Hinduism Invented?: Britons, Indians, and the Colonial Construction of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7drluePK-acC&amp;pg=PA111|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803729-3|pages=111–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lloyd Ridgeon|title=Major World Religions: From Their Origins To The Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFKBAgAAQBAJ |year= 2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-42935-6|pages=10–11}}, Quote: "It is often said that Hinduism is very ancient, and in a sense this is true (...). It was formed by adding the English suffix -ism, of Greek origin, to the word ''Hindu'', of Persian origin; it was about the same time that the word ''Hindu'', without the suffix -ism, came to be used mainly as a religious term. (...) The name ''Hindu'' was first a geographical name, not a religious one, and it originated in the languages of Iran, not of India. (...) They referred to the non-Muslim majority, together with their culture, as 'Hindu'. (...) Since the people called Hindu differed from Muslims most notably in religion, the word came to have religious implications, and to denote a group of people who were identifiable by their Hindu religion.

According to the [[philologist]] [[Max Müller]] in the 19th century, the root of the English word religion, the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:religio|religio]]'', was originally used to mean only reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, [[pietas|piety]] (which [[Cicero]] further derived to mean diligence).&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], ''Natural Religion'', p. 33, 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2340976 Lewis &amp; Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Müller]] characterized many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure at this point in history. What is called ancient religion today, they would have only called law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]].

===Modern western===
Religion is  a [[modern era|modern]] [[Western culture|Western]] concept.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|first=Timothy|last=Fitzgerald|title=Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures; there is no equivalent term for religion in many languages.&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nongbri" /&gt; Scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition, with some giving up on the possibility of a definition.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM.  2002).

An increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=A.M. |date=2002 |title=Sociological definitions, language games, and the 'essence' of religion | journal=Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion | volume=14 | issue=1 | issn=0943-3058 | doi=10.1163/157006802760198776 | pages=61–83 |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf |access-date=20 July 2017| citeseerx=10.1.1.613.6995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe that the way we use the concept today is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the [[Peace of Westphalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wilfred Cantwell |date=1978 |title=The Meaning and End of Religion |location=New York |publisher=Harper and Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions states:
{{quote|The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=King |first=W.L. |date=2005 |article=Religion (First Edition) |editor-link=Mircea Eliade |editor-first=Mircea |editor-last=Eliade |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|MacMillan Reference US]] |edition=2nd |p=7692}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] defined religion as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1993|pp=87–125}}}}

Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that
{{quote|[…] we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.{{sfn|Geertz|1993|p=90}}}}

The theologian [[Antoine Vergote]] took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as
{{quote|[…] the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="vergote"&gt;Vergote, A. (1996) ''Religion, Belief and Unbelief. A Psychological Study'', Leuven University Press. (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peter Mandaville]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as
{{quote|[…] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is ''lived'' as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref name="Paul James and Peter Mandaville 2010" /&gt;

According to the MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
{{quote|[…] almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences […] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of religions, ''Religion'', p. 7695&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Classical===
[[File:Будажап Цыреторов.JPG|thumb|Budazhap Shiretorov (Будажап Цыреторов), the head shaman of the religious community Altan Serge (Алтан Сэргэ) in [[Buryatia]].]]
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] in the late 18th century defined religion as ''das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl'', commonly translated as "the feeling of absolute dependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0034412504007462|title='Feeling of absolute dependence' or 'absolute feeling of dependence'? A question revisited|journal=Religious Studies|volume=41|pages=81–94|year=2005|last1=Finlay|first1=Hueston E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. "Lectures on the origin and growth of religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] defined religion in 1871 as "the belief in spiritual beings".&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Tylor, E.B. (1871) ''[https://archive.org/stream/primitiveculture1tylouoft#page/424/mode/2up Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom. Vol. 1]''. London: John Murray; (p. 424).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or [[idolatry]] and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

In his book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', the psychologist [[William James]] defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine".{{sfn|James|1902|p=31}} By the term divine James meant "any object that is god''like'', whether it be a concrete deity or not"{{sfn|James|1902|p=34}} to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.{{sfn|James|1902|p=38}}

The sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], in his seminal book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=}} By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them". Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;That is how, according to Durkheim, Buddhism is a religion. "In default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the practices derived from them"{{harvnb|Durkheim|1915|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=37}} Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|pp=40–41}}

Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, [[Frederick Ferré]] who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively".&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Ferré, F. (1967) ''Basic modern philosophy of religion''. Scribner, (p. 82).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned",&lt;ref name="Tillich, P. 1957 p.1"/&gt; which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1959) ''Theology of Culture''. Oxford University Press; (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by [[Richard Dawkins]]) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Pecorino, P.A. (2001) [http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/pecorip/scccweb/etexts/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_10_DEFINITION/The-Definition-of-Religion.htm ''Philosophy of Religion.

==Aspects==

===Beliefs===
{{Main|Religious beliefs}}
Traditionally, [[faith]], in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs. The interplay between faith and reason, and their use as perceived support for religious beliefs, have been a subject of interest to philosophers and theologians.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

====Mythology====
{{Main|Mythology}}
The word ''myth'' has several meanings.
# A traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon;
# A person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence; or
# A metaphor for the spiritual potentiality in the human being.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''The Power of Myth'', p. 22 {{ISBN|0-385-24774-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, such as those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and [[Scandinavia]], are usually categorized under the heading of [[mythology]]. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or [[culture]]s in development, are similarly called myths in the [[anthropology of religion]]. The term myth can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. By defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real or true than one's own religious stories and beliefs. [[Joseph Campbell]] remarked, "Mythology is often thought of as ''other people's'' religions, and religion can be defined as mis-interpreted mythology."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor''. Ed. Eugene Kennedy. New World Library {{ISBN|1-57731-202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sociology, however, the term myth has a non-pejorative meaning. There, myth is defined as a story that is important for the group whether or not it is objectively or provably true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/myth|title=myth|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[resurrection]] of their real-life founder [[Jesus]], which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, is symbolic of the power of life over death, and is also said to be a historical event. But from a mythological outlook, whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant. Instead, the [[symbol]]ism of the death of an old life and the start of a new life is what is most significant. Religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic interpretations.

====Worldview====
Religions have [[sacred history|sacred histories]], [[narrative]]s, and  [[mythology|mythologies]] which may be preserved in sacred [[Religious text|scriptures]], and [[Religious symbol|symbols]] and [[holy places]], that aim to explain the [[meaning of life]], the [[creation myth|origin of life]], or the [[religious cosmology|Universe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Practices===
{{Main|Religious behaviour|Cult (religious practice)}}
The practices of a religion may include [[ritual]]s, [[sermon]]s, commemoration or veneration (of a [[deity]], [[God (male deity)|gods]], or [[goddess]]es), [[sacrifice]]s, [[festival]]s, [[Banquet|feasts]], [[trance]]s, [[initiation]]s, [[funeral|funerary services]], [[matrimony|matrimonial services]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], [[religious music]], [[religious art]], [[sacred dance]], [[Community service|public service]], or other aspects of human culture.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/mythology Oxford Dictionaries] mythology, retrieved 9 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social organisation===
Religions have a societal basis, either as a living tradition which is carried by lay participants, or with an organized [[clergy]], and a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership.

==Academic study==
{{Main|Religious studies|Classifications of religious movements}}
A number of disciplines study the phenomenon of religion: [[theology]], [[comparative religion]], [[history of religion]], [[evolutionary origin of religions]], [[anthropology of religion]], [[psychology of religion]] (including [[neurotheology|neuroscience of religion]] and [[evolutionary psychology of religion]]), [[law and religion]], and [[sociology of religion]].

Daniel L. Pals mentions eight classical theories of religion, focusing on various aspects of religion: [[animism]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], by [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]] and [[J.G. Frazer]]; the [[Psychoanalysis|psycho-analytic]] approach of [[Sigmund Freud]]; and further [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]], and [[Clifford Geertz]].{{sfn|Pals|2006}}

[[Michael Stausberg]] gives an overview of contemporary theories of religion, including [[Cognitive science of religion|cognitive]] and biological approaches.{{sfn|Stausberg|2009}}

===Theories===
{{Main|Theories of religion}}
[[Sociology of religion|Sociological]] and [[Anthropology of religion|anthropological]] theories of religion generally attempt to explain the [[origin of religion|origin]] and [[social function|function of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories define what they present as universal characteristics of [[religious belief]] and [[Religious behaviour|practice]].

====Origins and development====
[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Yazılıkaya]] sanctuary in [[Turkey]], with the twelve gods of the underworld]]
The origin of religion is uncertain. There are a number of theories regarding the subsequent origins of religious practices.

According to [[anthropologists]] John Monaghan and Peter Just, "Many of the great world religions appear to have begun as revitalization movements of some sort, as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more comprehensive answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs. Charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world. It seems that the key to long-term success – and many movements come and go with little long-term effect – has relatively little to do with the prophets, who appear with surprising regularity, but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to institutionalize the movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |edition= |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[development of religion]] has taken different forms in different cultures. Some religions place an emphasis on belief, while others emphasize practice. Some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual, while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important. Some religions claim to be universal, believing their [[law]]s and [[cosmology]] to be binding for everyone, while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group. In many places religion has been associated with public institutions such as [[education]], [[hospital]]s, the [[family]], [[government]], and [[politics|political]] hierarchies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |edition= |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists John Monoghan and Peter Just state that, "it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant, persistent, and intolerable. One important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Cultural system====
While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a "cultural system".&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973&lt;/ref&gt; A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category".&lt;ref&gt;Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Niebuhr's (1894–1962) five-fold classification of the relationship between Christ and culture, however, indicates that religion and culture can be seen as two separate systems, though not without some interplay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Niebuhr, ''Christ and Culture'' (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1951) as cited by Domenic Marbaniang, "The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social constructionism====
{{Main|Theories about religions#Social constructionism|l1=Social constructionism}}
One modern academic theory of religion, [[social constructionism]], says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice and [[worship]] follows a model similar to the [[Abrahamic religions]] as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings.&lt;ref name="vergote 89"&gt;Vergote, Antoine, ''Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study'', Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald,  Talal Asad, and Jason Ānanda Josephson. The social constructionists argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

====Cognitive science====
{{Main|Cognitive science of religion}}

Cognitive science of religion is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines, including: [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[cognitive anthropology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[neurobiology]], [[zoology]], and [[ethology]].  Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities.

Hallucinations and delusions related to religious content occurs in about 60% of people with [[schizophrenia]]. While this number varies across cultures, this had led to theories about a number of influential religious phenomenon and possible relation to psychotic disorders. A number of prophetic experiences are consistent with psychotic symptoms, although retrospective diagnoses are practically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=PT|title=Psychosis and paroxysmal visions in the lives of the founders of world religions.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=26|issue=1|date=2014|pages=E13–14|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.12120412|pmid=24515692}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=ED|last2=Cunningham|first2=MG|last3=Price|first3=BH|title=The role of psychotic disorders in religious history considered.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=24|issue=4|date=2012|pages=410–426|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214|pmid=23224447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=SR|last2=Pargament|first2=KI|title=The role of religion and spirituality in mental health.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=September 2014|volume=27|issue=5|pages=358–363|doi=10.1097/YCO.0000000000000080|pmid=25046080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schizophrenic episodes are also experienced by people who do not have belief in gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reina|first1=Aaron|title=Faith Within Atheism|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|date=July 2014|volume=40|issue=4|pages=719–720|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbt076|pmid=23760918|pmc=4059423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious content is also common in [[temporal lobe epilepsy]], and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Favazza|first1=A|editor1-last=Sadock|editor1-first=B|editor2-last=Sadock|editor2-first=V|editor3-last=Ruiz|editor3-first=P|title=Kaplan and Sadocks Comprehensive Texbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|edition=10th|chapter=Psychiatry and Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altschuler|first1=EL|title=Temporal lobe epilepsy in the preistly source of the Pentateuch|journal=South African Medical Journal|date=2004|volume=11|issue=94|page=870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheistic content is also found to be common with temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Heilman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heilman|first1=Kenneth M.|last2=Valenstein|first2=Edward |title=Clinical Neuropsychology|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780195384871|page=488|quote=Studies that claim to show no difference in emotional makeup between temporal lobe and other epileptic patients (Guerrant et. al., 1962; Stevens, 1966) have been reinterpreted (Blumer, 1975) to indicate that there is, in fact, a difference: those with temporal lobe epilepsy are more likely to have more serious forms of emotional disturbance. This typical personality of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer &amp; Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky &amp; Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events. This can be manifested as a tendency to take a cosmic view; hyperreligiosity (or intensely professed atheism) is said to be common.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparativism===
{{Main|Comparative religion}}
Comparative religion is the branch of the [[study of religions]] concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's religions. In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and the nature and form of [[salvation]]. Studying such material is meant to give one a richer and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the [[sacred]], [[numinous]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Divinity|divine]].&lt;ref&gt;"Human beings' relation to that which they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual, and divine" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (online, 2006), cited after {{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/religion/quotes.htm |title=Definitions of Religion |website=Religion facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; of the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] includes [[Middle Eastern religions]] (including [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Iranian religions]]), [[Indian religions]], [[East Asian religions]], African religions, American religions, Oceanic religions, and classical Hellenistic religions.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497215/classification-of-religions/38029/Normative Charles Joseph Adams, ''Classification of religions: geographical'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{Main||History of religions}}
[[File:Prevailing world religions map.png|thumb|upright=2.05|A map of [[List of religious populations|major denominations and religions of the world]]]]
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the academic practice of [[comparative religion]] divided religious belief into philosophically defined categories called world religions. Some academics [[Study of religion|studying the subject]] have divided religions into three broad categories:
# [[world religions]], a term which refers to [[Transculturation|transcultural]], [[international]] religions
# [[indigenous religions]], which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and
# [[new religious movements]], which refers to recently developed religions.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham (2000). ''Indigenous Religions: A Companion''. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies, and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy, or even calling a given practice religious, rather than cultural, political, or social in nature, is limited.&lt;ref name="pennington"&gt;Brian Kemble Pennington ''Was Hinduism Invented?'' New York: Oxford University Press US, 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-516655-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. McCutcheon. ''Critics Not Caretakers: Redescribing the Public Study of Religion''. Albany: SUNY Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lash. ''The beginning and the end of 'religion'.'' Cambridge University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-521-56635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current state of psychological study about the nature of religiousness suggests that it is better to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that should be distinguished from cultural norms (i.e. religions).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bulbulia. "Are There Any Religions? An Evolutionary Explanation." ''Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion'' 17.2 (2005), pp. 71–100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphological classification===
Some scholars classify religions as either ''[[Universalizing religion|universal religions]]'' that seek worldwide acceptance and actively look for new converts, or ''[[ethnic religion]]s'' that are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts.&lt;ref name="Hinnells"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Routledge companion to the study of religion |last=Hinnells |first=John R. |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33311-5 |pages=439–440 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IGspjXKxIf8C |accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others reject the distinction, pointing out that all religious practices, whatever their philosophical origin, are ethnic because they come from a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fitzgerald. ''The Ideology of Religious Studies''. New York: Oxford University Press US, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Prentiss. ''Religion and the Creation of Race and Ethnicity''. New York: NYU Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8147-6701-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomoko Masuzawa.

===Demographical classification===
{{Main|Major religious groups|List of religious populations}}
The five largest religious groups by world population, estimated to account for 5.8 billion people and 84% of the population, are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism (with the relative numbers for Buddhism and Hinduism dependent on the extent of [[syncretism]]) and traditional folk religion.

A global poll in 2012 surveyed 57 countries and reported that 59% of the world's population identified as religious, 23% as [[irreligion|not religious]], 13% as convinced [[atheism|atheists]], and also a 9% decrease in identification as religious when compared to the 2005 average from 39 countries.&lt;ref name="gia"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/Global_INDEX_of_Religiosity_and_Atheism_PR__6.pdf |title= Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism |publisher= WIN-Gallup International |date= 27 July 2012 |accessdate= 24 August 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120906165952/http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/Global_INDEX_of_Religiosity_and_Atheism_PR__6.pdf |archivedate= 6 September 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow up poll in 2015 found that 63% of the globe identified as religious, 22% as not religious, and 11% as convinced atheists.&lt;ref name=GallupInt2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Losing our Religion?

==Specific religions==
{{Mainarticle|List of religions and spiritual traditions}}

===Abrahamic===
[[File:Molnár Ábrahám kiköltözése 1850.jpg|upright|thumb|The patriarch [[Abraham]] (by [[József Molnár (painter)|József Molnár]])]]
[[Abrahamic religions]] are [[monotheistic]] religions which believe they descend from [[Abraham]].

====Judaism====
[[File:Open Torah and pointer.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Torah]] is the primary sacred text of Judaism.]]
[[Judaism]] is the oldest Abrahamic religion, originating in the people of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel and Judea]]. The [[Torah]] is its foundational text, and is part of the larger text known as the [[Tanakh]] or [[Hebrew Bible]]. It is supplemented by oral tradition, set down in written form in later texts such as the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]]. Judaism includes a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from [[Rabbinic Judaism]], which holds that God revealed his laws and [[613 Mitzvot|commandments]] to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in the form of both the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah]]; historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups. The [[Jewish people]] were scattered after the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE. Today there are about 13 million Jews, about 40 per cent living in Israel and 40 per cent in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/shnaton61/st02_27.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cbs.gov.il |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest [[Jewish religious movements]] are [[Orthodox Judaism]] ([[Haredi Judaism]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]), [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]].

====Christianity====
[[File:StJohnsAshfield StainedGlass GoodShepherd Portrait cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jesus]] is the central figure of Christianity.]]
[[Christianity]] is based on the life and teachings of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] (1st century) as presented in the [[New Testament]]. The Christian faith is essentially faith in Jesus as the [[Christ]], the [[Son of God]], and as [[Messiah|Savior]] and Lord. Almost all Christians believe in the [[Trinity]], which teaches the unity of [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]] (Jesus Christ), and [[Holy Spirit]] as three persons in [[monotheism|one Godhead]]. Most Christians can describe their faith with the [[Nicene Creed]]. As the religion of [[Byzantine Empire]] in the first millennium and of [[Western Europe]] during the time of colonization, Christianity has been propagated throughout the world. The main divisions of Christianity are, according to the number of adherents:
* The [[Catholic Church]], led by the [[Bishop of Rome]] and the bishops worldwide in communion with him, is a [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] of 24 Churches ''[[sui iuris]]'', including the [[Latin Church]] and 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic churches]], such as the [[Maronite]] Catholic Church.
* [[Eastern Christianity]], which include [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Church of the East]].
* [[Protestantism]], separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation]] and is split into thousands of [[Religious denomination|denominations]].  Major branches of Protestantism include [[Anglicanism]], [[Baptists]], [[Calvinism]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Methodism]], though each of these contain many different denominations or groups.

There are also smaller groups, including:
* [[Restorationism]], the belief that Christianity should be restored (as opposed to reformed) along the lines of what is known about the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic early church]].
* [[Latter Day Saint movement]], founded by [[Joseph Smith]] in the late 1820s.
* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], founded in the late 1870s by [[Charles Taze Russell]].

====Islam====
[[File:Kaaba mirror edit jj.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Muslim]]s [[Tawaf|circumambulating]] the [[Kaaba]], the most sacred site in [[Islam]]]]
[[Islam]] is based on the [[Quran]], one of the [[Islamic holy books|holy books]] considered by Muslims to be [[Wahy|revealed]] by [[God in Islam|God]], and on the [[Hadith|teachings (hadith)]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], a major political and religious figure of the 7th century CE. Islam is based on the unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] prophets of Judaism, Christianity and other Abrahamic religions before [[Muhammad]]. It is the most widely practiced religion of [[Southeast Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[Western Asia]], and [[Central Asia]], while Muslim-majority countries also exist in parts of [[South Asia]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[Southeast Europe]]. There are also several [[Islamic republic]]s, including [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Afghanistan]].
* [[Sunni Islam]] is the largest denomination within Islam and follows the Quran, the hadiths which record the [[sunnah]], whilst placing emphasis on the [[sahabah]].
* [[Shia Islam]] is the second largest denomination of Islam and its adherents believe that [[Ali]] succeeded Muhammad and further places emphasis on Muhammad's family.
* [[Ahmadiyya]] adherents believe that the awaited Imam [[Mahdi]] and the Promised Messiah has arrived, believed to be [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] by Ahmadis.
* There are also Muslim revivalist movements such as [[Muwahhidism]] and [[Salafism]].

Other denominations of Islam include [[Nation of Islam]], [[Ibadi]], [[Sufism]], [[Quranism]], [[Mahdavia]], and [[non-denominational Muslims]]. [[Wahhabism]] is the dominant Muslim [[Maddhab|schools of thought]] in the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].

====Other====
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] is an Abrahamic religion founded in 19th-century Iran and since then has spread worldwide. It teaches unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as additional prophets including its founder [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. One of its divisions is the [[Orthodox Bahá'í Faith]].

Smaller regional Abrahamic groups also exist, including [[Samaritanism]] (primarily in Israel and the West Bank), the [[Rastafari movement]] (primarily in Jamaica), and [[Druze]] (primarily in Syria and Lebanon).

===East Asian===
{{Main|East Asian religions}}
East Asian religions (also known as Far Eastern religions or Taoic religions) consist of several religions of East Asia which make use of the concept of Tao (in Chinese) or Dō (in Japanese or Korean). They include:

====Taoism and Confucianism====
* [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]], as well as Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese religion influenced by Chinese thought.

====Chinese folk religion====
* [[Chinese folk religion]]: the indigenous religions of the [[Han Chinese]], or, by [[metonymy]], of all the populations of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]]. It includes the syncretism of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]], [[Wuism]], as well as many new religious movements such as [[Chen Tao (True Way Cult)|Chen Tao]], [[Falun Gong]] and [[Yiguandao]].
* Other folk and new religions of [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] such as [[Korean shamanism]], [[Chondogyo]], and [[Jeung San Do]] in Korea; [[Shinto]], [[Shugendo]], [[Ryukyuan religion]], and [[Japanese new religions]] in Japan; [[Satsana Phi]] in Laos; [[Cao Đài]], [[Hòa Hảo]], and [[Vietnamese folk religion]] in Vietnam.

===Dharmic (Indian)===
[[File:Rama, Lakshman and Sita at the Kalaram Temple, Nashik..jpg|upright|thumb|[[Hindu]] statue of [[Lord Rama]] in Kalaram Temple ([[India]])]]
[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Dharmacakra Discourse.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Buddha]], in a [[Sanskrit]] manuscript, [[Nalanda|Nālandā]], Bihar, India]]
[[Indian religions]] are practiced or were founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. They are sometimes classified as the ''dharmic religions'', as they all feature [[dharma]], the specific law of reality and duties expected according to the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mittal |first=Sushil |title=Surprising Bedfellows: Hindus and Muslims in Medieval and Early Modern India |year=2003 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739106730 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
* [[Hinduism]] is preferentially self-designated by the term ''Vaidika Dharma''.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=Survey of Hinduism, A: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CVviRghVtIC|date=2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8011-3| page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[synecdoche]] describing the similar philosophies of [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], and [[Hindu denominations|related groups]] practiced or founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Concepts most of them share in common include [[karma]], [[caste]], [[reincarnation]], [[mantra]]s, [[yantra]]s, and [[darśana]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Hinduism is variously defined as a religion, set of religious beliefs and practices, religious tradition etc. For a discussion on the topic, see: "Establishing the boundaries" in Gavin Flood (2003), pp. 1–17. [[René Guénon]] in his'' [[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'' (1921 ed.), Sophia Perennis, {{ISBN|0-900588-74-8}}, proposes a definition of the term religion and a discussion of its relevance (or lack of) to Hindu doctrines (part II, chapter 4, p. 58).&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is one of the most ancient of still-active religions,&lt;ref&gt;p. 434 ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'' By Wendy Doniger, M. Webster, Merriam-Webster, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 219 ''Faith, Religion &amp; Theology'' By Brennan Hill, Paul F. Knitter, William Madges&lt;/ref&gt; with origins perhaps as far back as prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;p. 6 ''The World's Great Religions'' By Yoshiaki Gurney Omura, Selwyn Gurney Champion, Dorothy Short&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is not a monolithic religion but a religious category containing dozens of separate philosophies amalgamated as [[Sanātana Dharma]], which is the name by which Hinduism has been known throughout history by its followers.

====Jainism====
* [[Jainism]], taught primarily by [[Rishabhanatha]] (the founder of [[ahimsa]]) is an ancient Indian religion that prescribes a path of [[non-violence]], [[truth]] and [[anekantavada]] for all forms of living beings in this universe; which helps them to eliminate all the [[Karma in Jainism|Karmas]], and hence to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death ([[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving ([[Moksha (Jainism)|nirvana]]). Jains are found mostly in India. According to Dundas, outside of the Jain tradition, historians date the [[Mahavira]] as about contemporaneous with the [[Buddha]] in the 5th-century BCE, and accordingly the historical [[Parshvanatha]], based on the c. 250-year gap, is placed in 8th or 7th century BCE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30–31}}
** [[Digambara]] Jainism (or sky-clad) is mainly practiced in South India. Their holy books are [[Pravachanasara]] and [[Samayasara]] written by their Prophets  [[Kundakunda]] and [[Amritchandra]] as their [[Jain Agamas (Digambara)|original cannon]] is lost.
** [[Shwetambara]] Jainism (or white-clad) is mainly practiced in Western India. Their holy books are [[Jain Agamas]], written by their Prophet [[Sthulibhadra]].

====Buddhism====
* [[Buddhism]] was founded by [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]] in the 6th century BCE. Buddhists generally agree that Gotama aimed to help [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] end their [[dukkha|suffering (dukkha)]] by understanding the [[dharma|true nature of phenomena]], thereby escaping the cycle of suffering and rebirth ([[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]].
** [[Theravada]] Buddhism, which is practiced mainly in [[Sri Lanka]] and Southeast Asia alongside folk religion, shares some characteristics of Indian religions. It is based in a large collection of texts called the [[Pali Canon]].
** [[Mahayana]] Buddhism (or the Great Vehicle) under which are a multitude of doctrines that became prominent [[Buddhism in China|in China]] and are still relevant [[Buddhism in Vietnam|in Vietnam]], [[Buddhism in Korea|Korea]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Japan]] and to a lesser extent [[Buddhism in the West|in Europe and the United States]]. Mahayana Buddhism includes such disparate teachings as [[Zen]], [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]], and [[Soka Gakkai]].
** [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism first appeared in India in the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony (2000), Buddhist Thought: A complete introduction to the Indian tradition, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-203-18593-5}} p=194&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently most prominent in the Himalaya regions&lt;ref&gt;Smith, E.

The principal beliefs of Sikhi are faith in ''[[Waheguru]]''—represented by the phrase ''[[ik Onkar|ik ōaṅkār]]'', meaning one God, who prevails in everything, along with a [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in which the Sikh is enjoined to engage in social reform through the pursuit of justice for all human beings.

===Indigenous and folk===
[[File:Chinese temple incence burner.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Incense]] burner in China]]

[[Iranian religions]] are ancient religions whose roots predate the [[Islamization]] of [[Greater Iran]]. Nowadays these religions are practiced only by minorities.

[[Zoroastrianism]] is based on the teachings of prophet [[Zoroaster]] in the 6th century BCE. Zoroastrians worship the [[Creator deity|creator]] [[Ahura Mazda]]. In Zoroastrianism good and evil have distinct sources, with evil trying to destroy the creation of Mazda, and good trying to sustain it.

[[Mandaeism]] is a [[monotheistic]] religion with a strongly [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] worldview. Mandaeans are sometime labeled as the Last [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]].

===New religious movements===
{{Main|New religious movement}}
*  [[Japanese new religions|Shinshūkyō]] is a general category for a wide variety of religious movements founded in Japan since the 19th century. These movements share almost nothing in common except the place of their founding. The largest religious movements centered in Japan include [[Soka Gakkai]], [[Tenrikyo]], and [[Seicho-No-Ie]] among hundreds of smaller groups.
* [[Cao Đài]] is a syncretistic, monotheistic religion, established in [[Vietnam]] in 1926.

* [[Unitarian Universalism]] is a religion characterized by support for a free and responsible search for truth and meaning, and has no accepted [[creed]] or [[theology]].
* [[Noahidism]] is a monotheistic ideology based on the Seven Laws of Noah, and on their traditional interpretations within Rabbinic Judaism.
* [[Scientology]] teaches that people are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature. Its method of spiritual rehabilitation is a type of counseling known as [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]], in which practitioners aim to consciously re-experience and understand painful or traumatic events and decisions in their past in order to free themselves of their limiting effects.
* [[Eckankar]] is a pantheistic religion with the purpose of making God an everyday reality in one's life.
* [[Wicca]] is a neo-pagan religion first popularised in 1954 by British civil servant [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], involving the worship of a God and Goddess.
* [[Neo-Druidism|Druidry]] is a religion promoting harmony with nature, and drawing on the practices of the druids.

* [[Satanism]] is a broad category of religions that, for example, worship Satan as a deity ([[Theistic Satanism]]) or use Satan as a symbol of carnality and earthly values ([[LaVeyan Satanism]]).

[[Sociological classifications of religious movements]] suggest that within any given religious group, a community can resemble various types of structures, including [[Church (building)|churches]], [[Religious denomination|denominations]], [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s, and [[institution]]s.

==Related aspects==

===Law===
{{main|Law and religion}}
The study of law and religion is a relatively new field, with several thousand scholars involved in law schools, and academic departments including political science, religion, and history since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Witte |first1=John |year=2012 |title=The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report |url= |journal=Ecclesiastical Law Journal |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=327–354 |doi=10.1017/s0956618x12000348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non-establishment, but also study religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding of religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in a comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, ''Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham and Brett G.

===Science===
{{Main|Faith and rationality|Relationship between religion and science|Epistemology}}
[[Science]] acknowledges [[reason]], [[empiricism]], and [[evidence]]; and religions include [[revelation]], [[faith]] and [[sacredness]] whilst also acknowledging [[Philosophy of religion|philosophical]] and [[metaphysical]] explanations with regard to the study of the universe. Both science and religion are not monolithic, timeless, or static because both are complex social and cultural endeavors that have changed through time across languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stenmark |first1=Mikael |title=How to Relate Science and Religion: A Multidimensional Model |date=2004 |publisher=W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co. |location=Grand Rapids, Mich. |isbn=978-0802828231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of science and religion are a recent invention: the term religion emerged in the 17th century in the midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nongbri/&gt; The term science emerged in the 19th century out of [[natural philosophy]] in the midst of attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature ([[natural science]]),&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cahan|editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226089287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSACM"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Numbers|editor1-first=Ronald|editor2-last=Lindberg|editor2-first=David|title=When Science and Christianity Meet|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226482149}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase religion and science emerged in the 19th century due to the reification of both concepts.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"/&gt; It was in the 19th century that the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, and Confucianism first emerged.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt; In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (''scientia'') and religion (''religio'') were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;

In general the [[scientific method]] gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop [[theories]] through elucidation of facts or evaluation by [[experiment]]s and thus only answers [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] questions about the [[universe]] that can be observed and measured. It develops [[theory|theories]] of the world which best fit physically observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is subject to later refinement, or even rejection, in the face of additional evidence. Scientific theories that have an overwhelming preponderance of favorable evidence are often treated as ''[[de facto]]'' verities in general parlance, such as the theories of [[general relativity]] and [[natural selection]] to explain respectively the mechanisms of [[gravity]] and [[evolution]].

Religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures and it is an attempt to find meaning in the world, and to explain humanity's place in it and relationship to it and to any posited entities. In terms of Christian theology and ultimate truths, people rely on reason, experience, scripture, and tradition to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe. Furthermore, religious models, understanding, and metaphors are also revisable, as are scientific models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tolman |first1=Cynthia |title=Methods in Religion |url=http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html |website=Malboro College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904013431/http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding religion and science, [[Albert Einstein]] states (1940): "For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action; it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts…Now, even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies. Though religion may be that which determine the goals, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personal God Concept Causes Science-Religion Conflict |journal=The Science News-Letter |date=21 September 1940 |first=Albert |last=Einstein |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=181–182 |jstor=3916567 |doi=10.2307/3916567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morality ===
{{Main|Morality and religion}}
Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the [[Jainism#Core beliefs|Triple Jems of Jainism]], [[Judaism|Judaism's]] [[Halacha]], [[Islam|Islam's]] [[Sharia]], [[Catholicism|Catholicism's]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], [[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] [[Eightfold Path]], and [[Theological Aspects of the Avesta|Zoroastrianism's]] good thoughts, good words, and good deeds concept, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe|last=Esptein|first=Greg M.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2010|isbn=978-0-06-167011-4|edition=|location=New York|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion and morality are not synonymous. While it is "an almost automatic assumption."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Elements of Moral Philosophy|last2=Rachels|first2=(ed) Stuart|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2011|isbn=978-0-078-03824-2|edition=7|location=New York|page=|last1=Rachels|first1=(ed) James}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Christianity, morality can have a [[Secular morality|secular basis]].

The study of religion and morality can be contentious due to ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definitions of religiosity.

=== Politics ===
====Impact====
Religion has had a significant impact on the political system in many countries. Notably, most Muslim-majority countries adopt various aspects of [[sharia]], the Islamic law. Some countries even define themselves in religious terms, such as [[Iran|The Islamic Republic of Iran]]. The sharia thus affects up to 23% of the global population, or 1.57&amp;nbsp;billion people who are [[Muslim world|Muslims]]. However, religion also affects political decisions in many western countries. For instance, in the [[United States]], 51% of voters would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who did not believe in God, and only 6% more likely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2016/02/economist-explains-18?cid1=cust/noenew/n/n/n/20160229n/owned/n/n/nwl/n/n/NA/email The Economist explains: The role of religion in America’s presidential race], ''The Economist'', 25 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Christians make up 92% of members of the US Congress, compared with 71% of the general public (as of 2014). At the same time, while 23% of U.S. adults are religiously unaffiliated, only one member of Congress ([[Kyrsten Sinema]], D-Arizona), or 0.2% of that body, claims no religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/27/10-facts-about-religion-in-america/|title=10 facts about religion in America|last=Lipka|first=Michael|date=27 Aug 2015|website=|publisher=Pew Research Center|access-date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most European countries, however, religion has a much smaller influence on politics&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2014/04/europe-religion-and-politics Europe, religion and politics:Old world wars], The Economist, 22 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; although it used to be much more important. For instance, [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] were illegal in many European countries until recently, following Christian (usually [[Catholicism|Catholic]]) doctrine. Several [[List of atheists in politics and law|European leaders are atheists]] (e.g. [[France]]’s former president [[François Hollande|Francois Hollande]] or Greece's prime minister [[Alexis Tsipras]]). In Asia, the role of religion differs widely between countries. For instance, [[India]] is still one of the most religious countries and religion still has a strong impact on politics, given that Hindu nationalists have been targeting minorities like the Muslims and the Christians, who historically belonged to the lower castes.&lt;ref&gt;Lobo, L. 2000 [http://americamagazine.org/issue/276/article/religion-and-politics-india Religion and Politics in India], ''America Magazine'', 19 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, countries such as [[Religion in China|China]] or [[Religion in Japan|Japan]] are largely secular and thus religion has a much smaller impact on politics.

====Secularism====
[[File:Ranjitsingh.gif|thumb|upright|[[Ranjit Singh]] established [[Ranjit Singh#Secular Sikh rule|secular rule]] over [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in the early 19th century.]]

{{Main|Secularism| Secularization}}
Secularization is the transformation of the politics of a society from close identification with a particular religion's values and institutions toward nonreligious values and [[secular]] institutions. The purpose of this is frequently modernization or protection of the populations religious diversity.

===Economics===

{{Further|Religion and business|Wealth and religion}}
One study has found there is a negative correlation between self-defined religiosity and the wealth of nations.&lt;ref name=WIN-Gallup&gt;{{cite web |last=WIN-Gallup |title=Global Index of religion and atheism. |url=http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021065544/http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the richer a nation is, the less likely its inhabitants to call themselves religious, whatever this word means to them (Many people identify themselves as part of a religion (not irreligion) but do not self-identify as religious).&lt;ref name="WIN-Gallup" /&gt;

Sociologist and political economist [[Max Weber]] has argued that Protestant Christian countries are wealthier because of their [[Protestant work ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, [1904] 1920. ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study from 2015, [[Christians]] hold the largest amount of wealth (55% of the total world wealth), followed by [[Muslims]] (5.8%), [[Hindus]] (3.3%) and [[Jewish]] (1.1%). According to the same study it was found that adherents under the classification [[Irreligion]] or other religions hold about 34.8% of the total global wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/453467/christians-hold-largest-percentage-global.html6 |title=Christians hold largest percentage of global wealth: Report|publisher=deccanherald.com|date=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
{{Main|Impacts of religion on health}}
[[Mayo Clinic]] researchers examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality, and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes. The authors reported that: "Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide."&lt;ref name="Religion and Medicine"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Paul S. |last1=Mueller, MD |first2=David J. |last2=Plevak, MD |first3=Teresa A. |last3=Rummans, MD |title=Religious Involvement, Spirituality, and Medicine: Implications for Clinical Practice |url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0025-6196/PIIS0025619611627997.pdf |quote=We reviewed published studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and subject reviews that examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes.

The authors of a subsequent study concluded that the influence of religion on health is largely beneficial, based on a review of related literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Hill |first2=Peter C. |title=The Role of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=February 2001 |first=Kevin S. |last=Seybold |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=21–24 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00106}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to academic James W. Jones, several studies have discovered "positive correlations between religious belief and practice and mental and physical health and longevity." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Religion, Health, and the Psychology of Religion: How the Research on Religion and Health Helps Us Understand Religion |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |year=2004 |first=James W. |last=Jones |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=317–328 |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4299-3|url=http://dergipark.gov.tr/bilimname/issue/3501/47580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of data from the 1998 US General Social Survey, whilst broadly confirming that religious activity was associated with better health and well-being, also suggested that the role of different dimensions of spirituality/religiosity in health is rather more complicated. The results suggested "that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and health from one form of spirituality/religiosity to another, across denominations, or to assume effects are uniform for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.11.008|pmid=16359765|title=Gender differences in religious practices, spiritual experiences and health: Results from the US General Social Survey|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=62|issue=11|pages=2848–2860|year=2006|last1=Maselko|first1=Joanna|last2=Kubzansky|first2=Laura D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics like [[Hector Avalos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence |first=Hector |last=Avalos |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, New York |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Regina Schwartz]],&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz&gt;{{cite book |title=The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism By Regina M. Schwartz |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] have argued that religions are inherently violent and harmful to society by using violence to promote their goals, in ways that are endorsed and exploited by their leaders.&lt;ref name="Hitchens 2007"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=God is not Great |publisher=Twelve |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref name="Dawkins 2006"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |title=The God Delusion |publisher=Bantam Books |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

Anthropologist Jack David Eller asserts that religion is not inherently violent, arguing "religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical." He asserts that "violence is neither essential to nor exclusive to religion" and that "virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary."&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eller |first=Jack David |title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=As we have insisted previously, religion is not inherently and irredeemably violent; it certainly is not the essence and source of all violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eller |first=Jack David |title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=Religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical. Violence is one phenomenon in human (and natural existence), religion is another, and it is inevitable that the two would become intertwined. Religion is complex and modular, and violence is one of the modules—not universal, but recurring. As a conceptual and behavioral module, violence is by no means exclusive to religion. There are plenty of other groups, institutions, interests, and ideologies to promote violence. Violence is, therefore, neither essential to nor exclusive to religion. Nor is religious violence all alike... And virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animal sacrifice ====
Done by some (but not all) religions, [[animal sacrifice]] is the [[ritual]] killing and offering of an animal to appease or maintain favour with a [[deity]]. It has been banned in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/india-court-bans-animal-sacrifice-hindu-temples |title=Indian court bans animal sacrifice |last=France-Presse |first=Agence|newspaper=The Guardian |date=2014-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superstition ===
{{Further|Superstition|Magical thinking|Magic and religion}}
Greek and Roman pagans, who saw their relations with the gods in political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods (''deisidaimonia''), as a slave might fear a cruel and capricious master. The Romans called such fear of the gods ''superstitio''.&lt;ref&gt;Veyne 1987, p. 211 {{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ancient Greek]] historian [[Polybius]] described superstition in [[Ancient Rome]] as an ''[[instrumentum regni]]'', an instrument of maintaining the cohesion of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]], VI 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Superstition has been described as the non rational establishment of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kfoster/FosterKokko2008%20Proc%20B%20superstition.pdf Kevin R. Foster and Hanna Kokko, "The evolution of superstitious and superstition-like behaviour", ''Proc. R. Soc. B'' (2009) 276, 31–37] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728042608/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kfoster/FosterKokko2008%20Proc%20B%20superstition.pdf |date=28 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is more complex and is often composed of social institutions and has a moral aspect. Some religions may include superstitions or make use of magical thinking. Adherents of one religion sometimes think of other religions as superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Religion Explained |last=Boyer | first = Pascal |year=2001 |chapter=Why Belief |authorlink=Pascal Boyer |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wreF80OHTicC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=%22fang+too+were+quite+amazed%22|title-link=Religion Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nailed : ten Christian myths that show Jesus never existed at all|last=David|first=Fitzgerald|isbn=9780557709915|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=701249439|date = October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[atheists]], [[deists]], and [[skeptics]] regard religious belief as superstition.

The Roman Catholic Church considers superstition to be sinful in the sense that it denotes a lack of trust in the divine providence of God and, as such, is a violation of the first of the Ten Commandments. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states that superstition "in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion" (para. #2110).  "Superstition," it says, "is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition. Cf. Matthew 23:16–22" (para. #2111)

===Agnosticism and atheism===
{{Main|Atheism|Agnosticism|Irreligion|Antireligion|Humanism}}
{{See also|Criticism of atheism}}
The terms [[atheist]] (lack of belief in any gods) and agnostic (belief in the unknowability of the existence of gods), though specifically contrary to theistic (e.g. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) religious teachings, do not by definition mean the opposite of religious. There are religions (including Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism), in fact, that classify some of their followers as agnostic, atheistic, or [[nontheism|nontheistic]]. The true opposite of religious is the word irreligious. [[Irreligion]] describes an absence of any religion; [[antireligion]] describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general.

===Interfaith cooperation===
{{Main|Interfaith dialogue}}
Because religion continues to be recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}, many religious practitioners{{who|date=July 2016}} have aimed to band together in [[interfaith]] dialogue, cooperation, and [[Religion and peacebuilding|religious peacebuilding]]. The first major dialogue was the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]], which affirmed universal values and recognition of the diversity of practices among different cultures. The 20th century has been especially fruitful in use of interfaith dialogue as a means of solving ethnic, political, or even religious conflict, with [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation]] representing a complete reverse in the attitudes of many Christian communities towards Jews.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Recent interfaith initiatives include A Common Word, launched in 2007 and focused on bringing Muslim and Christian leaders together,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acommonword.com/|title=A Common Word Between Us and You|work=acommonword.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "C1 World Dialogue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c1worlddialogue.com/|title=konsoleH :: Login|work=c1worlddialogue.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128195027/http://www.c1worlddialogue.com/|archivedate=28 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Common Ground initiative between Islam and Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islambuddhism.com/|title=Islam and Buddhism|work=islambuddhism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[United Nations]] sponsored "World Interfaith Harmony Week".&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/ World Interfaith Harmony Week]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/world-interfaith-harmony-week-resolution/|title=» World Interfaith Harmony Week UNGA Resolution A/65/PV.34|work=worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
Culture and religion have usually been seen as closely related. [[Paul Tillich]] looked at religion as the soul of culture and culture as the form or framework of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Queen, ''
Encyclopedia of American Religious History, Volume 1'' Facts on File, 1996. p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; In his own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion as ultimate concern is the meaning-giving substance of culture, and culture is the totality of forms in which the basic concern of religion expresses itself. In abbreviation: religion is the substance of culture, culture is the form of religion. Such a consideration definitely prevents the establishment of a dualism of religion and culture. Every religious act, not only in organized religion, but also in the most intimate movement of the soul, is culturally formed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, ''Theology of Culture'', Robert C. Kimball (ed), (Oxford University Press, 1959). p.42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Ernst Troeltsch]], similarly, looked at culture as the soil of religion and thought that, therefore, transplanting a religion from its original culture to a foreign culture would actually kill it in the same manner that transplanting a plant from its natural soil to an alien soil would kill it. &lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Sharpe, "Religion and Cultures", An inaugural lecture delivered on 6 July, 1977 by Eric J. Sharpe, Professor of Religious Studies in the University of Sydney. Accessed at [https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/ART/article/download/5496/6167 Openjournals] on June 22, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been many attempts in the modern pluralistic situation to distinguish culture from religion.&lt;ref&gt;See Taslima Nasreen, [https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/i-say-three-cheers-for-ayaan/232289 "I Say, Three Cheers For Ayaan",] ''Outlook, The Magazine'' 28 August 2006. Also, Nemani Delaibatiki, [http://fijisun.com.fj/2017/07/08/religion-and-the-vanua/ "Religion and the Vanua"] ''Fiji Sun'' July 08, 2017 in which the distinctive elements of culture against religion are taken from Domenic Marbaniang, [https://philpapers.org/bbs/thread.pl?tId=959 "Difference Between Culture and Religion: A Proposal Requesting Response"], 12 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Domenic Marbaniang has argued that elements grounded on beliefs of a metaphysical nature (religious) are distinct from elements grounded on nature and the natural (cultural). For instance, language (with its grammar) is a cultural element while sacralization of language in which a particular religious scripture is written is more often a religious practice. The same applies to music and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, "The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 7–17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of religion}}
Criticism of religion is [[criticism]] of the ideas, the truth, or the practice of religion, including its political and social implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Beckford|first=James A.|title=Social Theory and Religion| page=2| year=2003| publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-77431-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Lewis was born in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], to computer analyst father Wayne Lewis and retired social worker mother Patricia Scott.

Lewis was introduced to African American history by her father through her own [[genealogy]] as a child where she learned she was a descendant of [[Henri Christophe]], the first king of free Haiti in 1811. She comes from a family of teachers: Her maternal great grandfather, Nathaniel Lewis, was a student at [[Tuskegee University]], and later taught at Southern University A&amp;M and her maternal great grandmother, Della Atkinson, was a professor at Straight College, which is known today as Dillard University.

In 2000, Lewis received a bachelor's degree from [[Howard University]] in African American Studies. By then, her childhood experience with Black history grew into a career, teaching African-American Studies at Hyde Leadership Public Charter School in [[Washington, D.C.]] Lewis then earned a master's degree in African American Studies from [[Temple University]] in 2006.

After returning home to [[Louisiana]] in 2007, Lewis became Executive Director and Curator of the [http://www.themckennamuseum.com/#!jennifer-williams-bio/c20ei McKenna Museum of African American Art].&lt;ref name=NYDN-CCCADI-2010 /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Lewis lives and works in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].

Lewis' exhibition, "Sex Crimes Against Black Girls," was partly inspired by her personal experience with abuse as a child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2016, Lewis married business owner Tony Oluwatoyin Lawson with a wedding they called the "Royal Wedding of Zamunda" inspired by the blend of their [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Nigerian, New Orleanian and [[Lucumi religion|Lucumi]] cultures with a nod to the film, [[Coming to America]]. The wedding included a traditional [[Second line (parades)|second line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2016/12/how-this-couple-combined-new-orleanian-and-nigerian-culture-to-create-the-wedding-of-a-lifetime/|title=How This Couple Combined New Orleanian and Nigerian Culture to Create the Wedding of a Lifetime|date=2016-12-09|newspaper=The Root|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.okayafrica.com/video/biggest-blackest-wedding-of-all-time/|title=The Biggest, Blackest Wedding of All Time Will Make Your Day|date=2016-11-28|newspaper=Okayafrica.|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sharing'''  is the joint use of a resource or space. In its narrow sense, it refers to joint or alternating use of inherently finite goods, such as a common [[pasture]] or a shared residence. It is also the process of dividing and distributing. Apart from obvious instances, which we can observe in human activity, we can also find many examples of this happening in nature. When an organism takes in nutrition or oxygen for instance, its internal organs are designed to divide and distribute the energy taken in, to supply parts of its body that need it. Flowers divide and distribute their seeds. In a broader sense, it can also include free granting of use rights to goods that can be treated as [[Rivalry (economics)|nonrival goods]], such as information. Still more loosely, "sharing" can actually mean giving something as an outright gift: for example, to "share" one's food really means to give some of it as a gift. Sharing is a basic component of human interaction, and is responsible for strengthening social ties and ensuring a person’s well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poquérusse|first=Jessie|title=The Neuroscience of Sharing|url=https://www.uniiverse.com/neuroscience|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In a market==
Market sharing occurs when competitors agree to divide or allocate customers, suppliers or territories among themselves rather than allowing competitive market forces to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/business/anti-competitive-behaviour/cartels/market-sharing#market-sharing|title=Market sharing|last=Commission|first=Australian Competition and Consumer|date=2013-01-09|work=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market sharing can include:

* allocating customers by geographic area
* dividing contracts by value within an area

Also agreeing not to:

* compete for established customers
* produce each other’s products or services
* expand into a competitor’s market

Market sharing is generally an illegal practice as it violates anti-trust laws and the basic principles of the free market. Market sharing mainly occur in the form of cartels like the [[Guadalajara_Cartel|Guadalajara Cartel]], which was the first Mexican drug cartel to consolidate the production and supply of illegal marijuana into a single organization.

Sharing in a market may also refer to the temporary or permanent transfer of information and other physical as well as intellectual property, but this is generally accompanied by the exchange of money.{{expand section|date=November 2018}}
==In households==
[[File:Green sharing (1).jpg|thumb|Plant sharing]]
Resource sharing - called kaláka in Hungarian -  is an old tradition in Hungary. Young couples had to build their house after marriage.  Marriage itself was called házasodás in Hungarian (en: becoming the owner of a house). When doing so the whole community, relatives and acquaintances helped the young couple with work, knowledge and even money. At pigsticking, all members of the community got their shares too.  Superfluous plants were freely distributed for neighbours in the season.

In most cultures, members of the same household tend to pool their resources.

==In computer and Internet culture==
{{main|Image sharing|File sharing}}
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
[[File sharing]] is the practice of distributing or providing access to digitally stored information, such as computer programs, multi-media (audio, video), documents, or electronic books. It may be implemented through a variety of ways. Storage, transmission, and distribution models are common methods of file sharing incorporate manual sharing using [[removable media]], centralized computer file server installations on [[computer network]]s, [[World Wide Web]]-based [[hyperlink]]ed documents, and the use of distributed [[peer-to-peer networking]] (see [[peer-to-peer file sharing]]).

Sharing is a key feature in the developing field of [[free software]] and [[open source software]], with implications for economics. This is leading to a need to review [[licensing]], [[patents]] and [[copyright]], and to [[controversy]] in these areas, as well as new approaches like [[Creative Commons]] and the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].

Furthermore, sharing is a key feature of [[Internet culture]] in which images, videos, links, knowledge and other content are shared on [[Web 2.0]]-platforms such as [[reddit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nms.sagepub.com/content/15/2/167 John, Nicholas A. (2013) Sharing and Web 2.0: The emergence of a keyword. New Media &amp; Society, March 2013 vol. 15 no. 2 167-182]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herman|first1=Andrew|last2=Hadlaw|first2=Jan|last3=Swiss|first3=Thom|title=Theories of the Mobile Internet: Materialities and Imaginaries|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317911128|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=BFucBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145|accessdate=4 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computer science==
In [[computer science]], the issue of handling [[shared resource]]s figures prominently. For example, [[time-sharing]] is an approach to [[interactive computing]] in which a single [[computer]] is used to provide apparently simultaneous interactive general-purpose computing to multiple users by sharing processor time. Sharing of resources between [[Process (computer science)|processes]] and [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] is the source of most of the difficulties of [[concurrent programming]]. The word "sharing" is also used in some [[functional programming]] communities to refer specifically to sharing of memory between different data items to save space, otherwise known as [[hash consing]].

==In religions==

===Information and knowledge===
* The KJV Bible, [[s:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 13|1 Corinthians 13:2]] says that '''having all the knowledge in the world is useless, without the desire for charity (sharing).'''
* The Douay-Rheims Bible, [http://drbo.org/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=57&amp;ch=1&amp;l=9#x Philippians 1:9] says "'''And this I pray, that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge, and in all understanding'''".
* In editions of the Christian Bible, [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Hosea#4|Hosea 4:6]] says that '''obstruction of the flow of knowledge could be the destruction of mankind.'''
* '''Vidya Daan''' ({{lang|sa|विद्या दान}}) translated as '''Knowledge Charity''', a concept in [[Dāna|Daan]], is a [[Niyama|tenet]] of all [[Indian religions|Dharmic]] religions that also values the sharing of Knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit.us/vidya.html Sanskrit slokas about Vidya]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vidyadaan.in/about/ Vidya Daan: about]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gyan yoga''', '''[[Jnana yoga]]''' ({{lang|sa|ज्ञान योग}}) translated as '''Wisdom Exercise''' or '''Knowledge Path''', is the '''sacred search for True Knowledge''', in all Dharmic religions.
* In Hinduism, [[Vidya|Right Knowledge]] is a form of God, and anything that Knowledge is written on or recorded on is considered sacred, to be protected from obscurity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|sa|अपूर्व: कोपि कोशोयं विद्यते तव भारति ।&lt;br/&gt;व्ययतो वॄद्धिम् आयाति क्षयम् आयाति संचयात् ॥}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:* Translation: '''Oh Goddess [[Saraswati]], your treasure of knowledge ([[Vidya]]) is indeed very amazing! If used (shared) it grows and if unused (obscured) it shrinks!'''
*In Islam, [[Muhammad]] said: "'''Wisdom is the lost property of the faithful; wherever he finds it he has the right to take it'''"&lt;ref&gt;Sunan Tirmidhi Tradition:4159, Sunan Ibn Majah Tradition:9784, Ibid Tradition:9785, Mishkat al-Masabih Tradition:216&lt;/ref&gt;
:Muhammad also said: "'''Whoever is asked about a knowledge that he knows about and then hides it and keeps it away, he will be bridled on the day of judgement with a bridle of fire.'''"&lt;ref&gt;Related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and Al-Tirmidhi&lt;/ref&gt;

The information and communication technology tools used for smart tourism include [[Internet of things|IoT]], mobile communication, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It combines physical, informational, social, and commercial infrastructure of tourism with such tools to provide smart tourism opportunities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;The principles of smart tourism lie at enhancing tourism experiences, improve the efficiency of resource management, maximize destination competitiveness with an emphasis on sustainable aspects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gretzel|first=Ulrike|last2=Sigala|first2=Marianna|last3=Xiang|first3=Zheng|last4=Koo|first4=Chulmo|date=2015-08-01|title=Smart tourism: foundations and developments|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12525-015-0196-8|journal=Electronic Markets|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=179–188|doi=10.1007/s12525-015-0196-8|issn=1019-6781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gretzel|first=Ulrike|last2=Zhong|first2=Lina|last3=Koo|first3=Chulmo|date=2016-05-03|title=Application of smart tourism to cities|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305693638_Application_of_smart_tourism_to_cities|journal=International Journal of Tourism Cities|volume=2|doi=10.1108/IJTC-04-2016-0007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should also gather and distribute information to facilitate efficient allocation of tourism resources and integrate tourism supplies at a micro and macro level ensuring that the benefits are well distributed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are observed to be effective in technologically advanced destinations such as [[Smart city|smart cities]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Examples of smart tourism tools include;

# Mobiles application
# Augmented reality
# Near-field communication

== Smart Tourism Destinations ==
Any destination can be a smart tourist destination if it consists of the following;

* Soft smartness; includes collaborations, innovation, and leadership&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Hard smartness; refers to all the technology and infrastructure&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, the availability of any of the above does not make for a smart destination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It depends on the availability of hardsmartness which enables improvement of human capital and smart decisions based on the application of technology and infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Smart tourism requires the following attributes;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

# Technology embedded environments
# Responsive processes at micro and macro levels
# End-user devices
# Stakeholders that actively use smart platforms 

== Smart Tourism Tools ==
Smart tourism tools refer to a combination of mobile hardware, software, and networks to enable interaction between tourists, stakeholders, and physical objects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The communication must be able to provide personalized services and real-time information for making smart decisions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Three specific smart tourism tools are mobile applications, augmented reality, and near-field communications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Applications ===
Applications must be able to provide information which will help tourists in making informed choices such as making reservations, translation services, direction guidance. Audio guidance, etc&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. It should also allow real-time communication between stakeholders and customers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Examples include ViaHero which allows users to have personalized trips created with the help of local residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/viahero-local-plan-trip|title=This App Will Hire a Local to Plan Your Entire Trip – for Only $25 a Day|last=https://plus.google.com/+travelandleisure/posts|work=Travel + Leisure|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Augmented Reality ===
It is an experience augmenting a real-world environment with information with the help of smartphone or lens systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It can contribute significantly to cultural tourism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An example includes AR at a Roman theater which allows users to point their phone at the arena and watch a gladiator fight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Near Field Communications ===
NFC can be mostly used mostly in tourist places such as museums and which allows tourists to scan information points at paintings/ sculptures/ historical artifacts which then allows the phone to provide translations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The NFC however, requires a compatible device.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Each location calls for the application of different tools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both tourists and destinations benefit from smart tourism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Benefit for destinations includes economic reward, potential FDI, preservation of cultural heritage, etc. while for the tourists include convenience, reduction in expenses, to name a few.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges of Smart Tourism ==
Reliance on smart devices for running applications and power for the functioning of the system.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gretzel|first=Ulrike|last2=Reino|first2=Sofia|last3=Kopera|first3=Sebastian|last4=Koo|first4=Chulmo|date=2015-01-01|title=Smart Tourism Challenges|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301295363_Smart_Tourism_Challenges|journal=Journal of Tourism|volume=16|pages=41–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of a gap between digital and non-digital devices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It does not cater to the needs of those who want to experience tourism outside of the smart city realm.

Higher amounts of knowledge and infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Enterprises which are already affected by tourism will be further pushed down with the onset of smart tourism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2113">In [[linguistics]], a '''syntagma''' is an elementary constituent segment within a text. Such a segment can be a [[phoneme]], a [[word]], a grammatical [[phrase]], a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], or an event within a larger narrative structure, depending on the level of analysis. Syntagmatic analysis involves the study of relationships (rules of combination) among syntagmas.

At the lexical level, syntagmatic structure in a [[language]] is the combination of words according to the rules of [[syntax]] for that language. For example, English uses determiner + adjective + noun, e.g. ''the big house''. Another language might use determiner + noun + adjective (Spanish {{lang|es|la casa grande}}) and therefore have a different syntagmatic structure.

At a higher level, narrative structures feature a realistic temporal flow guided by tension and relaxation; thus, for example, events or rhetorical figures may be treated as syntagmas of epic structures.

Syntagmatic structure is often contrasted with paradigmatic structure. In [[semiotics]], "[[syntagmatic analysis]]" is [[semantic analysis (linguistics)|analysis]] of syntax or surface structure (syntagmatic structure), rather than [[paradigm]]s as in [[paradigmatic analysis]]. Analysis is often achieved through [[commutation test (semiotics)|commutation test]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem04.html | title=Semiotics for Beginners: Syntagmatic Analysis | author=Daniel Chandler | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000512022604/http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem04.html | archivedate=May 12, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==

===Ownership===
TV Tropes was founded in 2004 by a programmer under the pseudonym "Fast Eddie", who described himself as having become interested in the conventions of [[genre fiction]] while studying at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in the 1970s and after browsing Internet forums in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://io9.com/5479423/behind-the-wiki-meet-tv-tropes-cofounder-fast-eddie |title=Behind The Wiki: Meet TV Tropes Cofounder Fast Eddie |publisher=[[io9]] |first=Annalee |last=Newitz |date=February 24, 2010 |accessdate=February 25, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227083524/https://io9.com/5479423/behind-the-wiki-meet-tv-tropes-cofounder-fast-eddie |archivedate=February 27, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018 the site is privately owned and the site publicly lists two co-owners besides Eddie.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/about.php |website=TV Tropes |accessdate=April 19, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421145813/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/about.php |archivedate=April 21, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===
Initially focused on the television show ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'',&lt;ref name="MarySue"/&gt; TV Tropes has since increased its scope to include television series, [[film]]s, [[novel]]s, [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[professional wrestling]], [[video game]]s, [[anime]], [[manga]], [[comic strip]]s/[[comic book|books]], [[fan fiction]], and many other subjects, including Internet works such as [[Wikipedia]] (referred to in-wiki as "The Other Wiki").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia |title=Wikipedia - Television Tropes &amp; Idioms |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025202729/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia |archivedate=October 25, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, articles on the site often relate to real life, or point out real situations where certain tropes can be applied. It has also used its informal style to describe topics such as science, philosophy, politics, and history under its Useful Notes section. TV Tropes does not have [[notability]] standards for the works it covers.&lt;ref name="Notability"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/ThereIsNoSuchThingAsNotability |title=There Is No Such Thing As Notability - TV Tropes |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=May 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/696zkCvpC?url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoSuchThingAsNotability |archivedate=July 12, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article organization===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
The site includes entries on various series and tropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tropes|title=Tropes - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article on a work includes a brief summary of the work in question along with a list of associated tropes. Trope pages are the reverse of articles on works: they give a description of the trope itself, then provide a list of the trope's appearances in various works of media. In this way TV Tropes is fully interconnected through the various connections made between the works and their tropes.

For example, the trope "I Am Spartacus" is a specific type of scene that appears in multiple works. It refers to scenes where a character is shielded from identification by other characters who are also claiming to be that particular character. The trope name references a famous scene in the film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=I Am Spartacus |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus |website=TV Tropes |accessdate=September 7, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907080917/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSpartacus |archivedate=September 7, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example is included, along with examples from ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'', the [[Talmud]] and even recent stories from real life. Not all examples of a trope may be cases where it is "played straight". They may also include cases where the trope is parodied, played with, inverted or even averted (i.e. avoided altogether in a context where it would be expected).

In addition to the tropes, most articles about a work also have a "Your Mileage May Vary"&lt;ref name="mileage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/HomePage |title=Your Mileage May Vary - Television Tropes &amp; Idioms |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=August 21, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903082355/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/HoMepage |archivedate=September 3, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (YMMV) page with items that are deemed to be subjective. These items are not usually storytelling tropes, but are audience reactions which have been defined and titled. For example, the page of the well known trope "[[jumping the shark]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark|title=Jumping the Shark - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the moment at which a series experiences a sharp decline in quality as in the notorious story point in ''[[Happy Days]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays|title=Happy Days (Series) - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; only contains a list of works that reference the phrase. TV Tropes does not apply the term to a show, that being a subjective opinion about the show, but cites uses of the phrase by the show ("in-universe"). Most articles also have various pages within them. For example, the article may have an "Awesome"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/sugarwiki/momentofawesome?from=main.crowningmomentofawesome|title=Moment of Awesome / Sugar Wiki - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; page to describe crowning moments of awesome (i.e., a moment in a show or other fictional work that the majority of the readers or viewers regard as one of the high points); a "Fridge" page which describes examples of the tropes "Fridge Logic"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic|title=Fridge Logic - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (issues of a given work's internal consistency that do not typically occur to one until later), as well as the related "Fridge Horror"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror|title=Fridge Horror - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Fridge Brilliance";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance|title=Fridge Brilliance - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "Laconic"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaconicWiki|title=Laconic Wiki - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; page which describes an article/trope in a few short words; and more pages that focus on a particular aspect of an article/item.

===Trope descriptions===
Trope description pages are generally created through a standardized launching system, known as the "Trope Launch Pad" (TLP, formerly "You Know That Thing Where" [YKTTW]); site members, (referred to as "Tropers"), can draft a trope description and have the option of providing examples or suggesting refinements to other drafts before launch. While going through TLP is not necessary to launch a trope, it is strongly recommended in order to strengthen the trope as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TLPGuidelines |title=TLP Guidelines |accessdate=October 2, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003124445/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TLPGuidelines |archivedate=October 3, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has created its own self-referencing meta-trope, known as "TV Tropes Will Ruin Your Life". The trope warns that some readers may become jaded and cynical as an unanticipated side effect of reading TV Tropes, "[replacing] surprise almost entirely with recognition,"  referring to the inability to read books, watch films, etc. without identifying each trope as it occurs. Also mentioned is that many frequently-contributing community members self-describe themselves as addicted to the site. The community has dubbed the pattern of many tropers as taking a "Wiki Walk," starting an edit on an intended article, and subsequently following links from one page to the next for hours on end without intending to, pausing occasionally to add examples the troper notices to the listings or rework articles. In the process, this leads to the discovery of entirely new tropes to analyze, edit, and add examples to. This self-perpetuating cycle of behavior has become the subject of much lampooning for the community, with tongue-in-cheek references being made in the articles for tropes such as "[[Brainwashing]]," "Hive Mind," and ''Tome of Eldritch Lore'' (a book of cursed knowledge which infects the reader with obsessive madness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife |title=TV Tropes Will Ruin Your Life |accessdate=March 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/696zkhf0z?url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife |archivedate=July 12, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanding scope===
Considerable redesign of some aspects of content organization occurred in 2008, such as the introduction of [[namespace]]s, while 2009 saw the arrival of other languages, [[German language|German]] being the most developed. In 2011, TV Tropes branched out into video production, and launched ''Echo Chamber'', a web series about a TV Tropes [[vlog]]ger explaining and demonstrating tropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/EchoChamber |title=Echo Chamber |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901055445/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/EchoChamber |archivedate=September 1, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with TV Tropes co-founder Fast Eddie, [[Gawker Media]]'s blog ''[[io9]]'' described the tone of contributions to the site as "often light and funny". [[Cyberpunk]] author [[Bruce Sterling]] once described its style as a "wry [[fan fiction|fanfic]] analysis".&lt;ref name="Sterling"&gt;{{cite web |author=Bruce Sterling |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/01/tv-tropes-the-a |title=TV Tropes, the all-devouring pop-culture wiki |publisher=WIRED |date=January 21, 2009 |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312063723/https://www.wired.com/2009/01/tv-tropes-the-a |archivedate=March 12, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essayist Linda Börzsei described TV Tropes as a technological continuum of classical archetypal literary criticisms, capable of deconstructing [[Trope (literature)|recurring elements]] from creative works in an ironic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Börzsei |first=Linda |title=Literary Criticism in New Media |website=Academia.edu |date=April 2012 |url=https://www.academia.edu/4570620/Literary_Criticism_in_New_Media_A_critical_analysis_of_the_website_Television_Tropes_and_Idioms_and_the_place_of_literature_in_digital_culture |accessdate=September 3, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711171506/https://www.academia.edu/4570620/Literary_Criticism_in_New_Media_A_critical_analysis_of_the_website_Television_Tropes_and_Idioms_and_the_place_of_literature_in_digital_culture |archivedate=July 11, 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Robin Hanson]], inspired by a scholarly analysis of Victorian literature,&lt;ref name=epjournal&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep06715738.pdf |format=PDF |author=Kruger, Daniel et. al. |year=2006 |title=Hierarchy in the Library: Egalitarian Dynamics in Victorian Novels |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Psychology |accessdate=November 1, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023074308/https://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep06715738.pdf |archivedate=October 23, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests TV Tropes offers a veritable treasure trove of information about fiction - a prime opportunity for research into its nature.&lt;ref name=overcomingbias&gt;{{cite web |last=Hanson |first=Robin |url=https://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/05/tropes-are-treasures.html |title=Tropes Are Treasures |publisher=Overcoming Bias |date=May 9, 2009 |accessdate=March 11, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020232952/https://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/05/tropes-are-treasures.html |archivedate=October 20, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lifehacker]], Nick Douglas compared TV Tropes to [[Wikipedia]], recommending to "use [TV Tropes] when Wikipedia feels impenetrable, when you want opinions more than facts, or when you've finished a Wikipedia page and now you want the juicy parts, the hard-to-confirm bits that Wikipedia doesn't share."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Douglas |first=Nick |url=https://lifehacker.com/use-the-tv-tropes-site-the-same-way-you-would-wikipedia-1822930619 |title=Use the TV Tropes Site the Same Way You Would Wikipedia |work=Lifehacker |date=February 12, 2018 |accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Mature content incident===
In October 2010, in what the site refers to as "The Google Incident", [[Google]] temporarily withdrew its [[AdSense]] service from the site after determining that pages regarding adult and mature tropes were inconsistent with its terms of service.&lt;ref name="GoogIn"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TheGoogleIncident |title=Administrivia: The Google Incident |publisher=TV Tropes |accessdate=May 16, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516034226/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TheGoogleIncident |archivedate=May 16, 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://productforums.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!category-topic/adsense/i-dont-yet-have-an-account-getting-approved/T7-CeRf60B0 |title=Google Groups |website=productforums.google.com|access-date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a separate incident in 2012, in response to other complaints by Google, TV Tropes changed its guidelines to restrict coverage of sexist tropes and [[rape]] tropes. Feminist blog ''The Mary Sue'' criticized this decision, as it censored documentation of sexist tropes in [[sexism in video games|video games]] and [[young adult fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.themarysue.com/tv-tropes-rape-articles/ |title=TV Tropes Deletes Every Rape Trope; Geek Feminism Wiki steps in |publisher=themarysue.com |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=May 16, 2014 |author=Aja Romano |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423223946/https://www.themarysue.com/tv-tropes-rape-articles/ |archivedate=April 23, 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[ThinkProgress]]'' additionally condemned Google AdSense itself for "providing a financial disincentive to discuss" such topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/06/26/506563/tv-tropes/ |title=TV Tropes Bows to Google’s Ad Servers, Deletes Discussions of Sexual Assault in Culture |publisher=[[ThinkProgress]] |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=May 16, 2014 |author=Alyssa Rosenberg |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517121952/https://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/06/26/506563/tv-tropes/ |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site now separates NSFG articles (Not Safe for Google) from SFG articles (Safe for Google) in order to allow discussion of these kinds of tropes.&lt;ref name="GoogIn"/&gt;

Regarding these and other concerns of re-licensing and advertising, a wiki called All The Tropes [[Fork (software development)|fork]]ed all the content from TV Tropes with the original CC-BY-SA license in late 2013. Authors of the fork attributed several actions of taking commercial rights over what is published on its website, censorship, and failing to comply with the original license to TV Tropes managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate=November 24, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124193959/https://allthetropes.miraheze.org/wiki/All_The_Tropes%3AWhy_Fork_TV_Tropes |url=https://allthetropes.miraheze.org/wiki/All_The_Tropes:Why_Fork_TV_Tropes |title=All The Tropes:Why Fork TV Tropes |work=miraheze.org |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some editors raised concerns that keeping the content submitted with the previous [[copyleft]] license at TV Tropes is illegal, as the re-licensing had occurred without the permission of the editors and the original CC-BY-SA license did not allow its distribution under the new terms.&lt;ref name="SoylentNews"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=14/05/15/1938243 |title=TV Tropes Relicensed its Content - Without Permit |publisher=Soylent News |date=May 15, 2014 |accessdate=September 3, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005031905/https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=14%2F05%2F15%2F1938243 |archivedate=October 5, 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
{{Shia Islam|Beliefs and practices}}
'''The Four Companions''', also called '''the Four Pillars of the Sahaba''' is a [[Shi'a|Shiʿah]] term for the four [[Sahaba]] who stayed most loyal to [[Imam Ali]] after the death of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]:
* [[Abu Dhar al-Ghifari|Abū Dharr al-Ghifāri]]
* [[Ammar ibn Yasir|Ammār ibn Yāsir]]
* [[Miqdad ibn Aswad|al-Miqdad ibn Aswād al-Kindi]]
* [[Salman the Persian|Salman al-Fārsī]]

Those among [[sahaba|Muhammad's companions]] who were closest to both [[Muhammad]] and [[Imam Ali]] were called [[Shia etymology|Shiʿah of Ali]] "partisans of Ali" during Muhammad's lifetime, and it was for these primarily that the following hadith was said:{{quote|Glad tidings, [[Ali]]! Verily you and your Shiʿah will be in Paradise.}} These companions are later referred to as "The Real Shiʿah". [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas|Abdullah ibn Abbas]], [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]] and [[Malik al-Ashtar]] were other such partisans. However, it is only The Four Companions that are believed to have attained the rank of "The Real Shiʿah" and remained so.
