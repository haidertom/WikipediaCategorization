      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8962">'''Advanced Innovation Design Approach''' (AIDA) is a holistic approach for enhancing innovative and competitive capability of industrial companies. The name Advanced Innovation Design Approach (AIDA) was proposed in the research project "Innovation Process 4.0" run at the [[University of Applied Sciences Offenburg]], Germany in co-operation with 10 German industrial companies in 2015-2017.&lt;ref&gt;Livotov P. [http://triz.h4u.eu/Innovator_01-2016_(02).pdf Systemic Approach for Enhancing Innovative and Competitive Capability of Industrial Companies - Research Concept. Journal of the European TRIZ Association  01-2016 (163-169)].&lt;/ref&gt;
AIDA can be considered as a pioneering mindset, an individually adaptable range of strongest innovation techniques such as comprehensive [[Front end innovation|front-end innovation]] process, advanced innovation methods, best tools and methods of the theory of inventive problem solving [[TRIZ]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]] 4521 (2016). Inventive Problem Solving with TRIZ. Fundamentals and Definitions.&lt;/ref&gt; organisational measures for accelerating innovation, IT-solutions for Computer-Aided Innovation, and other tools for [[new product development]], elaborated in the recent decade in the industry and academia.

Initially the AIDA has been conceptualised as systemic approach including analysis, optimizations and further development of the innovation process and promoting the innovation climate in industrial companies. The innovation process with self-configuration, self-optimization, self-diagnostics and intelligent information processing and communication, is understood as a holistic system comprising following typical phases with feedback loops and simultaneous auxiliary or follow-up processes: uncovering of solution-neutral customer needs, technology and market trends, identification of the needs and problems with high market potential and formulation of the innovation tasks and strategy, systematic idea generation and problem solving, evaluation and enhancement of solution ideas, creation of innovation concepts based on solution ideas, evaluation of the innovation concepts as well as [[implementation]], validation and market launch of chosen innovation concepts. &lt;br&gt;
The Advanced Innovation Design Approach was refined and further developed for the application in the field of process engineering in the context of the [[EU]] research project "Intensified by Design - Platform for the intensification of processes involving solids handling” within international consortium of 22 universities, research institutes and industrial companies under H2020 SPIRE programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibd-project.eu/ Intensified by Design] - Platform for the intensification of processes involving solids handling. EU Research Project (Horizon 2020, SPIRE Programme)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle of completeness ==

As a holistic innovation approach, AIDA postulates the complete problem analysis and a comprehensive idea generation and problem solving. The problems faced by the industry can not be solved by single eureka idea. 
The principle of completeness in the new product development can be illustrated by following 4 steps.&lt;ref&gt;Casner D. et al. (2017) [https://www.designsociety.org/publication/39714/Advanced+innovation+design+approach+for+process+engineering Advanced Innovation Design Approach for Process Engineering]. Proceedings of the ICED17 - 21st International Conference of Engineering Design, [[The Design Society|The Design Society]],  Aug. 21-25, 2017, Vancouver, [[University of British Columbia]].&lt;/ref&gt;
#Initial complex problem must be segmented into the partial problems. The problem ranking method helps to identify problems crucial for innovation success.
#The strongest TRIZ inventive principles replace the random [[brainstorming]], increasing the quality and quantity of ideas within a short period of time.  For each partial problem several ideas must be generated. No relevant idea should be overseen.
#The complementary solution ideas are combined to the solution concepts. A robust solution concept delivers solutions for all partial problems.
#The solution concepts often have their secondary side effects, like costs, risks or R&amp;D expenditures, which must be limited through concept optimization.

Another example demonstrates the principle of completeness in the phase of the innovation strategy formulation. For the complete identification of existing and future customer needs or benefits several complementary methods are used simultaneously (Tool 4. Innovation potential analysis):

*Analysis of market and technological trends, and others.

== AIDA innovation tools ==

AIDA tools or apps most frequently used in the practice include:

#Brainstorming 40x40: Generate 40 ideas with enhanced 40 TRIZ Inventive Principles (incl. 160 inventive sub-principles, 2017).
#Inno-Workshop: Tool for systematic problem solving and moderation of innovation workshops with TRIZ.
#[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ TRIZ] Inventor: Solving of bottle-neck problems with inventive algorithm ARIZ in its short form.
#Innovation potential analysis: comprehensive identification of innovation opportunities, customer benefits and segments with high market potential.
#New concept development: implementation of the selected innovation tasks (tool 04) into new concepts with high market potential.
#Root-conflict analysis and anticipatory failure identification: tool for elimination harmful effects.
#Systematic and creative cost cutting: for products and processes.
#InnoMonitor: tool for continuous  monitoring of innovative capability of companies (80 parameters and 10 key performance indicators).
#Database of 200+ best practice measures for enhancement of innovation capability.
#Rapid Cross Industry Innovation: an easy-to-use method for fast idea generation with the help of analogies and similarity rules.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5339">'''Andrei Ivanovich Bogdanov''' ({{lang-ru|Андрей Иванович Богданов}}) (1692 – September 11, 1766) was one of the first  [[Russia]]n [[bibliography|bibliographers]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographers]].

Andrei Bogdanov had studied at Academician [[gimnasium]] (a gimnasium of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]). His father was a gunpowder-maker and Andrei had assisted him in his work. In 1727 according to [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great's]] edict Bogdanov began work at the field of typographical art.
&lt;!--
'''Андре́й Ива́нович Богда́нов'''в (1692 — 11 сентября 1766, [[Санкт-Петербург]]) — один из первых русских [[Библиография|книговедов]]. Учился в гимназии при [[Петербургская Академия наук|Петербургской Академии Наук]]. Отец его был мастером порохового дела и Андрей Иванович помогал ему, пока указом [[Пётр I|Петра I]] от 1719 года не был определен «в службу к типографскому художеству». Далее работал в Санкт-Петербургской типографии, а после 1727 года — в типографии Академии Наук. С 1730 года Андрей Иванович работал в библиотеке Академии наук. 

Труд Андрея Ивановича Богданова ''«Историческое, географическое и топографическое описание Санкт-Петербурга от начала заведения его, с 1703, по 1751 год»''  —  первое дошедшее до нас произведение, в котором собраны сведения по [[География|географии]], [[Топонимика|топонимике]], административной структуре, населению Санкт-Петербурга. Это по сути энциклопедия столичной жизни первой половины XVIII века.

Throughout history, forms of [[art]] have gone through periodic abrupt changes called '''artistic revolutions'''.  Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways.  See also [[cultural movement]]s.

== Artistic revolution and political revolutions ==

The role of [[fine art]] has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism, balance, or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful. So as times change, art changes. If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions. The best artists have predated society's changes due not to any prescience, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their talent of seeing.

Artists who succeeded enough to portray visions that future generations could live to see, often had to navigate an often treacherous path between their own capacity to see and execute what lesser artists could not, while still appealing to powerful patrons who could finance their visions. For example, paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 17th century when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings, but later as leadership became oppressive, satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;

No art owes quite as much to state power as French painting does. It was in the age of absolute monarchy launched by Louix XIV in the 17th century that the likes of Poussin and Le Brun put France in the forefront of European art. Versailles found its stately mirror in the powerful idea of classicism – a painting style, enduring in later artists like Ingres, whose austerity and grandeur express the authority of a world where Jove is very much in his throne.&lt;ref&gt;jonathanjonesblog&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic revolution of style ==

[http://www.art-head-start.com/3d/squid/revolution300.jpg Here] is an example of an Artistic Revolution Pieces

== Scientific and Technological ==

Not all artistic revolutions were political. Sometimes, science and technological innovations have brought about unforeseen transformations in the works of artists.  The stylistic revolution known as [[Impressionism]],  by painters eager to more accurately capture the changing colors of light and shadow, is inseparable from discoveries and inventions in the mid-19th century in which the style was born.

[[Eugene Chevreul]], a French chemist hired as director of dyes at a French tapestry works,  began to investigate the optical nature of color in order to improve color in fabrics.  Chevreul realized It was the eye, and not the dye, that had the greatest influence on color, and from this, he revolutionized color theory by grasping what came to be called the law of simultaneous contrast: that colors mutually influence one another when juxtaposed, each imposing its own complementary color on the other.  The French painter Eugène Delacroix, who had been experimenting with what he called broken tones,  embraced Chevreul's book, "The Law of Contrast of Color (1839) with its explanations of how juxtaposed colors can enhance or diminish each other, and his exploration of all the visible colors of the spectrum.  Inspired by Chevreul’s 1839 treatise, Delacroix passed his enthusiasm on to the young artists who were inspired by him. It was Chevreul who led the Impressionists to grasp that they should apply separate brushstrokes of pure color to a canvas and allow the viewer’s eye to combine them optically.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Eugene-Chevreul&lt;/ref&gt;

They were aided greatly in this by innovations in oil paint itself. Since the Renaissance,  painters had to grind pigment, add oil and thus create their own paints; these time-consuming paints also quickly dried out, making studio painting a necessity for large works, and limiting painters to mix one or two colors at a time and fill in an entire area using just that one color before it dried out.  in 1841, a little-known American painter named John G. Rand invented a simple improvement without which the Impressionist movement could not have occurred: the small, flexible tin tube with removable cap in which oil paints could be stored.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/never-underestimate-the-power-of-a-paint-tube-36637764/?no-ist, May 2013, by Perry Hurt&lt;/ref&gt;   Oil paints kept in such tubes stayed moist and usable -- and quite portable. For the first time since the Renaissance, painters were not trapped by the time frame of how quickly oil paint dried.

Paints in tubes could be easily loaded up and carried out into the real world,  to directly observe the play of color and natural light, in shadow and movement, to paint in the moment.  Selling the oil paint in tubes also brought about the arrival of dazzling new pigments -  chrome yellow, cadmium blue - invented by 19th century industrial chemists. The tubes freed the Impressionists to paint quickly, and across an entire canvas, rather than carefully delineated single-color sections at a time; in short, to sketch directly in oil - racing across the canvas in every color that came to hand and thus inspiring their name of "impressionists" - since such speedy, bold brushwork and dabs of separate colors made contemporary critics think their paintings were mere impressions, not finished paintings, which were to have no visible brush marks at all, seamless under layers of varnish.

Pierre-Auguste Renoir said, “Without colors in tubes, there would be no Cézanne, no Monet, no Pissarro, and no Impressionism.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/never-underestimate-the-power-of-a-paint-tube-36637764/#P4ovFKfbRLyMIhQT.99&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the careful, hyper-realistic techniques of French neo-classicism were seen as stiff and lifeless when compared to the remarkable new vision of the world as seen through the new invention of photography by the mid-1850s.  It was not merely that the increasing ability of this new invention, particularly by the French inventor Daguerre, made the realism of the painted image redundant as he deliberately competed in the Paris diorama with large-scale historical paintings.&lt;ref&gt;"Speculating Daguerre: Art and Enterprise in the Work of L. J. M. Daguerre" by Stephen C. Pinson, Chicago, (2012) p. 1-12&lt;/ref&gt;  The neo-classical subject matter,  limited by Academic tradition to Greek and Roman legends, historical battles and Biblical stories, seemed oppressively cliched and limited to artists eager to explore the actual world in front of their own eyes revealed by the camera - daily life, candid groupings of everyday people doing simple things, Paris itself, rural landscapes and most particularly the play of captured light -  not the imaginary lionizing of unseen past events.&lt;ref&gt;Review of "The Lens of Impressionism," at University of Michigan Museum of Art, October- Dec. 2009 by Simon Kelly, Volume 9, Issue 1 Spring 2010, http://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/spring10/the-lens-of-impressionism&lt;/ref&gt; Early photographs influenced Impressionist style by its use of asymmetry, cropping and most obviously the blurring of motion, as inadvertently captured in the very slow speeds of early photography.

 [[Edgar Degas]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]  - in their framing, use of color, light and shadow, subject matter  - put these innovations to work to create a new language of visual beauty and meaning.

== Faking revolution: the C.I.A. and Abstract Expressionism ==

Their initial break with realism into an exploration of light, color and the nature of paint was brought to an ultimate conclusion by the  [[Abstract Expressionists]] who broke away from recognizable content of any kind into works of pure shape, color and painterliness which emerged at the end of the second world war.  At first thought of as primitive, inept works - as in "my four year old could do that"—these works were misunderstood and neglected until given critical and support by the rise of art journalists and critics who championed their work in the 1940s and 50's,  expressing the power of such work in aesthetic terms the artists themselves seldom used, or even understood.  [[Jackson Pollock]] who pioneered splatter painting, dispensing with a paint brush altogether, soon became lionized as the angry young man in a large spread in Life Magazine.

In fact, in a deliberate, secret and successful effort to separate artistic revolutions from political ones,  abstract expressionists like Pollack, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko, while seemingly difficult, pathbreaking artists, were in fact secretly supported for twenty years by the C.I.A. in a Cold War policy begun in 1947 to prove that the United States could foster more artistic freedom than the Soviet bloc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html&lt;/ref&gt;  "It was recognized that Abstract Expressionism was the kind of art that made Socialist Realism look even more stylized and rigid and confined than it was, " said former C.I.A. case worker Donald Jameson, who finally broke the silence on this program in 1995.  Ironically, the covert C.I.A. support for these radical works was required because an attempt to use government funds for a European tour of these works during the Truman administration led to a public uproar in conservative McCarthy-era America, with Truman famously remarking, "If that's art, I'm a Hottentot."  Thus the program was hidden under the guise of fabricated foundations and the support of wealthy patrons who were actually using C.I.A. funds, not their own, to sponsor traveling exhibitions of American abstract expressionists all over the world, publish books and articles praising them and to purchase and exhibit Abstract Expressionist works in major American and British museums. Thomas Braden, in charge of these cultural programs for the C.I.A.. in the early years of the Cold War, had formerly been executive secretary of the Museum of Modern Art, America's leading institution for 20th Century art and the charges of collusion between the two echoed for many years after this program was revealed, though most of the artists involved had no idea they were being used in this way and were furious when they found out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/17/unpopular-front&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic Movements ==

=== [[Art in ancient Greece|Ancient &amp; Classical Art]] ===
Key dates: 15000 BCE / 400 BCE-200CE / 350 CE-450CE&lt;br /&gt;
Ancient - There are few remaining examples with early art often favouring drawing over colour. Work has been found recently in tombs, Egyptian frescoes, pottery and metalwork.&lt;br /&gt;
Classical - Relating to or from ancient Roman or Greek architecture and art. Mainly concerned with geometry and symmetry rather than individual expression.&lt;br /&gt;
Byzantine - A religious art characterised by large domes, rounded arches and mosaics from the eastern Roman Empire in the 4th Century.&lt;ref name=artmovements&gt;http://www.artmovements.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Gothic architecture|Medieval &amp; Gothic]]===
Key dates: 400CE&lt;br /&gt;
Medieval - A highly religious art beginning in the 5th Century in Western Europe. It was characterised by iconographic paintings illustrating scenes from the bible.&lt;br /&gt;
Gothic - This style prevailed between the 12th century and the 16th century in Europe. Mainly an architectural movement, Gothic was characterised by its detailed ornamentation most noticeably the pointed archways and elaborate rib vaulting.&lt;br /&gt;
First developed in France, Gothic was intended as a solution to the inadequacies of Romanesque architecture. It allowed for cathedrals to be built with thinner walls and it became possible to introduce stained glass windows instead of traditional mosaic decorations. Some of the finest examples of the style include the cathedrals of Chartres, Reims and Amiens. The term was also used to describe sculpture and painting that demonstrated a greater degree of naturalism.&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Renaissance]]===
Key dates: 14th century&lt;br /&gt;
This movement began in Italy in the 14th century and the term, literally meaning rebirth, describes the revival of interest in the artistic achievements of the Classical world. Initially in a literary revival Renaissance was determined to move away from the religion-dominated Middle Ages and to turn its attention to the plight of the individual man in society. It was a time when individual expression and worldly experience became two of the main themes of Renaissance art. The movement owed a lot to the increasing sophistication of society, characterised by political stability, economic growth and cosmopolitanism. Education blossomed at this time, with libraries and academies allowing more thorough research to be conducted into the culture of the antique world. In addition, the arts benefited from the patronage of such influential groups as the Medici family of Florence, the Sforza family of Milan and Popes Julius II and Leo X. The works of Petrarch first displayed the new interest in the intellectual values of the Classical world in the early 14th century and the romance of this era as rediscovered in the Renaissance period can be seen expressed by Boccaccio. Leonardo da Vinci was the archetypal Renaissance man representing the humanistic values of the period in his art, science and writing. Michelangelo and Raphael were also vital figures in this movement, producing works regarded for centuries as embodying the classical notion of perfection. Renaissance architects included Alberti, Brunelleschi and Bramante. Many of these artists came from Florence and it remained an important centre for the Renaissance into the 16th century eventually to be overtaken by Rome and Venice. Some of the ideas of the Italian Renaissance did spread to other parts of Europe, for example to the German artist Albrecht Dürer of the 'Northern Renaissance'. But by the 16th century Mannerism had overtaken the Renaissance and it was this style that caught on in Europe. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, Filippo Brunelleschi, Raphael da Urbino, Titian, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Donatello Bardi.&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Mannerism]]===
Key dates: 1520-1600&lt;br /&gt;
Artists of the Early Renaissance and the High Renaissance developed their characteristic styles from the observation of nature and the formulation of a pictorial science. When Mannerism matured after 1520(The year Raphael died), all the representational problems had been solved. A body of knowledge was there to be learned. Instead of nature as their teacher, Mannerist artists took art. While Renaissance artists sought nature to find their style, the Mannerists looked first for a style and found a manner. In Mannerist paintings, compositions can have no focal point, space can be ambiguous, figures can be characterized by an athletic bending and twisting with distortions, exaggerations, an elastic elongation of the limbs, bizarre posturing on one hand, graceful posturing on the other hand, and a rendering of the heads as uniformly small and oval. The composition is jammed by clashing colors, which is unlike what we've seen in the balanced, natural, and dramatic colors of the High Renaissance. Mannerist artwork seeks instability and restlessness. There is also a fondness for allegories that have lascivious undertones. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Andrea del Sarto, Jacopo da Pontormo, Correggio&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Baroque]]===
Key dates: 17th century&lt;br /&gt;
Baroque Art emerged in Europe around 1600, as a reaction against the intricate and formulaic Mannerist style which dominated the Late Renaissance. Baroque Art is less complex, more realistic and more emotionally affecting than Mannerism.&lt;br /&gt;
This movement was encouraged by the Catholic Church, the most important patron of the arts at that time, as a return to tradition and spirituality.&lt;br /&gt;
One of the great periods of art history, Baroque Art was developed by Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, and Gianlorenzo Bernini, among others. This was also the age of Rubens, Rembrandt, Velázquez, and Vermeer.&lt;br /&gt;
In the 18th century, Baroque Art was replaced by the more elegant and elaborate Rococo style.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Gianlorenzo Bernini, Rubens, Rembrandt, Nicolas Poussin&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Rococo]]===
Key dates: 18th century&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout the 18th century in France, a new wealthy and influential middle-class was beginning to rise, even though the royalty and nobility continued to be patrons of the arts. Upon the death of Louis XIV and the abandonment of Versailles, the Paris high society became the purveyors of style. This style, primarily used in interior decoration, came to be called Rococo. The term Rococo was derived from the French word "rocaille", which means pebbles and refers to the stones and shells used to decorate the interiors of caves. Therefore, shell forms became the principal motif in Rococo. The society women competed for the best and most elaborate decorations for their houses. Hence the Rococo style was highly dominated by the feminine taste and influence.&lt;br /&gt;
François Boucher was the 18th century painter and engraver whose works are regarded as the perfect expression of French taste in the Rococo period. Trained by his father who was a lace designer, Boucher won fame with his sensuous and light-hearted mythological paintings and landscapes. He executed important works for both the Queen of France and Mme. de Pompadour, Louis XV's mistress, who was considered the most powerful woman in France at the time. Boucher was Mme. de Pompadour's favorite artist and was commissioned by her for numerous paintings and decorations. Boucher also became the principal designer for the royal porcelain factory and the director of the Gobelins tapestry factory. The Vulcan Presenting Venus with Arms for Aeneas is a template for a tapestry made by this factory. &lt;br /&gt;
Characterized by elegant and refined yet playful subject matters, Boucher's style became the epitome of the court of Louis XV. His style consisted of delicate colors and gentle forms painted within a frivolous subject matter. His works typically utilized delightful and decorative designs to illustrate graceful stories with Arcadian shepherds, goddesses and cupids playing against a pink and blue sky. These works mirrored the frolicsome, artificial and ornamented decadence of the French aristocracy of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
The Rococo is sometimes considered a final phase of the Baroque period.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
François Boucher, William Hogarth, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Angelica Kauffman, Giovanni Antonio Canaletto, Velázquez Vermeer&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Neoclassicism|Neo-classical]]===
Key dates: 1750-1880&lt;br /&gt;
A nineteenth-century French art style and movement that originated as a reaction to the Baroque. It sought to revive the ideals of ancient Greek and Roman art. Neoclassic artists used classical forms to express their ideas about courage, sacrifice, and love of country. David and Canova are examples of neo-classicists.&lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
Jacques-Louis David, Sir Henry Raeburn, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Thomas Gainsborough, Antonio Canova, Arnold Bocklin&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

===[[Romanticism]]===
Key dates: 1800-1880&lt;br /&gt;
Romanticism was basically a reaction against Neoclassicism, it is a deeply felt style which is individualistic, beautiful, exotic, and emotionally wrought.&lt;br /&gt;
Although Romanticism and Neoclassicism were philosophically opposed, they were the dominant European styles for generations, and many artists were affected to a greater or lesser degree by both. Artists might work in both styles at different times or even mix the styles, creating an intellectually Romantic work using a Neoclassical visual style, for example.&lt;br /&gt;
Great artists closely associated with Romanticism include J.M.W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich, John Constable, and William Blake.&lt;br /&gt;
In the United States, the leading Romantic movement was the Hudson River School of dramatic landscape painting.&lt;br /&gt;
Obvious successors of Romanticism include the Pre-Raphaelite movement and the Symbolists. But Impressionism, and through it almost all of 20th-century art, is also firmly rooted in the Romantic tradition. &lt;br /&gt;
Representative artists:&lt;br /&gt;
George Stubbs, William Blake, John Martin, Francisco Goya, Sir Thomas Lawrence, John Constable, Eugène Delacroix, Sir Edwin landseer, Caspar David Friedrich, JMW Turner&lt;ref name=artmovements/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5546">The '''Sex Orientation Scale''' ('''SOS''') was [[Harry Benjamin]]'s attempt to classify and understand various forms and subtypes of [[transvestism]] and [[transsexualism]] in biological males, published in 1966.&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"&gt;Benjamin, Harry (1966). ''The Transsexual Phenomenon.'' The Julian Press, {{ISBN|9780446824262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heath|first=Rachel Ann|title=The Praeger Handbook of Transsexuality: Changing Gender to Match Mindset|year=2006|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.

''[[Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy]]'' Volume 1, Issue 3, 1975 doi:10.1080/00926237508405291&lt;/ref&gt; Much like Kinsey's understanding of sexual orientation, Benjamin understood the nature of gender identity and gender expression not as a discrete scale, but as a spectrum, a continuum with many variations.  However the Benjamin scale does not reflect a modern understanding of gender identity and is not useful as a contemporary diagnostic tool, especially due to its conflation of gender identity with sexual orientation.

Benjamin noted, "It must be emphasized again that the remaining six types are not and never can be sharply separated."&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"/&gt;
Benjamin added a caveat: "It has been the intention here to point out the possibility of several conceptions and classifications of the transvestitic and the transsexual phenomenon. Future studies and observations may decide which one is likely to come closest to the truth and in this way a possible understanding of the etiology may be gained."&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"/&gt;

Benjamin's Scale references and uses Alfred Kinsey's sexual orientation scale to distinguish between "true transsexualism" and "transvestism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frayser|first=Suzanne G.|title=Studies in Human Sexuality: A Selected Guide|year=1995|publisher=Libr.

== Modern views ==
Contemporary views on gender identity and classification differ markedly from Harry Benjamin's original opinions.&lt;ref name="Ekins2005"&gt;Ekins, Richard (2005). Science, politics and clinical intervention: Harry Benjamin, transsexualism and the problem of heteronormativity ''[[Sexualities (journal)|Sexualities]]'' July 2005 vol. 8 no. 3 306-328 doi: 10.1177/1363460705049578&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual orientation is no longer regarded a criterion for diagnosis, or for distinction between transsexuality, transvestism and other forms of gender variant behavior and expression.  Modern views also exclude fetishistic transvestism from the spectrum of transsexual identity/classification, this type of transvestism is not related to gender expression or identity but is a distinctly sexual phenomenon most commonly practised by people who are neither transsexual nor homosexual. Benjamin's scale was designed for use with [[trans women]], and [[trans men]]'s identities do not align with these categories.&lt;ref name="Hansbury2008"&gt;Hansbury, Griffin (2008). The Middle Men: An Introduction to the Transmasculine Identities. ''[[Studies in Gender and Sexuality]]''  Volume 6, Issue 3, 2005 doi:10.1080/15240650609349276&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Communication Association''' ('''CCA'''; or '''Association canadienne de communication''' '''ACC''' in French) is a national, bilingual association of communications researchers, educators, and private and public sector professionals in Canada. Established in 1979, the CCA/ACC "seeks to advance communication research and studies in the belief that a better understanding of communication is crucial to building a vibrant society."&lt;ref name=Annual&gt;{{cite web|title=CCA Annual Meeting|url=http://www.acc-cca.ca/annualmeeting|website=CCA|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ali|first1=Christopher|title=The Canadian Communication Tradition|journal=inMedia: The French Journal of Media Studies|date=2013|volume=4|url=https://inmedia.revues.org/696#tocfrom1n2|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1970s===
The creation of the CCA has been considered to be due in part to research that emerged out of the ''Ontario Royal Commission on Violence in the Communications Industry'' ([[Judy LaMarsh|LaMarsh Commission]]) of 1976. This commission drew together a number of scholars who later met at a conference in the University of Windsor in 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=British Journal of Canadian Studies|title=The Ontario Royal Commission on Violence in the Communications Industry: Twenty years later|author-last=Tate|author-first=Eugene|year=1998|volume = 1| issue = 13 | page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1979 in Philadelphia where the presentations tended to focus on research that came out of the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Canadian Journal of Communication | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | year = 2000 | author-last = Tate | author-first = Eugene | title = The Beginnings of Communication Studies in Canada: Concluding Comments: Canadian Journal of Communication and the LaMarsh Commission | url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/1144/1063}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this same year, the CCA was established on June 1, 1979 during the ''Learned Societies Conference'' (now the [[Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences|Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences]]) in Saskatoon, Canada.&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tate|first=Eugene|date=1979|title=Canadian Communication Association Founded: Reflections on the Saskatoon Meeting|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/221|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.22230/cjc.1979v6n1a221|issn=1499-6642}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Homer|first=Joan|date=1980|title=The Spectrum of Communication: Can it survive the politics of association?|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/236/142|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-existing [[Canadian Journal of Communication]] was voted to be the official journal of the association.&lt;ref name=Tate/&gt; However, discussions over this arrangement led to the absence of any legally binding relationship between the two. The journal exists independently of the association and is owned by its subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Gilbert | editor-first1 = John | editor-last2 = Lorimer | editor-first2 = Rowland |editor-last3 = Patrick | editor-first3 = Ruth J | title = Scholarly communication in the next millennium: Selected papers from Canada's Policy Conference | publisher = Canadian Journal of Communication Corporation | location = Vancouver | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780969898320 | page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
Part of the activities of the CCA in its early years was to address the combination of unique Canadian perspectives and the burgeoning theories on the nature and definition of communication. Advancing the debate, especially at early CCA meetings and conferences were "pioneers of Canadian communication studies"&lt;ref name=Fouts&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fouts|first=Gregory|date=2000|title=The Beginnings of Communication Studies in Canada: The Canadian Communication Association and the Canadian Journal of Communication: Some Reminiscences and Trends|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/1142|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|issn=1499-6642}}&lt;/ref&gt; including: Earle Beattie, William Gilsdorf, Garth Jowett, Annie Mear, William Melody, Walter Romanow, Paul Rutherford, Liora Salter, Eugene Tate, [[James R.

Indeed, "[t]he politics of the Canadian Communication Association was grounded in the search for an answer to the very definition of communication."&lt;ref name=Fouts/&gt; The creation of the CCA and has been described as a part of the larger trend to establish the interdisciplinary field of [[communication]] as part of emergent scholarly, professional, and corporate activities in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Graff | first = Harvey | title = Undisciplining knowledge : interdisciplinarity in the twentieth century | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781421417455|page=84;248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Toby | title = Global Media Studies | publisher = Wiley | location = Chicester | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780745693064 |page=Table 1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Croucher | first = Stephen | title = Understanding communication theory : a beginner's guide | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781317751373|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, news and discussion about the association was communicated by an [[electronic mailing list]] called CCANet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher=Association of Research Libraries, Office of Scientific and Academic Publishing | title=Directory of Electronic Journals, Newsletters, and Academic Discussion Lists| year=1991|volume=1-2|ISSN=1057-1337|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=KmrgAAAAMAAJ|LCCN=92649836|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later half of the 1990s, the 
Association for the Study of Canadian Radio and Television (ASCRT) / Association des études sur la radio-télévision canadienne (AERTC) ended its term as an association and merged with the CCA due to a lack of interest from young scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Bredin | editor-first1 = Marian | editor-last2 = Henderson | editor-first2 = Scott| editor-last3 = Matheson | editor-first3 = Sarah A. |author-first = Mary J. | author-last=Miller | chapter = From Kine to Hi-Def: A personal view of Television Studies in Canada | title = Canadian television : text and context | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | location = Waterloo, Ontario, Canada | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781554583898 | page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the music context, the term '''chroma feature''' or '''chromagram''' closely relates to the twelve different [[pitch classes]]. Chroma-based features, which are also referred to [[Harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]], are a powerful tool for analyzing music whose pitches can be meaningfully categorized (often into twelve categories) and whose tuning approximates to the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered scale]]. One main property of chroma features is that they capture harmonic and melodic characteristics of music, while being robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation.

==Definition==

The underyling observation is that humans perceive two musical pitches as similar in color if they differ by an octave. Based on this observation, a pitch can be separated into two components, which are referred to as ''tone height'' and ''chroma''.&lt;ref name=Shepard64_pitch_ASA&gt;
{{cite journal
|last=Shepard
|first=Roger N.
|title=Circularity in judgments of relative pitch
|journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America
|volume=36
|issue=212
|date=1964
|pages=2346–2353}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered scale]], one considers twelve chroma values represented by the set

:{C, C{{music|#}}, D, D{{music|#}}, E ,F, F{{music|#}}, G, G{{music|#}}, A, A{{music|#}}, B}

that consists of the twelve pitch spelling attributes as used in Western music notation. Note that in the equal-tempered scale different pitch spellings such
C{{music|#}} and D{{music|b}} refer to the same chroma. Enumerating the chroma values, one can identify the set of chroma values with the set of integers {1,2,...,12}, where 1 refers to chroma C, 2 to C{{music|#}}, and so on. A [[pitch class]] is defined as the set of all pitches that share the same chroma. For example, using the [[scientific pitch notation]], the pitch class corresponding to the chroma C is the set

:{..., C&lt;sub&gt;−2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ...}

consisting of all pitches separated by an integer number of octaves. Given a music representation (e.g. a musical score or an audio recording), the  main idea of chroma features is to aggregate for a given local time window (e.g. specified in beats or in seconds) all information that relates to a given chroma into a single coefficient. Shifting the time window across the music representation results in a sequence of chroma features each expressing how the representation's pitch content within the time window is spread over the twelve chroma bands. The resulting time-chroma representation is also referred to as [[chromagram]]. The figure above shows chromagrams for a C-major scale, once obtained from a musical score and once from an audio recording. Because of the close relation between the terms chroma and pitch class, chroma features are also referred to as [[Harmonic pitch class profiles|pitch class profiles]].

==Applications==
Identifying pitches that differ by an octave, chroma features show a high degree of robustness to variations in timbre and closely correlate to the musical aspect of harmony. This is the reason why chroma features are a well-established tool for processing and analyzing music data.&lt;ref name=Mueller15_FundamentalsMusicProcessig_SPRINGER&gt;

==Computation of audio chromagrams==
There are many ways for converting an audio recording into a chromagram. For example, the conversion of an audio recording into a chroma representation (or chromagram) may be performed either by using short-time Fourier transforms in combination with binning strategies&lt;ref name=BartschW05_chroma_IEEEMULTIMEDIA&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; or by employing suitable multirate filter banks.&lt;ref name=MuellerKC05_ChromaFeatures_ISMIR/&gt;
Furthermore, the properties of chroma features can be significantly changed by
introducing suitable pre- and post-processing steps modifying spectral, temporal,
and dynamical aspects. This leads to a large number of chroma variants, which
may show a quite different behavior in the context of a specific music analysis scenario.&lt;ref name=MuellerE11_ChromaToolbox_ISMIR&gt;

== Religious cognition ==
Research in [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that the brain is a coordinated network of domain-specific modules corresponding to various adaptations that emerged in our evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=H. Clark|last2=Kurzban|first2=Robert|title=Modularity in Cognition: Framing the Debate|journal=Psychological Review|date=2006|volume=113|issue=3|pages=628–647|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.113.3.628|pmid=16802884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fodor|first1=Jerry A.|title=The modularity of mind: an essay on faculty psychology|date=1984|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.

These modules are co-opted to give rise to religious thinking patterns, and they include [[theory of mind]], [[Essentialism|essential psychology]] and the [[hyperactive agency detection device]].&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt; Moreover, the cultural transmission of these ideas is contingent upon them being minimally counterintuitive.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atran|first1=Scott|last2=Henrich|first2=Joseph|title=The Evolution of Religion: How Cognitive By-Products, Adaptive Learning Heuristics, Ritual Displays, and Group Competition Generate Deep Commitments to Prosocial Religions|journal=Biological Theory|date=January 2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=18–30|doi=10.1162/BIOT_a_00018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of mind ===
Theory of mind (ToM) is a capacity to attribute mental states, complete with thoughts, emotions and motivations, to other social agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Premack|first1=David|last2=Woodruff|first2=Guy|title=Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=4 February 2010|volume=1|issue=04|pages=515|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00076512}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation is ubiquitous in primitive forms among various social species, but the complexity of human social life for long stretches of evolutionary history has facilitated a rich understanding of others' mental experiences to match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|editor1-last=Buss|editor1-first=David|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|date=2016|edition=2nd|chapter=Reputation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of [[autism]] have been cited in support for the proposition that ToM is a distinct modular adaptation because of its distinctly narrow impact on ToM capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron-Cohen|first1=Simon|title=Mindblindness: an essay on autism and theory of mind|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass [u.a.]|isbn=026252225X|edition=1. pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ToM is thought to lend itself to an intuitive sense of [[mind-body dualism]], where the material body is animated by a non-material self (i.e., a "soul").&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pursosis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purzycki &amp; Sosis|editor1-last=Ulrich|editor1-first=Frey|title=Essential Building Blocks of Human Nature|date=2011|chapter=Our Gods: Variation in Supernatural Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Essentialism ===
[[Folk psychology]] among humans is characterized by essential thinking, or a tendency to interpret objects in terms of "essences." This means that attributions of objects' underlying realities are intuitively inferred from a [[fuzzy set]] of the object's [[Ontology|ontological]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=Deborah A.|last2=Miller|first2=Dale T.|title=Psychological Essentialism of Human Categories|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=202–206|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00504.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive interpretations of essence give rise to concepts of purity, simplified good and evil concepts, and intuitive senses of meaning applied to teleology.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt;

=== Hyperactive agency detection device ===
The capacity for agent detection has been an important modular adaptation for predator avoidance in humans. Some have called this mechanism a hyperactive agency detection device because of its fairly high rate of erroneous agency applications. In a potential predator situation, humans are forced to interpret an object's ontological features, infer agency or non-agency, and execute a behavioral response. Evolutionary theorists have cited the relatively low costs of incorrect agency inferences and the severe [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] costs of detection failure as a reason to suspect that a tendency to interpret naturalistic processes as agent behaviors is an adaptation.&lt;ref name="boyer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyer|first1=Pascal|title=Religion explained : the evolutionary origins of religious thought|date=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465006960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=K.|last2=Wegner|first2=D. M.|title=Blaming God for Our Pain: Human Suffering and the Divine Mind|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=19 November 2009|volume=14|issue=1|pages=7–16|doi=10.1177/1088868309350299}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a cognitive bias that leads humans to reason about objects and processes in agentive terms.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; This is particularly foundational to beliefs in a god or gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Justin L.|title=Why would anyone believe in God?|date=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, MD [u.a.]|isbn=978-0759106673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minimally counterintuitive beliefs ===
The integration of ToM, hyperactive applications of agency and essential psychology ultimately renders a cognitive tendency for humans to interact with the naturalistic processes of the world with the [[intentional stance]]. This is a perspective from which humans reason that objects and processes may be enacting behaviors intentionally, with meaningful, rational mental states of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel C.|title=The intentional stance|date=1989|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262540533|edition=1st MIT Press paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious beliefs are successfully transmitted if they are compatible with the cognitive tools that reconstruct them upon reception. This means that they must be minimally counterintuitive, or that they violate few enough ontological features of an object or process, to make general sense while remaining memorable violations nonetheless.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich" /&gt; For example, the concept of a [[ghost]] exploits existing intuitions about mind-body dualism and only violates the usual coupling of mind and body. This creates a memorable concept of a non-material person that can move through walls and have motives of its own. On the other hand, a highly counterintuitive idea about an object that violates several of its ontological features, like a jealous Frisbee, is less likely to be [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted]]. This is because it is cognitively demanding, not easily reconstructed by the brain and thus, not easily reasoned about and remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mesoudi|first1=Alex|title=Cultural Evolution. ; How Darwinian Theory Can Explain Human Culture and Synthesize the Social Sciences.|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226520445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious behaviors associated with culturally transmitted god concepts can be conceptualized as phenotypic strategies associated with the informational makeup of that cultural concept.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Successfully transmitted religious concepts typically involve minimally counterintuitive violations of the intentional stance, which serves a cognitive constraint of cultural evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Joseph|last2=Boyd|first2=Robert|last3=Richerson|first3=Peter J.|title=Five Misunderstandings About Cultural Evolution|journal=Human Nature|date=19 April 2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=119–137|doi=10.1007/s12110-008-9037-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ecological factors also play a role in determining which religious behaviors (and their god concepts) are more likely to be replicated.&lt;ref name="purzinpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=The Evolution of Gods' Minds in the Tyva Republic|journal=Current Anthropology|date=13 April 2016|pages=S000–S000|doi=10.1086/685729|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that religious rituals associated with salient representational models of gods' minds and concerns are more likely to survive when they are adaptive strategies.&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin G.|last2=Finkel|first2=Daniel N.|last3=Shaver|first3=John|last4=Wales|first4=Nathan|last5=Cohen|first5=Adam B.|last6=Sosis|first6=Richard|title=What Does God Know?

== Ecology of god concepts ==
Cross-culturally, representational models of gods' minds take an array of diverse forms, such as anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures, abstract forces, or some combination of these. Models of gods' minds typically fall within a spectrum between two extremes: on one end there are Big Gods, and on the other there are Local Gods.&lt;ref name="norenbiggods"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|title=Big gods : how religion transformed cooperation and conflict|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0691151212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big Gods are usually moralistic, punitive and omniscient, whereas Local Gods are often concerned about ritual behaviors, amoral and limited in knowledge.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; The subject matter that gods are believed to care across cultures fall into three categories, but may involve an admixture of more than one. These categories are (1) behaviors toward other people, (2) behaviors toward the gods themselves and (3) behaviors toward nature and/or the environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While people impute these concerns to gods' minds, they often correspond to ecological challenges.&lt;ref name="botero" /&gt; This correspondence establishes why religious ideas often covary with ecological problems in the social and natural world: because these ideas enact behavioral strategies that solve them.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="norenbiggods" /&gt;

=== Large-scale cooperation ===
Cases of large-scale [[cooperation]] in complex societies are a widely studied example of a socioecological problem that religious beliefs address. Existing models of human cooperation have included [[kin selection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=W.D.|title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 1964|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4|pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[reciprocal altruism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trivers|first1=Robert L.|title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=March 1971|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[indirect reciprocity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leimar|first1=O|last2=Hammerstein|first2=P|title=Evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 April 2001|volume=268|issue=1468|pages=745–53|pmid=11321064|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1573|pmc=1088665}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowak|first1=Martin A.|last2=Sigmund|first2=Karl|title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring|journal=Nature|date=11 June 1998|volume=393|issue=6685|pages=573–577|doi=10.1038/31225|pmid=9634232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Competitive altruism|competitive helping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|title=Competitive helping increases with the size of biological markets and invades defection|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 2011|volume=281|issue=1|pages=47–55|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.04.023|pmid=21550351}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models are robust across certain conditions likely relevant to the [[Pleistocene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=R.|last2=Richerson|first2=P. J.|title=Culture and the evolution of human cooperation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=5 October 2009|volume=364|issue=1533|pages=3281–3288|doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cooperation is easily eroded in large-scale, complex societies with frequently anonymous interactions between strangers. This is because profitable defections dominate cooperative strategies due to a lack of significant threats of [[punishment]] to defectors.&lt;ref name="mathew"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathew|first1=S.|last2=Boyd|first2=R.|title=Punishment sustains large-scale cooperation in prestate warfare|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=13 June 2011|volume=108|issue=28|pages=11375–11380|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105604108|pmid=21670285|pmc=3136302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For large-scale cooperation to succeed, a cultural [[Coordination game|coordination solution]] stabilized by sanction threats must exist.&lt;ref name="purz12" /&gt;

[[Morality and religion|Religious rules addressing moral behavior]] are cultural coordination devices that can expand the scale of cooperative behavior by motivating [[Prosocial behavior|prosociality]].&lt;ref name="norenetalpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|last2=Shariff|first2=Azim F.|last3=Gervais|first3=Will M.|last4=Willard|first4=Aiyana K.|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita A.|last6=Slingerland|first6=Edward|last7=Henrich|first7=Joseph|title=The cultural evolution of prosocial religions|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2 December 2014|volume=39|doi=10.1017/S0140525X14001356}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important stipulation here is that these devices must be enforced by punishment threats for people who do not behave prosocially. Frequent instances of anonymity in large-scale societies and the costs associated with punishment undermine sanction threats, but widespread beliefs in morally punitive and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] gods effectively outsource the punishment costs to a pervasive social monitor. This can effectively motivate widespread prosocial behavior in large-scale, complex societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schloss|first1=Jeffrey P.|last2=Murray|first2=Michael J.|title=Evolutionary accounts of belief in supernatural punishment: a critical review|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=46–99|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2011.558707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has been empirically supported from a few different angles. For instance, the cross-cultural prevalence of omniscient, moralistic gods (i.e., Big Gods) is positively correlated with society size and complexity.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt; Examples of sharing behaviors in [[Experimental economics|experimental economic games]] played by large-scale societies also reveal more generous behaviors when individuals are primed with Big God concepts before the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xygalatas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Klocová|first2=Eva Kundtová|last3=Cigán|first3=Jakub|last4=Kundt|first4=Radek|last5=Maňo|first5=Peter|last6=Kotherová|first6=Silvie|last7=Mitkidis|first7=Panagiotis|last8=Wallot|first8=Sebastian|last9=Kanovsky|first9=Martin|title=Location, Location, Location: Effects of Cross-Religious Primes on Prosocial Behavior|journal=The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|date=9 November 2015|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/10508619.2015.1097287|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shariff|first1=A.

When distant strangers of the same religion were paired in a game, their sharing behaviors were significantly more generous if their common beliefs involved Big God concepts. The researchers of this study argue that this supports the hypothesis stating that widespread beliefs in omniscient, morally punitive Big Gods may have contributed to the expansion of prosocial behavior.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="corelig16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|last2=Apicella|first2=Coren|last3=Atkinson|first3=Quentin D.|last4=Cohen|first4=Emma|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita Anne|last6=Willard|first6=Aiyana K.|last7=Xygalatas|first7=Dimitris|last8=Norenzayan|first8=Ara|last9=Henrich|first9=Joseph|title=Moralistic gods, supernatural punishment and the expansion of human sociality|journal=Nature|date=10 February 2016|volume=530|issue=7590|pages=327–330|doi=10.1038/nature16980|pmid=26863190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costly signaling ===
Concerns attributed to gods about how people behave toward the gods themselves are widespread and not easily disentangled from specific ecological conditions. The reason is intuitive; [[rational agent]]s who do not care about their treatment are counterintuitive. Researchers investigating the socioecological functions of ritual behaviors in deference to gods claim that functionally, these rituals serve as costly signals of commitment to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sosis|first1=Richard|last2=Bressler|first2=Eric R.|title=Cooperation and Commune Longevity: A Test of the Costly Signaling Theory of Religion|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|date=1 May 2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=211–239|doi=10.1177/1069397103037002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costly ritual displays are particularly public and ubiquitous in small-scale societies, functioning as social devices that promote intragroup cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Ronald|last2=Xygalatas|first2=Dimitris|title=Extreme Rituals as Social Technologies|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|date=6 November 2014|volume=14|issue=5|pages=345–355|doi=10.1163/15685373-12342130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reputations related to trustworthiness can be significantly based on adherence to ritual behavior expectations,&lt;ref name="purz11"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Tyvan                            and the socioecological constraints of supernatural agents' minds|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=31–45|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2010.550723}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fulfillment of these expectations are often a joint function of other behavioral strategies relevant to separate domains of gods' concerns.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt; More broadly, religious costly signals are an implicit expression of honest commitment to the rest of the group, indicating that the signaler is a dedicated part of other aspect of the group's coordinated solution strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulbulia|first1=Joseph|last2=Sosis|first2=Richard|title=Signalling theory and the evolution of religious cooperation|journal=Religion|date=September 2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=363–388|doi=10.1080/0048721X.2011.604508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small- and large-scale societies alike, these rituals often coexist with other categories of gods' concerns.

=== Resource management ===
Resource management and the prevention of material insecurity are more commonly associated with gods' concerns among small-scale societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=Rita Anne|last2=Norenzayan|first2=Ara|last3=Henrich|first3=Joseph|title=Supernatural punishment, in-group biases, and material insecurity: experiments and ethnography from Yasawa, Fiji|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=18 June 2014|volume=6|issue=1|pages=34–55|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2014.921235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=PurzyckI|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Toward a Cognitive Ecology of Religious Concepts: Evidence from the Tyva Republic|journal=Journal for the Cognitive Science of Religion|date=13 August 2012|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1558/jcsr.v1i1.99}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other aspects of religious belief often address social interactions, problems of resource acquisition and security extend from attributed gods' concerns about peoples' interactions with their natural environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An example of this effect has been alluded to by anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]], who wrote about the economic reasons that [[Hindu]] beliefs, holding cows as sacred and forbidden from slaughter, were adaptive. According to Harris, the long-standing and stable benefits derived from many Hindu peoples' use of cows for labor and sources of fuel and fertilizer seemed to outweigh the costs of not eating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Marvin|title=Cows, pigs, wars, &amp; witches : the riddles of culture|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0679724680|edition=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ethnographic example of an adaptive use of animal resources was described by [[Roy Rappaport]] in 1984, who considered the reasons for ritual pig sacrifice in [[Papua New Guinea]] during times of intergroup conflict. These pigs were consuming local peoples' resources and creating resource insecurities that put a strain on the local groups, escalating the intergroup competition for resources and fueling their conflict. Thus, the ritualistic sacrifices alleviated the strain on local resources and mitigated the hostilities between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rappaport|first1=Roy Abraham|title=Pigs for the ancestors : ritual in the ecology of a New Guinea people|date=2000|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Il.|isbn=978-1577661016|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[human behavioral ecology]] researchers have more recently studied burning practices among the Australian [[Martu people]] and the consequential increases in local biodiversity. These authors, in an ethnographic discussion of the Martu people, note that these burning practices stem from religious beliefs that their practices allow the world to continue existing as they know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bird|first1=R.

Another ethnographic example of religious beliefs facilitating resource management comes from the [[Tuva people|Tyva people]], a pastoralist population in southern [[Siberia]]. They associate ritual structures called cairns with local spirit masters (''cher eezi''). These structures demarcate local territories in which spirit masters reside, and the expectation to stop and give prayer offerings out of respect to ''cher eezi'' is embedded in peoples' beliefs about them. The ''cher eezi'' are believed to be amoral and care mostly about activity within their sacred territories, such as hunting and overexploiting resources that belong to them.&lt;ref name="purz11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13" /&gt; More recently, Tyva people have begun facing new challenges associated with urbanization (e.g., pollution, alcohol abuse), and the ''cher eezi'' have been more frequently believed to be concerned about these same problems.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;

{{Communication}}

'''Communication studies''' or '''communication sciences''' is an [[academic discipline]] that deals with processes of [[human communication]]. There are three types of communication: ''verbal'', involving listening to a person to understand the meaning of a message; ''written'', in which a message is read; and ''nonverbal'' communication involving observing a person and inferring meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Different Types of Communication and Channels|url=https://new.edu/resources/different-types-of-communication-and-channels--5|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310233148/https://new.edu/resources/different-types-of-communication-and-channels--5|website=New Charter University|archivedate=March 10, 2016|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation to [[mass media]] outlets, such as [[television broadcasting]].

Communication studies shares with [[cultural studies]] an interest in how messages are interpreted through the [[political]], [[cultural]], [[economic]], [[semiotic]], [[hermeneutic]], and [[social]] dimensions of their contexts. In [[political economics]], communication studies examines how the politics of [[ownership]] affects content. Quantitative communication studies examines [[statistics]] in order to help substantiate claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Statistical Methods for Communication Science|last = Hayes|first = Andrew F.|publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caffarel-Serra|first=Carmen|last2=Ortega|first2=Félix|last3=Gaitán|first3=Juan-Antonio|date=2018-07-01|title=Communication research in Spain: Weaknesses, threats, strengths and opportunities|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C56-2018-06|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=26|issue=56|doi=10.3916/c56-2018-06|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of communication studies}}
Communication science began in earnest when students of [[Wilbur Schramm]]—the founder of the [[Institute for Communications Research]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]]—namely [[David Berlo]], came to [[Michigan State University]] and founded the first General Communication Arts department in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It is still one of Michigan State's strongest programs and nationally ranked in the study of human communication.

== Scope ==
Communication studies integrates aspects of both social sciences and the humanities. As a [[social science]], the discipline overlaps with [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[political science]], [[economics]], and [[public policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last=Calhoun|first=Craig|date=2011|title=Communication as Social Science (And More) |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/files/ahcs/communication_as_social_science_and_more.pdf |journal=International Journal of Communication |publisher=McGill University |volume=5 |pages=1479–1496}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a humanities perspective, communication is concerned with rhetoric and persuasion (traditional graduate programs in communication studies trace their history to the rhetoricians of Ancient Greece). Humanities approaches to communication often overlap with history, philosophy, english, and cultural studies.

===In the United States===
Undergraduate curricula aim to prepare students to interrogate the nature of communication in society, and the development of communication as a specific field.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last=Morreale|first=Sherwyn|last2=Osborn|first2=Michael|last3=Pearson|first3=Judy|date=2000|title=Why Communication is Important: A Rationale for the Centrality of the Study of Communication|url=https://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/Chairs_Corner/Making_the_Case_for_and_Advancing_the_Discipline/PDF-ATD-JACA-Why_Communication_is_Important_%20Rationale_for_Centrality_of_the_Study_of_Communication.pdf|journal=Journal of the Association for Communication Administration|publisher=National Communication Association|volume=29|pages=1–25|access-date=2016-09-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105235213/https://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/Chairs_Corner/Making_the_Case_for_and_Advancing_the_Discipline/PDF-ATD-JACA-Why_Communication_is_Important_%20Rationale_for_Centrality_of_the_Study_of_Communication.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Communication Association]] (NCA) recognizes nine distinct but often overlapping sub-disciplines within the broader communication discipline: [[technical communication|technology]], critical-cultural, [[health communication|health]], [[intercultural communication|intercultural]], [[interpersonal communication|interpersonal]]-small group, mass communication, [[organizational communication|organizational]], [[political communication|political]], rhetorical, and [[environmental communication]]. Students take courses in these subject areas. Other programs and courses often integrated in communication programs include [[journalism]], [[film criticism]], [[theatre]], [[public relations]], [[political science]] (e.g., political campaign strategies, public speaking, effects of media on elections), as well as [[radio]], [[television]], [[computer-mediated communication]], [[film production]], and [[new media]].

=== In Canada ===
With the early influence of federal institutional inquiries, notably the 1951 [[Massey Commission]], which "investigated the overall state of culture in Canada,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/massey-commission-emc|title=Massey Commission {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the study of communication in Canada has frequently focused on the development of a cohesive national culture, and on infrastructural empires of social and material circulation. Although influenced by the American Communication tradition and [[British Cultural Studies]], Communication studies in Canada has been more directly oriented toward the state and the policy apparatus, for example the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]. Influential thinkers from the Canadian communication tradition include [[Harold Innis]], [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Florian Sauvageau]], [[Gertrude Joch Robinson|Gertrude Robinson]], [[Marc Raboy]], [[Dallas Smythe]], [[Gail Guthrie Valaskakis]] and [[George Grant (philosopher)|George Grant]].

{{wiktionary|connoisseur}}
A '''connoisseur''' ([[French language|French]] [[Reforms of French orthography|traditional]] (pre-1835) spelling of ''connaisseur'', from Middle-French ''connoistre'', then ''connaître'' meaning "to be acquainted with" or "to know somebody/something.") is a person who has a great deal of [[knowledge]] about the [[fine arts]], [[cuisine]]s, or an expert judge in matters of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]].  In many areas the term now has an air of pretension, and may be used in a partly [[irony|ironic]] sense, but in the [[art trade]] connoisseurship remains a crucial skill for the identification and attribution to individual artists of works by the [[Style (visual arts)|style]] and technique, where documentary evidence of [[provenance]] is lacking.  The situation in the [[wine trade]] is similar, for example in assessing the potential for ageing in a young wine through [[wine tasting]].

==Connoisseurship in art==
"The ability to tell almost instinctively who painted a picture is defined [...] as connoisseurship".&lt;ref name="arthistorynews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorynews.com/articles/1101_On_connoisseurship |title=On Connoisseurship| first=Bendor| last=Grosvenor |website=Arthistorynews.com |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Connoisseurs evaluate works of [[art]] on the basis of their experience of the [[Style (visual arts)|style]] and technique of artists. Judgment informed by [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] is essential, but it must be grounded in a thorough understanding of the work itself. On the basis of [[empirical evidence]], refinement of [[perception]] about [[wikt:technique|technique]] and [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]], and a disciplined method of analysis, the responsibility of the connoisseur is to [[:wikt:attribute|attribute]] [[authorship]], validate [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]] and appraise quality. These findings are crucial for the [[art valuation|valuation of works]], and can be collected and organized into a ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'' of the work of a single [[artist]] or a [[art school|school]].

In his ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (1955), [[Erwin Panofsky]] explains the difference between a connoisseur and an [[art historian]]: "The connoisseur might be defined as a [[laconic]] art historian, and the art historian as a loquacious connoisseur."

The English dealer and art historian, [[Philip Mould]] says, "it is about noticing things which have specific characteristics of the artists involved, as opposed to general characteristics of the era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/moversshakers/qa-bbcs-art-sleuth-philip-mould/1469.article |title=Interview by Gabriella Griffith |publisher=Londonlovesbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out the importance of condition and understanding what the artist originally painted (as opposed to how the painting now looks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art Detective|first=Philip|last=Mould|date=2009|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; His colleague, [[Bendor Grosvenor]] takes the view that connoisseurship is learned by looking at paintings and cannot be taught in the classroom. He believes that it has become unfashionable in the world of art history and as a result, activities such as producing a catalogue raisonné are undervalued by the art history establishment.&lt;ref name="arthistorynews1"/&gt; [[Svetlana Alpers]] confirms the art historians reservations that the identification of individual style in works is "essentially assigned to a group of specialists in the field known as conoisseurs".&lt;ref&gt;[[Svetlana Alpers|Alpers, Svetlana]], "Style is What You Make It", p. 139, in ''The Concept of Style'', ed. Berel Lang, (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1987), 137-162, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hgiUuMCOmOcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Concept+of+Style,+ed.+Berel+Lang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uXY8Ue2pAcSS7Ab5q4HgBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Concept%20of%20Style%2C%20ed.%20Berel%20Lang&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, [[Christie's]] Education offers an MA in the History of Art and the Art Market that includes a seminar on connoisseurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.edu/ny_ma_modconnhist.html |title=Christie's MA course components |publisher=Christies.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This covers "the critical skills needed to look at art, write about art, research and evaluate works, including handling and viewing art objects and visiting artists’ studios, conservation labs and museums."

===Earlier views of connoisseurship===
During the 18th century, the term was often used as a synonym for a still vaguer man of taste or a pretend [[critic]].

In 1760, [[Oliver Goldsmith]] said, "[[Painting]] is and has been and now will someday become the sole object of fashionable care; the title of connoisseur in that art is at present the safest passport into every fashionable Society; a well timed shrug, an admiring attitude and one or two exotic tones of exclamation are sufficient qualifications for men of low circumstances to curry favour."

In 1890, [[Giovanni Morelli]] wrote, "art connoisseurs say of art historians that they write about what they do not understand; art historians, on their side, disparage the connoisseurs, and only look upon them as the drudges who collect materials for them, but who personally have not the slightest knowledge of the physiology of art."

The attributions of painted pottery were an important project to the History of Ancient Art and Classical Archeology (Ancient Greece and South Italy). Two specialists were the most important authorities in archaeological connoisseurship: John Davidson Beazley (1885-1970) and Arthur Dale Trendall (1909-1995).

==Connoisseurs in other fields==
Connoisseur is also used in the context of [[gastronomy]], i.e. in connection with fine [[food]], [[beer]], [[wine]], [[tea]] and many other products whose consumption can be pleasing to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Connaisseur|"Connaisseur" in its original French]]{{Better source|date=December 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/Connaisseur |title='Connaisseur' in the '&amp;#39;Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales'&amp;#39;, 3rd meaning |publisher=Cnrtl.fr |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8799">'''Eco-innovation''' is the development of products and processes that contribute to [[sustainable development]], applying the commercial application of knowledge to elicit direct or indirect ecological improvements. This includes a range of related ideas, from [[environmentally friendly]] technological advances to socially acceptable innovative paths towards [[sustainability]]. The field of research that seeks to explain how, why, and at what rate new "ecological" [[Idea|ideas]] and [[technology]] spread is called [[eco-innovation diffusion]].

==Concept==

The idea of eco-innovation is fairly recent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Díaz-García|first=Cristina|last2=González-Moreno|first2=Ángela|last3=Sáez-Martínez|first3=Francisco J.|date=2015|title=Eco-innovation: insights from a literature review|journal=Innovation: Management, Policy &amp; Practice|volume=17|issue=1|pages=6–23|doi=10.1080/14479338.2015.1011060|issn=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first appearances of the concept of eco-innovation in the literature is in the book by Claude Fussler and Peter James.&lt;ref&gt;Fussler, C. &amp; P. James, 1996; ''Driving Eco-Innovation: A Breakthrough Discipline for Innovation and Sustainability'', Pitman Publishing: London, 364 p.&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent article, Peter James defines eco-innovation as "new products and processes which provide customer and business value but significantly decrease environmental impacts".&lt;ref name="james"&gt;James, P., 1997; 'The Sustainability Circle: a new tool for product development and design', ''Journal of Sustainable Product Design'' 2: 52:57, http://www.cfsd.org.uk/journal&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus Rennings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rennings|first=Klaus|date=2000|title=Redefining innovation - eco-innovation research and the contribution from ecological economics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800999001123|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=32|issue=2|pages=319–332|doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(99)00112-3|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduces the term eco-innovation addressing explicitly three kinds of changes towards sustainable development: technological, social and institutional innovation.

Eco-innovation is closely linked to a variety of related concepts. It is often used interchangeably with "[[environmental innovation]]", and is also often linked with [[environmental technology]], [[eco-efficiency]], [[Ecodesign|eco-design]], [[environmental design]], [[sustainable design]], or [[sustainable innovation]]. While the term "environmental innovation" is used in similar contexts to "eco-innovation", the other terms are mostly used when referring to product or process design, and therefore focus more on the technological aspects of eco-innovation rather than the societal or political aspects. [[Ecovation]] is the process by which responsible capitalism aligns with ecological innovation to construct products which have a generative nature and are recyclable back into the environment for usage in other industries.

===As a technological term===

The most common usage of the term "eco-innovation" is to refer to [[innovative]] products and processes that reduce environmental impacts. This is often used in conjunction with eco-efficiency and eco-design. Leaders in many industries have been developing innovative technologies in order to work towards [[sustainability]]. However, these are not always practical, or enforced by policy and legislation.

===As a social process===

Another position held (for example, by the organisation [http://www.eco-innovation.net Eco Innovation]) is that this definition should be complemented: eco-innovations should also bring greater social and cultural acceptance. In this view, this "social pillar" added to James's&lt;ref name="james" /&gt; definition is necessary because it determines learning and the effectiveness of eco-innovations. This approach gives eco-innovations a social component, a status that is more than a new type of commodity, or a new sector, even though [[environmental technology]] and eco-innovation are associated with the emergence of new economic activities or even branches (e.g., [[waste treatment]], [[recycling]], etc.). This approach considers eco-innovation in terms of usage rather than merely in terms of product. The social pillar associated with eco-innovation introduces a governance component that makes eco-innovation a more integrated tool for [[sustainable development]].

== Diffusion ==

'''Embodied music cognition''' is a direction within [[systematic musicology]] interested in studying the role of the human body in relation to all musical activities.

It considers the human body as the natural mediator between mind (focused on musical intentions, meanings, significations) and physical environment (containing musical sound and other types of energy that affords human action).

== Introduction ==
Given the impact of body movement on musical meaning formation and signification, the musical mind is said to be embodied. [[Embodied philosophy|Embodiment]]  assumes that what happens in the mind is depending on properties of the body, such as kinaesthetic properties.

Embodied music cognition tends to see music perception as based on action. For example, many people move when they listen to music. Through movement, it is assumed that people give meaning to music. This type of meaning-formation is corporeal, rather than cerebral because it is understood through the body. This is different from a disembodied approach to music cognition, which sees musical meaning as being based on a perception-based analysis of musical structure. The embodied grounding of music perception is based on a multi-modal encoding of auditory information and on principles that ensure the coupling of perception and action.

During the last decade, research in embodied music cognition 
has been strongly motivated by a demand for new tools in view of the interactive possibilities offered by digital media technology.

With the advent of powerful computing tools, and in particular real-time interactive music systems, gradually more attention has been devoted to the role of gesture in music. This [[musical gestures]] research has been rather influential in that it puts more emphasis on
sensorimotor feedback and integration, as well as on the coupling
of perception and action. With new sensor technology, gesture-based research has meanwhile become a vast domain of music research, with consequences for the methodological and [[epistemological]] foundations of music cognition research.

==Method==
The scientific apparatus draws upon an empirical and evidence-based methodology, which is based on measurement of sound (via audio-recording), human movement (via video-recording, kinematic recording), human biology (via bioparameter-recording) and [[semantics]] (via questionnaires). Using a scientific apparatus for measurement, statistical analysis and computational modelling, embodied music cognition aims to build up reliable knowledge about the role of the human body in meaning formation.

==Applications==
Research in embodied music cognition has a strong connection with technology development, more particularly, in fields related to interactive music systems, and music information retrieval. Mediation technology is the technology by which the human body, and consequently also the human mind, can be given an extension in the digital musical domain.

==How it is distinct from (disembodied) music cognition==
[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]] had a tremendous impact on cognitive science and in particular on cognitive musicology.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Influenced by [[Gestalt psychology]], [[music cognition]] research of the last decades of the 20th Century was mainly focusing on the perception of structure, that is, the perception of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[melody]], [[rhythm]], [[harmony]] and [[tonality]]. It considered music perception as a faculty on its own, completely dissociated from musical action.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Instead, in studies on embodied musical activity (such as listening and music performance), subjects are invited to actively engage in the [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] process. This engagement is articulated by means of corporeal expression which can be measured, analyzed, modelled and related to the musical stimulus. [[René Descartes]]' idea that mental activity is of a separate order from body movement is refuted and, in fact reversed.

==How it is distinct from traditional musicology==
The difference with the traditional phenomenological and hermeneutic approaches to musical meaning formation is that embodied music cognition has a focus on an empirical and evidence-based methodology, rather than on subjective first-person descriptions. Embodied music cognition aims at giving a full account of the subjective involvement by taking into account the role of the social-cultural context, subjective background (involving gender, age, familiarity with music, degree of music education).

Embodied music cognition adopts a scientific methodology but its aim is not to reduce music to physics, nor to reduce gesture and embodied meaning to the biomechanics of the human body. Instead, embodied music cognition fully recognizes the contribution of all mental and bodily systems including subjective feelings, emotions and coinaesthetic (or body image) awareness.

'''Euxinia''' or '''euxinic conditions''' occur when water is both [[Anoxic event|anoxic]] and sulfidic. This means that there is no [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and a raised level of free [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Euxinic bodies of water are frequently strongly stratified, have an oxic, highly productive, thin surface layer, and have anoxic, sulfidic bottom water.  The word euxinia is derived from the Greek name for the Black Sea- Εὔξεινος Πόντος (''Euxeinos Pontos)''- which translates to "hospitable sea".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Katja M.|last2=Kump|first2=Lee R.|date=2008-04-29|title=Oceanic Euxinia in Earth History: Causes and Consequences|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124256|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=251–288|doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euxinic deep water is a key component of the [[Canfield ocean]], a model of oceans during the Proterozoic known as the [[Boring Billion]] proposed by [[Donald Canfield]], an American geologist, in 1998.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is still debate within the scientific community on both the duration and frequency of euxinic conditions in the ancient oceans.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy W.|date=2008-08-15|title=Ironing Out Ocean Chemistry at the Dawn of Animal Life|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5891/923|journal=Science|language=en|volume=321|issue=5891|pages=923–924|doi=10.1126/science.1162870|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18703731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euxinia is relatively rare in modern bodies of water, but does still happen in places like the Black Sea and certain fjords.

== Background ==
Euxinia most frequently occurred in the Earth's ancient oceans, but its distribution and frequency of occurrence are still under debate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy W.|last2=Anbar|first2=Ariel D.|last3=Severmann|first3=Silke|last4=Scott|first4=Clint|last5=Gill|first5=Benjamin C.|date=2009-04-27|title=Tracking Euxinia in the Ancient Ocean: A Multiproxy Perspective and Proterozoic Case Study|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124233|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=507–534|doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original model was that it was quite constant for approximately a billion years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some meta-analyses have questioned how persistent euxinic conditions were based on relatively small [[black shale]] deposits in a period when the ocean should have theoretically been preserving more organic matter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Before the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] happened approximately 2.3 billion years ago, there was little free oxygen in either the atmosphere or the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-12415-5_1|title=Sustaining Life on Planet Earth: Metalloenzymes Mastering Dioxygen and Other Chewy Gases|last=Torres|first=Martha E.

Sosa}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally thought that the ocean accumulated oxygen soon after the atmosphere did, but this idea was challenged by Canfield in 1998 when he proposed that instead of the deep ocean becoming oxidizing, it became sulfidic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canfield|first=D. E.|year=|title=A new model for Proterozoic ocean chemistry|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/24839|journal=Nature|volume=396|issue=6710|pages=450–453|doi=10.1038/24839|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is partially based on the disappearance of [[banded iron formation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s from the geological records 1.8 billion years ago. Canfield argued that although enough oxygen entered the atmosphere to erode sulfides in continental rocks, there was not enough oxygen to mix into the deep ocean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This would result in an anoxic deep ocean with an increased flux of sulfur from the continents. The sulfur would strip iron ions from the sea water, resulting in [[iron sulfide]] (pyrite), a portion of which was eventually buried. When sulfide became the major oceanic [[oxidant]] instead of iron, the deep water became euxinic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This has become what is known as the [[Canfield ocean]], a model backed by the increase in presence of δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S in sedimentary [[pyrite]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the discovery of evidence of the first sulfate [[evaporite]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melezhik|first=Victor A.|last2=Fallick|first2=Anthony E.|last3=Rychanchik|first3=Dmitry V.|last4=Kuznetsov|first4=Anton B.|date=2005-04-01|title=Palaeoproterozoic evaporites in Fennoscandia: implications for seawater sulphate, the rise of atmospheric oxygen and local amplification of the δ13C excursion|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00600.x/abstract|journal=Terra Nova|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=141–148|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00600.x|issn=1365-3121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anoxic event|Anoxia]] and sulfidic conditions often occur together. In anoxic conditions anaerobic, sulfate reducing bacteria convert sulfate into sulfide, creating sulfidic conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The emergence of this metabolic pathway was very important in the pre-oxygenated oceans because adaptations to otherwise inhabitable or "toxic" environments like this may have played a role in the diversification of early eukaryotes and protozoa in the pre-Phanerozoic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Euxinia still occurs occasionally today, mostly in [[meromictic lakes]] and silled basins such as the [[Black Sea]] and some fjords.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is rare in modern times; less than 0.5% of today's sea floor is euxinic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Causes ==
[[File:How oceans become euxinic.png|thumb|600x600px|Diagram of mechanisms of euxinia in the Canfield Ocean]]
The basic requirements for the formation of euxinic conditions are the absence of [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and the presence of [[Sulfate|sulfate ions]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), organic matter (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|bacteria]] capable of reducing sulfate to [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The bacteria utilize the [[redox]] potential of sulfate as an [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]] and organic matter as a [[Reducing agent|reductant]] to generate chemical energy through [[Anaerobic respiration|cellular respiration]]. The chemical species of interest can be represented via the reaction:

2CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 2HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

In the reaction above the sulfur has been reduced to form the [[By-product|byproduct]] hydrogen sulfide, the characteristic compound present in water under euxinic conditions. Although sulfate reduction occurs in waters throughout the world, most modern-day aquatic habitats are oxygenated due to [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] production of oxygen and [[gas exchange]] between the atmosphere and surface water. Sulfate reduction in these environments is often limited to occurring in [[seabed]] [[sediment]]s that have a strong [[redox gradient]] and become [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] at some depth below the [[Sediment–water interface|sediment-water interface]]. In the ocean the [[Reaction rate|rate]] of these reactions is not [https://online.science.psu.edu/biol011_active002/node/4343 limited] by sulfate, which has been present in large quantities throughout the oceans for the past 2.1 billion years.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The [[Great Oxygenation Event]] increased atmospheric oxygen concentrations such that oxidative [[weathering]] of [[Sulfide minerals|sulfides]] became a major source of sulfate to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=E. M.|year=1982|title=Sulphate and sulphate reduction in early Precambrian oceans|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v296/n5853/pdf/296145a0.pdf|journal=Nature|volume=296|pages=145–148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canfield|first=Donald E.|last2=Farquhar|first2=James|date=2009-05-19|year=|title=Animal evolution, bioturbation, and the sulfate concentration of the oceans|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8123|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=20|pages=8123–8127|doi=10.1073/pnas.0902037106|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2688866|pmid=19451639|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite plentiful sulfate ions being present in solution, they are not preferentially used by most bacteria. The reduction of sulfate does not give as much energy to an organism as reduction of oxygen or [[nitrate]], so the concentrations of these other elements must be nearly zero for sulfate-reducing bacteria to out-compete [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[denitrifying bacteria]]. In most modern settings these conditions only occur in a small portion of sediments, resulting in insufficient concentrations of hydrogen sulfide to form euxinic waters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Conditions required for the formation of persistent euxinia include [[anoxic waters]], high [[nutrient]] levels, and a [[Stratification (water)|stratified]] water column.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These conditions are not all-inclusive and are based largely on modern observations of euxinia. Conditions leading up to and triggering large-scale euxinic events, such as the [[Canfield ocean]], are likely the result of multiple interlinking factors, many of which have been inferred through studies of the [[geologic record]] at relevant locations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The formation of stratified anoxic waters with high nutrient levels is influenced by a variety of global and local-scale phenomena such as the presence of nutrient traps and a warming climate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nutrient traps ===
In order for euxinic conditions to persist, a positive feedback loop must exist that perpetuates organic matter export to bottom waters and reduction of sulfate under anoxic conditions. Organic matter export is driven by high levels of primary production in the [[photic zone]], supported by a continual supply of nutrients to the oxic surface waters. A natural source of nutrients, such as phosphate ({{chem|PO|4|3−}}), comes from [[weathering]] of rocks and subsequent transport of these dissolved nutrients via rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=C. M.|last2=Mills|first2=M. M.|last3=Arrigo|first3=K. R.|last4=Berman-Frank|first4=I.|last5=Bopp|first5=L.|last6=Boyd|first6=P. W.|last7=Galbraith|first7=E. D.|last8=Geider|first8=R.

==== Geography ====
[[File:FjordCirculation.JPG|thumb|399x399px|A simplified model of estuarine circulation in a silled basin. Depicted here is a three-layered body of water which has been further simplified in the article by combining the intermediate and deep layers.]]
The arrangement of the continents has changed over time due to [[plate tectonics]], resulting in the [[bathymetry]] of ocean basins also changing over time. The shape and size of the basins influences the circulation patterns and concentration of nutrients within them. [[Computer simulation|Numerical models]] simulating past arrangements of continents have shown that nutrient traps can form in certain scenarios, increasing local concentrations of phosphate and setting up potential euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On a smaller scale, silled basins often act as nutrient traps due to their typical [[Estuarine water circulation|estuarine circulation]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Estuarine circulation occurs where surface water is replenished from river input and precipitation, causing an outflow of surface waters from the basin, while deep water flows into the basin over the sill. This type of circulation allows for anoxic, high nutrient bottom water to develop within the basin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Stratification ====
Stratified waters, in combination with slow vertical mixing, are essential to maintaining euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Stratification occurs when two or more water masses with different densities occupy the same basin. While the less dense surface water can exchange gas with the oxygen-rich atmosphere, the denser bottom waters maintain low oxygen content. In the modern oceans, [[thermohaline circulation]] and [[upwelling]] prevent the oceans from maintaining anoxic bottom waters. In a silled basin, the stable stratified layers only allow surface water to flow out of the basin while the deep water remains anoxic and relatively unmixed. During an intrusion of dense saltwater however, the nutrient-rich bottom water upwells, causing increased [[Primary production|productivity]] in the surface, further enhancing the nutrient trap due to [[biological pump]]ing.

=== Warming climate ===
A warming climate increases surface temperatures of waters which effects multiple aspects of euxinic water formation. As waters warm, the [[solubility]] of [[Ocean deoxygenation|oxygen decreases]], allowing for deep anoxic waters to form more readily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hotinski|first=Roberta M.|year=2001|title=Ocean stagnation and end-Permian anoxia|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235451836_Ocean_Stagnation_and_end_Permian_anoxia|journal=Geology|volume=29|pages=7–10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the warmer water causes increased respiration of organic matter leading to further oxygen depletion. Higher temperatures enhance the hydrologic cycle, increasing evaporation from bodies of water, resulting in increased precipitation. This causes higher rates of weathering of rocks and therefore higher nutrient concentrations in river outflows. The nutrients allow for more productivity resulting in more [[marine snow]] and subsequently lower oxygen in deep waters due to increased respiration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Volcanism has also been proposed to be a factor in creating euxinic conditions. The [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) released during [[Volcanism|volcanic]] outgassing causes [[global warming]] which has cascading effects on the formation of euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Evidence for euxinic events ==

=== Black shale ===
[[File:Black shale, Kansas City MO - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Black shale is one of the preliminary indicators of anoxia and perhaps euxinia]]
Black shales are organic rich, microlaminated sedimentary rocks often associated with bottom water anoxia. This is because anoxia slows the degradation of organic matter, allowing for greater burial in the sediments. Other evidence for anoxic burial of black shale includes the lack of [[bioturbation]], meaning that there were no organisms burrowing into the sediment because there was no oxygen for respiration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There must also be a source of organic matter for burial, generally from production near the oxic surface. Many papers discussing ancient euxinic events use the presence of black shale as a preliminary proxy for anoxic bottom waters, but it should be noted that their presence does not in and of itself indicate euxinia or even strong anoxia. Generally geochemical testing is needed to provide better evidence for conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Geochemistry ===
Some researchers study the occurrence of euxinia in ancient oceans because it was more prevalent then than it is today. Since ancient oceans cannot be directly observed, scientists use geology and chemistry to find evidence in [[sedimentary rock]] created under euxinic conditions. Some of these techniques come from studying modern examples of euxinia, while others are derived from geochemistry. Though modern euxinic environments have geochemical properties in common with ancient euxinic oceans, the physical processes causing euxinia most likely vary between the two.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Isotopes ====
[[Stable isotope ratio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s can be used to infer the environmental conditions during the formation of sedimentary rock. Using [[stoichiometry]] and knowledge of [[redox]] pathways, paleogeologists can use [[isotope]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s ratios of elements to determine the chemical composition of the water and sediments when burial occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945435170|title=Stable isotope geochemistry|last=Jochen.|first=Hoefs,|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319197159|oclc=945435170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfur isotopes are frequently used to look for evidence of ancient euxinia. Low δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S in black shales and sedimentary rocks provides positive evidence for euxinic formation conditions. The pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in euxinic basins typically has higher concentrations of light sulfur isotopes than pyrite in the modern ocean.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The reduction of sulfate to sulfide favors the lighter sulfur isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S) and becomes depleted in the heavier isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S). This lighter sulfide then bonds with Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to form FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is then partially preserved in the sediments. In most modern systems, sulfate eventually becomes limiting, and the isotopic weights of sulfur in both sulfate and sulfide (preserved as FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) become equal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Molybdenum (Mo), the most common transition metal ion in modern seawater, is also used to look for evidence for euxinia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Weathering of rocks provides an input of MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; into oceans. Under oxic conditions, MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;  is very unreactive, but in modern euxinic environments such as the [[Black Sea]], molybdenum precipitates out as oxythiomolybdate (MoO&lt;sub&gt;4−x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; ).&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnold|first=G.

==== Trace-element enrichment ====
Under euxinic conditions, some trace elements such as Mo, U, V, Cd, Cu, Tl, Ni, Sb, and Zn, become insoluble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Algeo|first=Thomas J|last2=Maynard|first2=J.

==== Organic biomarkers ====
[[File:Purple and Green Sulfur Bacteria and Their Biomarkers.png|thumb|440x440px|Pigments from purple and green sulfur reducing bacteria are strong evidence for euxinic conditions]]
Bacteria such as [[green sulfur bacteria]] (GSB) and [[purple sulfur bacteria]] (PSB), which exist where the photic zone overlaps with euxinic water masses, leave pigments behind in sediments.  These pigments can be used to identify past euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The pigments used to identify past presesnce of GSB are [[chlorobactane]] and [[isorenieratene]].&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overmann|first=Jörg|last2=Cypionka|first2=Heribert|last3=Pfennig|first3=Norbert|date=1992-01-01|title=An extremely low-light adapted phototrophic sulfur bacterium from the Black Sea|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lo.1992.37.1.0150/abstract|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=150–155|doi=10.4319/lo.1992.37.1.0150|issn=1939-5590}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pigments used to identify past presence of PSB is [[okenane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overmann|first=Jörg|last2=Sandmann|first2=Gerhard|last3=Hall|first3=Ken J.|last4=Northcote|first4=Tom G.|date=1993-03-01|title=Fossil carotenoids and paleolimnology of meromictic Mahoney Lake, British Columbia, Canada|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00877257|journal=Aquatic Sciences|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=31–39|doi=10.1007/BF00877257|issn=1015-1621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iron geochemistry ====
[[Pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a mineral formed by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) and bioreactive iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). In oxic bottom waters pyrite can only form in sediments where H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is present. However, in iron-rich euxinic environments, pyrite formation can occur at higher rates in both the water column and in sediments due to higher concentrations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Threfore the presence of euxinic conditions can be inferred by the ratio of pyrite-bound iron to the total iron in sediments. High ratios of pyrite-bound iron can be used as an indicator of past euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy|last2=Severmann|first2=Silke|year=2006|title=A critical look at iron paleoredox proxies: New insights from modern euxinic marine basins|url=|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=70|pages=5698–5722|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raiswell|first=R.|last2=Newton|first2=R.|last3=Wignall|first3=P.

== Euxinic events in Earth's history ==

  [[File:Timeline of euxinia in ancient oceans.png|thumb|660x660px|Presence of euxinia in the world's ancient deep oceans. According to Canfield, the deep ocean became sulfitic around 1.8 billion years ago and stayed that way for much of the boring billion. Periodic euxinia dominated through the Late Devonian Kelwasser events, and then most likely disappeared during the Carboniferous. Euxinia reemerged at the Permian-Triassic Boundary, and may have been present during the Ocean Anoxia Events of the Mesozoic. Euxinia is rare in Cenozoic oceans. Adapted from Lyons, 2008&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;]]

=== Proterozoic ===
The Proterozoic is the transition era between anoxic and oxygenated oceans. The classic model is that the end of the [[Banded iron formation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (BIFs) was due to the injection of oxygen into the deep ocean, an approximately 0.6 billion year lag behind the [[Great Oxygenation Event]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holland|first=Heinrich D.|date=2006-06-29|year=|title=The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1470/903|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=361|issue=1470|pages=903–915|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1838|issn=0962-8436|pmid=16754606|via=|pmc=1578726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canfield, however, argued that anoxia lasted much longer, and the end of the banded iron formations was due to the introduction of sulfide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Supporting Canfield's original hypothesis, 1.84 billion year old sedimentary records have been found in the Animike group in Canada that exhibit close to full pyritization on top of the last of the banded iron formations, showing evidence of a transition to euxinic conditions in that basin.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poulton|first=Simon W.|last2=Fralick|first2=Philip W.|last3=Canfield|first3=Donald E.|date=2004-09-09|title=The transition to a sulphidic ocean {{!}}[sim]{{!}} 1.84 billion years ago|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7005/full/nature02912.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=431|issue=7005|pages=173–177|doi=10.1038/nature02912|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In order for full pyritization to happen, nearly all of the sulfate in the water was reduced to sulfide, which stripped the iron from the water, forming pyrite. Because this basin was open to the ocean, deep euxinia was interpreted as being a widespread phenomena.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This euxinia is hypothesized to have lasted until about 0.8 billion years ago, making basin bottom euxinia a potentially widespread feature throughout the [[Boring Billion]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Further evidence for euxinia was discovered in the McArthur Basin in Australia, where similar iron chemistry was found. The degree of pyritization and the δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S were both high, supporting the presence of anoxia and sulfide, as well as the depletion of sulfate.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shen|first=Yanan|last2=Canfield|first2=Donald E.|last3=Knoll|first3=Andrew H.|date=2002-02-01|title=Middle Proterozoic ocean chemistry: Evidence from the McArthur Basin, northern Australia|url=http://www.ajsonline.org/content/302/2/81|journal=American Journal of Science|language=en|volume=302|issue=2|pages=81–109|doi=10.2475/ajs.302.2.81|issn=0002-9599}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different study found biomarkers for [[green sulfur bacteria]] and [[purple sulfur bacteria]] in the same area, providing further evidence for the reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brocks|first=Jochen J.|last2=Love|first2=Gordon D.|last3=Summons|first3=Roger E.|last4=Knoll|first4=Andrew H.|last5=Logan|first5=Graham A.|last6=Bowden|first6=Stephen A.|date=2005-10-06|title=Biomarker evidence for green and purple sulphur bacteria in a stratified Palaeoproterozoic sea|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7060/abs/nature04068.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=437|issue=7060|pages=866–870|doi=10.1038/nature04068|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molybdenum isotopes have been used to examine the distribution of euxinia in the Proterozoic eon, and suggest that perhaps euxinia was not as widespread as Canfield initially postulated. Bottom waters may have been more widely suboxic than anoxic, and there could have been negative feedback between euxinia and the high levels of surface primary production needed to sustain euxinic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=C.|last2=Lyons|first2=T.

=== Phanerozoic ===
There is evidence for multiple euxinic events during the Phanerozoic. It is most likely that euxinia was periodic during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, but geologic data is too sparse to draw any large scale conclusions. In this eon, there is some evidence that euxinic events are potentially linked with mass extinction events including the [[Late Devonian extinction|Late Devonian]] and [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Paleozoic ====

The periodic presence of euxinic conditions in the Lower Cambrian has been supported by evidence found on the Yangtze platform in South China. Sulfur isotopes during the transition from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic give evidence for widespread euxinia, perhaps lasting throughout the Cambrian period.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Benjamin C, Timothy W Lyons, Seth a Young, Lee R Kump, Andrew H Knoll, and Matthew R Saltzman. 2010. “Geochemical Evidence for Widespread Euxinia in the Later Cambrian Ocean.” ''Nature'' 469 (7328): 80–83. doi:10.1038/nature09700.&lt;/ref&gt;  Towards the end of the Lower Cambrian, the euxinic chemocline grew deeper until euxinia was present only in the sediments, and once sulfate became limiting, conditions became anoxic instead of euxinic. Some areas eventually became oxic, while others eventually returned to euxinic for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Tatiana|last2=Strauss|first2=Harald|last3=Guo|first3=Qingjun|last4=Liu|first4=Congqiang|date=2007-10-08|title=Reconstructing marine redox conditions for the Early Cambrian Yangtze Platform: Evidence from biogenic sulphur and organic carbon isotopes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018207001800|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|series=From Snowball Earth to the Cambrian bioradiation: calibration of Ediacaran-Cambrian history in South China|volume=254|issue=1–2|pages=175–193|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2007.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geological records from the paleozoic in the Selwyn Basin in Northern Canada have also shown evidence for episodic stratification and mixing, where, using δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S, it was determined that hydrogen sulfide was more prevalent than [[sulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodfellow|first=Wayne D|last2=Jonasson|first2=Ian R|year=1984|title=Data from ocean stagnation and ventilation defined by secular trends in pyrite and baritye, Selwyn Basin, Yukon|url=|journal=Geology|volume=12|pages=583–586|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was not originally attributed to euxinia, further studies found that seawater in that time likely had low concentrations of sulfate, meaning that the sulfur in the water was primarily in the form of sulfide. This combined with organic-rich black shale provide strong evidence for euxinia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lowenstein|first=Tim K.|last2=Hardie|first2=Lawrence A.|last3=Timofeeff|first3=Michael N.|last4=Demicco|first4=Robert V.|title=Secular variation in seawater chemistry and the origin of calcium chloride basinal brines|url=http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1130%2FG19728R.1|journal=Geology|volume=31|issue=10|doi=10.1130/g19728r.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for euxinia has also been tied to the [[Kellwasser event]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the Late Devonian Extinction event. Euxinia in basinal waters in what is now central Europe (Germany, Poland, and France) persisted for part of the late Devonian, and may have spread up into shallow waters, contributing to the extinction event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=David|last2=Wignall|first2=Paul B.|last3=Racki|first3=Grzegorz|date=2004-03-01|title=Extent and duration of marine anoxia during the Frasnian–Famennian (Late Devonian) mass extinction in Poland, Germany, Austria and France|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/geological-magazine/article/div-classtitleextent-and-duration-of-marine-anoxia-during-the-frasnianfamennian-late-devonian-mass-extinction-in-poland-germany-austria-and-francediv/E23779056D0B8D8520D5A7E04FFF5B1D|journal=Geological Magazine|volume=141|issue=2|pages=173–193|doi=10.1017/S0016756804008866|issn=1469-5081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was perhaps a period of oxygenation of bottom waters during the [[Carboniferous]], most likely between the Late Devonian Extinction and the Permian-Triassic Extinction, at which point euxinia would be very rare in the paleo oceans.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Mesozoic ====

The Mesozoic is well known for its distinct [[Ocean anoxic event|Ocean Anoxic Event]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (OAEs) which resulted in the burial of layers of black shale. Although these OAEs are not stand alone evidence for euxinia, many do contain biomarkers which support euxinic formation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Again, evidence is not universal. OAEs may have spurred the spread of existing euxinia, especially in upwelling regions or semi-restricted basins, but photic zone euxinia did not happen everywhere.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Cenozoic ====
Few episodes of euxinia are evident in the sedimentary record during the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since the end of the Cretaceous OAEs, it is most likely that the oceanic bottom waters have stayed oxic.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Modern euxinia ==
 
Euxinic conditions have nearly vanished from Earth's open-ocean environments, but a few small scale examples still exist today. Many of these locations share common biogeochemical characteristics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, low rates of overturning and vertical mixing of the total water column is common in euxinic bodies of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Small surface area to depth ratios allow multiple stable layers to form while limiting wind-driven overturning and thermohaline circulation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, restricted mixing enhances stratified layers of high nutrient density which are reinforced by biological recycling.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the chemocline, highly specialized organisms, such as green sulfur bacteria (GSB) take advantage of the strong redox potential gradient and minimal sunlight.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The Black Sea ===
[[File:Black Sea Catchment Map.svg|thumb|Map of the Black Sea showing the many rivers that supply the basin with low-density fresh water, along with the narrow Bosphorus Strait to the southwest that supplies the basin with high-density salt water.

The Black Sea is a commonly used modern model for understanding biogeochemical processes that occur under euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nägler|first=T.

The only connection between the open ocean and the Black Sea is the [[Bosphorus|Bosphorus Strait]], through which dense Mediterranean waters are imported.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Subsequently, numerous rivers, such as the [[Danube]], [[Don River (Russia)|Don]], [[Dnieper]], and [[Dniester]], drain fresh water into the Black Sea, which floats on top of the more dense Mediterranean water, causing a strong, stratified water column.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This stratification is maintained by a strong [[pycnocline]] which restricts ventilation of deep waters and results in an intermediate layer called the [[chemocline]], a sharp boundary separating oxic surface waters from anoxic bottom waters usually between 50m and 100m depth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=J.

=== Meromictic lakes ===
[[Meromictic lake]]s are poorly mixed and anoxic bodies of water with strong vertical stratification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While meromictic lakes are frequently categorized as bodies of water with the potential for euxinic conditions, many do not exhibit euxinia. Meromictic lakes are infamous for [[limnic eruption]]s.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; These events usually coincide with nearby tectonic or volcanic activity that disturbs the otherwise stable stratification of meromictic lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-663-05239-5_10|title=Natural Hazards in West and Central Africa|last=Tietze|first=Klaus|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Vieweg+Teubner Verlag|isbn=9783663052418|editor-last=Freeth|editor-first=Samuel J.|series=International Monograph Series|pages=97–107|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-663-05239-5_10|editor-last2=Ofoegbu|editor-first2=Charles O.|editor-last3=Onuoha|editor-first3=K.

[[File:Mariager fjord vinter.jpg|thumb|Mariager fjord often produces a "rotten egg" smell in the summer due to sulfur content.]]

=== North Sea fjords ===
Some [[fjord]]s develop euxinia if the connection to the open ocean is constricted, similar to the case of the Black Sea. This constriction prohibits relatively dense, oxygen-rich oceanic water from mixing with the bottom water of the fjord, which leads to stable stratified layers in the fjord.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Low salinity melt water forms a lens of fresh, low density water on top of a more dense mass of bottom water.  Ground sources of sulfur are also an important cause for euxinia in fjords.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sørensen|first=Ketil B|last2=Canfield|first2=Donald E|date=2004-02-01|title=Annual fluctuations in sulfur isotope fractionation in the water column of a euxinic marine basin 1|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703703003879|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=68|issue=3|pages=503–515|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(03)00387-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Framvaren Fjord ====

This fjord was born as a glacial lake that was separated from the open ocean (the North Sea) when it was lifted during glacial rebound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A shallow channel (2m deep) was dug in 1850, providing a marginal connection to the North Sea.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A strong pycnocline separates fresh surface water from dense, saline bottom water, and this pycnolcine reduces mixing between the layers. Anoxic conditions persist below the chemocline at 20m, and the fjord has the highest levels of hydrogen sulfide in the anoxic marine world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Millero|first=Frank J.|date=1991-07-01|title=The oxidation of H2S in Framvaren Fjord|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.1007/abstract|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=36|issue=5|pages=1007–1014|doi=10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.1007|issn=1939-5590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Like the Black Sea, vertical overlap of oxygen and sulfur is limited, but the decline of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S approaching the chemocline from below is indicative of oxidation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, which has been attributed to manganese and iron oxides, photo-autotrophic bacteria, and entrainment of oxygen horizontally from the boundaries of the fjord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yao|first=Wensheng|last2=Millero|first2=Frank J.|title=The chemistry of the anoxic waters in the Framvaren Fjord, Norway|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01025231|journal=Aquatic Geochemistry|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=53–88|doi=10.1007/BF01025231|issn=1380-6165}}&lt;/ref&gt; These oxidation processes are similar to those present in the Black Sea.

Two strong seawater intrusion events have occurred through the channel in recent history (1902 and 1942).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Seawater intrusions to fjords force dense, salty, oxygen-rich water into the typically anoxic, sulfidic bottom waters of euxinic fjords.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pakhomova|first=Svetlana|last2=Braaten|first2=Hans Fredrik|last3=Yakushev|first3=Evgeniy|last4=Skei|first4=Jens|date=2014-04-28|year=|title=Biogeochemical consequences of an oxygenated intrusion into an anoxic fjord|url=http://www.geochemicaltransactions.com/content/15/1/5|journal=Geochemical Transactions|language=En|volume=15|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1186/1467-4866-15-5|issn=1467-4866|pmid=24872727|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events result in a temporary disturbance to the chemocline, raising the depth at which H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is detected. The breakdown of the chemocline causes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S to react with dissolved oxygen in a redox reaction.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This decreases the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the biologically active photic zone which can result in basin-scale fish die-offs.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The 1942 event, in particular, was strong enough to chemically reduce the vast majority of oxygen and elevate the chemocline to the air-water interface.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This caused a temporary state of total anoxia in the fjord, and resulted in dramatic fish mortality.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Mariager Fjord ====

This fjord is marked by a highly mobile chemocline with a depth that is thought to be related to temperature effects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Local reports of strong rotten egg smell- the smell of sulfur- during numerous summers around the fjord provide evidence that, like the Framvaren fjord, the chemocline has breached the surface of the fjord at least 5 times in the last century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sediments export during these events increased the concentrations of dissolved phosphates, inorganic bioavailable nitrogen, and other nutrients, resulting in a [[harmful algal bloom]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

The [[Cariaco Basin]] in Venezuela has been used to study the cycle of organic material in euxinic marine environments.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Werne|first=Josef P.|last2=Lyons|first2=Timothy W.|last3=Hollander|first3=David J.|last4=Formolo|first4=Michael J.|last5=Sinninghe Damsté|first5=Jaap S.|date=2003-04-15|title=Reduced sulfur in euxinic sediments of the Cariaco Basin: sulfur isotope constraints on organic sulfur formation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254102003935|journal=Chemical Geology|series=Isotopic records of microbially mediated processes|volume=195|issue=1–4|pages=159–179|doi=10.1016/S0009-2541(02)00393-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in productivity coincident with post glacial nutrient loading probably caused a transition from oxic to anoxic and subsequently euxinic conditions around 14.5 thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy W|last2=Werne|first2=Josef P|last3=Hollander|first3=David J|last4=Murray|first4=R.

'''Figura serpentinata''' (Italian - [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpentine]] figure) is a style in painting and sculpture, intended to make the figure seem more dynamic, that is typical of [[Mannerism]]. It is similar, but not identical, to [[contrapposto]], and features figures often in a [[spiral]] pose.&lt;ref name="mma"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/dona/hd_dona.htm|title=Donatello (ca. 1386–1466)|accessdate=November 20, 2007|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=2007|author=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early examples can be seen in the work of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]].

Emil Maurer writes of the painter and theorist [[Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo]] (1538–1600): "The recommended ideal form unites, after Lomazzo, three qualities: the pyramid, the "serpentinata" movement and a certain numerical proportion, all three united to form one whole. At the same time, precedence is given to the "moto", that is, to the meandering movement, which should make the pyramid, in exact proportion, into the geometrical form of a cone."

[[File:Laokoon-Gruppe-02.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Laocoön group]]
Bousquet holds that the "serpentinata" style arose as a result of the discovery of the [[Laocoön and His Sons|Laocoön group]] in 1506, and its deep impact on all artists, but on Michelangelo in particular.  [[John Shearman]] also argues that it was invented by Michelangelo, citing the "Victors" that he produced for [[Pope Julius II]]'s tomb.  Maurer, on the other hand, can only detect this style rarely in Michelangelo's work and cites [[Beccafumi]] instead as its pioneer. Beccafumi's student [[Marco Pino]] connected Beccafumi's style with those of [[Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati)|Salviati]], [[Parmigianino]] and perhaps even Michelangelo, and his work as a whole is marked by "serpentinata" motifs. [[Paolo Pino]] himself says in his "Dialogo della Pittura", that his figures' poses are many and varied, and that in all his works to find one single figure, that completely and utterly distorts, is ambivalent and difficult.

As Maurer writes, painters are freer than sculptors and less closely tied-down to nature.  Thus they can play around with their figures, reshaping, overstretching, geometricising, dissolving, caricaturing, colouring, meandering, according to the painting's goal and intended effect.  With the loosening of the norms of the [[Renaissance]] and the development of the "Serpentita" style, that style's structures and rules began to be systematised.  A style of form began by which figures showed physical power, passion, tension and semantic perfection.  Movements were not without motivation, nor even simply done with a will, but with will shown in a pure form.  Also their actions arose not out of power, but powerlessness.

The style exerted an influence even into the 1620s, with [[Bernini]]'s ''[[The Rape of Proserpina (Bernini)|The Rape of Proserpina]]''.

The first part of ''Galileo's Middle Finger'' recounts Dreger's activism against surgical "correction" of [[intersex]] individuals' genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/barronlerner/2015/03/13/science-activism-and-truth-galileos-middle-finger-by-alice-dreger/ | author = Lerner, Barron | date = March 13, 2015 | title = Science, Activism And Truth: 'Galileo's Middle Finger' by Alice Dreger | work = Forbes.com | accessdate = March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some surgeons called this "total urogenital mobilization" which is "...ripping out everything that didn't seem right to the doctor and rebuilding a girl's genitals from scratch using Frankenstein stitches..."&lt;ref name="gal47"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, her book discusses the [[intersex medical interventions]] that some intersex children in the United States undergo. Based on her interactions with the intersex community as well as her own research, she advocated that genital surgery for intersex children be postponed until the individual is old enough to make an informed decision, in the absence of any evidence that the benefits of such surgery outweighed its already reported risks.

The second section provides her analysis of the controversy surrounding ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'' (2003), by sex researcher and psychologist [[J. Michael Bailey]]. In that book, Bailey summarized research on [[Blanchard's transsexualism typology]] in a way that Dreger says is scientifically accurate, well-intended, and sympathetic, but insensitive to its political implications. Dreger writes that "Bailey made the mistake of thinking that openly accepting and promoting the truth about people's identities would be understood as the same as accepting them and helping them, as he felt he was".&lt;ref name="gal65"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 | page = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, many activists in the trans community objected to the contention that their transition was sexually motivated.

Bailey's book was based on the academic publications of psychologist [[Ray Blanchard]], which Bailey interpreted for a lay audience. The larger audience and potential to influence public beliefs about transgenderism led a prominent transgender activist, [[Lynn Conway]], to campaign against Bailey.  Dreger concludes that the accusations levied against Bailey by Conway and others did not hold up to scrutiny. "Conway developed what became an enormous Web site hosted by the University of Michigan for the purpose of taking down Bailey and his ideas [and] that largely enabled me to figure out what she had really done and how Bailey had essentially been set up in an effort to shut him up about [[autogynephilia]]".&lt;ref name="gal65" /&gt; Dreger wrote that some activists had turned their horror at Bailey's findings into a very public vendetta against him and his family, including thinly veiled allegations that he sexually abused his children.&lt;ref name="bartlett"&gt;{{cite news | author = Bartlett, Tom | date = March 10, 2015 | title = Reluctant Crusader: Why Alice Dreger’s writing on sex and science makes liberals so angry | work = [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] | url = http://chronicle.com/article/Reluctant-Crusader/228377/?cid=gn | accessdate = March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After researching the allegations against Bailey, she concluded that they were false.  Moreover, Dreger observed that "the most interesting mail, from my perspective, came from trans women who wrote to tell me that, though they weren't thrilled with Bailey's oversimplifications of their lives, they also had been harassed and intimidated by [[Andrea James]] for daring to speak anything other than the politically popular 'I was always just a woman trapped in a man's body' story. They thanked me for standing up to a bully."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 | page = 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreger also investigates the controversy surrounding biologist [[Randy Thornhill]] and anthropologist Craig T. Palmer's ''[[A Natural History of Rape]]'' (2000) and accusations by Patrick Tierney in his book ''[[Darkness in El Dorado]]'' that anthropologist [[Napoleon Chagnon]] seriously abused the [[Yanomamo]]. She returns to the issue of intersex in an examination of geneticist [[Maria New]]'s research in prenatal [[dexamethasone]] use in cases of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].

==Reception==

''[[The New York Times]]'' described the book as "a rant, a manifesto, a treasury of evocative new terms ([[sissyphobia]], [[autogynephilia]], [[Phall-O-Meter|phall-o-meter]]) and an account of the author’s transformation" from activist to scientist and back again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/books/review/galileos-middle-finger-by-alice-dreger.html?_r=0 |title=‘Galileo’s Middle Finger,’ by Alice Dreger |last1=Dobbs |first1=David |date=April 17, 2015 |website= |publisher= [[The New York Times]] |access-date=2015-07-20 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' describes the book as "highly readable" with an important message: "Science and social justice require each other to be healthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Miller, Laura | title = "Galileo’s Middle Finger": When scholars and activists clash over controversial research, we all lose.

The book was at first selected as 2016 finalist for a [[Lambda Literary Award]] in the LGBTQ nonfiction category, but the foundation rescinded this nomination on March 22, 2016, describing the book as "inconsistent with its mission of affirming LGBTQ lives."&lt;ref name="Lambda Literary award withdrawal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/712366965466206208|title=Lambda Literary award withdrawal|accessdate=Mar 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brynn Tannehill, writing for ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', compared arguments made in the book to the arguments made by anti-transgender groups like the [[Family Research Council]]. She wrote that the book promoted a theory that trans people are "just self-hating homosexual men who believe they could have guilt-free sex if they were female and heterosexual men with an out-of-control fetish (autogynephilia)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tannehill |first=Brynn |date=March 25, 2016 |title=Lambda Literary Foundation Snuffs Out Anti-Trans Scandal |url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2016/3/25/lambda-literary-foundation-snuffs-out-anti-trans-scandal |newspaper=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |access-date=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinnia Jones, a trans activist writer, criticised the book as providing an "incomplete and sensationalized" depiction of the subject which selectively covers claims made by proponents, ignoring those which might present it in a worse light. She also highlighted perceived methodological flaws with the research conducted by Blanchard and others, especially a willingness to ignore data points which are inconsistent with their hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Zinna|url=http://genderanalysis.net/2016/04/alice-dreger-autogynephilia-and-the-misrepresentation-of-trans-sexualities-book-review-galileos-middle-finger/|accessdate=2017-07-04|date=2016-04-01|title=Alice Dreger, autogynephilia, and the misrepresentation of trans sexualities (Book review: Galileo’s Middle Finger)|website=genderanalysis.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4197">[[File:Hinman collator.jpg|thumb|A Hinman collator owned by the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]]]]
The '''Hinman collator''', an early [[optical collator]], was an [[opto-mechanical]] device for comparing pairs of documents for differences in the text. Documents that appeared similar were said to “collate”. The collator resulted in rapid advances in the study of [[Literature|literary]] works.

Invented by [[Charlton Hinman]] in the late 1940s, the device used [[light bulb|lights]] and [[mirror]]s to superimpose images of the two documents so that differences in text alignment or wording stood out. This resulted in huge improvements in speed and efficiency compared to the traditional [[Cross-reference|cross-referencing]] of texts by eye.

The idea built on earlier work such as [[Carl Pulfrich|Carl Pulfrich's]] [[blink comparator]] used to help identify the former planet [[Pluto]], and Hinman's work analysing aerial photographs during [[World War II]].

Hinman used his device to compare the many slightly different impressions of the [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare]]'s works. The [[printing]] and [[bookbinding]] processes used in the time of Shakespeare often resulted in variations in the pages bound into the final books, and the collator enabled Hinman to describe the exact order in which the Folios had been composited and printed. He used the collator to compare 55 different copies of the First Folio held by the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]], and subsequently wrote about his findings in ''Printing and Proof-reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare'' in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collation.folger.edu/2011/08/welcome-to-the-collation/ |title=Welcome to The Collation |last1=Werner |first1=Sarah |date=August 18, 2011 |website=The Collation |publisher=[[Folger Shakespeare Library]] |access-date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of Hinman's success, the device was purchased by a number of universities, libraries and other institutions (allegedly including the [[CIA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more compact types of collator were developed in the 1960s, the last Hinman was built in 1978. In his 2002 survey of mechanical collators, Steven Escar Smith estimates from scattered records that as many as 59 Hinman Collators were produced, 41 of these surviving at the time of his survey's publication. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The device was developed further by Randall McLeod.&lt;ref&gt;Zalewski, Daniel. [http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9706/fieldnotes.html ''Through the looking glass.''] Lingua franca, June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lazio Roma Gesu2 tango7174.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Triumph of the Name of Jesus'', by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]], on the ceiling of the [[Church of the Gesu]]. The decorations of the vault over the nave date back to the 17th century. The fresco is the work of Giovanni Battista Gaulli, known as Baciccia. The stucco reliefs were executed by Ercole Antonio Raggi and Leonardo Reti, following the drawings of Baciccia who wanted to effect a real continuity between painting and sculpture.]]

'''Illusionism''' in [[art history]] means either the artistic tradition in which artists create a work of art that appears to share the physical space with the viewer&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;"Illusionism," ''Grove Art Online''. [[Oxford University Press]], [accessed 17 March 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; or more broadly the attempt to represent physical appearances precisely – also called [[mimesis]].  The term [[realism (art)|realist]] may be used in this sense, but that also has rather different meanings in art, as it is also used to cover the choice of ordinary everyday subject-matter, and avoiding idealizing subjects. Illusionism encompasses a long history, from the deceptions of [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]] to the works of [[mural]]ist [[Richard Haas]] in the twentieth century, that includes [[trompe-l'oeil]], [[anamorphosis]], [[Op art]], [[Abstract Illusionism]], and [[Illusionistic ceiling painting]] techniques such as ''di sotto in sù'' and ''quadratura''.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; [[sculpture|Sculptural]] illusionism includes works, often painted, that appear real from a distance.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; Other forms, such as the [[illusionistic tradition]] in the theatre, and [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]]'s "peepshow"-boxes from the seventeenth century, combine illusionistic techniques and media. 

==Illusionistic realism==

[[File:Frederic Leighton - Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|left|340px|[[Lord Leighton]]'s ''Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession'' of 1853-55 is at the end of a long tradition of illusionism in painting, but is not Realist in the sense of Courbet's work of the same period.]]
The development of increasingly accurate representation of the visual appearances of things has a long history in art. It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and beasts, of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of beasts, and [[Ancient Egyptian art]] developed conventions involving both [[stylization]] and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. [[Ancient Greek art]] is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in [[mosaic]]) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by [[Zeuxis]] in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective.  This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly [[Socrates]], were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. [[Roman portraiture]], when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.

[[File:Camera picta, ceiling 3.jpg|alt=Illusionistic ceiling fresco by Andrea Mantegna in the Camera degli Sposi, Ducal Palace, Mantua|left|thumb|[[Andrea Mantegna]]'s late-[[Quattrocento]] ceiling fresco in the ''[[Camera degli Sposi]]''  (commissioned by [[Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua|Ludovico III Gonzaga]] for Mantua's Ducal Palace) is an early example of [[illusionistic ceiling painting]].]]
The art of [[Late Antiquity]] famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the [[Late medieval]] or [[Early Renaissance]] period, and were helped by the development of new techniques of [[oil painting]] which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze.  Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, idealism remained the norm.

The accurate depiction of [[landscape painting|landscape in painting]] had also been developing in Early Netherlandish and Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. [[Still life]] paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked "realism", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of [[Flower bouquet|bouquet]]s in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time.  Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in [[Cubism]].

==Donald Judd==


In his writings and art criticisms during the mid-1960s [[art critic]]/artist [[Donald Judd]] claimed that illusionism in painting undermined the artform itself. Judd implied that painting was dead, claiming painting was a ''lie'' because it depicted the ''illusion'' of three-dimensionality on a flat surface. Judd claimed that painting needed to recognize its objecthood in real space and reject illusion. Donald Judd wrote in “Specific Objects” in 1965:
{{quote|Three dimensions are real space. That gets rid of the problem of illusionism and of literal space, space in and around marks of color… Actual space is intrinsically more powerful and specific than paint on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2011/07/artseen/donald-judd Greg Lindquist, The Brooklyn Rail, ''Donald Judd'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Modern Illusion==
In the Webster Texas Holiday Inn, close to the Houston Space Center, there is a double illusion ceiling by muralist Frank Wilson, commissioned in honor of US astronauts. Other double illusion murals exist in rooms for officials as well as the dining room, depicting a night sky under darkness and illuminated by glowing minerals.  Under normal light, clouds and birds are observed.

'''Industrial arts''' is an educational program which features fabrication of objects in wood or metal using a variety of hand, power, or machine tools. It may include [[small engine repair]] and [[automobile maintenance]], and all programs usually cover [[technical drawing]] as part of the curricula. As an educational term, ''industrial arts'' dates from 1904 when Charles R. Richards of Teachers College, Columbia University, New York suggested it to replace ''[[manual training]]''.

In the [[U.S.A.|United States]], industrial arts classes are colloquially known as "'''[[Workshop |shop]] class'''"; these programs expose children to the basics of home repair, manual craftsmanship, and machine safety. Most industrial arts programs were established in comprehensive rather than dedicated [[vocational schools]] and focused on a broad range of skills rather than on a specific [[vocational training]]. In 1980, the name of industrial arts education in New York State was changed to "[[technology education]]" during what was called the "Figuring Project". The project goal was to increase students' [[technological literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.oswego.edu/technology/history-1/ |title= History {{!}} Department of Technology |last=|first= |date= 2017 |website= www.oswego.edu |at=sec. Technology Education |language= en |archive-url=|archive-date= |dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (VIC, Australia) industrial arts is still a key part of the high school curriculum. The term now describes a key study of [[technology]] that focuses on both engineering and industrial technologies. Additionally, [[design]] using the aforementioned technologies is now a key part of the industrial arts curriculum and has been since the mid-1980s when the subject of technics was introduced into Victorian high schools.

One of the most important aspects of industrial arts is still that while students design they ultimately realize a solution; learning the challenges involved with working with materials and also the challenges of small scale project management.

Some universities have doctoral programs in industrial arts.

==Industrial arts clubs==
An industrial arts club is an organization that promotes the use of industrial fabrication equipment by the general public. Clubs have grown out of the decline of industrial arts (aka shop class) programs in comprehensive school systems in the US.
Clubs began as student organizations in primary and secondary schools offering industrial, the [[TechShop]] and Sparqs Industrial Arts Club based in Massachusetts which grew out of campus activities at [[MIT]].

==Industrial Arts in New South Wales==
Industrial Arts (IA) is an important part of the (NSW) high school curriculum. Industrial Arts syllabi are managed, like all NSW syllabi by the [[Board of Studies]]. In some schools Industrial Arts faculties have become part of a larger Technology faculty, however many schools still have a stand-alone Industrial Arts faculty.

The primary role of Industrial Arts education is to expose students to a variety of industrial and [[engineering]] technologies that improve their understanding of the industrial and engineered world. Moreover, students learn both project management and design principles, most courses are project based with students realizing a solution to a design or engineering challenge. Two key components of the projects are '''synthesis''' of a solution and '''evaluation''' of the final product. Both of these components are the highest order objectives in [[Bloom's Taxonomy]].

===Industrial Arts Curricula in NSW===
Industrial Arts has a single compulsory course for Years 7 and 8: Technology (Mandatory). This course also has area that cover Home Economics concepts and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) content.

For Years 9 and 10 all Industrial Arts courses are electives, the three electives on offer are Design and Technology, Graphics Technology and Industrial Technology. The most popular Industrial Arts elective is Industrial Technology.

*'''Design and Technology''': this course centres on design without a prescribed context, so students may work with a variety of non-specified technologies. Students are given a design challenge and they come up with a solution. Their passage through the design process is documented in a Design Folio. In some schools Design and Technology may not be delivered by the Industrial Arts faculty, in some schools the [[Home Economics]] faculty may run the Design and Technology course.
*'''Graphics Technology''': this course introduces students to both manual (pencil) technical drawing and [[Computer Aided Design]] (CAD). This course has a core study in Year 9 and then a variety of electives for Year 10 including: Engineering Drawing, Architectural Drawing and Computer Animation.
*'''Industrial Technology''': this course may be studied with a variety of different disciplines with the most popular ones being: [[timber]], [[metal]], [[electronics]], [[multimedia]] and [[engineering]]. All have a common theme that students are involved in designing and making projects relevant to the context being studied. For example, a student in Industrial Technology – Multimedia may be asked to design an animation or website advertising a product. The development of their project is documented in their Project Report. A key part of the project report is evaluation of the finished product.

In Years 11 and 12 Industrial Arts offers three [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] (HSC) non-Vocational courses: Design and Technology, Engineering Studies and Industrial Technology.
*'''Design and Technology''' is an extension of the junior course of the same name. The course centres on design without a prescribed context, so students may work with a variety of non-specified technologies. For their HSC students must create a Major Design Project. Students establish a need and then try to solve it and realise a solution. A key part of the project is evaluation through the design process. The Major Design project counts for 60% of their final HSC examination mark.
*'''Engineering Studies''' is primarily a theory course that introduces students to the engineered world. The course looks at a variety of engineering applications and fields of engineering. Students learn about engineering history and societal implications, [[engineering mechanics]], [[engineering materials]], engineering electronics and engineering communication methods. The course introduces students to many concepts that they would otherwise first encounter in undergraduate engineering programmes at university.  One of the fundamental aspects of the course is learning engineering through the investigation of real life applications. This builds greater significance and understanding in students.
*'''Industrial Technology''' is also an extension of the junior course of the same name. The course centres on students working within a prescribed technology such as: Timber Products and Furniture Industries, Multimedia Industries Automotive Industries, Electronics Industries, Graphics Industries and Metal and Engineering Industries. For their HSC students must create a Major Project. Students develop a project and document their progress through the project. Hence they learn the vital skills of project management. Similar to Design and Technology evaluation of the project is an important part of the associated documentation.  The Major Project counts for 60% of their final HSC examination mark. The fundamental difference between Industrial Technology and Design and Technology is that a student studying Industrial Technology must study theory relevant to specific technology and also study industry practices relevant to their technology.

==Professional Association for Industrial Arts in New South Wales==
In NSW the professional association for Industrial Arts teachers is the [[Institute of Industrial Arts Technology Education]] ([[IIATE]]). This organisation releases a quarterly journal (on CD) and also runs an annual conference that investigates matters relevant to Industrial Arts education. Moreover, the IIATE represents Industrial Arts teachers in a variety of situations such as syllabus development meetings and teacher training interviews.

Another important role that The IIATE fulfils is that of Professional Learning. The IIATE has run some very successful training days called ''Hands on Technology'' where teachers are able to build their skills and knowledge in a variety of areas. This ''Hands on'' concept has now been extended with the ''Hands on Engineering'' day now being developed to assist teachers in delivering the Industrial Arts' courses Industrial Technology - Engineering and Engineering Studies.

The IIATE has also successfully run training programmes for CAD software which has enable many more teachers to effectively embed CAD into their teaching.

'''Land recycling''' is the reuse of abandoned, vacant, or underused properties for [[redevelopment]] or repurposing.

Land recycling aims to ensure the reuse of [[developed land]] as part of: new developments; [[decontamination|cleaning up]] contaminated properties; reuse and/or making use of used land surrounded by development or nearby infrastructure. End-uses from land recycling may include: mixed-use, residential, commercial, or industrial developments; and/or [[Public space|public open space]] such as [[urban open space]] use by [[urban park]]s, [[community garden]]s; or larger [[open space reserve]]s such as [[regional park]]s.

Since many abandoned and underutilized properties lie within economically distressed and disadvantaged communities, land recycling often benefits and stimulates re-investment in historically under-served areas. The real or perceived presence of [[xenobiotic]] [[hazardous substance]]s from historical previous uses or ''in situ'' [[land pollution]], causing [[soil contamination]] and [[groundwater pollution]], may complicate the redevelopment of such properties. Such environmentally distressed properties, with site cleanup and mitigation considerations, are commonly referred to as [[brownfield]]s.

==Synonyms==
Other commonly used terms can relate to or serve as synonyms of land recycling:

* '''[[Infill|Infill development]]''': development that takes place within existing communities, making maximum use of the existing [[infrastructure]] instead of building on previously undeveloped land; 
* '''[[Sustainable development]]''': Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs; and
* '''[[Brownfield land|Brownfield development]]''': development of [[real property]] for which its reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a [[dangerous goods|hazardous substance]], pollutant or contaminant.

==Benefits==

The US Government [[Accountability Office]] estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfields and almost {{convert|15|e6acre|km2}} of potentially contaminated properties across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Brownfield Redevelopment: Stakeholders Report That EPA's Program Helps to Redevelop Sites, but Additional Measures Could Complement Agency Efforts
GAO-05-94; December 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; These sites sit idle and neglected, serving as desolate eyesores within their communities. By putting these barren infill sites to use, land recycling revitalizes communities, promotes [[sustainable development]], and preserves precious [[land resource|resources]]. The social, economic, environmental, and other benefits of land recycling include:

* Social and economic [[revitalization]]
* Sustainability
* An alternative to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]
* Direction of [[economic development|development]] to urban cores
* Addressing [[climate change]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Social and economic revitalization===

Land recycling helps clean up and revitalize inner cities by returning abandoned, idle, or underused sites to productive use, bolstering [[community spirit]], creating jobs and boosting local tax-revenues.

The re-use of land revitalizes communities and renews economic activity, particularly in under-served urban areas. Abandoned, idled, and vacant properties often lie in former industrial and commercial areas, typically in urban and historically disadvantaged areas. These sites can be community eyesores, negatively impacting social and economic development, and often human and [[environmental health]]. The failure to redevelop brownfields in particular translates into potentially more exposure to toxics and the loss of economic and housing benefits that can come from appropriate redevelopment.

By putting these properties to new and productive use, land recycling encourages growth of [[business]]es and services in such areas, helping to break up concentrations of [[poverty]], creating jobs, and stimulating additional private investment and local tax-revenue. An abandoned, well-situated, factory site can be cleaned up and redeveloped into a much-needed mixed-use development with a grocery store, senior housing, and access to public transportation. The addition of neighborhood-serving retail, affordable housing, or a clean public park in a disadvantaged community can boost local spirit and improve overall quality of life.

===Sustainability===
[[Sustainability]] involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Land recycling expresses an inherently sustainable idea, based on the same common-sense as recycling an aluminum can. Like other natural resources, land represents a shared investment that should be reused and recycled, rather than [[land consumption|consumed]] and abandoned after use. [[Recycling paper]] saves trees, reusing land saves land.

By encouraging the recycling rather than the consumption of land, land recycling promotes [[smart growth]] and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, {{convert|4.5|acre|m2}} of undeveloped land is conserved.
[http://www.gwu.edu/~eem/Brownfields/project_report/chapters-html.htm#chapter5 Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials]. As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption. Each infill development prevents sprawl into open space, forests and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.

===An alternative to sprawl===
Land recycling increases density in urban areas, by reducing [[urban sprawl]] and unplanned, low-density, [[automobile]]-dependent developments.

Sprawl development scatters housing, public transit, jobs and other amenities farther apart, demanding more frequent use of cars for travel. The increase in vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) produces a range of health and environmental problems, including air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased incidence of traffic jams and asthma. This results in a lower quality of life for residents, ever-increasing commute times, and the health implications of smog.

By moving new jobs, economic opportunities and community amenities farther from established populations, sprawl development can cripple once-thriving cities. This trend takes a toll on the socio-economic health of urban communities as growth retreats from the urban center.

Rather than take advantage of existing infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and public works, building sprawl projects abandons these resources and demands further consumption of land and resources.

Land recycling offers an intelligent alternative to sprawl development. It reuses vital infrastructure and public resources and creates compact, full-service neighborhoods that reduce [[vehicle use]] and [[carbon dependence]]. Rebuilding in urban neighborhoods generates reinvestment in vibrant economic and cultural centers, rather than drawing away much-needed resources. Compact, urban development through land recycling is essential to sustainable development and is key to managing rapid population growth across the United States and beyond. As daily commute times decrease, the general quality of life improves as residents have more time to enjoy the world around them.

===Directing development to urban cores===
Redirecting population growth and growth of businesses to already urbanized areas is integral to fostering sustainable communities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Applying sustainable principles to land use and growth management requires that growth be redirected from scattered fringe areas back to our urban cores, where people, services and infrastructure already exist. Building up our urban areas positively increases population density, providing the critical mass to support local services from coffee shops to grocery stores, public transit to libraries and symphony halls. Land recycling provides opportunities for urban renewal and to build truly livable communities: efficient, compact, vibrant urban neighborhoods integrated with public transit systems, which offer a mix of uses as well as affordable housing.

===Addressing climate change===
Land recycling effectively curbs [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] emissions by encouraging smart, compact growth that reduces [[vehicle dependence]]. Redevelopment within an urban core reduces commuting distances and therefore average vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by creating residential, office, and other amenities within close proximity. Since transportation alone accounts for a third of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the United States, land recycling offers a key tool in any fight against climate change.  A recent Urban Land Institute study found that compact urban developments reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by 20 to 40 percent &lt;ref&gt;Urban Land Institute.  Growing Cooler: The Evidence of Urban Development and Climate Change.  Available at  {{cite web|url=http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; because users are closer to amenities and can more easily rely on public transportation. Smart urban planning is therefore crucial to maximizing energy savings and overall reduction of greenhouse gases.

{{As of | 2009}} the green movement has started to emphasize the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System, a certification system that rewards the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. LEED certification signifies incorporation of smart building design and technology to reduce energy use and minimize waste. However, even if a building is energy-efficient, the energy required to travel to and from a LEED certified site may well exceed the energy saved through energy-efficient features. LEED certified buildings and other developments best benefit climate change when they reuse infill sites and access existing resources.

==Challenges==
While land recycling has great economic and environmental benefits, without the right tools, skills, and knowledge, reusing land can produce certain challenges.  Obstacles to redevelopment may include lack of funding and increased scrutiny. These can particularly impede projects on brownfields, which carry the stigma of contamination. Because of these concerns, the perceived ease of developing on open land, or [[greenfield land|greenfields]], remains alluring to many. Factors that hinder land recycling include:

* market factors
* environmental-liability risks
* uncertainty and cost
* complicated/confusing regulatory requirements
* difficulty in obtaining project financing
* the lure of greenfields

===Market factors===
As the saying goes, in [[real estate]] only three things matter: location, location, location. Because idled and underused infill sites are often located in distressed urban areas concerns arise about crime, safety, and access to quality education and services. These and other market factors frequently pull development to open land near traditionally desirable communities and away from urban infill sites.

====Greenfields competition====
Brownfields and infill sites must compete with attractive, undeveloped suburban and rural land, also called [[greenfield land]]. When considering the real or perceived risks and costs of land recycling, a greenfield development may seem more economically sensible as the immediate costs are typically less than developing on an infill or brownfield site. However, it is important to consider the long-term economic gain of land recycling and the added social and environmental rewards of sustainable development.

===Brownfields===
As defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, a [[brownfield]] site is “real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant”. In other words, brownfield sites comprise abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.

====Uncertainty and costs====
Assessing whether or not a site is contaminated can be a costly process that deters land reuse. Potential purchasers are often unwilling or unable to risk an investment in a site assessment for a property that may require cleanup they cannot afford. Even if a site has been purchased, concerns over cleanup costs may further stall redevelopment. Uncertainty over time, cost or a high price for cleanup leaves many brownfield sites in development limbo.

====Project financing====
Obtaining private front-end financing for brownfield cleanup can be a difficult process{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Since financing is more readably available for development on greenfields, infill and brownfield sites are often passed over.

===Environmental-liability risks===
Although recent changes in some country's federal laws provide some liability relief to new purchasers of contaminated properties, the law remains very complex and many state laws still have strict liability covering real property. Thus, in many cases, any current or past property owner can potentially be legally and financially liable regardless of who is responsible for contamination. This liability web continues to throw a chill on many brownfield projects even in the presence of regulatory reforms designed to encourage redevelopment. A common belief among many brownfield owners is that it is less risky and cheaper to abandon or “mothball” a facility than to conduct a site assessment that could trigger large cleanup costs and potential liability.

====Regulatory requirements====
The potentially complex process of successfully redeveloping an infill site, particularly a brownfield, can challenge land recycling interest and proposals.  Understanding and complying with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements can be daunting for some property owners and developers. Guidance from legal specialists and environmental cleanup consultants is often needed to design, develop, and guide a project through the process of regulatory requirements and permitting approvals.

'''''{{lang|la|Lectio difficilior potior}}''''' ([[Latin]] for "the more difficult reading is the stronger") is a main principle of [[textual criticism]]. Where different manuscripts conflict on a particular word, the principle suggests that the more unusual one is more likely the original. The presupposition is that scribes would more often replace odd words and hard sayings with more familiar and less controversial ones, than vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice A. Robinson, "[http://www.reltech.org/TC/v06/Robinson2001.html New Testament Textual Criticism: The Case for Byzantine Priority]", 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; It will readily be seen that ''lectio difficilior potior'' is an internal criterion, which is independent of criteria for evaluating the manuscript in which it is found,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Emanuel |last=Tov |title=Criteria for Evaluating Textual Readings: The Limitations of Textual Rules |work=[[Harvard Theological Review]] |volume=75 |issue=4 |date=October 1982 |pages=429–448 esp. pp. 439ff |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/48032678/Criteria-for-Evaluating-Textual-Reading |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is as applicable to manuscripts of a ''[[roman courtois]]'' or a classical poet as it is to a biblical text.

The principle was one among a number that became established in early 18th-century text criticism, as part of attempts by scholars of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] to provide a neutral basis for discovering an ''[[wikt:urtext|urtext]]'' that was independent of the weight of traditional authority.

==History==
According to Paolo Trovato who cites as source Sebastiano Timpanaro, the principle was first mentioned by Jean Le Clerc in 1696 in his ''Ars critica''.&lt;ref&gt;Page 117 in  Trovato, P. (2014). Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Lachmann's Method. libreriauniversitaria.it.&lt;/ref&gt;
It was also laid down by [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]], in his ''Prodromus Novi Testamenti Graeci Rectè Cautèque Adornandi'', 1725, and employed in his ''Novum Testamentum Graecum'', 1734.&lt;ref&gt;Noted in an observation by [[Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener]] in ''A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New testament'' (E. Miller, ed. 1894:vol. ii, p. 247) by [[William Laughton Lorimer|W.L. Lorimer]], ""Lectio Difficilior", ''The Classical Review'' '''48'''.5 (November 1934:171).&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely promulgated by [[Johann Jakob Wettstein]] to whom it is often attributed.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. by [[H. J. Rose]] in ''The Classical Review'' '''48''' (126 note 2, corrected by Lorimer 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usefulness==
Many scholars considered the employment of ''lectio difficilior potior'' an objective criterion that would even override other evaluative considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Tov 1982:432.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet and scholar [[A.E. Housman]] challenged such reactive applications in 1922, in the provocatively-titled article "The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnx.org/content/m11803/latest/ ''Proceedings of the Classical Association'' '''18''' (1922), pp67-84.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, taken as an axiom, the principle ''lectio difficilior'' produces an [[eclectic text]], rather than one based on a history of manuscript transmission. "Modern eclectic [[praxis (process)|praxis]] operates on a variant unit basis without any apparent consideration of the consequences", [[Maurice A. Robinson]] warned. He suggested that to the principle "should be added a corollary, difficult readings created by individual scribes do not tend to perpetuate in any significant degree within transmissional history".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A noted proponent of the superiority of the [[Byzantine text-type]], the form of the Greek New Testament in the largest number of surviving manuscripts, Robinson would use the corollary to explain differences from the [[Majority Text]] as scribal errors that were not perpetuated because they were known to be errant or because they existed only in a small number of manuscripts ''at the time''.

Most textual-critical scholars would explain the corollary by the assumption that scribes tended to "correct" harder readings and so cut off the stream of transmission. Thus, only earlier manuscripts would have the harder readings. Later manuscripts would not see the corollary principle as being a very important one to get closer to the original form of the text.

However, ''lectio difficilior'' is not to be taken as an absolute rule either but as a general guideline. "''In general'' the more difficult reading is to be preferred" is [[Bruce Metzger]]'s reservation.&lt;ref&gt;Italics supplied. [[Bruce Metzger]], ''The Text of the New Testament'', II.i.1, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; "There is truth in the maxim: ''lectio difficilior lectio potior'' ('the more difficult reading is the more probable reading')", write Kurt and Barbara Aland.&lt;ref&gt;Aland, ''The Text of the New Testament'', pp. 275-276; the Alands' twelve basic principles of textual criticism are [http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/text_crit.html reported on-line].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for scholars like [[Kurt Aland]] who follow a path of reasoned eclecticism that is based on evidence both internal and external to the manuscripts, "this principle must not be taken too mechanically, with the most difficult reading (''lectio difficillima'') adopted as original simply because of its degree of difficulty".&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Martin Litchfield West]] cautions, "When we choose the 'more difficult reading'... we must be sure that it is in itself a plausible reading. The principle should not be used in support of dubious syntax, or phrasing that it would not have been natural for the author to use. There is an important difference between a more ''difficult'' reading and a more ''unlikely'' reading".&lt;ref&gt;West 1973, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''You may also be looking for a journal [[Leisure Studies]]''
'''Leisure studies''' is a branch of the [[social sciences]] that focuses on understanding and analyzing [[leisure]]. [[Recreation]] and [[tourism]] are common topics of leisure research.

The [[National Recreation and Park Association]] is the national organization in the United States for leisure studies, and offers [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] to many universities to offer courses of study ([[Academic degree|degree]] programs) in leisure studies.

The ''Journal of Leisure Research''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://js.sagamorepub.com/jlr|title=Journal of Leisure Research|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Journal of Park and Recreation Administration'' are some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wilderdom.com/journals/journalsRecreation&amp;Leisure.htm|title=Peer-reviewed Journals in Recreation &amp; Leisure Studies|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholarly US [[academic journal]]s of leisure studies.



==History==

While leisure studies has existed for much longer, a first centralized organization for directing leisure studies was established in [[Birmingham, England]], in May 1975, and is known as the Leisure Studies Association. In 1984, the first international conference was held by the LSA at the [[University of Sussex]] in Brighton, which also set the record as the largest LSA event held to date with over 275 attendees. LSA conferences are widely regarded as some of the most attended events for leisure researchers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leisurestudies.org/history-of-lsa|title=ORIGINS OF LSA - Leisure Studies Association|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Pursuing a degree in leisure studies will give students the opportunity to learn how to incorporate leisure into recreational activities and [[tourism]]. Students take a wide variety of classes ranging from [[psychology]] and [[social sciences]] to [[biology]] and [[anatomy]]. Students learn how to improve and foster a healthy life through leisure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinedegrees.org/degrees/leisure-studies/|title=Leisure Studies Degrees|work=Online Degrees|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leisure activities==
The leisure activities that people who work in leisure studies deal with include a very broad range of activities. Most of the activities can be separated into 3 sub-categories: sport and recreation, tourism, and leisure.
[[Sport]] and [[recreation]] activities is one of the broadest categories in leisure studies. This includes sports, both traditional and non-traditional, and any indoor or outdoor physical activities done for recreational purposes. Sport and recreation activities includes, but is not limited to, [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[running]], [[hiking]], [[weight training|weight lifting]], [[playing]] [[games]] and other [[outdoor recreation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/majors/parks-recreation-fitness-parks-recreation-leisure-studiesM|title=Big Future by The College Board|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tourism]] describes the traveling for leisure purposes. Destinations include [[public parks|parks]] and [[national parks]], [[hiking|hikes]], and domestic and foreign [[city|cities]].

All other activities that are not considered to be a part of sport and recreation or tourism are included general leisure activities. This category is quite vast, and includes, but are not limited to, [[yoga]], [[the arts]], [[nature conservation]], and other hobbies.&lt;ref name="csulb.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careers.csulb.edu/monographs/cohhs_recreatio.html|title=Careers Profiles|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mathematics and architecture''' are related, since, [[mathematics and art|as with other arts]], [[architect]]s use [[mathematics]] for several reasons. Apart from the mathematics needed when engineering [[building]]s, architects use [[geometry]]: to define the spatial form of a building; from the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] of the sixth century BC onwards, to create forms considered harmonious, and thus to lay out buildings and their surroundings according to mathematical, [[aesthetic]] and sometimes religious principles; to decorate buildings with mathematical objects such as [[tessellation]]s; and to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise wind speeds around the bases of tall buildings.

In &lt;!--[[History of Science and Technology in China|Ancient China]], Needs section in article before we put this here--&gt;[[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Ancient Greece]], [[Architecture of India|India]], and the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic world]], buildings including [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], temples, mosques, palaces and [[mausoleum]]s were laid out with specific proportions for religious reasons. In Islamic architecture, [[Geometry|geometric]] shapes and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric tiling patterns]] are used to decorate buildings, both inside and outside. Some Hindu temples have a [[fractal]]-like structure where parts resemble the whole, conveying a message about the infinite in [[Hindu cosmology]]. In [[Chinese architecture]], the [[tulou]] of [[Fujian province]] are circular, communal defensive structures. In the twenty-first century, mathematical ornamentation is again being used to cover public buildings.

In [[Renaissance architecture]], [[symmetry]] and proportion were deliberately emphasized by architects such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Sebastiano Serlio]] and [[Andrea Palladio]], influenced by [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'' from [[Ancient Rome]] and the arithmetic of the Pythagoreans from Ancient Greece.
At the end of the nineteenth century, [[Vladimir Shukhov]] in [[Russia]] and [[Antoni Gaudí]] in [[Barcelona]] pioneered the use of [[hyperboloid structures]]; in the [[Sagrada Família]], Gaudí also incorporated [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] [[paraboloid]]s, tessellations, [[catenary arch]]es, [[catenoid]]s, [[helicoid]]s, and [[ruled surface]]s. In the twentieth century, styles such as [[modern architecture]] and [[Deconstructivism]] explored different geometries to achieve desired effects. [[Minimal surface]]s have been exploited in tent-like roof coverings as at [[Denver International Airport]], while [[Richard Buckminster Fuller]] pioneered the use of the strong [[thin-shell structure]]s known as [[geodesic dome]]s.

==Connected fields==
[[File:CdM, presunto autoritratto di leon battista alberti, white ground.jpg|thumb|upright|In the [[Renaissance]], an [[architect]] like [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was expected to be knowledgeable in many disciplines, including [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]].]]

The architects Michael Ostwald and Kim Williams, considering the relationships between [[architecture]] and [[mathematics]], note that the fields as commonly understood might seem to be only weakly connected, since architecture is a profession concerned with the practical matter of making buildings, while mathematics is the pure [[Number theory|study of number]] and other abstract objects. But, they argue, the two are strongly connected, and have been since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. In Ancient Rome, [[Vitruvius]] described an architect as a man who knew enough of a range of other disciplines, primarily [[geometry]], to enable him to oversee skilled artisans in all the other necessary areas, such as masons and carpenters. The same applied in the [[Middle Ages]], where graduates learnt [[arithmetic]], geometry and [[aesthetics]] alongside the basic syllabus of grammar, logic, and rhetoric (the [[trivium]]) in elegant halls made by master builders who had guided many craftsmen. A master builder at the top of his profession was given the title of architect or engineer. In the [[Renaissance]], the [[quadrivium]] of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy became an extra syllabus expected of the [[Renaissance man]] such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. Similarly in England, Sir [[Christopher Wren]], known today as an architect, was firstly a noted astronomer.&lt;ref name=Ostwald1&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Williams, Kim |editor2=Ostwald, Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume I: from Antiquity to the 1500s |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2015 |isbn=978-3-319-00136-4 |pages=chapter 1. 1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams and Ostwald, further overviewing the interaction of mathematics and architecture since 1500 according to the approach of the German sociologist [[Theodor W. Adorno|Theodor Adorno]], identify three tendencies among architects, namely: to be [[revolutionary]], introducing wholly new ideas; [[reactionary]], failing to introduce change; or [[revivalist artist|revivalist]], actually going backwards. They argue that architects have avoided looking to mathematics for inspiration in revivalist times. This would explain why in revivalist periods, such as the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in 19th century England, architecture had little connection to mathematics. Equally, they note that in reactionary times such as the Italian [[Mannerism]] of about 1520 to 1580, or the 17th century [[Baroque]] and [[Palladian]] movements, mathematics was barely consulted. In contrast, the revolutionary early 20th century movements such as [[Futurism]] and [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] actively rejected old ideas, embracing mathematics and leading to [[Modernist]] architecture. Towards the end of the 20th century, too, [[fractal]] geometry was quickly seized upon by architects, as was [[aperiodic tiling]], to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings.&lt;ref name=Ostwald48&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Williams, Kim |editor2=Ostwald, Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume II: The 1500s to the Future |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2015 |isbn=978-3-319-00142-5 |pages=chapter 48. 1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architects use mathematics for several reasons, leaving aside the necessary use of mathematics in the [[Architectural engineering|engineering of buildings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Architectural Engineering Overview |url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/archeng/archeng.pdf |publisher=Sloan Career Cornerstone Center |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, they use geometry because it defines the spatial form of a building.&lt;ref name=Leyton&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leyton |first1=Michael |title=A Generative Theory of Shape |date=2001 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-42717-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, they use mathematics to design forms that are [[aesthetic|considered beautiful]] or harmonious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stakhov |first1=Alexey |last2=Olsen |first2=Olsen |title=The Mathematics of Harmony: From Euclid to Contemporary Mathematics and Computer Science |date=2009 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-277-582-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the time of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] with their religious philosophy of number,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=William |authorlink1=William Smith (lexicographer) |title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |date=1870 |publisher=Little, Brown |page=620}}&lt;/ref&gt; architects in [[Greek architecture|Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic world]] and the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] have chosen the [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s of the built environment – buildings and their designed surroundings – according to mathematical as well as aesthetic and sometimes religious principles.&lt;ref name=Vitruvius2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tennant/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rai/&gt;&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt; Thirdly, they may use mathematical objects such as [[tessellation]]s to decorate buildings.&lt;ref name=Utrecht&gt;{{cite web |last1=van den Hoeven |first1=Saskia |last2=van der Veen |first2=Maartje |title=Muqarnas: Mathematics in Islamic Arts |url=http://www.jphogendijk.nl/projects/muqarnas2010.pdf |publisher=Utrecht University |accessdate=30 September 2015 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cucker103&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felipe |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=103–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourthly, they may use mathematics in the form of computer modelling to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise whirling air currents at the base of tall buildings.&lt;ref name=Freiberger/&gt;

==Secular aesthetics==

===Ancient Rome===
[[File:Greekhse1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;|Plan of a Greek house by [[Vitruvius]]]]

====Vitruvius====
{{further information|Vitruvius|Vitruvian module|De architectura}}
[[File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - Interior of the Pantheon, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The interior of the [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]] by [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]], 1758]]

The influential Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius argued that the design of a building such as a temple depends on two qualities, proportion and ''symmetria''. Proportion ensures that each part of a building relates harmoniously to every other part. ''Symmetria'' in Vitruvius's usage means something closer to the English term modularity than [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as again it relates to the assembling of (modular) parts into the whole building. In his Basilica at [[Fano]], he uses ratios of small integers, especially the [[triangular number]]s (1, 3, 6, 10,&amp;nbsp;...) to proportion the structure into [[Vitruvian module|(Vitruvian) modules]].{{efn|In Book 4, chapter 3 of ''[[De architectura]]'', he discusses modules directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vitruvius |title=VITRUVIUS, BOOK IV, CHAPTER 3 On the Doric order |url=http://www.vitruvius.be/boek4h3.htm|website=Vitruvius.be |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus the Basilica's width to length is 1:2; the aisle around it is as high as it is wide, 1:1; the columns are five feet thick and fifty feet high, 1:10.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Vitruvius |title=On Architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBLNbOp46CYC&amp;pg=PR9 |year=2009 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-193195-1 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dehio 1 Pantheon Floor plan.jpg|thumb|upright|Floor plan of the Pantheon]]

Vitruvius named three qualities required of architecture in his ''[[De architectura]]'', c. 15 B.C.: firmness, usefulness (or "Commodity" in [[Henry Wotton]]'s 16th century English), and delight. These can be used as categories for classifying the ways in which mathematics is used in architecture. Firmness encompasses the use of mathematics to ensure a building stands up, hence the mathematical tools used in design and to support construction, for instance to ensure stability and to model performance. Usefulness derives in part from the effective application of mathematics, reasoning about and analysing the spatial and other relationships in a design. Delight is an attribute of the resulting building, resulting from the embodying of mathematical relationships in the building; it includes aesthetic, sensual and intellectual qualities.&lt;ref name="WilliamsOstwald2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Kim |last2=Ostwald |first2=Michael J. |title=Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future: Volume I: Antiquity to the 1500s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWKYBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42 |date=9 February 2015 |publisher=Birkhäuser |isbn=978-3-319-00137-1 |pages=42, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Pantheon====
{{main article|Pantheon (Rome)}}

[[File:Santa Maria Novella.jpg|thumb|Facade of [[Santa Maria Novella]], [[Florence]], 1470. The frieze (with squares) and above is by [[Leon Battista Alberti]].]]

The first Renaissance treatise on architecture was Leon Battista Alberti's 1450 ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' (On the Art of Building); it became the first printed book on architecture in 1485. It was partly based on Vitruvius's ''De architectura'' and, via Nicomachus, Pythagorean arithmetic. Alberti starts with a cube, and derives ratios from it. Thus the diagonal of a face gives the ratio 1:{{radic|2}}, while the diameter of the sphere which circumscribes the cube gives 1:{{radic|3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=March |first1=Lionel |title=Renaissance mathematics and architectural proportion in Alberti's De re aedificatoria |journal=Architectural Research Quarterly |date=1996 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=54–65 |doi=10.1017/S135913550000110X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sphere circumscribing a cube |url=http://www.mathalino.com/reviewer/solid-mensuration-solid-geometry/013-insciribed-and-circumscribed-sphere-about-cube-volume- |website=Mathalino.com Engineering Math Review |accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alberti also documented [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s discovery of [[linear perspective]], developed to enable the design of buildings which would look beautifully proportioned when viewed from a convenient distance.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt;

The next major text was [[Sebastiano Serlio]]'s ''Regole generali d'architettura'' (General Rules of Architecture); the first volume appeared in Venice in 1537; the 1545 volume (books 1 and 2) covered geometry and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]].

The [[pyramid]]s of [[Ancient Egypt]] are [[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices|tombs]] constructed with deliberately chosen proportions, but which these were has been debated. The face angle is about 51°85’, and the ratio of the slant height to half the base length is 1.619, less than 1% from the [[golden ratio]].

The mathematics of [[fractals]] has been used to show that the reason why existing buildings have universal appeal and are visually satisfying is because they provide the viewer with a sense of scale at different viewing distances. For example, in the tall [[gopuram]] gatehouses of [[Hindu]] temples such as the [[Virupaksha Temple, Hampi|Virupaksha Temple]] at [[Hampi]] built in the seventh century, and others such as the [[Kandariya Mahadev Temple]] at [[Khajuraho]], the parts and the whole have the same character, with [[fractal dimension]] in the range 1.7 to 1.8.

[[Pythagoras]] (c. 569 – c. 475 B.C.) and his followers, the Pythagoreans, held that "all things are numbers". They observed the harmonies produced by notes with specific small-integer ratios of frequency, and argued that buildings too should be designed with such ratios. The Greek word ''symmetria'' originally denoted the harmony of architectural shapes in precise ratios from a building's smallest details right up to its entire design.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=J.

The [[Parthenon]] is {{convert|69.5|m|ft}} long, {{convert|30.9|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|13.7|m|ft}} high to the cornice. This gives a ratio of width to length of 4:9, and the same for height to width. Putting these together gives height:width:length of 16:36:81, or to the delight&lt;ref name="Maor2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maor|first=Eli|title=The Pythagorean Theorem: A 4,000-year History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5VoBGy3AoAC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12526-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Pythagoreans 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This sets the module as 0.858&amp;nbsp;m. A 4:9 rectangle can be constructed as three contiguous rectangles with sides in the ratio 3:4. Each half-rectangle is then a convenient 3:4:5 right triangle, enabling the angles and sides to be checked with a suitably knotted rope. The inner area (naos) similarly has 4:9 proportions ({{convert|21.44|m|ft}} wide by 48.3&amp;nbsp;m long); the ratio between the diameter of the outer columns, {{convert|1.905|m|ft}}, and the spacing of their centres, {{convert|4.293|m|ft}}, is also 4:9.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt;

The Parthenon is considered by authors such as [[John Julius Norwich]] "the most perfect Doric temple ever built".&lt;ref name=Norwich/&gt; Its elaborate architectural refinements include "a subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [[naos (architecture)|naos]] walls and the ''entasis'' of the columns".&lt;ref name=Norwich&gt;{{cite book |author=Norwich, John Julius |title=Great Architecture of the World |publisher=Artists House |year=2001 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entasis]]'' refers to the subtle diminution in diameter of the columns as they rise. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in other classical Greek temples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Penrose, Francis |title=Principles of Athenian Architecture |publisher=Society of Dilettanti |year=1973 |origyear=1851 |page=ch. II.3, plate 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the platform has a slight parabolic upward curvature to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outwards, but they actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on, they would meet about a mile above the centre of the building; since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [[architrave]] and roof above: "all follow the rule of being built to delicate curves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stevens, Gorham P. |title=Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |volume=66 |issue=3 |date=July 1962 |pages=337–338 |doi=10.2307/501468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The golden ratio was known in 300 B.C., when [[Euclid]] described the method of geometric construction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Euclid's Elements|Euclid. ''Elements'']]. Book 6, Proposition 30.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the golden ratio was used in the design of the Parthenon and other ancient Greek buildings, as well as sculptures, paintings, and vases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Archibald, R.

[[File:Selimiye Mosque.png|thumb|upright|Selimiye Mosque, 1569–1575]]

The [[Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]], Turkey, was built by [[Mimar Sinan]] to provide a space where the [[mihrab]] could be see from anywhere inside the building. The very large central space is accordingly arranged as an octagon, formed by 8 enormous pillars, and capped by a circular dome of {{convert|31.25|m|ft}} diameter and {{convert|43|m|ft}} high. The octagon is formed into a square with four semidomes, and externally by four exceptionally tall minarets, {{convert|83|m|ft}} tall.

[[Mughal architecture]], as seen in the abandoned imperial city of [[Fatehpur Sikri]] and the [[Taj Mahal]] complex, has a distinctive mathematical order and a strong aesthetic based on symmetry and harmony.&lt;ref name=Rai&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rai |first1=Jaswant |title=Mathematics and Aesthetics in Islamic Architecture: Reference to Fatehpur Sikri |journal=Journal of King Saud University, Architecture &amp; Planning |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=19–48 |date=1993 |url=http://repository.ksu.edu.sa/jspui/handle/123456789/560}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michell |first1=George |last2=Pasricha |first2=Amit |title=Mughal Architecture &amp; Gardens |date=2011 |publisher=Antique Collectors Club |isbn=978-1-85149-670-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The white marble [[mausoleum]], decorated with [[pietra dura]], the great gate (''Darwaza-i rauza''), other buildings, the gardens and paths together form a unified hierarchical design. The buildings include a [[mosque]] in red sandstone on the west, and an almost identical building, the Jawab or 'answer' on the east to maintain the bilateral symmetry of the complex. The formal [[charbagh]] ('fourfold garden') is in four parts, symbolising the four rivers of paradise, and offering views and reflections of the mausoleum. These are divided in turn into 16 parterres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Koch | first=Ebba | title=The Complete Taj Mahal: And the Riverfront Gardens of Agra| edition=1st| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson | isbn=0-500-34209-1| pages=24 and passim | date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taj site plan.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Site plan of the Taj Mahal complex. The great gate is at the right, the mausoleum in the centre, bracketed by the mosque (below) and the jawab. The plan includes squares and [[octagon]]s.]]

The Taj Mahal complex was laid out on a grid, subdivided into smaller grids. The historians of architecture Koch and Barraud agree with the traditional accounts that give the width of the complex as 374 Mughal yards or [[gaz (measure)|gaz]],{{efn|1 gaz is about {{convert|0.86|m|ft}}.}} the main area being three 374-gaz squares. These were divided in areas like the bazaar and caravanserai into 17-gaz modules; the garden and terraces are in modules of 23 gaz, and are 368 gaz wide (16 x 23). The mausoleum, mosque and guest house are laid out on a grid of 7 gaz. Koch and Barraud observe that if an octagon, used repeatedly in the complex, is given sides of 7 units, then it has a width of 17 units,{{efn|A square drawn around the octagon by prolonging alternate sides adds four right angle triangles with hypotenuse of 7 and the other two sides of {{radic|49/2}} or 4.9497..., nearly 5.

Islamic buildings are often decorated with [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] which typically make use of several mathematical [[tessellations]], formed of ceramic tiles ([[girih]], [[zellige]]) that may themselves be plain or decorated with stripes.&lt;ref name=StAndrewsArchitecture/&gt; Symmetries such as stars with six, eight, or multiples of eight points are used in Islamic patterns. Some of these are based on the 'Khatem Sulemani' or Solomon's seal motif, which is an eight-pointed star made of two squares, one rotated 45 degrees from the other on the same centre.&lt;ref name=Ronning&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.exeter.ac.uk/PErnest/pome24/ronning%20_geometry_and_Islamic_patterns.pdf | title=Islamic Patterns And Symmetry Groups | publisher=University of Exeter | accessdate=18 April 2014 | author=Rønning, Frode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic patterns exploit many of the 17 possible [[wallpaper groups]]; as early as 1944, Edith Müller showed that the Alhambra made use of 11 wallpaper groups in its decorations, while in 1986 [[Branko Grünbaum]] claimed to have found 13 wallpaper groups in the Alhambra, asserting controversially that the remaining 4 groups are not found anywhere in Islamic ornament.&lt;ref name=Ronning/&gt;

===Modern architectural decoration===
{{further information|Ornament (art)|Contemporary architecture}}

Towards the end of the 20th century, novel mathematical constructs such as fractal geometry and aperiodic tiling were seized upon by architects to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings.&lt;ref name=Ostwald48/&gt; In 1913, the Modernist architect [[Adolf Loos]] had declared that "Ornament is a crime",&lt;ref name=Gibberd&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gibberd |first1=Matt |last2=Hill |first2=Albert |title=The Return of Ornamentation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/property-and-architecture/7279/the-return-of-ornamentation.html |accessdate=12 October 2015 |work=The Telegraph |date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; influencing architectural thinking for the rest of the 20th century. In the 21st century, architects are again starting to explore the use of [[Ornament (art)|ornament]]. 21st century ornamentation is extremely diverse. Henning Larsen's 2011 [[Harpa Concert and Conference Centre]], Reykjavik has what looks like a crystal wall of rock made of large blocks of glass.&lt;ref name=Gibberd/&gt; Foreign Office Architects' 2010 [[Ravensbourne College]], London is tessellated decoratively with 28,000 anodised aluminium tiles in red, white and brown, interlinking circular windows of differing sizes.

==Defence==

===Europe===
{{further information|Star fort}}

The architecture of [[fortification]]s evolved from [[medieval fortification|medieval fortresses]], which had high masonry walls, to low, symmetrical [[star fort]]s able to resist [[artillery]] bombardment between the mid-fifteenth and nineteenth centuries. The geometry of the star shapes was dictated by the need to avoid dead zones where attacking infantry could shelter from defensive fire; the sides of the projecting points were angled to permit such fire to sweep the ground, and to provide crossfire (from both sides) beyond each projecting point. Well-known architects who designed such defences include [[Michelangelo]], [[Baldassare Peruzzi]], [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] and [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Duffy, C. |year=1975 |title=Fire &amp; Stone, The Science of Fortress Warfare 1660–1860 |publisher=Booksales |isbn=978-0-7858-2109-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler |first1=David |title=The Art of Warfare in the Age of Marlborough |date=1990 |publisher=Spellmount |isbn=978-0-946771-42-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural historian [[Siegfried Giedion]] argued that the star-shaped fortification had a formative influence on the patterning of the Renaissance [[Urban planning|ideal city]]: "The Renaissance was hypnotized by one city type which for a century and a half—from Filarete to Scamozzi—was impressed upon all utopian schemes: this is the star-shaped city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Giedion, Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Giedion |title=Space, Time and Architecture |publisher=Harvard University Press |origyear=1941 |date=1962 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[File:HakkaYongding.jpg|thumb|A [[tulou]] in [[Yongding County]], [[Fujian province]]]]

In [[Chinese architecture]], the [[tulou]] of [[Fujian province]] are circular, communal defensive structures with mainly blank walls and a single iron-plated wooden door, some dating back to the sixteenth century. The walls are topped with roofs that slope gently both outwards and inwards, forming a ring. The centre of the circle is an open cobbled courtyard, often with a well, surrounded by timbered galleries up to five stories high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Neill |first1=Tom |title=China's Remote Fortresses Lose Residents, Gain Tourists |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/01/150102-hakka-china-tulou-fujian-world-heritage-culture-housing/ |publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |accessdate=6 January 2017 |date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental goals==
[[File:Yakhchal of Yazd province.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yakhchal]] in [[Yazd]], Iran]]

Architects may also select the form of a building to meet environmental goals.&lt;ref name="SimitchWarke2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simitch |first1=Andrea |last2=Warke |first2=Val |title=The Language of Architecture: 26 Principles Every Architect Should Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2v-1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT191 |year=2014 |publisher=Rockport Publishers |isbn=978-1-62788-048-0 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Foster and Partners]]' [[30 St Mary Axe]], London, known as "[[#Top|The Gherkin]]"&lt;!--links to top (lead image)--&gt; for its [[cucumber]]-like shape, is a [[solid of revolution]] designed using [[Computer aided design|parametric modelling]]. Its geometry was chosen not purely for aesthetic reasons, but to minimise whirling air currents at its base. Despite the building's apparently curved surface, all the panels of glass forming its skin are flat, except for the lens at the top. Most of the panels are [[quadrilateral]]s, as they can be cut from rectangular glass with less wastage than triangular panels.&lt;ref name=Freiberger&gt;{{cite web |last1=Freiberger |first1=Marianne |title=Perfect buildings: the maths of modern architecture |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/perfect-buildings-maths-modern-architecture|publisher=Plus magazine|accessdate=5 October 2015|date=1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[yakhchal]] (ice pit) of [[Iran|Persia]] functioned as an [[evaporative cooler]]. Above ground, the structure had a domed shape, but had a subterranean storage space for ice and sometimes food as well. The subterranean space and the thick heat-resistant construction insulated the storage space year round. The internal space was often further cooled with [[windcatcher]]s. The ice was available in the summer to make the frozen dessert [[faloodeh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mahdavinejad |first=M. |author2=Javanrudi, Kavan |title=Assessment of Ancient Fridges: A Sustainable Method to Storage Ice in Hot-Arid Climates |journal=Asian Culture and History |date=July 2012 |volume=4 |issue=2 |doi=10.5539/ach.v4n2p133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

F.|title=Perspectives on culture, technology, and communication: The media ecology tradition|year=2006|publisher=NJ: Hampton|location=Gencarelli|pages=201–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ecology]] in this context refers to the environment in which the medium is used – what they are and how they affect society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Understanding Me:  Lectures and Interviews,'' by Marshall McLuhan, edited by Stephanie McLuhan and David Staines, Foreword by Tom Wolfe.  MIT Press, 2004, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Postman states, "if in biology a 'medium' is something in which a bacterial culture grows (as in a Petri dish), in media ecology, the medium is 'a technology within which a [human] culture grows.'" &lt;ref&gt;Postman, N. (2006). Media Ecology Education. Explorations in Media Ecology, 5(1), 5-14. doi:10.1386/eme.5.1.5_1&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "Media ecology looks into the matter of how media of communication affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; and how our interaction with media facilitates or impedes our chances of survival. The word ecology implies the study of environments: their structure, content, and impact on people. An environment is, after all, a complex message system which imposes on human beings certain ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/|title=What is Media Ecology?|last=Postman|first=Neil|date=|website=Media Ecology Association|publisher=|access-date=2 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Media ecology argues that media act as extensions of the human senses in each era, and [[communication technology]] is the primary cause of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hakanen|first=Ernest A.|title=Branding the teleself: Media effects discourse and the changing self|year=2007|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7391-1734-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan is famous for coining the phrase, "[[the medium is the message]]", which is an often-debated phrase believed to mean that the medium chosen to relay a message is just as important (if not more so) than the message itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McLuhan proposed that media influence the progression of society, and that significant periods of time and growth can be categorized by the rise of a specific technology during that period.

Additionally, scholars have compared media broadly to a system of infrastructure that connect the nature and culture of a society with media ecology being the study of "traffic" between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=eea7d6ba-45f9-4434-912c-3d9a2405e153@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=Infrastructuralism: Media as Traffic between Nature and Culture.: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

===Marshall McLuhan===

In 1934, Marshall McLuhan enrolled as a student at [[Cambridge University]], a school which pioneered modern literary [[criticism]]. During his studies at Cambridge, he became acquainted with one of his professors, [[I.A. Richards]], a distinguished English professor, who would inspire McLuhan's later scholarly works. McLuhan admired Richards' approach to the critical view that English studies are themselves nothing but a study of the process of communication.&lt;ref name="Marchand"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchand|first=Philip|title=Marshall McLuhan: The Medium and The Messenger : A Biography|year=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-63186-5|pages=37–39|edition=Rev Sub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards believed that "words won't stay put and almost all verbal constructions are highly ambiguous".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; This element of Richards' perspective on communication influenced the way in which McLuhan expressed many of his ideas using metaphors and phrases such as "[[Global village (term)|The Global Village]]" and "[[The Medium Is the Message]]" two of his most well known phrases that encapsulate the theory of Media Ecology.  
[[File:Marshall McLuhan.jpg|thumb|[[Marshall McLuhan]], c. 1936.]]
McLuhan used the approaches of Richards, [[William Empson]], and [[Harold Innis|Harlold Innis]] as an "entrée to the study of media".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; However, it took many years of work before he was able to successfully fulfill their approaches. McLuhan determined that "if words were ambiguous and best studied not in terms of their 'content' but in terms of their effects in a given context and if the effects were often subliminal, the same might be true of other human artifacts, the wheel, the printing press, the telegraph and the TV".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; This led to the emergence of his ideas on Media Ecology.

In addition to his scholarly work, McLuhan was also a well known media personality of his day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marshallmcluhan.com/biography/|title=Who was Marshall McLuhan? – The Estate of Marshall McLuhan|website=marshallmcluhan.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on television shows, in magazine articles, and even had a small cameo in the movie ''[[Annie Hall]]''.

Few theories receive the kind of household recognition that Media Ecology received, due directly to McLuhan's role as a pop culture icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullen|first=Megan|year=2006|title=Coming to Terms with the Future He Foresaw : Marshall McLuhan's 'Understanding Media'|jstor=40061070|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=47|issue=2|pages=373–380|doi=10.1353/tech.2006.0143}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an excellent debater and public speaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marshall McLuhan: The medium and the messenger|last=Marchand|first=Phillip|publisher=Ticknor &amp; Fields|year=1989|isbn=0899194850|location=New York|pages=153|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his writing was not always what would normally pass in academia.

=== Neil Postman ===
Inspired by McLuhan, [[Neil Postman]] founded the Program in Media Ecology at [[New York University]] in 1971, as he further developed the theory McLuhan had established. According to Postman, media ecology emphasizes the environments in which communication and technologies operate and spread information and the effects these have on the receivers.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "What is Media Ecology." ''Media Ecology Association.'' 2009. Web. 29 Sept 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "Such information forms as the alphabet, the printed word, and television images are not mere instruments which make things easier for us. They are environments - like language itself, symbolic environments with in which we discover, fashion, and express humanity in particular ways."&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "Teaching as a conserving activity." Instructor 89.4 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

Postman focused on media technology, process, and structure rather than content and considered making moral judgments the primary task of media ecology. "I don't see any point in studying media unless one does so within a moral or ethical context."&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;Griffin, Em. A First Look at Communication Theory. 7th ed. New York, NY: The McGraw-Hill , 2009. Print&lt;/ref&gt;  Postman's media ecology approach asks three questions: What are the moral implications of this bargain? Are the consequences more humanistic or antihumanistic? Do we, as a society, gain more than we lose, or do we lose more than we gain?&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

=== North American, European and Eurasian versions ===
Media ecology is a contested term within [[media studies]] for it has different meanings in European and North American contexts. The North American definition refers to an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of media theory and media design involving the study of media environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/index.html|title=What is Media Ecology?|last=Nystrom|first=Christine|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European version of media ecology is a materialist investigation of media systems as complex dynamic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strate|first=Lance|year=2004|title=A Media Ecology Review|url=http://cscc.scu.edu/trends/v23/v23_2.pdf|journal=Communication Research Trends|volume=23|pages=28–31|issn=0144-4646|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, a similar theory was independently developed by [[Yuri Rozhdestvensky]]. In more than five monographs, Rozhdestvensky outlined the systematic changes which take place in society each time new communication media are introduced, and connected these changes to the challenges in politics, philosophy and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Polski, M. |author2=Gorman, L.|year=2012|title=Yuri Rozhdestvensky vs. MArshall McLuhan: A triumph vs. a Vortex|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=10 |issue=3–4|url=http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Article,id=13566/|doi=10.1386/eme.10.3-4.263_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a founder of the vibrant school of ecology of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Polski, M.|year=2013|title=Media Ecology Pedagogy—Art or Techne?|conference=MEA conference|location=Grand Rapids, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European version of media ecology rejects the North American notion that ecology means environment. Ecology in this context is used "because it is one of the most expressive [terms] language currently has to indicate the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fuller, Matthew|title=Media Ecologies: Materialist Energies in Art and Technoculture|publisher=MIT Press|year=2005|pp=2–3|isbn=9780262062473|series=Leonardo Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following theorists such as [[Felix Guattari]], [[Gregory Bateson]], and [[Manuel De Landa]], the European version of media ecology (as practiced by authors such as [[Matthew Fuller (author)|Matthew Fuller]] and [[Jussi Parikka]]) presents a post-structuralist political perspective on media as complex dynamical systems.

=== Other contributions ===
Along with McLuhan {{Harv|McLuhan|1962}}, Postman {{Harv|Postman|1985}} and [[Harold Innis]], media ecology draws from many authors, including the work of [[Walter Ong]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Félix Guattari]], [[Eric Havelock]], [[Susanne Langer]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Edward T. Hall]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], and [[Gregory Bateson]].

==Core concepts==

=== Assumptions of the theory ===
* Media are infused in every act and action in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = West|first = Richard|title = Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|year = 2010|publisher = Mc Graw Hill|location = New York|isbn = 978-0-07-338507-5|pages = 428–430|edition = 4|author2 = Lynn H. Turner|chapter = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Media fix our perceptions and organize our experiences.
* Media tie the world together.

These three assumptions can be understood as: media are everywhere all the time; media determine what we know and how we feel about what we know; and media connect us to others. Communication media have penetrated the lives of almost all people on the planet, arranging people into an interconnected human community.

===McLuhan's media history===

McLuhan believed there are three inventions that transformed the world: the [[phonemic orthography|phonetic alphabet]], the [[printing press]], and the [[telegraph]]. Due to these technologies, the world was taken from one era into the next. In order to understand the effects of symbolic environment, McLuhan split history into four periods:&lt;ref name="epoch" /&gt; the tribal age, the literary age, the print age, and the [[electronic age]] (information age). Throughout the structure of their distinctive methods of communication (e.g., oral, written, printed, electronic), different media arouse patterns in the brain that are distinctive to each and every particular form of communication.&lt;ref name="epoch"&gt;{{cite book|last = McLuhan|first = M.|title = The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects|year = 1967|publisher = HardWired|location = San Francisco|isbn = 978-1-888869-02-6|pages = |author2 = Fiore Q.|author3 = Agel J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tribal age====

The first period in history that McLuhan describes is the Tribal Age, a time of community because the ear is the dominant sense organ. This is also known as an acoustic era because the senses of hearing, touch, taste, and smell were far more strongly developed than the ability to visualize. During this time, hearing was more valuable because it allowed people to be more immediately aware of their surroundings, which was extremely important for hunting. Everyone hears at the same time making listening to someone in a group a unifying act, deepening the feeling of community. In this world of surround sound, everything is more immediate, more present, and fosters more passion and spontaneity. During the Tribal Age, hearing was believing.

====Literacy age====

The second age is the Literacy Stage, a time of private detachment because the eye is the dominant sense organ; also known as the visual era. Turning sounds into visible objects radically altered the symbolic environment. Words were no longer alive and immediate, they were able to read over and over again. Hearing no longer becomes trustworthy; seeing was believing. Even though people read the same words, the act of reading is an individual act of singular focus. Tribes didn't need to come together to get information anymore. This is when the invention of the alphabet came about. During this time, when people learned to read, they became independent thinkers.

====Print age====

The third stage is the Print Age, when individual products were mass produced due to the invention of the printing press. It gave the ability to reproduce the same text over and over again. With printing came a new visual stress: the portable book. It allowed people to carry books, so they could read in privacy isolated from others. Libraries were created to hold these books and also gave freedom to be alienated from others and from immediacy of their surroundings.

====Electronic age====

Lastly, the Electronic Age, otherwise included under the [[Information Age|information age]], is an era of instant communication and a return to an environment with simultaneous sounds and touch. It started with a device created by Samuel Morse's invention of the telegraph and led to the telephone, the cell phone, television, internet, DVD, video games, etc. This ability to communicate instantly returned us to the tradition of sound and touch rather than sight. Being able to be in constant contact with the world becomes a nosy generation where everyone knows everyone's business and everyone's business is everyone else's. This phenomenon is called the [[Global village (term)|global village]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Updating the ages ====
[[Robert K. Logan]] is professor emeritus of [[physics]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and Chief Scientist of the Strategic Innovation Lab at the [[Ontario College of Art and Design]]. He worked collaboratively with Marshall McLuhan at the University of Toronto, co-publishing various works and producing his own works, heavily inspired by McLuhan. Logan updates the era of communications, adding two new eras:
# Age of nonverbal mimetic communication (characteristic of archaic [[Homo sapiens]])
# Age of orality
# Age of literacy
# Age of electric mass media
# Age of digital interactive media, or 'new media'&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding New Media: Extending Marshall McLuhan|last=Logan|first=Robert K.|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2010|isbn=9781433111266|location=New York|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, through the study of media ecology, it is argued that through technological advancements in media, many societies have become a "[[participatory culture]]." Tom Valcanis argues that this very easily witnessed by looking at the rise of Apple's iPhone. "If the technology is the medium in which a culture grows, the interactive and user oriented nature of these technologies have given rise to a participatory and 'mash-up' culture in which the ways of producing and accessing content are deconstructed, uploaded, mixed, converged, and reconstructed through computers and smartphones mediated by online platforms; it becomes a 'participatory culture'..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=2a4280c5-20e6-4610-831e-e8e7e7c9ae04@sessionmgr4007|title=AN IPHONE IN EVERY HAND: MEDIA ECOLOGY, COMMUNICATION STRUCTURES, AND THE G...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The medium is the message"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding media|last = McLuhan|first = Marshall|publisher = Mentor|year = 1964|isbn = 978-0262631594|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most famous insight from McLuhan, and is one of the concepts that separates the North American theory from the European theory. Instead of emphasizing the information content, McLuhan highlighted the importance of medium characteristics which can influence and even decide the content. He proposed that it is the media format that affects and changes on people and society.

For example, [[traditional media]] is an extension of the human body, while the [[new media]] is the extension of the human nervous system. The emergence of new media will change the equilibrium between human sensual organs and affect human psychology and society.  The extension of human senses will change our thoughts and behaviors and the ways we perceive the world. That's why McLuhan believed when a new medium appears, no matter what the concrete content it transmits, the new form of communication brings in itself a force that causes social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xianhong|author2=Guilan Ding|title=SPECIAL COMMENTARY New media as relations|journal=Chinese Journal of Communication|date=November 2009|volume= 2| issue =  3|pages=367–369|url=http://www.informaworld.com|doi=10.1080/17544750903209242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are accustomed to thinking the [[message]] is separate from a [[Medium (website)|medium.]] McLuhan saw the message and the medium to mean the same thing. The audience is normally focused on the content and overlook the medium. What we forget is that the content cannot exist outside of the way that it is mediated. McLuhan recognized that the way media work as environments is because we are so immersed in them. "It is the medium that has the greatest impact in human affairs, not specific messages we send or receive.&lt;ref name="Strate"&gt;Strate, Lance. "Studying Media as Media: McLuhan and the Media Ecology Approach." MediaTropes eJournal. 1. (2008): 1-16. Web. 28 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The media shape us because we partake in them over and over until they become a part of us.

Different mediums emphasize different senses and encourage different habits, so engaging in this medium day after day conditions our senses.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Different forms of media also affect what their meaning and impact will be. The form of medium and mode of information determines who will have access, how much information will be distributed, how fast it will be transmitted, how far it will go, and, most importantly, what form it will be displayed.&lt;ref name="Strate" /&gt; With society being formed around the dominant medium of the day, the specific medium of communication makes a remarkable difference.

==== The Metaphor ====
The key elements to Media Ecology has been largely attributed to Marshal McLuhan, who coined the statement “the medium is the message.” Levinson furthers McLuhan’s statement by stating that “the way we communicate, often taken for granted, often determines what we communicate, and therein just about everything else in life and society” &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levinson|first=paul|date=2000|title=McLuhan and Media Ecology|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v1/levinson01.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association|volume=1|pages=17-22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan gave a center of gravity, a moral compass to Media Ecology which was later adapted and formally introduced by Neil Postman&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

The very foundation for this theory is based on a metaphor that provides a model for understanding the new territory, offers a vocabulary, and indicates in which directions to continue exploring.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scolari|first=Carlos A.|date=2012-04-09|title=Media Ecology: Exploring the Metaphor to Expand the Theory|url=https://academic.oup.com/ct/article-abstract/22/2/204/4085708?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=204–225|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01404.x|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Carlos Scolari states, “the configuration of media ecology in the 1960s and 1970s was part of a broader process of the general application of the ecological metaphor to the social sciences and humanities in the postwar period.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is still a scholarly debate over who coined the phrase “the medium is the message”. Author Niall Stephan argues that while most attribute the  metaphor to Marshall McLuhan, it is better directed to Neil Postman, who helped popularize McLuhan under the banner of “media ecology”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Niall|date=2014|title=Toward a More Substantive Media Ecology: Postman's Metaphor Versus Posthuman Futures|url=|journal=International Journal of Communications|volume=8|pages=2027-2045|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Janet Sternburg|Janet Sternberg]] has a different take on the metaphor- using her own metaphor to make sense of it all. Sternberg applies the Chinese “yin/ yang” metaphor to media ecology as a means of better understanding the divergence among scholars. She states that there are two basic intellectual traditions can be distinguished in the field: the “yang” tradition of studying media as environments, focusing on mass communication and on [[intrapersonal communication]] and the “yin” tradition is studying environments as media, emphasizing interpersonal communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v3/Sternberg03.pdf|title=The Yin and Yang of Media Ecology|last=Sternberg|first=Janet|date=2002|year=|website=MEA Convention Proceedings|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Connection to general systems theory ====
While [[general systems theory]] originated in 1928 in the Ph.D. thesis of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]. Robert Logan summarizes a general system as "one that is composed of interacting and interrelated components such as an understanding of it must entail considering the general system as a whole and not as a collection of individual components".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://summit.is4is.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/logan3text.pdf|title=General Systems Theory and Media Ecology: Parallel Disciplines that Inform Each Other|date=June 2015|doi=10.1386/eme.14.1-2.39_1|author=Robert Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logan argues that general systems theory, as well as cybernetics, complexity theory, and emergent dynamics, and media ecology "cross pollinate each other" in that,  "a general system is a medium" due to the non-linear aspects of messages and that general systems are "quasi-deterministic".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This thinking is in line with McLuhan who once wrote, "A new medium is never an addition to an old one, nor does it leave the old one in peace. It never ceases to oppress the older media until it finds new shapes and positions for them."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Global village ===
Marshall McLuhan used the phrase [[Global village (term)|global village]] to describe that "humans can no longer live in isolation, but rather will always be connected by continuous and instantaneous [[electronic media]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introducing communication theory: analysis and application|last=West|first=Richard|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780073385075|pages=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan addresses the idea of a global village in his book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' saying, "Such is the character of a village or, since electric media, such is also the character of global village. And it is the advertising and PR community that is most aware of this basic new dimension of global interdependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tremblay|first1=Gaetan|title=From Marshall McLuhan to Harold Innis, or From the Global Village to the World Empire|journal=Canadian Journal of Communications|date=2012|volume=37|issue=4|page=572|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/2662/2341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology, especially electronic media in today's age, makes the world increasingly interconnected. Socially, economically, politically, culturally, what happens in one part of the world has a ripple effect into other countries.

This seems like a common sense idea today, where the internet makes it possible to check news stories around the globe, and social media connects individuals regardless of location. However, in McLuhan's day, the global village was just becoming possible due to technology like television and long distance phone calls. This concept has become one of the most prolific and understandable ideas to come out of media ecology, and has spurred significant research in many areas. It is especially relevant in today's society, where the internet, social media, and other new media have made the world a smaller place, and today many researchers give McLuhan credit for his foresight.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Walkosz, Barbara J.|author2=Tessa Jolls|author3= Mary Ann Sund|title=Global/Local: Media Literacy for the Global Village|work=Medialit.org|conference= Proc. of International Media Literacy Research Forum, London|publisher=OfCom|year=2008|url=http://www.medialit.org/sites/default/files/33_globallocal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of note is McLuhan's insistence that the world becoming a global village should lead to more global responsibility. Technology has created an interconnected world, and with that should come concern for global events and occurrences outside one's own community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Postman builds on this concept with the idea of teaching the narrative of 'Spaceship Earth' where students are taught the importance of everyone taking care of planet earth as a fragile system of diversity both biological and cultural;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hepg.org/her-home/issues/harvard-educational-review-volume-66-issue-4/herarticle/redefining-the-value-of-school_287|title=The Harvard Educational Review - HEPG|website=hepg.org|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the original person to coin the term 'Spaceship Earth' was futurists R. Buckminster Fuller who once said, "I've often heard people say: 'I wonder what it would feel like to board a spaceship,' and the answer is very simple. What does it feel like? That's all we have experienced. We're all astronauts on a little spaceship called earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/spaceshipearth|title=Spaceship Earth {{!}} The Buckminster Fuller Institute|website=www.bfi.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics do worry though, that in creating a truly global village, some cultures will become extinct due to larger or more dominant cultures imposing their beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K|first=Dixon, Violet|date=2009-01-01|title=Understanding the Implications of a Global Village|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/61/understanding-the-implications-of-a-global-village|journal=Inquiries Journal|volume=1|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the global village helps to conceptualize [[globalization]] within society. Michael Plugh writes, "[The] village is an environment produced both by technological change and human imagination of this globalized environment."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global village: Globalization through a media ecology lens|date=2014|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=13|issue=3-4|pages=219–235|doi=10.1386/eme.13.3-4.219_1|author=Plugh, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the rise in media communication technology has uniformed the way individuals across the globe process information. Plugh says, "Where literate societies exchange an 'eye for an ear,' according to McLuhan, emphasizing the linear and sequential order of the world, electronic technology retrievers the total awareness of environment, characteristic of oral cultures, yet to an extended or 'global' level."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Hot vs. cool media===
McLuhan developed an idea called hot and cold media.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall, and Quentin Fiore. "The medium is the message." New York 123 (1967): 126-128.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot media]] refer to a high-definition communication that demand little involvement from the audience and concentrate on one sensory organ at a time. These types of media require no interpretation because they give all the information necessary to comprehend. Some examples of hot media include radio, books, and lectures. [[Cool media]] describe media that demand active involvement from the audience. Cool media require the audience to be active and fill in information by mentally participating. This is multi-sensory participation. Some examples of cool media are TV, seminars, and cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|title=Understanding media: The Extension of Man|year=1994|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-63159-4|author2=Lewis H. Lapham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"McLuhan frequently referred to a chart that hung in his seminar room at the University of Toronto. This was a type of shorthand for understanding the differences between hot and cool media, characterized by their emphasis on the eye or the ear."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Innis: The Philosophical Historian. An Exchange of Ideas Between Prof. Marshall McLuhan and Prof. Eric A. Havelock," recorded at Innis College, Toronto, October 14, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Eye'': left hemisphere (hot) controls right side of the body; visual; speech; verbal; analytical; mathematical; linear; detailed; sequential; controlled; intellectual; dominant worldly;quantitative; active; sequential ordering
* ''Ear:'' right hemisphere (cool) controls the left side of the body; spatial; musical; acoustic; holistic; artistic; symbolic; simultaneous; emotional; creative; minor; spiritual; qualitative; receptive; synthetic; gestalt; facial recognition; simultaneous comprehension; perception of abstract patterns

===Laws of media===
Another aspect of media ecology is the ''laws of media,'' which McLuhan outlined with his son [[Eric McLuhan]] to further explain the influence of technology on society.&lt;ref name="Laws of media"&gt;{{cite book|title=Laws of media: The new science|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-8020-7715-8|location=Toronto|pages=98–99|author2=Eric McLuhan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws of media theory are depicted by a tetrad, which poses questions about various media, with the goal of developing peoples' critical thinking skills and to prepare people for "the social and physical chaos" that accompany every technological advancement or development. There is no specific order to the laws of media, as the effects occur simultaneously and form a feedback loop: technology impacts society, which then impacts the development of technology.
[[File:MediaTetrad.svg|thumb|Depiction of Media Tetrad]]
The four effects, as depicted in the [[tetrad of media effects]] are:&lt;ref name="Laws of media" /&gt;
* ''Enhancement'': What does the medium enhance? Media can enhance various social interactions, such as the telephone, which reduced the need for face-to-face interactions.
* ''Obsolescence'': What does the medium obsolesce? Technological advancements can render older media obsolete, as television did for the radio. This does not necessarily mean that the older medium is completely eradicated however, as radio, for example, is still in use today. 
* ''Retrieval'': What does the medium retrieve? New media can also spur a restoration of older forms of media, which the new forms may not be able to incorporate into their new technologies. For example, the Internet has promoted new forms of social conversations, which may have been lost through television. 
* ''Reversal'': What will the medium reverse? When a medium is overwhelmed due to its own nature, "pushed to the limit of its potential,"&lt;ref name="Laws of media" /&gt; it ceases to have functional utility and can cause a reversion to older media.

==Criticism==

===Technological determinism===
A significant criticism of this theory is a result of its deterministic approach. [[Determinism]] insists that all of society is a result of or effected by one central condition. In some cases the condition can be language ([[linguistic determinism]]), religion ([[theological determinism]]), financial ([[economic determinism]]). In the case of McLuhan, Postman and Media Ecology, technology is the sole determinant for society and by breaking up time in measures of man's technological achievements they can be classified as [[technological determinism]]. According to Postman, "The printing press, the computer, and television are not therefore simply machines which convey information. They are metaphors through which we conceptualize reality in one way or another. They will classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, argue a case for what it is like. Through these media metaphors, we do not see the world as it is. We see it as our coding systems are. Such is the power of the form of information."&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Teaching as a Conserving Activity (1979), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Postman has also stated that "a medium is a technology within which a culture grows; that is to say, it gives form to a culture's politics, social organization, and habitual ways of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Postman|first=Neil|title=The Humanism of Media Ecology|url=http://media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v1/humanism_of_media_ecology.html|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as [[Michael Zimmer (academic)|Michael Zimmer]] view McLuhan and his "Medium is the Message" theory as a prime example of technological determinism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...an overarching thread in media ecological scholarship, exemplified by McLuhan's (1964/1994) assertion 
that "the medium is the message", the technological bias of a medium carries greater importance than the particular message it is delivering. McLuhan saw changes in the dominant medium of communication as the main determinant of major changes in society, culture, and the individual. This McLuhanesque logic, which rests at the center of the media ecology tradition, is often criticized for its media determinism. Seeing the biases of media technologies as the primary force for social and cultural change resembles the hard technological determinism of the embodied theory of technological bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Zimmer, Michael|authorlink=Michael Zimmer (academic)|title=Media Ecology and Value Sensitive Design: A Combined Approach to Understanding the Biases of Media Technology|conference=Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association|volume=6|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The critics of such a deterministic approach could be theorists who practice other forms of determinism, such as economic determinism. Theorists such as John Fekete believes that McLuhan is oversimplifying the world "by denying that human action is itself responsible for the changes that our socio-cultural world is undergoing and will undergo, McLuhan necessarily denies that a critical attitude is morally significant or practically important."&lt;ref name="Fekete, John 1973"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fekete, John|title=McLuhanacy: Counterrevolution in cultural theory|journal=Telos|year=1973|volume=1973|issue=15|pp=75–123|doi=10.3817/0373015075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lance Strate]], on the other hand, argues that McLuhan's theories are in no way deterministic. "McLuhan never actually used the term, "determinism," nor did he argue against human agency. In his bestselling book, ''The Medium is the Message'', he wrote, "there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening" (McLuhan &amp; Fiore, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;25). John Culkin (1967) summed up McLuhan's position with the quote, "we shape our tools and thereafter they shape us",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Culkin, J.|year=1967|chapter=Each culture develops its own sense ratio to meet the demands of its environment|editor=G. Stearn|title=McLuhan: Hot and cool|pp=49–57|location=New York: New American Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a transactional approach to media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strate, Lance|title=Studying media as media: McLuhan and the media ecology approach|journal=MediaTropes|volume=1|issue=1|year=2008|p=133|url=http://www.mediatropes.com/index.php/Mediatropes/article/view/3344/1488}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement from Strate would define McLuhan and Media Ecology as "[[soft determinism]]" opposed to "[[hard determinism]]" with the difference being that "hard determinism" indicates that changes to society happen with no input or control from the members of that society, whereas "soft determinism" would argue that the changes are pushed by technology but free will and agency of the members of society ultimately have a chance to influence the outcome.

While ideas of technological determinism generally have negative connotations, technology philosopher Paul-Peter Verbeek argued that technologies are "inherently moral agents" and their development is a "moral enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cussing the buzz-saw, or, the medium is the morality of Peter-Paul Verbeek|date=2016|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=15|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.1386/eme.15.2.129_1|author=Grosswiler, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Can Technological Artefacts Be Moral Agents?|date=2011|publisher=|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics|volume=17|issue=3|pages=411–424|doi=10.1007/s11948-010-9241-3|pmid=20927601|pmc=3183318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peter-Paul Verbeek|title=Obstetric Ultrasound and the Technological Mediation of Morality: A Postphenomenological Analysis|date=1 March 2008|publisher=|journal=Human Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=11–26|doi=10.1007/s10746-007-9079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disruptions to existing systems ===
While advancing technologies allow for the study of media ecology, they also frequently disrupt the existing system of communication as they emerge. In general, four types of disruption can occur within the study of media ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.waccglobal.org/articles/a-shifting-media-ecology-what-the-age-of-luther-can-teach-us|title=A shifting media ecology: What the age of Luther can teach us|journal=Media Development|date=2017|volume=64|issue=2|pp=5–10|author=Soukup, Paul A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# New Technologies
# New Audiences
# New Authority
#New Rhetoric

One example where this can be seen is in do-it-yourself education. Advancing technologies have also expanded access to do-it-yourself (DIY) education. DIY education can be defined to include "any attempt to decentralize or disrupt traditional place-based educational models through the sometimes collective, other times individual use of digital media".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A media ecological analysis of do-it-yourself education: Exploring relationships between the symbolic and the material realms of human action|author=John Dowd|doi=10.1386/eme.13.2.155_1|date=June 2014|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=13|number=2|pp=155–175(21)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an analysis of media ecology the impact of these new technologies on society can better be understood.

==== Mobility and Modality ====
Various scholars have looked to media ecology theory through different lenses to better understand this theory in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. While Sternberg applied the yin/yang metaphor to make sense of the theory, Julia Hildebrand and John Dimmick et. al create a new languages of modality. As such, contributing to a new rhetoric to contextualize Media Ecology in the age of the internet, social media, and advances in technologies. Hildebrand uses the conceptualization of ‘mediated mobilities’ to illustrate a connection between media ecology and mobilities research, ultimately making a case for a ''modal medium theory''. She looks into the articles of Emily Keightley and Anna Reading, and Lance Strate as a basis for her case. In 1999, Lance Strate states Media Ecology Theory is “grammar and rhetoric, semiotics and systems theory, the history and the philosophy of technology”.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hildebrand|first=Julia M|date=2017-05-11|title=Modal media: connecting media ecology and mobilities research|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0163443717707343|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=348–364|doi=10.1177/0163443717707343|issn=0163-4437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hildebrand explains that Strate’s concept of media ecology is not limited to the study of information and communication technology but technology, in general. Technology is therefore implying materialities and mobilities that is put into relation with media ecology. As Hildebrand states, “[e]nvironments are created and shaped by different media and modes and the physical, virtual, and mental processes and travels they generate”.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Much like Media Ecology, mobilities research talk about a “flow” that shapes the environment, creating a contact zones. Dimmick furthers this statement by creating a term that describes the intersection of communication environments (“contact zones”) and issues of mobility- ''interstices.''&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimmick|first=John|last2=Feaster|first2=John Christian|last3=Hoplamazian|first3=Gregory J.|date=2010-05-18|title=News in the interstices: The niches of mobile media in space and time|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1461444810363452|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=23–39|doi=10.1177/1461444810363452|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes two scholars, Hemment and Caronia, to contextualize his new word. Hemment argues that mobile technologies create a place out of space and time, a kind of “nonspace” or “nonplace” considering they are independent from the variables of space and time. Caronia notes that such technologies extend media to creating empty space and places.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===The medium is not the message===
McLuhan's critics state the medium is not the message. They believe that we are dealing with a mathematical equation where medium equals x and message equals y. Accordingly, x = y, but really "the medium is the message" is a metaphor not an equation.  His critics also believe McLuhan is denying the content altogether, when really McLuhan was just trying to show the content in its secondary role in relation to the medium. McLuhan says technology is an "extension of man" and when the way we physically sense the world changes, how we perceive it will also collectively change, but the content may or may not affect this change in perception. McLuhan said that the user is the content, and this means that the user must interpret and process what they receive, finding sense in their own environments.&lt;ref name=Grosswiler&gt;{{cite book|last=Grosswiler|first=Paul|title=Transforming McLuhan: Cultural, Critical, and Postmodern Perspectives|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|location=p.52|isbn=9781433110672|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of McLuhan's high profile critics was [[Umberto Eco]]. Eco comes from background in [[semiotics]], which goes beyond linguistics in that it studies all forms of communication. He reflected that a cartoon of a cannibal wearing an alarm clock as a necklace was counter to McLuhan's assertion that the invention of clocks created a concept of time as consistently separated space. While it could mean this it could also take on different meanings as in the depiction of the cannibal. The medium is not the message. An individual's interpretation can vary.  Believing this to be true Eco says, "It is equally untrue that acting on the form and content of the message can convert the person receiving it." In doing this Eco merges form and content, the separation of which is the basis of McLuhan's assertion. McLuhan does not offer a theory of communication. He instead investigates the effects of all media mediums between the human body and its physical environment, including language.&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=W. Terrance|title=McLuhan: A Guide for the Perplexed|year=2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing|location=London, GBR|isbn=9781441143808|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===

The North American variant of media ecology is viewed by numerous theorists such as John Fekete&lt;ref name="Fekete, John 1973"/&gt; and Neil Compton as meaningless or "McLuhanacy". According to Compton, it had been next to impossible to escape knowing about McLuhan and his theory as the media embraced them. Compton wrote, "it would be better for McLuhan if his oversimplifications did not happen to coincide with the pretensions of young status-hungry advertising executives and producers, who eagerly provide him with a ready-made claque, exposure on the media, and a substantial income from addresses and conventions."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenthal|first=Raymond|title=McLuhan: Pro and Con|year=1968|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls|location=New York|pages=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists such as [[Jonathan Miller]] claim that McLuhan used a subjective approach to make objective claims, comparing McLuhan's willingness to back away from a "probe" if he did not find the desired results to that of an objective scientist who would not abandon it so easily.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Jonathan|title=Marshall McLuhan|year=1971|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0670019120|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theorists against McLuhan's idea, such as [[Raymond Rosenthal]], also believe that he lacked the scientific evidence to support his claims:&lt;ref name='Strate'/&gt; "McLuhan's books are not scientific in any respect; they are wrapped however in the dark, mysterious folds of the scientific ideology."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal /&gt; Additionally, As [[Lance Strate]] said: "Other critics complain that media ecology scholars like McLuhan, Havelock, and Ong put forth a "Great Divide" theory, exaggerating, for example, the difference between orality and literacy, or the alphabet and hieroglyphics.

===New media===
Many ecologists are using media ecology as an analytical framework, to explore whether the current [[new media]] has a "new" stranglehold on culture or are they simply extensions of what we have already experienced. The new media is characterised by the idea of [[web 2.0]]. It was coined in 2003 and popularized by a media consultant, [[Tim O'Reilly]]. He argues that a particular assemblage of software, hardware and sociality have brought about 'the widespread sense that there's something qualitatively different about today's Web. This shift is characterised by co-creativity, participation and openness, represented by software that support for example, wiki-based ways of creating and accessing knowledge, social networking sites, blogging, tagging and 'mash ups'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Reilly|first=Tim|title=What Is Web 2.0? Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2005/09/what-is-web-20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interactive and user-oriented nature of these technologies have transformed the global culture into a [[participatory culture]] which proves Neil Postman's saying "[[Wikiversity:Neil Postman: Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change|technological change]] is not additive; it is ecological".

As new media power takes on new dimension in the digital realm, some scholars begin to focus on defending the democratic potentialities of the Internet on the perspective of corporate impermeability. Today, corporate encroachment in cyberspace is changing the balance of power in the new media ecology, which "portends a new set of social relationships based on commercial exploitation".&lt;ref name=Milberry&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milberry|first=K|author2=Anderson, S.|title=Open Sourcing Our Way to an Online Commons: Contesting Corporate Impermeability in the New Media Ecology|journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|year=2009|pages=393–412|volume=33|issue=4|doi=10.1177/0196859909340349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many social network websites inject customized advertisements into the steady stream of personal communication. It is called commercial incursion which converts user-generated content into fodder for marketers and advertisers.&lt;ref name=Milberry/&gt; So the control rests with the owners rather than the participants. It is necessary for online participants to be prepared to act consciously to resist the enclosure of digital commons.

There is some recent research that puts the emphasis on the youth, the future of the society who is at the forefront of new media environment. Each generation, with its respective worldview, is equipped with certain media grammar and [[media literacy]] in its youth.&lt;ref name="Gumpert 1985 23–35"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gumpert|first=Gary|author2=Robert Cathcart|title=Media grammars, generations, and media gaps|journal=Critical Studies in Mass Communication|year=1985|volume=2|pages=23–35|doi=10.1080/15295038509360059}}&lt;/ref&gt; As each generation inherits an idiosyncratic media structure, those born into the age of radio perceive the world differently from those born into the age of television.&lt;ref name="Gumpert 1985 23–35"/&gt; The nature of new generation is also influenced by the nature of the new media.

According to the media ecology theory, analyzing today's generational identity through the lens of media technologies themselves can be more productive than focusing on media content. Media ecologists employ a media ecology interpretative framework to deconstruct how today's new media environment increasingly mirrors the values and character attributed to young people. Here are some typical characteristics of the new generation: first, it is "the world's first generation to grow up thinking of itself as global. The internet and satellite television networks are just two of the myriad technologies that have made this possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huntley|first=Rebecca|title=The World According to Y: Inside the New Adult Generation|year=2006|publisher=Crows Nest NSW|location=Australia|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, "there may actually be no unified ethos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Serazio|first=Michael|title=(New) Media Ecology and Generation Mash-Up Identity: The Technological Bias of Millennial Youth Culture|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/8/6/6/p238668_index.html|conference= NCA 94th Annual Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With "hundreds of cable channels and thousands of computer conferences, young generation might be able to isolate themselves within their own extremely opinionated forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Screenagers: Lessons In Chaos From Digital Kids|year=2006|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|isbn=978-1572736245|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In 2009 a study was published by Cleora D'Arcy, Darin Eastburn and Bertram Bruce entitled "How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D'Arcy, C. J.|author2=Eastburn, D. M.|author3=Bruce, B. C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs|journal=College Teaching|volume=57|issue=1|pp=56–63|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/274764053|doi=10.3200/CTCH.57.1.56-63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this study was to use Media Ecology in order to determine which media is perceived as the most useful as an instructional tool in post-secondary education. This study specifically analyzed and tested "new media" such as podcasts, blogs, websites, and discussion forums with other media, such as traditional text books, lectures, and handouts. Ultimately comparing "hot" and "cold" media at today's standard of the terms. The result of the study, which included student surveys, indicated that a mixture of media was the most "valued" method of instruction, however more interactive media enhanced student learning.

==Application and Case Studies ==
There is significant research being done on the rise of [[social media]] platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and their influence on communication in society. Some of that research is being done through a media ecology perspective. Below are some examples: 

=== Social media activism ===
While many people utilize social media platforms to stay in contact with friends and family, socialize, or even shop,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correa|first=Teresa|last2=Hinsley|first2=Amber Willard|last3=de Zúñiga|first3=Homero Gil|date=2010-03-01|title=Who interacts on the Web?: The intersection of users' personality and social media use|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563209001472|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=26|issue=2|pages=247–253|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2009.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; these platforms have also been pivotal for social activism. [[Social media activism]] and [[hashtag activism]] have become popular ways to gain mainstream media and public attention for causes, and to facilitate protests.

Thomas Poell researched the influence of social media on the 2010 protests of the [[2010 G20 Toronto summit|Toronto G20 Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poell|first=Thomas|year=2014|title=Social media and the transformation of activist communication: exploring the social media ecology of the 2010 Toronto G20 protests|url=|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=17|issue=6|pages=716–731|via=|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2013.812674}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, he focused on identifying how each social media site was used independently, and then how they were integrated together. The sites analyzed were [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]], [[Flickr|Flikr]], Facebook, and an open publishing website. What he found is that each site is used differently for social media activism. While this kind of activism was originally looked at as a way to promote causes and encourage long term focus on the issues, Poell found that sites like Twitter and Facebook tend to do the opposite. Posts center around photographs and videos of action during protests and rallies, not on the issues that are being protested. This would be an example of hot media, because the user can scroll through photos or watch videos without being otherwise engaged, instead of cool media where the user has to be more involved. Additionally, because activists are using sites they do not own, the social media platform actually has more control over the information being posted. For example, Twitter no longer allows unrestricted access to all posts made with a certain hashtag after a period of time. This seems to mean that the issue being highlighted fades over time.

Additionally, Heather Crandall and Carolyn M. Cunningham focus on hashtag activism, where activists use [[Tag (metadata)|metadata tags]] to focus on specific issues (ex: #activism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crandall|first=Heather|last2=Cunningham|first2=Carolyn M.|year=2016|title=Media ecology and hashtag activism: #Kaleidoscope|url=|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=22–32|doi=10.1386/eme.15.1.21_1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not look at one specific protest like the G20 summit, but rather at the benefits and criticisms of hashtag activism as a whole. They discuss that social media is a new media ecology, one where users can connect and share ideas without boundaries. This falls under McLuhan's idea of the world as a global village. By using hashtags, activists are able to bring awareness to social issues. Crandall and Cunningham point out that this is both beautiful and interesting, because it encourages learning, conversations, and community for social justice, and that it is also dark and confusing, because the open environment of the internet also allows hashtags to be used for hate speech and threats of violence. Also, they posit that hashtag activism is pointed and stacked, in that hashtags are often short lived, and the user has to be able to navigate the platform and understand hashtags in order to gain knowledge of the issue. When viewed through media ecology, hashtag activism is changing the way people encounter and engage in social justice.

=== Case Studies ===

==== [[Arab Spring]]: Egypt and Iran ====
Doctor Mark Allen Peterson of in the Department of Anthropology at Miami University published an article in the Summer of 2011 comparing the media ecology of 1970's Iran to that in Egypt in 2011. The article, title "Egypt's Media Ecology in a Time of Revolution"&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;Peterson, Mark Allen. "Egypt's media ecology in a time of revolution." Arab media &amp; society 13 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; looks at the difference that social media made in the Egyptian uprising and makes two observations: social media extends the "[[Grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]" network and that social media, despite the result of the uprising, completely changes the "[[mediascape]]" of Egypt. One dramatic difference between the two uprising noticed by Peterson is the ultimate position of the media of choice during each in the end. On the one hand, Iran's news media, the primary source of information at that time, reverted to its original role, while the Egyptian use of social media changed the media of choice for Egypt.

Peterson's study compared his observations to that of William Beeman, who in 1984 published an essay, "The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after"&lt;ref name=Beeman&gt;Beeman, William O. "The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after." The news media and national and international conflict (1984): 147-165.&lt;/ref&gt; on the media ecology of Iran. Beeman's ultimate conclusion of his review of the [[Iranian Revolution]] followed that of what you would expect to find from most media ecologists: "At times newly introduced mass media have produced revolutionary effects in the societal management of time and energy as they forged new spaces for themselves. Thus media are cultural forces as well as cultural objects. In operation, they produce specific cultural effects that cannot be easily predicted."&lt;ref name=Beeman/&gt;{{rp|147}}

Although there were many similarities between the Iranian and [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian revolutions]], such as censorship in media, including newspaper and television, the one major difference was the availability of the internet and social media as a tool to spread messages and increase awareness in Egypt. Social media in 2011's uprising was equivalent to the use of cassette tapes in Iran in the 1970s. The tapes provided a way to spread information that could not be as easily censored and was repeatable through the country.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|5}} The rise of social media helped free Egyptians from censorship of other media. In this case, the medium was the message, a message of freedom and by the Egyptian government's attempt to also censor this medium, they only managed to spread the message further and faster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although we may never know the true impact, in fact it likely sped up the regime's fall. In the absence of new technologies, people were forced to rely on traditional means of communication, including knocking on doors, going to the mosque, assembling in the street, or other central gathering places. Thomas Schelling won a Nobel prize in part for discovering that in the absence of information, people will coordinate by selecting a focal point that seems natural, special or relevant to them. Given the protests, Tahrir Square was the obvious focal point. By blocking the Internet, the government inadvertently fueled dissent and galvanized international support for the people of Egypt. (Bowman 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, Warigia. 2011. Dictators and the Internet. Cairo Review of Global Affairs. http://www.aucegypt.edu/GAPP/CairoReview/Pages/articleDetails.aspx?aid=34 [accessed November 14, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 2011, leaders of the protest continue to utilize social media as a method to push democratic reform.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|4}} According to Peterson the role of social media in Egypt is also evolving the political culture as even state figures are beginning to make announcements using social media rather than more traditional forms of media.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|5}}

==== [[Gezi Park protests|Gezi Protests]]: Turkey  ====
Much like the Arab Spring, the Gezi protests were an environmental sit-in that ultimately turned into a social movement based on the influence of various forms of social media. Rolien Hoyng and Murat Es coin the term “Turkish media ecology” to evoke a sense of particularly on the part of Turkey’s relationship with media outlets and platforms.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc|title=Conspiratorial Webs: Media Ecology and Parallel Realities in Turkey|last=Hoyng|first=Rolien|last2=Es|first2=Murat|date=2016|website=International Journal of Communications|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey, media censorship and control by state institutions most directly impact broadcast media. Both authors emphasize how “…media-ecological affordances are conditioned and modulated by legal frameworks and institutional-political rationalities”.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They also note that such censored media ecology forms a ‘fertile milieu’ for the proliferation of conspiracy theories which both feed on one another.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Scholar Gulizar Haciyakupoglu examines how social media influenced the protests, specifically looking at how trust was built and maintained among protestors across multiple platforms.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haciyakupoglu|first=Gulizar|last2=Zhang|first2=Weiyu|date=2015-03-18|title=Social Media and Trust during the Gezi Protests in Turkey|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/20/4/450/4067584|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=450–466|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12121|issn=1083-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his interviews, the scholar extrapolates that “closed groups” like Whatsapp and Facebook “…allowed the circulation of confidential and trustworthy information among first- and second-degree friends” whereas Twitter was used for “rapid acquisition of logistic information” that became important during the protest.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; 

====[[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15M Movement]]: Spain  ====
Emiliano Treré looks to the Media Ecology metaphor as a way to investigate the relationship between social movements, media ecologies and communication technologies through the lens of Spain’s 15M movement. Treré states how most scholars believe the media ecological framework is particularly suited for the study of the social movements/media nexus “…because of its ability to provide fine-tuned explorations of the multiplicity, the interconnections, the dynamic evolution of old and new media forms for social change”.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treré|first=Emiliano|last2=Mattoni|first2=Alice|date=2015-11-25|title=Media ecologies and protest movements: main perspectives and key lessons|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1109699|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=290–306|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2015.1109699|issn=1369-118X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author also agrees with Scolari (mentioned above) that the key reflections from the theory is especially beneficial for modern analysis on media and social events.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One such application is seen with the analysis of Spain’s anti-austerity movement, also called the “15M movement.” Facing different degrees of mainstream media manipulation and bias “various media activists turned to Web TV services, radical online tools, Twitter and Facebook among others to organize, and contrast the official narratives of the protest."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Scholar John Postill argues that Twitter, among all the types of technologies used, produced a greater effect for setting and tone and agenda of the movement.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Postill|first=John|date=2013-10-23|title=Democracy in an age of viral reality: A media epidemiography of Spain’s indignados movement|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1466138113502513|journal=Ethnography|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=51–69|doi=10.1177/1466138113502513|issn=1466-1381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such appropriation of technologies demonstrates the dichotomies between old and new technologies that in term created a kind of “technological sovereignty” among activists.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Media Ecology has the innate ability to aggregate different analytical approaches to better understand the technology that is at place during such a protest. Postill and other scholars ultimately look to a new age in social activism, where “viral” posts shared by media professionals and amateurs empower people and become the rising voice for the future of democracy in Spain.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15794">'''Misattribution of arousal''' is a term in [[psychology]] which describes the process whereby people make a mistake in assuming what is causing them to feel [[arousal|aroused]]. For example, when actually experiencing physiological responses related to [[fear]], people mislabel those responses as romantic arousal. The reason physiological symptoms may be attributed to incorrect stimuli is because many stimuli have similar physiological symptoms such as increased [[blood pressure]] or [[shortness of breath]].

One of the initial studies looking into this phenomenon conducted by Schachter and Singer (1962)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=S|last2=Singer|first2=J|title=Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state|journal=Psychological Review|date=1962|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt; was based on the idea that the experience of arousal could be ambiguous and therefore misattributed to an incorrect stimulus. Operating under this assumption, the researchers developed the [[two factor theory of emotion]]. Misattribution of arousal, which is an influence on emotion processing, can be found in multiple situations, such as romantic situations and physiological responses from exercise.

An example of the possible effects of misattribution of arousal is perceiving a potential partner as more attractive because of a heightened state of physiological stress. A study done by White et al. (1981)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=G|last2=Fishbein|first2=S|last3=Rutsein|first3=J|title=Passionate love and the misattribution of arousal|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=41|pages=56–62|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.41.1.56}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated this phenomenon and found that those in an unrelated aroused state will rate an attractive confederate more highly than a rater without arousal. The researchers also found that aroused raters would dislike an unattractive confederate more than those without arousal.

== Initial demonstration ==

=== Experiment ===
[[Donald Dutton]] and [[Arthur Aron]]'s  (1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dutton|first1=D.G.|last2=Aaron|first2=A. P.|title=Some evidence for heightened sexual attraction under conditions of high anxiety|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1974|volume=30|issue=4|pages=510–517|doi=10.1037/h0037031|pmid=4455773}}&lt;/ref&gt; study to test the causation of misattribution of arousal incorporated an attractive confederate female to wait at the end of a bridge that was either a suspension bridge (that would induce fear) or a sturdy bridge (that would not induce fear). After the males crossed the bridge, they were stopped by a female confederate and took a [[Thematic Apperception Test]] wherein they had to compose a short story based on an ambiguous image; the image chosen was purposefully not sexual at all. Afterward, the story was analyzed for sexual content. The female confederate, who was not aware of the true hypothesis of the experiment, then gave her phone number to the males if they had any more questions about the experiment and the researchers documented how many males called the confederate. As the men finished the survey, the woman explained she would be available to answer any questions regarding her project, giving her [[phone number]] and name to the male subjects. Dutton and Aron wondered if the participants were more likely to call the woman because they were physically attracted to her or not. However, Dutton and Aron had to take into consideration that some factors of the men, such as the possibility of some men already being involved in a relationship or how an individual male interpreted the woman's body gestures.
Therefore, Dutton and Aron had the woman survey the men under two conditions:  immediately after they crossed a {{convert|450|ft|m|sing=on}}-long bridge or after they had crossed and had enough time to rest. In the first condition, the men who were surveyed during their cross over the bridge would have had their arousal level increased as they were speaking to the woman. Conditions such as experiencing winds during their walk and the nervous feeling may have contributed to their fast-paced [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]]s and rapid [[breathing]].

In the other condition, the woman had approached the men after they had crossed the bridge. They had enough time to rest and get their heartbeat and breathing back to normal.

=== Results ===
More males contacted the female experimenter when they had just walked down the suspension bridge, which was thought to be due to their misattribution of their arousal (they believed that they were feeling sexual arousal at the sight of the female instead of feeling the leftover physiological arousal from the fear of walking across the suspension bridge). This was interpreted by the researchers to mean that the men found the woman more attractive when they had more anxiety about crossing the bridge. There were no significant differences on either bridge when the researchers used a male confederate to give the Thematic Apperception Test and his phone number for any further questions about the experiment.

== Subsequent research ==

=== Experiment: expansion on initial demonstration ===

Fear is not the only emotion that can be a result of misattribution of arousal. One of the earlier studies that focused on misattribution of arousal was done by Schachter and Singer in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=S|last2=Singer|first2=J|title=Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state|journal=Psychological Review|date=1962|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers told the participants in their study that they were testing how their vision responded to a shot of vitamins called Suproxin. Suproxin was actually a shot of epinephrine or a placebo. Epinephrine activated the sympathetic nervous system and produced systems such as an elevated heart rate and blood pressure. The researchers then either told the participants the effects of the epinephrine, said nothing about any potential effects of the epinephrine, or told them they may feel some effects that had nothing to do with the epinephrine (for example, the researchers told the participants they could experience a headache from the shot). The participants were told that they had to wait 20 min for the Suproxin to get into their bloodstreams. While they were waiting, a confederate (a participant who is also covertly collaborating with/an associate of the researchers) who was either euphoric or angry waited with the participant to see if the emotion of the participant could be manipulated by the epinephrine and the emotion of the confederate. The confederate played basketball with pieces of balled up scrap paper while in the euphoric state or had to take a questionnaire and became very angry with the personal questions in the anger state.The participants then were observed to see if they appeared to be angry or euphoric and took a self-reported survey about their mood.

They found that if someone was physiologically aroused without being aware of it, they would attribute their arousal to a recent thought in their memory.The researchers also found that emotions (in this study, euphoria and anger) could be manipulated by providing a participant with a shot of epinephrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=S|last2=Singer|first2=J|title=Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state|journal=Psychological Review|date=1962|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: influence on confidence ===

Misattribution of arousal can also influence how much confidence one feels before completing a task. One study conducted by Savitsky, Medvec, Charlton, and Gilovich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savitsky|first1=K|last2=Medvec|first2=V|last3=Charlton|first3=A|last4=Gilovich|first4=T|title=What, me worry?' Arousal, misattribution and the effect of temporal distance on confidence|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=529–536|doi=10.1177/0146167298245008}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on how confidence can be affected by misattribution of arousal. Typically people feel more confident before they are supposed to do a task, but the closer they get to having to perform that task, the less confident they feel, which could be due to the arousal from the expectation of the performance. The researchers told participants that they would be exposed to a subliminal noise and were then asked if they could predict how well they would do on two tasks. After they made their predictions, the researchers either told them that the noise could make them nervous, the noise would have no effect on them, or they were told that they would not have to do the tasks until the next session a month away after they were exposed to the noise. The tasks were to unscramble anagrams or to recall as many nonsense syllables as they could after seeing them briefly. They could earn money for the tasks (more money was earned for each anagram unscrambled or each syllable correctly recalled). The participants then predicted how well they did on the tasks, and how well they believed everyone else did on the task. A second experiment replicated this first experiment.The researchers had participants attribute their arousal to noises that they heard, which resulted in those participants feeling more confident that they did well on the tasks than those that attributed their arousal to the performance anxiety from the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savitsky|first1=K|last2=Medvec|first2=V|last3=Charlton|first3=A|last4=Gilovich|first4=T|title='What, me worry?' Arousal, misattribution and the effect of temporal distance on confidence|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=529–536|doi=10.1177/0146167298245008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: polarity ===
White, Fishbein, and Rutsein generated further research on the misattribution of arousal with their 1981 study, “Passionate Love and the Misattribution of Arousal.” The researchers performed their study using two experiments. In the first experiment, 54 male participants were placed under varying degrees of physical exertion, in order to create a state of arousal. The participants were then asked to view a video of a female confederate either manipulated to be attractive or unattractive. The video was a self-disclosure statement where the female discussed hobbies and other typically dating related material. After completing the video, participants were given thirteen attraction trait criteria on which to rate the female. The experiment confirmed the researcher's hypothesis that individuals in a neutral aroused state were more likely to rate a target as attractive than an unaroused individual.
White, Fishbein, and Rutsein hypothesized that the polarity of an individual's arousal could influence the impact of the misattribution of arousal. To test this hypothesis the researchers created three separate videos to prime the subjects with a positive, negative, or neutral arousal. Sixty six male participants were asked to watch one of the videos and then rate the female as in the first study. The study found that regardless of the stimuli's polarity, the participants in the aroused state found the attractive confederate more attractive and the unattractive confederate as less attractive than the unaroused participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=G|last2=Fishbein|first2=S|last3=Rutsein|first3=J|title=Passionate love and the misattribution of arousal|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=41|pages=56–62|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.41.1.56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: conditional emotional responses ===

A study done by Loftis and Ross in 1974 looked at the effects of misattribution of arousal upon acquisition and extinction of a conditional emotional response. They conducted two experiments with 89 female undergraduates to show that misattribution procedures can alter physiological response to a conditioned source of a fear or arousal. The results suggested that self perception and attribution play a major role in emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loftis|first=Jack|author2=Ross|title=Effects of misattribution of arousal upon the acquisition and extinction of a conditioned emotional response|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=November 1974|volume=30|issue=5|pages=673–682|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/614269444/|doi=10.1037/h0037414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: alternate model ===

Additionally, a study conducted by Allen, Kenrick, Linder and McCall in 1989 suggested an alternative explanation to the misattribution of arousal in terms of attraction-arousal (as there are other types of arousal that can be misattributed). The original model of misattribution of arousal essentially states that the person who is aroused will only be attracted to the target person, so long as they are unaware of the true cause of arousal.  Allen et al. propose a different model called Response-Facilitation, in which they suggest that the subject that is aroused will be more attracted to the target person (compared to people who are unaroused), regardless of if they know the true source of the stimulation. To test this new model, they ran two studies in which they manipulated the type of arousal the participants experienced and the salience (awareness) of the arousal. In one study, they put the participants into three different groups: control (no arousal), arousal-awareness (where they were put in front of an attractive person, but knew what the actual cause of arousal (exercise) was), and arousal-unaware (where they were put in front of an attractive person but didn't realize the true cause of arousal). After conducting the study, the researchers found that regardless of whether the person was aware of the true cause of arousal, they were still more attracted to the target person than those in the control condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=J|last2=Kenrick|first2=D|last3=Linder|first3=D|last4=McCall|first4=M|title=Arousal and attraction: A response-facilitation alternative to misattribution and negative-reinforcement models|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1989|volume=57|issue=2|pages=261–270|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.2.261}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, whereas the original theory of misattribution of arousal said that people could only misattribute their arousal if they were unaware of the true cause, the Response-Facilitation model states that it is possible that people could be aware of the true cause of arousal and still find themselves attracted to someone, compared to people who are unaroused.  This demonstrates another potential model that could explain the attraction-arousal component of the misattribution of arousal theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12429">Throughout the years, the Cuban nation has developed a wealth of musicological material created by numerous investigators and experts on this subject.

==Early 20th century==

Apart from the work of some authors who provided information about the music in Cuba during the 19th century, that was usually included in chronicles covering a more general subject, the first investigations and studies specifically dedicated to the musical art and practice did not appear in Cuba until the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="valdes"&gt;Valdés Cantero, Alicia, Determined women ready to succeed. The ''International Journal of Cuban Studies'', 2 December 2008. http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/i18088_3.pdf{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, musicological research and documentation in Cuba was not undertaken by professionals fully dedicated to that subject, but instead it was conducted by historians, ethnologists or composers such as polymath [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] (b. 1881) or composer [[Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes]] (b. 1874). The controversy sustained by these distinguished personalities in reference to the possible African (or indigenous) roots of Cuban music spanned several decades, from the 1930s to the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Fernando. Africanía de la Música Folklórica de Cuba. Editora Universitaria, La Habana, Cuba. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another important personality, María Muñoz (b. 1886), a Galician pianist, professor and choir conductor that graduated at the Madrid Conservatory under the guidance of Manuel de Falla, developed an outstanding musical activity in Cuba. Together with her husband Antonio Quevedo, she co-founded the Society of Contemporary Music in 1929, promoted the cultural journal “Musicalia” and founded the Havana Choral Society.&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio. Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, UK. 2004. P.145&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Fernando Ortiz, she gave summer courses on musicology at the [[Havana University]] from the 1930s. Those courses nurtured and stimulated the careers of some future outstanding musicologists such as [[María Teresa Linares Savio]] (b. 1920).&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;

One of the earliest contribution to musicological studies in [[Cuba]] was provided by Emilio Grenet, brother of the famous Cuban composer [[Eliseo Grenet]].
 
Emilio Grenet was born in [[Havana]] in 1901 and passed away in the same city, in 1941. He studied [[Sight-reading]] and [[Music theory]] with professor Armando Laguardia and worked as a pianist in [[New York City]] in 1923. After returning to Cuba he traveled to Spain where he met composer [[Joaquín Turina]] who introduced him to his professor of [[Harmony]], [[Conrado del Campo]].

Grenet returned again to [[Cuba]] where he worked in the Education Ministry Radio Station, started his investigations about the genres of Cuban popular music and travelled to [[New York City]] to record with the orchestra of his brother [[Eliseo Grenet]]. He taught [[Musical composition]] to the renowned Cuban conductor Enrique González Mántici and [[Harmony]] to the composer and guitarist Vicente González Rubiera ([[Guyún]]).

In 1939, Grenet published his important work "Cuban popular music", which represented a serious study of the Cuban popular music genres, and a thorough insight into the most important aspects of the musical creation in [[Cuba]], from the 19th Century until that time. The book also included 80 scores of representative compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Grenet. EcuRed: https://www.ecured.cu/Emilio_Grenet. Retrieved: 07-30-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1940s and 1950s==

[[File:Alejocarpentier.jpg|thumb|right|100px|&lt;center&gt;Alejo Carpentier.]]
In 1946, the famous Cuban writer, art critic and musicologist [[Alejo Carpentier]] (b. 104) established a benchmark with his work “La música en Cuba” (1946), an attempt to put together a comprehensive history of Cuban music from the 16th century until his time. Although the work presented as facts some controversial historical issues, such as the origins of the well known “Son de la Mateodora” and the “Cuban Contradanza”, this important study (based on extensive investigations conducted by Carpentier) offered a deep insight into Cuban music history never witnessed before.
 
Coincidentally, young composers and musicologists such as [[Argeliers León]] (b. 1918) and Hilario González (b. 1920) were diligently working along with [[José Ardévol]]  at “Grupo de Renovación Musical” to improve and renovate  the Cuban musical panorama.&lt;ref&gt;EcuRed. Grupo de Renovación Musical. http://www.ecured.cu/index.php/Grupo_de_Renovaci%C3%B3n_Musical&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, [[Argeliers León]] continued offering the musicology summer courses started by María Muñoz and [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] at the Havana University and served as a professor of such prominent students as pianist and professor Ana Margarita Aguilera Ripoll (b. 1903), author of the important compilation of children songs “Cancionero Infantil de Hispanoamérica.” Other contemporary Cuban musicologists were María Antonieta Henriquez, founder of the National Museum of Music, and [[Lydia Cabrera]], an anthropologist renowned for her studies of Afro-Cuban music.&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;

==Post revolutionary period (1959)==

After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Pablo Hernández Balaguer (b. 1928) was teaching musicology at the Oriente University, an educational institution that offered the first Music Degree in the history of Cuba. Balaguer conducted an important study about the work of composer Esteban Salas and published the Music Catalog from the archives of the Santiago de Cuba Cathedral. He was a professor of several distinguished musicologists such as Virtudes Feliú Herrera (b. 1941), who conducted a thorough research into Cuban historical ritual and festive traditions. Her work has been compiled in the “Ethnographic Atlas of Cuba,” which received an award from the Cuban Academy of Science.&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;


[[Argeliers León]] and his wife María Teresa Linares were the leading figures of Cuban musicology during the early decades after the Cuban Revolution (1959). Between 1961 and 1970, León was de director of the Institute of Ethnology and Folklore at the Academy of Sciences of Cuba and he also headed the Folklore Department at the National Theater of Cuba, the Music Department of the José Martí National Library and the Music Department at Casa de Las Américas. He served as professor at the Havana Municipal Conservatory, taught African cultures in Cuba at the Havana University and musicology at the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). As a musicologist he published several books which included Del Canto y el Tiempo (1974), where he proposed a subdivision in “generic complexes” to study the musical styles in Cuba.&lt;ref name="orovio"&gt;Orovio, Helio. Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, UK. 2004. P. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

María Teresa Linares conducted extensive investigation on several areas of Cuban music history and published numerous books and articles. She worked as a professor at the Alejandro García Caturla Conservatory, the Havana University and the Institute of Ethnology and Folklore at the Academy of Sciences. Until year 2000 she was the director of the Museum of Music, and at a later time she was affiliated to the Fernando Ortiz Foundation.&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

During the first decade of the Cuban Revolution (1960 to 1970) an emerging generation of musicologists started to acquire recognition within the Cuban musical scene. We should mention, in first place, two humble and dedicated investigators that had certain common characteristics. They both had university backgrounds and worked for many years at the José Martí National Library as researchers; also their main subjects of investigation were somewhat related to the musicological work of Alejo Carpentier. Alberto Muguercia (b. 19280), a lawyer from Santiago de Cuba holds the honor of having refuted one of the greatest myths in the history of Cuban music: The “Son de la Ma Teodora” origins. In his famous book “La música en Cuba”, Alejo Carpentier categorically attributed a 16th-century origin to a popular melody called Son de la Ma Teodora without conducting a thorough investigation about the subject, thus establishing an erroneous fact as a popular tradition.  In a brilliant article about this subject: “Teodora Ginés: ¿Mito o realidad histórica? Muguercia demonstrated the inaccuracy of this theory.&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

In turn, Zolia Lapique (b. 1930), a librarian and historian, refuted a theory formulated by Carpentier in reference to the French-Haitian origin of the “Contradanza Cubana”. She attributed an earlier development and other possible origins (Spanish and English) to this musical style in her outstanding article: “Aportes Franco-Haitianos a la contradanza cubana: mitos y realidades.”  &lt;ref&gt;Giro, Radamés. Panorama de la Música Popular Cubana. Editorial Letras Cubanas, 1995. P. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent members of this generation are: Cristóbal Díaz Ayala (b. 1930), author of a complete Cuban music discography, Jorge Ibarra (b. 1931), Leonardo Acosta (b. 1933), Dulcila Cañizares (b. 1936), Raul Martínez Rodríguez (b. 1937), Helio Orovio (b. 1938), Radamés Giro (b. 1940), [[Danilo Orozco]] (b. 1944) and Alberto Faya (1944).&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

==The second generation (1970s) and beyond==

The members of the second generation of Cuban musicologists that appeared during the Cuban Revolution period, graduated in their great majority either from the Havana Municipal Conservatory or the [[Instituto Superior de Arte]] (ISA), which from 1976 offered the first Musicology Degree in the history of Cuba. Many of them worked at a later time at the newly created Centro para la investigación y desarrollo de la música cubana (CIDMUC), founded in 1978.&lt;ref name="valdes"/&gt;
From this group we should mention two renowned musicologists that frequently worked in collaboration with each other: Victoria Elí (b. 1945) and Zoila Gómez (b. 1948). We should also mention Tamahra Martín (b. 1945), who dedicated two books to the Cuban choral music: “La música coral en Cuba” (1987) and “Música Coral” (1990).

[[File:Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández, musicólogo, violonchelista y profesor cubano.]]
Two other important musicologists from this generation are: [[Alberto Alén Pérez]]  (b. 1948) and [[Rolando Antonio Pérez Fernández]] (b. 1947). Alberto Alén applied his extensive knowledge of psychology and statistics to musical form analysis as well as music pedagogy, in publications such as: “La forma de las formas musicales” and “Diagnosticar la musicalidad”. Rolando Pérez developed extensive investigations about Afro-Cuban music and is well known for having documented and analyzed the process of transition from ternary rhythms to binary rhythms of the Cuban and Latin American popular music, during the 18th and 19th centuries, in his book: “Proceso de binarización de los ritmos ternarios africanos en América Latina (1987).”&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt;

Olavo Alén (b. 1947) has closely followed the steps of Argeliers León in his studies of Afro-Cuban music and, most importantly, has elaborated and expanded León's theory of “generic complexes”, in works such as: “Géneros de la música cubana” from 1976.&lt;ref name="orovio"/&gt; 

Those theories have been strongly refuted by other musicologists such as Leonardo Acosta, who explains in his article “De los complejos genéricos y otras cuestiones”: 

{{Cita|“Fortunately, the theology [sic] of generic complexes has been viewed with skepticism in musicological circles of several countries, including Cuba, where quite a few musicologists have oscillated [in his opinion]&lt;ref&gt;Note by the editor.&lt;/ref&gt;between rejection, disbelief and disdain …” &lt;ref&gt;Acosta, Leonardo. De los complejos genéricos y otras cuestiones. Clave. Publicación del Instituto Cubano de la Música. Año 4, No. 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Other members of this Group are renowned musicologists Martha Ezquenazi (1949), Jesús Gómez Cairo (1949) and Dora Ileana Torres (1956).

}}

'''Natural science''' is a [[Branches of science|branch of science]] concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of [[Phenomenon|natural phenomena]], based on [[empirical evidence]] from [[observation]] and [[experimentation]]. Mechanisms such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.

Natural science can be divided into two main branches: [[list of life sciences|life science]] (or biological science) and [[Outline of physical science|physical science]]. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]]. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields).

In Western society's [[analytic tradition]], the empirical sciences and especially natural sciences use tools from [[formal science]]s, such as mathematics and logic, converting information about nature into measurements which can be explained as clear statements of the "[[laws of science|laws of nature]]". The [[social science]]s also use such methods, but rely more on [[qualitative research]], so that they are sometimes called "[[soft science]]", whereas natural sciences, insofar as they emphasize [[quantification (science)|quantifiable]] data produced, tested, and confirmed through the [[scientific method]], are sometimes called "[[hard science]]".{{sfn|Lagemaat|2006|p=283}}

Modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to [[natural philosophy]], usually traced to [[ancient Greece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] debated the benefits of using approaches which were more [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, [[conjecture]]s, and [[presupposition]]s, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh G Gauch Jr, ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71#v=twopage pp 71–73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906160524/https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic data collection, including [[discovery science]], succeeded [[natural history]], which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.{{sfn|Oglivie|2008|pp=1–2}} Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.&lt;ref name="Wordnet definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|publisher=Princeton University WordNet|accessdate=October 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303173506/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|archivedate=March 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
{{main|Philosophy of science}}
Philosophers of science have suggested a number of criteria, including [[Karl Popper]]'s controversial [[falsifiability]] criterion, to help them differentiate scientific endeavors from non-scientific ones. [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]], [[accuracy]], and [[quality control]], such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in the present-day global scientific community.

===Biology===
{{Main|Biology|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}
[[File:Wilson1900Fig2.jpg|thumb|Onion (''[[Allium]]'') cells in different phases of the cell cycle. Growth in an '[[organism]]' is carefully controlled by regulating the cell cycle.]]
This field encompasses a set of disciplines that examines phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component [[biophysics]] up to complex [[ecology|ecologies]]. Biology is concerned with the characteristics, [[scientific classification|classification]] and [[behaviors]] of [[organism]]s, as well as how [[species]] were formed and their interactions with each other and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

The biological fields of [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[medicine]] date back to early periods of civilization, while [[microbiology]] was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. However, it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science. Once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things, it was decided they were best studied as a whole.

Some key developments in biology were the discovery of [[genetics]]; [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]]; the [[germ theory of disease]] and the application of the techniques of [[biochemistry|chemistry]] and [[biophysics|physics]] at the level of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organic molecule]].

Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. [[Molecular biology]] is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while [[cellular biology]] is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] looks at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while [[ecology]] looks at how various organisms interrelate.

===Chemistry===
{{Main|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry#Branches of chemistry}}
[[File:Caffeine.svg|thumb|This [[structural formula]] for molecule [[caffeine]] shows a graphical representation of how the atoms are arranged.]]
Constituting the scientific study of matter at the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] scale, chemistry deals primarily with collections of atoms, such as [[gas]]es, molecules, [[crystal]]s, and [[metal]]s. The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied. Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms and molecules for use in larger-scale applications.

Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes. Chemistry is often called "[[the central science]]" because of its role in connecting the other natural sciences.

Early experiments in chemistry had their roots in the system of [[Alchemy]], a set of beliefs combining mysticism with physical experiments. The science of chemistry began to develop with the work of [[Robert Boyle]], the discoverer of gas, and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who developed the theory of the [[Conservation of mass]].

The [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|discovery of the chemical elements]] and [[atomic theory]] began to systematize this science, and researchers developed a fundamental understanding of [[State of matter|states of matter]], [[ion]]s, [[chemical bond]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s. The success of this science led to a complementary [[chemical industry]] that now plays a significant role in the world economy.

===Physics===
{{Main|Physics|Outline of physics#Branches of physics}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|The [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] are descriptions of the [[probability distribution]]s of an [[electron]] [[bound state|bound]] to a [[proton]]. Their mathematical descriptions are standard problems in [[quantum mechanics]], an important branch of physics.]]
Physics embodies the study of the fundamental constituents of the [[universe]], the [[forces]] and interactions they exert on one another, and the results produced by these interactions. In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the principles and laws set down by the field. Physics relies heavily on [[mathematics]] as the logical framework for formulation and quantification of principles.

The study of the principles of the universe has a long history and largely derives from direct observation and experimentation. The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with [[philosophy]] gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification. Key historical developments in physics include [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Law of universal gravitation|theory of universal gravitation]] and [[classical mechanics]], an understanding of [[electricity]] and its relation to [[magnetism]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theories of [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], the development of [[thermodynamics]], and the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model of atomic and [[subatomic physics]].

The field of physics is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[theoretical physics]], [[applied physics]] and [[optics]]. Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being "universalists" like [[Isaac Newton]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Lev Landau]], who worked in multiple areas.

===Astronomy===
{{Main|Astronomy|Outline of astronomy#Branches of astronomy}}
[[File:Moon Dedal crater.jpg|thumb|Unmanned and manned spacecraft missions have been used to image distant locations within the [[Solar System]], such as this ''[[Apollo 11]]'' view of [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]].]]
This discipline is the science of [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[phenomenon|phenomena]] that originate outside the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. It is concerned with the evolution, [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]], and [[motion (physics)|motion]] of celestial objects, as well as the [[physical cosmology|formation and development of the universe]].

Astronomy includes the examination, study and modeling of [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and the [[cosmos]]. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the [[interstellar medium]]).

While the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century. A key factor was [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s introduction of the telescope to examine the night sky in more detail.

The mathematical treatment of astronomy began with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s development of [[celestial mechanics]] and the laws of [[gravitation]], although it was triggered by earlier work of astronomers such as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. By the 19th century, astronomy had developed into a formal science, with the introduction of instruments such as the [[spectroscope]] and [[photography]], along with much-improved telescopes and the creation of professional observatories.

===Earth science===
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of Earth sciences#Branches of Earth science}}
Earth science (also known as geoscience), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], including [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[physical geography]], [[oceanography]], and [[soil science]].

Although [[mining]] and [[gemology|precious stones]] have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of [[economic geology]] and [[mineralogy]] did not occur until the 18th century. The study of the earth, particularly [[palaeontology]], blossomed in the 19th century. The growth of other disciplines, such as [[geophysics]], in the 20th century led to the development of the theory of [[plate tectonic]]s in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology. Earth sciences today are closely linked to [[petroleum]] and [[mineral resource]]s, [[climate]] research and to [[environmental assessment]] and [[environmental remediation|remediation]].

====Atmospheric sciences====
{{Main article|Atmospheric sciences}}
Though sometimes considered in conjunction with the earth sciences, due to the independent development of its concepts, techniques and practices and also the fact of it having a wide range of sub disciplines under its wing, the [[atmospheric sciences]] is also considered a separate branch of natural science. This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of the time. The timescale of study also varies from days to centuries. Sometimes the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than earth.

====Oceanography====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}
The serious study of oceans began in the early to mid-20th century. As a field of natural science, it is relatively young but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject. Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state that it has its own paradigms and practices. As such a big family of related studies spanning every aspect of the oceans is now classified under this field.

==Interdisciplinary studies==
The distinctions between the natural science disciplines are not always sharp, and they share a number of cross-discipline fields. Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by [[astrophysics]], [[geophysics]], [[chemical physics]] and [[biophysics]]. Likewise chemistry is represented by such fields as [[biochemistry]], [[chemical biology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[astrochemistry]].

A particular example of a scientific discipline that draws upon multiple natural sciences is [[environmental science]]. This field studies the interactions of physical, chemical, geological, and [[biological components]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], with a particular regard to the effect of human activities and the impact on [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. This science also draws upon expertise from other fields such as economics, law and social sciences.

A comparable discipline is [[oceanography]], as it draws upon a similar breadth of scientific disciplines. Oceanography is sub-categorized into more specialized cross-disciplines, such as [[physical oceanography]] and [[marine biology]]. As the [[marine ecosystem]] is very large and diverse, marine biology is further divided into many subfields, including specializations in particular [[species]].

There are also a subset of cross-disciplinary fields which, by the nature of the problems that they address, have strong currents that run counter to
specialization. Put another way: In some fields of integrative application, specialists in more than one field are a key part of most dialog. Such integrative fields, for example, include [[nanoscience]], [[astrobiology]], and [[complex system]] [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]].

===Materials science===
{{Main|Materials science}}
[[File:Materials science tetrahedron;structure, processing, performance, and proprerties.svg|thumb|The materials paradigm represented as a tetrahedron]]
Materials science is a relatively new, interdisciplinary field which deals with the study of [[matter]] and its properties; as well as the discovery and design of new materials. Originally developed through the field of [[metallurgy]], the study of the properties of materials and solids has now expanded into all materials. The field covers the chemistry, physics and engineering applications of materials including metals, ceramics, artificial polymers, and many others. The core of the field deals with relating structure of material with it properties.

It is at the forefront of research in science and engineering. It is an important part of [[forensic engineering]] (the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property) and [[failure analysis]], the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents. Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology.

The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[property|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

==History==
{{See also|Natural philosophy|History of science}}

Some scholars trace the origins of natural science as far back as pre-literate human societies, where understanding the natural world was necessary for survival.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} People observed and built up knowledge about the behavior of animals and the usefulness of plants as food and medicine, which was passed down from generation to generation.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} These primitive understandings gave way to more formalized inquiry around 3500 to 3000 BC in the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt]]ian cultures, which produced the first known written evidence of [[natural philosophy]], the precursor of natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=2}} While the writings show an interest in astronomy, mathematics and other aspects of the physical world, the ultimate aim of inquiry about nature's workings was in all cases religious or mythological, not scientific.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=2–3}}

A tradition of scientific inquiry also emerged in [[Ancient China]], where [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] and philosophers experimented with elixirs to [[life extension|extend life]] and cure ailments.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=3}} They focused on the [[yin and yang]], or contrasting elements in nature; the yin was associated with femininity and coldness, while yang was associated with masculinity and warmth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|pp=3–4}} The five phases – fire, earth, metal, wood and water – described a cycle of transformations in nature. Water turned into wood, which turned into fire when it burned. The ashes left by fire were earth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=4}} Using these principles, Chinese philosophers and doctors explored human anatomy, characterizing organs as predominantly yin or yang and understood the relationship between the pulse, the heart and the flow of blood in the body centuries before it became accepted in the West.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

Little evidence survives of how [[Ancient India]]n cultures around the [[Indus River]] understood nature, but some of their perspectives may be reflected in the [[Vedas]], a set of sacred [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} They reveal a conception of the universe as ever-expanding and constantly being recycled and reformed.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Surgeons in the [[Ayurvedic]] tradition saw health and illness as a combination of three humors: [[wind]], [[bile]] and [[phlegm]].{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} A healthy life was the result of a balance among these humors.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} In Ayurvedic thought, the body consisted of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind and empty space.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Ayurvedic surgeons performed complex surgeries and developed a detailed understanding of human anatomy.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

[[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] philosophers in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] culture brought natural philosophy a step closer to direct inquiry about cause and effect in nature between 600 and 400 BC, although an element of magic and mythology remained.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and eclipses were explained increasingly in the context of nature itself instead of being attributed to angry gods.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]], an early philosopher who lived from 625 to 546 BC, explained earthquakes by theorizing that the world floated on water and that water was the fundamental element in nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=2}} In the 5th century BC, [[Leucippus]] was an early exponent of [[atomism]], the idea that the world is made up of fundamental indivisible particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}} [[Pythagoras]] applied Greek innovations in mathematics to astronomy, and suggested that the earth was [[sphere|spherical]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}}

===Aristotelian natural philosophy (400 BC–1100 AD)===
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Aristotle's view of inheritance, as a model of the transmission of patterns of movement of the body fluids from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|Aristotelian form]] from the father.]]
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Later [[Socrates|Socratic]] and [[Plato]]nic thought focused on ethics, morals and art and did not attempt an investigation of the physical world; Plato criticized pre-Socratic thinkers as materialists and anti-religionists.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=21–22}} [[Aristotle]], however, a student of Plato who lived from 384 to 322 BC, paid closer attention to the natural world in his philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=27–28}} In his ''[[History of Animals]]'', he described the inner workings of 110 species, including the [[stingray]], [[catfish]] and [[bee]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=33–34}} He investigated chick embryos by breaking open eggs and observing them at various stages of development.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=34}} Aristotle's works were influential through the 16th century, and he is considered to be the [[Aristotle's biology|father of biology for his pioneering work in that science]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=34–35}} He also presented philosophies about physics, nature and astronomy using [[inductive reasoning]] in his works ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=37–39, 53}}

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle in [[The School of Athens|a 1509 painting]] by [[Raphael]]. Plato rejected inquiry into natural philosophy as against religion, while his student, Aristotle, created a body of work on the natural world that influenced generations of scholars.]]

While Aristotle considered natural philosophy more seriously than his predecessors, he approached it as a theoretical branch of science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=52}} Still, inspired by his work, [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]]  philosophers of the early 1st century AD, including [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], wrote treatises that dealt with the rules of the natural world in varying degrees of depth.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=95}} Many [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] of the 3rd to the 6th centuries also adapted Aristotle's teachings on the physical world to a philosophy that emphasized spiritualism.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=54, 59}} Early [[medieval]] philosophers including [[Macrobius]], [[Calcidius]] and [[Martianus Capella]] also examined the physical world, largely from a cosmological and [[cosmography|cosmographical]] perspective, putting forth theories on the arrangement of celestial bodies and the heavens, which were posited as being composed of [[aether (classical element)|aether]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=103}}

Aristotle's works on natural philosophy continued to be translated and studied amid the rise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=61–66}} 

In the Byzantine Empire [[John Philoponus]], an Alexandrian Aristotelian commentator and Christian theologian, was the first who questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics. Unlike Aristotle who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus instead relied on observation, and argued for observation rather than resorting into verbal argument.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.wmich.edu/~mcgrew/philfall.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the [[theory of impetus]]. John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as inspiration for Galileo Galilei during the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/philoponus/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Christian|last=Wildberg|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=8 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. Page 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival in mathematics and science took place during the time of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] from the 9th century onward, when Muslim scholars expanded upon Greek and [[India]]n natural philosophy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=11}} The words ''[[alcohol]]'', ''[[algebra]]'' and ''[[zenith]]'' all have [[Arabic]] roots.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=11–12}}

===Medieval natural philosophy (1100–1600)===
{{also|Renaissance of the 12th century}}
Aristotle's works and other Greek natural philosophy did not reach the West until about the middle of the 12th century, when works were translated from [[Greek people|Greek]] and Arabic into [[Latin]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=95, 130}} The development of European civilization later in the Middle Ages brought with it further advances in natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=106}} European inventions such as the [[horseshoe]], [[horse collar]] and [[crop rotation]] allowed for rapid population growth, eventually giving way to urbanization and the foundation of schools connected to monasteries and cathedrals in modern-day [[France]] and [[England]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=106–107}} Aided by the schools, an approach to Christian [[theology]] developed that sought to answer questions about nature and other subjects using logic.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} This approach, however, was seen by some detractors as [[heresy]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} By the 12th century, Western European scholars and philosophers came into contact with a body of knowledge of which they had previously been ignorant: a large corpus of works in Greek and Arabic that were preserved by Islamic scholars.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} Through translation into Latin, Western Europe was introduced to Aristotle and his natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} These works were taught at new universities in [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]] by the early 13th century, although the practice was frowned upon by the Catholic church.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}} A 1210 decree from the [[Synod]] of Paris ordered that "no lectures are to be held in Paris either publicly or privately using Aristotle's books on natural philosophy or the commentaries, and we forbid all this under pain of excommunication."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}}

In the late Middle Ages, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] translated a treatise by the earlier Persian scholar [[Al-Farabi]] called ''On the Sciences'' into Latin, calling the study of the mechanics of nature ''scientia naturalis'', or natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus also proposed his own classification of the natural sciences in his 1150 work ''On the Division of Philosophy''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} This was the first detailed classification of the sciences based on Greek and Arab philosophy to reach Western Europe.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus defined natural science as "the science considering only things unabstracted and with motion," as opposed to mathematics and sciences that rely on mathematics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}} Following Al-Farabi, he then separated the sciences into eight parts, including physics, cosmology, meteorology, minerals science and plant and animal science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}}

Later philosophers made their own classifications of the natural sciences. [[Robert Kilwardby]] wrote ''On the Order of the Sciences'' in the 13th century that classed medicine as a mechanical science, along with agriculture, hunting and theater while defining natural science as the science that deals with bodies in motion.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=156–157}} [[Roger Bacon]], an English friar and philosopher, wrote that natural science dealt with "a principle of motion and rest, as in the parts of the elements of fire, air, earth and water, and in all inanimate things made from them."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} These sciences also covered plants, animals and celestial bodies.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} Later in the 13th century, Catholic priest and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined natural science as dealing with "mobile beings" and  "things which depend on matter not only for their existence, but also for their definition."{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=159–163}} There was wide agreement among scholars in medieval times that natural science was about bodies in motion, although there was division about the inclusion of fields including medicine, music and perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=234}} Philosophers pondered questions including the existence of a vacuum, whether motion could produce heat, the colors of rainbows, the motion of the earth, whether elemental chemicals exist and where in the atmosphere rain is formed.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=236–237}}

In the centuries up through the end of the Middle Ages, natural science was often mingled with philosophies about magic and the occult.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=170–178}} Natural philosophy appeared in a wide range of forms, from treatises to encyclopedias to commentaries on Aristotle.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=189–190}} The interaction between natural philosophy and [[Christianity]] was complex during this period; some early theologians, including [[Tatian]] and [[Eusebius]], considered natural philosophy an outcropping of pagan Greek science and were suspicious of it.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=239–240}} Although some later Christian philosophers, including Aquinas, came to see natural science as a means of interpreting scripture, this suspicion persisted until the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=241–243}} The [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Condemnation of 1277]], which forbade setting philosophy on a level equal with theology and the debate of religious constructs in a scientific context, showed the persistence with which Catholic leaders resisted the development of natural philosophy even from a theological perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=246–247}} Aquinas and [[Albertus Magnus]], another Catholic theologian of the era, sought to distance theology from science in their works.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=251}} "I don't see what one's interpretation of Aristotle has to do with the teaching of the faith," he wrote in 1271.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=252}}

===Newton and the scientific revolution (1600–1800)===
By the 16th and 17th centuries, natural philosophy underwent an evolution beyond commentary on Aristotle as more early Greek philosophy was uncovered and translated.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} The invention of the printing press in the 15th century, the invention of the microscope and telescope, and the [[Protestant Reformation]] fundamentally altered the social context in which scientific inquiry evolved in the West.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery of a new world changed perceptions about the physical makeup of the world, while observations by [[Copernicus]], [[Tyco Brahe]] and [[Galileo]] brought a more accurate picture of the solar system as [[heliocentric]] and proved many of Aristotle's theories about the heavenly bodies false.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274–275}} A number of 17th-century philosophers, including [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Francis Bacon]] made a break from the past by rejecting Aristotle and his medieval followers outright, calling their approach to natural philosophy as superficial.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=276–277}}

The titles of Galileo's work ''Two New Sciences'' and [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''New Astronomy'' underscored the atmosphere of change that took hold in the 17th century as Aristotle was dismissed in favor of novel methods of inquiry into the natural world.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon was instrumental in popularizing this change; he argued that people should use the arts and sciences to gain dominion over nature.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=278–279}} To achieve this, he wrote that "human life [must] be endowed with new discoveries and powers."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} He defined natural philosophy as "the knowledge of Causes and secret motions of things; and enlarging the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of all things possible."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon proposed scientific inquiry supported by the state and fed by the collaborative research of scientists, a vision that was unprecedented in its scope, ambition and form at the time.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} Natural philosophers came to view nature increasingly as a mechanism that could be taken apart and understood, much like a complex clock.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–285}} Natural philosophers including [[Isaac Newton]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Francesco Redi]] conducted experiments focusing on the flow of water, measuring [[atmospheric pressure]] using a [[barometer]] and disproving [[spontaneous generation]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–290}} Scientific societies and scientific journals emerged and were spread widely through the printing press, touching off the [[scientific revolution]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–295}} Newton in 1687 published his ''The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'', or ''Principia Mathematica'', which set the groundwork for physical laws that remained current until the 19th century.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=304–306}}

Some modern scholars, including Andrew Cunningham, Perry Williams and [[Floris Cohen]], argue that natural philosophy is not properly called a science, and that genuine scientific inquiry began only with the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} According to Cohen, "the emancipation of science from an overarching entity called 'natural philosophy' is one defining characteristic of the Scientific Revolution."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Other historians of science, including [[Edward Grant]], contend that the scientific revolution that blossomed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries occurred when principles learned in the exact sciences of optics, mechanics and astronomy began to be applied to questions raised by natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Grant argues that Newton attempted to expose the mathematical basis of nature – the immutable rules it obeyed – and in doing so joined natural philosophy and mathematics for the first time, producing an early work of modern physics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=317–318}}

[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton]] is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time.]]
The scientific revolution, which began to take hold in the 17th century, represented a sharp break from Aristotelian modes of inquiry.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}} One of its principal advances was the use of the [[scientific method]] to investigate nature. Data was collected and [[repeatability|repeatable]] measurements made in [[experiment]]s.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=26–27}} Scientists then formed [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain the results of these experiments.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The hypothesis was then tested using the principle of [[falsifiability]] to prove or disprove its accuracy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The natural sciences continued to be called natural philosophy, but the adoption of the scientific method took science beyond the realm of philosophical conjecture and introduced a more structured way of examining nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}}

Newton, an English mathematician and physicist, was the seminal figure in the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=33}} Drawing on advances made in astronomy by Copernicus, Brahe and Kepler, Newton derived the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal law of gravitation]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=33–35}} These laws applied both on earth and in outer space, uniting two spheres of the physical world previously thought to function independently of each other, according to separate physical rules.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=35}} Newton, for example, showed that the [[tide]]s were caused by the gravitational pull of the [[moon]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=36}} Another of Newton's advances was to make mathematics a powerful explanatory tool for natural phenomena.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}} While natural philosophers had long used mathematics as a means of measurement and analysis, its principles were not used as a means of understanding cause and effect in nature until Newton.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}}

In the 18th century and 19th century, scientists including [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], [[Alessandro Volta]], and [[Michael Faraday]] built upon Newtonian mechanics by exploring [[electromagnetism]], or the interplay of forces with positive and negative charges on [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Faraday proposed that forces in nature operated in "[[Field (physics)|fields]]" that filled space.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} The idea of fields contrasted with the Newtonian construct of gravitation as simply "action at a distance", or the attraction of objects with nothing in the space between them to intervene.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 19th century unified these discoveries in a coherent [[Maxwell's equations|theory of electrodynamics]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Using mathematical equations and experimentation, Maxwell discovered that space was filled with charged particles that could act upon themselves and each other, and that they were a medium for the transmission of charged waves.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}}

Significant advances in chemistry also took place during the scientific revolution. [[Antoine Lavoisier]], a French chemist, refuted the [[phlogiston theory]], which posited that things burned by releasing "phlogiston" into the air.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[Joseph Priestley]] had discovered [[oxygen]] in the 18th century, but Lavoisier discovered that [[combustion]] was the result of [[oxidation]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} He also constructed a table of 33 elements and invented modern chemical nomenclature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} Formal biological science remained in its infancy in the 18th century, when the focus lay upon the [[Scientific classification|classification and categorization]] of natural life. This growth in [[natural history]] was led by [[Carl Linnaeus]], whose 1735 [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the natural world is still in use. Linnaeus in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|pp=171–179}}

===19th-century developments (1800–1900)===
[[File:Michelson-Morley experiment (en).svg|thumb|The [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] was used to disprove that light propagated through a [[luminiferous aether]]. This 19th-century concept was then superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]].]]

By the 19th century, the study of science had come into the purview of professionals and institutions. In so doing, it gradually acquired the more modern name of ''natural science.'' The term ''scientist'' was coined by [[William Whewell]] in an 1834 review of [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''On the Connexion of the Sciences''.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite book |last1= Holmes|first1= R|title= The age of wonder: How the romantic generation discovered the beauty and terror of science|edition= |date= 2008|publisher= Harper Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-714953-7|page= 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the word did not enter general use until nearly the end of the same century.

===Modern natural science (1900–present)===
According to a famous 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by the American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and the American physical chemist [[Merle Randall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances |first1=Gilbert N. |last1=Lewis |first2=Merle |last2=Randall |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |edition=First |others=later Printing edition |date=1923 |asin= B000GSLHZS}}&lt;/ref&gt; the natural sciences contain three great branches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aside from the logical and mathematical sciences, there are three great branches of ''natural science'' which stand apart by reason of the variety of far reaching deductions drawn from a small number of primary postulates — they are [[mechanics]], [[electrodynamics]], and [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huggins|first=Robert A.|title=Energy storage|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|edition=Online-Ausg. |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, natural sciences are more commonly divided into life sciences, such as botany and zoology; and physical sciences, which include physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy and materials science.

[[ File:Giorgione - Sleeping Venus - Google Art Project 2.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Giorgione's ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Sleeping Venus]]'' (c. 1510), Dresden, [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]].]]
In [[art history]], "'''Old Master'''" (or "'''old master'''")&lt;ref&gt;The term is spelled either way in the literature. Major UK and US dictionaries, incl. the [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/old_master Oxford Online Dictionaries], [https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=old%20master American Heritage Dictionary], Macmillan, Cambridge, and Random House dictionaries use lowercase; Oxford English Dictionary, Collins, and Merriam-Webster dictionaries also mention the uppercase spelling.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=christies1&gt;[http://www.christies.com/departments/old-master-and-early-british-paintings-70-1.aspx Old Masters Department], Christies.com.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to any [[painting|painter]] of skill who worked in Europe before about 1800, or a painting by such an artist. An "[[old master print]]" is an original [[printmaking|print]] (for example an [[engraving]] or [[etching]]) made by an artist in the same period. The term "old master [[drawing]]" is used in the same way.

In theory, "Old Master" applies only to artists who were fully trained, were [[Master craftsman|Master]]s of their local [[Guild of Saint Luke|artists' guild]], and worked independently, but in practice, paintings produced by pupils or workshops are often included in the scope of the term. Therefore, beyond a certain level of competence, date rather than quality is the criterion for using the term.

==Period covered==
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the term was often understood as having a starting date of perhaps 1450 or 1470; paintings made before that were "primitives", but this distinction is no longer made. The  ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''  defines the term as "A pre-eminent artist of the period before the modern; esp. a pre-eminent western European painter of the 13th to 18th centuries." The first quotation given is from 1696, in the diary of [[John Evelyn]]: "My L: Pembroke..shewed me divers rare Pictures of very many of the old &amp; best Masters, especially that of M: Angelo..,&amp; a large booke of the best drawings of the old Masters."&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"old master, n. and adj." ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, December 2016. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to refer to a painting or sculpture made by an Old Master, a usage datable to 1824.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; There are comparable terms in Dutch, French and German; the Dutch may have been the first to make use of such a term, in the 18th century, when ''oude meester'' mostly meant [[Dutch Golden Age painting|painters of the Dutch Golden Age]] of the previous century. ''Les Maitres d'autrefois'' of 1876 by [[Eugene Fromentin]] may have helped to popularize the concept, although "vieux maitres" is also used in French. The famous collection in [[Dresden]] at the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] is one of the few museums to include the term in its actual name, although many more use it in the title of departments or sections. The collection in the Dresden museum essentially stops at the [[Baroque]] period.

The end date is necessarily vague – for example, [[Goya]] (1746–1828) is certainly an Old Master,&lt;ref name=christies1 /&gt; though he was still painting and [[printmaking]] at his death in 1828. The term might also be used for [[John Constable]]&lt;ref name=christies1 /&gt; (1776–1837) or [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1868), but usually is not.

The term tends to be avoided by [[art historian]]s as too vague, especially when discussing paintings, although the terms "Old Master Prints" and "Old Master drawings" are still used. It remains current in the art trade. Auction houses still usually divide their sales between, for example, "Old Master Paintings", "Nineteenth-century paintings" and "Modern paintings". [[Christie's]] defines the term as ranging "from the 14th to the early 19th century".{{cite quote|date=January 2017}}

==Anonymous artists==
Artists, most often from early periods, whose hand has been identified by art historians, but to whom no identity can be confidently attached, are often given names by art historians such as ''[[Master E.S.]]'' (from his monogram), ''[[Master of Flémalle]]'' (from a previous location of a work), ''Master of [[Mary of Burgundy]]'' (from a patron), ''[[Master of Latin 757]]'' (from the shelf mark of a manuscript he illuminated), ''[[Master of the Brunswick Diptych]]'' or ''[[Master of Schloss Lichtenstein]]''.

'''Philip Gossett''' (September 27, 1941 – June 12, 2017)&lt;ref name="chicagotribune"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/vonrhein/ct-ent-0614-gossett-obit-20170613-column.html |title=Philip Gossett, scholar of 19th-century Italian opera, is dead at 75 |first=John |last=von Rhein |date=June 13, 2017 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.is/20170615151852/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/vonrhein/ct-ent-0614-gossett-obit-20170613-column.html |archive-date=2017-06-15|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[musicologist]] and historian, and Robert W. Reneker Distinguished Service Professor of Music at the [[University of Chicago]]. His lifelong interest in 19th-century Italian opera began with listening to [[Metropolitan Opera]] broadcasts in his youth. ''Divas and Scholars: Performing Italian Opera'', a major work on the subject, won the Otto Kinkeldey Award of the [[American Musicological Society]] as best book on music of 2006.

Philip Gossett's contributions to opera scholarship and how they can influence operatic performance may best be summed up by ''[[Newsday]]'''s comment that "some encomiasts claim that soprano [[Maria Callas]] did as much for Italian opera as [[Arturo Toscanini]] or Verdi. Musicologist Philip Gossett arguably has done as much for Italian opera as any of those geniuses."&lt;ref&gt;Marion Lignara Rosenberg, [http://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/retirement/opera-review-1.650130 "Restoring the erotic to a Verdi classic"], , ''[[Newsday]]'',  2 April 2004 online at newsday.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gossett earned degrees from the [[Juilliard School]], [[Amherst College]], and [[Princeton University]]. He studied in Paris on a [[Fulbright Scholarship]].&lt;ref name="ON"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2017/9/Departments/Obituaries.html|title=Obituaries: Philip Gossett|work=[[Opera News]]|date=September 2017|volume=82|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time he began graduate musical studies in the mid-1960s, the Italian composers such as [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi]] had been given little serious academic study.  As he noted: "If you were going to be a serious musicologist, you had to study Beethoven or Bach or Gregorian chants, but Rossini -- that was a pretty funny idea" &lt;ref name="Gossett"&gt;[http://www-news.uchicago.edu/citations/04/041219.gossett-st.html Art Golab, "U. of C. musicologist gets 'surprise' $1.5 mil. award", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', December 19, 2004, on news.uchicago.edu/citations]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he persisted and notes that "I went to [[Princeton University]] for graduate work in musicology (and) I fell more in love with the music and wrote my doctoral dissertation on the music of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi. Then I went to Paris on a [[Fulbright]] and studied Rossini's operas."&lt;ref name="Clurman"&gt;Judith Clurman, [http://www.juilliard.edu/update/journal/j_articles204.html "Meet Philip Gossett"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040503153607/http://www.juilliard.edu/update/journal/j_articles204.html |date=2004-05-03 }}, ''The Juilliard Journal Online'' on juilliard.edu, March 2004. Interview with Philip Gossett&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Gossett's work has frequently taken him to Italy, where he has advised on the presentations of productions at the [[Rossini Opera Festival]] in Rossini's hometown of [[Pesaro]], and he has worked directly with the Istituto Nazionale di Studi Verdiani (Institute of Verdi Studies) in [[Parma]] which was founded in 1960. Also, for the 2001 centenary of Verdi's death, he worked with the [[Teatro Regio di Parma]] on their programming. In 1968 he joined the faculty of the [[University of Chicago]] where he remained for the rest of his career. He was a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago at the time of his death in 2017.&lt;ref name="ON"/&gt;

==Critical editions of Verdi and Rossini operas==
Given that Gossett's musical interests focus on 19th-century Italian opera (especially the works of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi),  most of his career was devoted to being General Editor of two important  projects while at the University of Chicago: the research for the preparation of [[Critical edition (opera)|critical editions]] of all the operas of both Rossini (some 70) and Verdi (some 33, in their various forms).  These are being prepared and gradually published as ''The Works of Giuseppe Verdi'' (by the University of Chicago Press in collaboration with the Italian publishing house [[Casa Ricordi]] of [[Milan]]) and of ''The Works of Gioachino Rossini'' (by [[Bärenreiter|Bärenreiter Verlag]], [[Kassel]]).

In an interview, Gossett explained what he means by the term "critical edition":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By critical edition of an opera I have always meant an edition that bases itself wherever possible on the very finest and most accurate sources for an opera. That means that it must study the entire performance history of a work. In some cases of course we have an autograph manuscript, and that helps us, but it is also where many of the problems start, because composers are known to have made mistakes in their autograph manuscripts. And therefore we are required – we feel it is necessary – to intervene and to correct errors that sometimes have been perpetrated on these works by printed editions from the beginning, so they are just mistakes in the old editions, simple mistakes.&lt;ref name="GAZZ"&gt;Gazzola, Interview with Philip Gossett on operalively.org. 17 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere, he explained the overall aim of the production of critical editions of the operas by using the example of Rossini's ''[[Il viaggio a Reims]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We used sources in Rome, Paris, Vienna, and New York. The scores reprinted cheaply today simply reproduce all the errors, all the faults of these 19th-century scores—most of which were produced very quickly and, in Verdi's own words, "are filled with errors." ... The new critical editions have tried, for the first time, to return to authentic sources and they allow performers to have access to the various versions sanctioned by the composers.&lt;ref name="Clurman"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As he has explained, Gossett does not believe that singers need to base their interpretations entirely on everything contained in a critical edition. His aim is "that performers should base their work on the finest editions possible, and that’s what we try to produce".&lt;ref name="GAZZ"/&gt;

As of 2004, it was noted that "Gossett's team (had) completed 12 of 33 projected volumes of Verdi's work and more than 30 volumes of an expected 70 for Rossini. 'I'll never get through the Rossini,' Gossett said. 'But the Verdi – I'm hoping.'"&lt;ref name="Gossett"/&gt;  However, in July 2013, the University of Chicago's "Verdi Critical Edition - Available Titles" page shows 17 opera titles by Verdi
&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Vavail.html  List of Verdi operas in critical editions]&lt;/ref&gt; and 9 Rossini opera titles currently available or planned for publication by Bärenreiter Verlag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Barenreiter%20plan.htm  Rossini operas prepared by Bärenreiter Verlag]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is in addition to the 26 Rossini operas for which critical editions have been prepared by the Rossini Foundation under Gossett's general direction.

However, he is on record as denying that the [[Claudio Scimone]] edition of ''[[Maometto II]]'' is a critical edition in the true sense of the word, but is more a performing edition by Scimone as conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Gazzola, Interview with Philip Gossett on operalively.com&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Rossini's ''[[Tancredi]]'', ''[[Ermione]]'' and ''[[Semiramide]]'' are three of critical editions which he has personally edited, while his most recent work is Verdi's ''[[La forza del destino]]'' which, while yet to be formally published, was performed at the [[San Francisco Opera]] in November 2005 in its 1869 version. The 1862 version was presented in the Stadttheater, Bern in April 2006.

===Work with US opera companies===
In the US, he has consulted with the [[Houston Grand Opera]] (in 1979 for the first production of the critical edition of ''Tancredi'', with its then newly discovered tragic ending, starring [[Marilyn Horne]])&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, ''Divas and Scholars'' pp 148-152&lt;/ref&gt;. He has worked three times with the [[Metropolitan Opera]]: for its November 1990 production of ''[[Semiramide]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Gossett, ''Divas and Scholars'', pp 175-199&lt;/ref&gt;; for its 1993 production of ''[[Stiffelio]]''; and for its 1997 production of ''[[La cenerentola]]''. He has also worked with [[Santa Fe Opera|The Santa Fe Opera]] in 2000 for Rossini's ''[[Ermione]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, ''Divas and Scholars'', pp 8-11&lt;/ref&gt; and with the [[Chicago Lyric Opera]] for the first presentations of Rossini's long-lost ''Il viaggio a Reims'' in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, ''Divas and Scholars'', pp. 152-158&lt;/ref&gt; Gossett again acted as consultant to The Santa Fe Opera during rehearsals for its 2012 season production of the new critical edition of Rossini's original ''Maometto II'' of 1820 and he returned in the same capacity during rehearsals of the company's new production of Rossini's ''[[La donna del lago]]'' during the 2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santafeopera.org/tickets/production.aspx?performanceNumber=5708  Performance details at The Santa Fe Opera]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2010 presentations of Verdi's ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'' for the Met, Gossett also worked with conductor [[Riccardo Muti]] on revisions to the score based on new research. This has become a new critical edition of the opera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Vavail.html  The ''Atilla'' critical edition], edited by Helen Greenwald, is currently available as a rental in ''The Works of Giuseppe Verdi'' series.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muti has acknowledged Gossett's role in clarifying ambiguities (in this case in ''Rigoletto'') which had crept into many texts.&lt;ref&gt;F. Paul Driscoll, "Grandissimo Maestro", ''Opera News'', February 2010, p.20. Interview with Riccardo Muti: "Even the critics did not realize that some words they were used to hearing didn't make any sense. For example, the critical edition with Gossett revealed many important things, such as when the Duke goes in the ''taverna''...and asks for "Una stanza e del vino" ("a room and some wine") [....] but nobody realized that these are not the words that Verdi wrote.  Verdi wrote, "Tua sorella e del vino" - "I want your ''sister'' and some wine". Muti continues to explain that Rigoletto's comment to Gilda (in which he says "that's just like him", meaning that the request is typical of his behaviour)   which follows the Duke's remark, makes no sense without the word "sister" being included."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Gossett was awarded the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]'s "Distinguished Achievement Award" in 2004, which gained him a prize of $1.5 million to facilitate his research. Also, in 1998, the Italian government gave  him the  "Cavaliere di Gran Croce", the highest honor that can be awarded to a civilian. Academically, he has been President of the American Musicological Society and of the Society for Textual Scholarship, as well as Dean of the Division of the Humanities at the University of Chicago. In 2008 Gossett was appointed foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]].

'''Physical education,''' also known as '''Phys Ed.''', '''PE''', '''gym''', or '''gym class''', and known in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries as '''physical training''' or '''PT''',&lt;ref&gt;

==Asia==
In [[Singapore]], pupils from primary school through junior colleges are required to have two hours of PE every week, except during examination periods. Pupils may play games like [[soccer|football]], [[badminton]], [[captain ball]], and [[basketball]] during most sessions. Unorthodox sports such as [[fencing]], and [[skateboarding]] are occasionally played. In more prestigious secondary schools and in junior colleges, sports such as [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[marksmanship|shooting]], and [[squash (sport)|squash]] are played. (This paragraph needs to be cited. Where is this information from?)  

An Biennial compulsory fitness exam, NAPFA, is conducted in every school to assess pupils' physical fitness in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asiaone.com/napfa-fitness-test-education-tool|title=Napfa: From fitness test to education tool|work=AsiaOne|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a series of fitness tests (pull-ups/inclined pull-ups for girls, standing broad jump, sit-ups, sit-and-reach and 1.6&amp;nbsp;km for primary [10- to 12-year-olds]/2.4&amp;nbsp;km for secondary and junior college levels [13- to 18-year-olds]). Students are graded by gold, silver, or bronze, or as fail. NAPFA for pre-enlistees serves as an indicator for an additional two months in the country's compulsory national service if they attain bronze or fail.

In [[Malaysia]], pupils from primary schools to secondary schools are expected to do two periods or one hour of PE throughout the year except a week before [[Test (assessment)|examinations]]. In most [[secondary schools]], games like badminton, [[sepak takraw]], [[association football|football]], [[netball]], basketball and tennis are available. Pupils may bring their own sports equipment to the school with the authorization of the teacher. (Again, citation needed for this paragraph. Where is this information from?) 

In the [[Philippines]], PE is mandatory for all years, unless the school gives the option for a student to do the [[Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme]] instead for fifth and sixth year. Some schools have integrated martial arts training into their physical education curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visayandailystar.com/2008/September/27/sportnews1.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930151303/http://www.visayandailystar.com/2008/September/27/sportnews1.htm |date=September 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garimot.com/articles/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523121915/http://www.garimot.com/articles/index.html |date=May 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imafp.com/Chapters/IMAFP_commissions/IMAFP_mindanao.htm |title=Regional Commissions and Chapters International Modern Arnis Federation Philippines Mindanao Commission |publisher=Imafp.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindanaotimes.com.ph/story.php?id=22801 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115150606/http://www.mindanaotimes.com.ph/story.php?id=22801 |date=January 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/sim/sim/view/20081214-177923/Life-Lessons-from-Karate |title=Sunday Inquirer Magazine: Life Lessons from Karate |publisher=Showbizandstyle.inquirer.net |date=2008-12-14 |accessdate=2010-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304154557/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/sim/sim/view/20081214-177923/Life-Lessons-from-Karate |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SMATrinitasORBenteng.JPG|thumb|Indonesian high school students playing the traditional game "Benteng"]]
In [[Indonesia]], students ranging from [[kindergarten]] to [[high school]] have PE integrated with their curriculum. Kindergarten through grade 3 students have [[gymnastics]]. Starting from Grade 4, students are introduced to traditional martial arts [[Pencak Silat]] and some team games such as badminton, football, futsal, rounders, and basketball. Starting from [[junior high school]], games such as basketball, volleyball, cricket, tennis, badminton, kho kho, and kabaddi are played. Drills and physical training are taught.

In Bhutan, the inclusion of Health and Physical Education in the school curriculum was formally endorsed during the 7th CAPSD Board Meeting in 1997. A series of pilot tests were conducted in primary schools from 1998 to 1999. Since the pilot tests were very successful, HPE was introduced as a formal teaching subject in all the primary schools from the year 2000.

In 2007, a set of revised curriculum books, consisting of a curriculum framework and eight activity books, were developed for use from 2009 academic session.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], physical education was first made an important part of the curriculum in government primary and secondary schools in 1981. The policy was outlined in a Ministerial Statement to the Victorian Legislative Assembly by the Minister for Educational Services, [[Norman Lacy]] MP on 17 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/MinisterialStatementOnNewDirectionsInPhysicalEducation#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Ministerial Statement on New Directions in Physical Education |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the goal of physical education is to "develop physically literate individuals who have the knowledge, skills and confidence to enjoy a lifetime of healthful physical activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shape America Home Page|url = http://www.shapeamerica.org|website = www.shapeamerica.org|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero Hour is a before-school physical education class first implemented by [[Naperville Central High School]]. In the state of [[Illinois]] this program is known as Learning Readiness P.E. (LRPE). It was based on research indicating that [[student]]s who are physically fit are more [[academics|academically]] alert and experience growth in [[brain cell]]s or enhancement in [[brain]] development. NCHS pairs a PE class that incorporates [[cardiovascular exercise]], [[core strength]] training, cross lateral movements, and [[literacy]] and [[math]] strategies with literacy and math classes that utilize movement to enhance [[learning]] and improve achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Enhancing P.E. in Illinois, http://iphionline.org/pdf/P.E._Case_Study_Naperville.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In British Columbia, Canada, the government has stated in the grade one curriculum that students must participate in physical activity daily five times a week. The teacher is also responsible for planning Daily Physical Activity (DPA), which is thirty minutes of mild to moderate physical activity a day, not including curriculum physical education classes. The curriculum requires students in grade one to be knowledgeable about healthy living. For example, they must be able to describe benefits of regular exercise, identify healthy choices that require them to be more physically active, and describe the importance of choosing healthy food.&lt;ref&gt;BC curriculum package&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation needed|date=June 2018}} &lt;!-- Not a strong source for this information. See actual curriculum documents for more reliable information regarding what students are learning.  --&gt;

Ontario, Canada has a similar procedure in place. On October 6, 2005 the Ontario Ministry of Education (OME) implemented a Daily Physical Activity policy in elementary schools, grades 1–8. It requires that all students in grades 1 to 8, including those with special needs, be provided with opportunities to participate in a minimum of twenty minutes of sustained moderate to vigorous physical activity each school day during instructional time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/teachers/dpa1-3.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212025619/http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/teachers/dpa1-3.pdf |date=December 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many factors that contribute to the ease of implementing and sustaining a quality program, including the involvement of the administration, parents, and community. However, it ultimately comes down to the willingness of the physical education teacher(s) to do their best no matter the situation &lt;ref&gt;The Importance of Physical Education https://www.supportrealteachers.org/the-importance-of-quality-physical-education.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwiJncBRC1ARIsAOvG-a5DFCcyvtwvTO6TWrGWTlSx7w1mmTqLbz4jFcQRk2MNf73vNIItQS8aAvUSEALw_wcB&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Portugal]], pupils from primary school can optionally join PE as an extra-curricular activity. From middle school to secondary school, pupils must participate in PE classes for two hours per week.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[Scotland]] has is a government supported requirement of a minimum of two hours of quality PE in primary and two periods (50 minutes each) in secondary S1 to S4. Recent funding has ensured most local authorities have employed PE lead officers to support the requirement. In fifth and sixth year, PE is voluntary in that personalisation and choice must be considered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In [[England]], pupils are expected to do two hours of PE a week in year 7, 8 and 9 and at least one in year 10 and 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National curriculum in England: physical education programmes of study|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-physical-education-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-physical-education-programmes-of-study|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=24 November 2016}} [[File:UKOpenGovernmentLicence.svg|50px]] This content is available under the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/  Open Government Licence v3.0]. © Crown copyright.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sweden]] it differs from municipality to municipality but generally, year 0 to 2 has 55 minutes PE a week. Year 3 to 6 has 110 minutes a week and year 7-9 has 220 minutes. In upper secondary school, all national programs have an obligatory course, Idrott och hälsa 1, containing 100 points of PE, which corresponds to 90-100 hours of PE during the course. (One point should be one hour, but due to holidays this isn't true.) The schools can spend these hours as they like during the three years students attend. Most schools put this course during the first year and offer the follow-up course, Idrott och hälsa 2, which also contains 100 points.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}


In Ireland, you are expected to do 2 Classes worth of P.E.(80 Minutes)This also includes Shower and Changing Times, so averagely 60-65 minutes outside.

{{refimprove|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Corta-Mato Escolar 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Young [[Portugal|Portuguese]] children participating in a school race]]
Physical education [[fad|trends]] have developed recently{{when|date=March 2014}} to incorporate a greater variety of activities besides typical [[sports]]. Introducing students to activities like [[bowling]], [[walking]]/[[hiking]], or [[frisbee]] at an early age can help them develop good activity habits that will continue into adulthood. 

Some [[teacher]]s have begun to incorporate stress-reduction techniques such as [[yoga]], deep breathing and [[tai chi]]. Tai chi, an ancient martial arts form focused on slow meditative movements, is a relaxation activity with many benefits. Studies have shown that it enhances muscular strength and endurance, as well as cardiovascular endurance. It also provides psychological benefits such as improving general mental health, concentration, awareness and positive mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tai Chi for Mental Health {{!}} Psych Central News|url=http://psychcentral.com/news/2010/05/24/tai-chi-for-mental-health/14015.html|website=Psych Central News|date=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be taught to any age student with little or no equipment, making it ideal for mixed ability and age classes. Tai chi can easily be incorporated into a holistic learning body and mind unit.&lt;ref&gt;Lu C. (2007 {{full citation needed|date=February 2017}})&lt;/ref&gt; 

Teaching non-traditional sports may also provide motivation for students to increase their activity, and can help them learn about different cultures. For example, while learning about [[lacrosse]] in the Southwestern United States, students might also learn about the Native American cultures of the Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada, where the sport originated. Teaching non-traditional (or non-native) sports provides an opportunity to integrate academic concepts from other subjects as well, which may now be required of many PE teachers.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

PE is very important to students' health and overall well-being. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] stated that over the past three years{{when|date=June 2018}} obesity in children (ages 2–5) and adolescents (ages 12–19) has doubled because of diet and lack of activity. Since the 1970s the number of children who are obese has tripled.&lt;ref&gt;The Importance of Physical Education. (n.d.). Retrieved April 1, 2016, from http://www.veanea.org/home/1000.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Jf;fhjk;sfdbkdfl'b.jpg|thumbnail]]

SHAPE America's National Standards &amp; Grade-Level Outcomes for K-12 Physical Education define what a student should know and be able to do as result of an effective physical education program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shapeamerica.org/standards/pe/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trend is the incorporation of [[health]] and [[nutrition]] into the physical education curriculum. The [[Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004]] required that all school districts with a federally-funded school meal program develop wellness policies that address nutrition and physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;Pangrazi, Robert (2007) "Dynamic Physical Education for Elementary School Children" 15th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; While teaching students sports and movement skills, PE teachers are now incorporating short health and nutrition lessons into the curriculum. This is more prevalent at the elementary school level, where students do not have a specific Health class. Recently most elementary schools have specific health classes for students as well as physical education class. Due to the recent outbreaks of diseases such as swine flu, school districts are making it mandatory for students to learn about practicing good hygiene along with other health topics.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Today many states require Physical Education teachers to be certified to teach Health courses.  Many colleges and universities offer both Physical Education and Health as one certification. This push towards health education is beginning at the intermediate level, including lessons on bullying, self-esteem and stress and anger management.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Research has shown that there is a positive correlation between brain development and exercising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=REYNOLDS|first=GRETCHEN|title=Phys Ed: Can Exercise Make Kids Smarter?|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/phys-ed-can-exercise-make-kids-smarter/|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incorporating local indigenous knowledge into physical education can lead to many meaningful experiences and a way of learning about other cultures. For example, by incorporating traditional knowledge from varying indigenous groups from across Canada, students can be exposed to many concepts such as holistic learning and the medicine wheel. A unit could be focused on connecting to a place or feeling while outdoors, participating in traditional games, or outdoor environmental education. These types of lesson can easily be integrated into other parts of the curriculum and give Aboriginal students a chance to incorporate their culture in the local school community.&lt;ref&gt;Lowen, G {{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have been done in how physical education can help improve academic achievement. In a 2007 article, researchers found a profound gain in English Arts [[standardized testing]] test scores among students who had 56 hours of physical education in a year, compared to those who had 28 hours of physical education a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tremarche|first1=Pamela V.|last2=Robinson|first2=Ellyn M.|last3=Graham|first3=Louise B.|title=Physical Education and Its Effect on Elementary Testing Results|journal=Physical Educator|date=2007|volume=64|issue=2 |pages=58–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], the physical education curriculum is designed to allow school pupils a full range of modern opportunities, including sports. [[Martial arts]] classes, like [[wrestling]] in the United States, and [[Pencak Silat]] in France, [[Indonesia]], and [[Malaysia]], teach children [[self-defense]] and to feel good about themselves. The physical education curriculum is designed to allow students to experience at least a minimum exposure to the following categories of activities: [[aquatic sports|aquatics]], conditioning activities, [[gymnastics]], individual/dual sports, [[team sports]], rhythms, and [[dance]].

In these areas, a planned sequence of learning experiences is designed to support a progression of student development. This allows kids through 6th grade to be introduced to sports, fitness, and teamwork in order to be better prepared for the middle and high school age. In 1975, the [[United States House of Representatives]] voted to require school physical education classes include [[coeducation|both genders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=483834 |title=Physical Education – Jul 18, 1975 – NBC – TV news: Vanderbilt Television News Archive |publisher=Tvnews.vanderbilt.edu |date=1975-07-18 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some high school and some middle school PE classes are single-sex. &lt;!-- This makes no sense as written. Can someone clarify?) Requiring individuals to participate in physical education activities, such as [[dodge ball]], [[flag football]], and other competitive sports remains a controversial subject because of the social impact these have cases physical education programs have been cut.--&gt;&lt;!-- A lot of research shows the benefits of physical education however there can also be a lot of negative experiences students deal with regarding physical education.  --&gt;&lt;!-- A section detailing possible negative experiences students may face during physical education would be beneficial  --&gt;

==Technology use in physical education==

New technology in education is playing a big role in classes. One of the most affordable and effective tools is a simple video recorder.  With this, students can see the mistakes they're making in things such as a throwing motion or swinging form.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Wang, L., Myers, D., &amp; Yanes, M. (2010). Creating student-centered learning experience through the assistance of high-end technology in physical education. Journal of Instructional Psychology, 37(4), 352–356.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that students find this more effective than having someone try to explain what they are doing wrong, and then trying to correct it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Educators may use technologies such as [[pedometer]]s and [[heart rate monitor]]s to make step and heart rate goals for students.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, M., Karp, G., Goc, H., &amp; Perlman, D. (2008). Physical educators' usage. Physical Educator, 65(2), 82–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Other technologies that can be used in a Physical Education setting include [[video projector]]s, [[GPS]] and games and gaming systems such as [[Kinect]], [[Wii]] Fit and ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''. Projectors can show students proper form or how to play certain games. [[GPS]] systems can be used to get students active in an outdoor setting, and active exergames{{clarify|date=October 2014}} can be used by teachers to show students a good way to stay fit in and out of the classroom setting.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, G. (2011, November 21). Interview by M Massey [Personal Interview].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of technology that is commonly used in Physical Education is the pedometer. This does not necessarily track how far a person is going, but lets them know the number of steps they are taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/using-pedometers-to-assess-physical-activity-participation-levels |title=Using pedometers to assess physical activity participation levels |publisher=Humankinetics.com |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pecentral.org/lessonideas/pedometer/pedometerlessonndex.html |title=PEC: Pedometer Lesson Activities |publisher=Pecentral.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''privileged positions of business and science''' refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge and the ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

== Privileged position of business ==

Businesses have considerable power in decision-making processes in business-oriented societies. High level executives make discrete decisions about technological innovation without regard to consequences. Political scientist Edward Woodhouse states that businesses make key economic decisions that include creating jobs, choosing industrial plant and equipment, and deciding which new products to develop and market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, businesses hold a privileged position related to politics in the sense that they are capable of considerable influence over key public choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership role that business has in the economy gives executives of large corporations an unusual kind of degree of influence over governmental policy making.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government officials have incentives to carry out businesses' demands. They know that failure of businesses to maintain high employment will upset voters more quickly than anything else.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Our economy functions as a chain effect. Businesses that get what they want provide plentiful jobs and stimulate cash flow in the economy. As a result, citizens are happy, and this happiness translates to more trust and faith in the government party. Government officials thus have a higher chance of reelection.

It is clear that the businesses have the most influence in this chain effect. If a business fails, jobs are lost, citizens are unhappy, and the government party loses trust and their chance of reelection. One example of this was President Bush’s plummeting popularity and resulting defeat by Bill Clinton.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Therefore, it would make sense for government officials to reach out to these executives and provide valuable resources to benefit both parties. Power is shifted from government officials to business executives, because these executives have the ability to influence government officials to meet their demands. As a result, a large category of decisions is turned over to businessmen, and taken off the agenda of government. In a way, business managers become the public officials they represent.

This privilege of power is unique to corporations only. If workers want reform on unfair working conditions or pay, they must form a worker’s union. However, a worker’s union has considerably less influence than a corporation. As opposed to workers’ unions, businesses exercise more control on governmental policy making because workers are expendable – workers need money more urgently than society needs their services, so a business can operate for a lot longer than workers can afford to stay off the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privileged position of science ==

Without the knowledge of scientists and technologists, there would be no possibility of producing new technology and progress in a positive manner. Those who have these types of  knowledge and abilities are essentially the "seed" of technological innovation. They have the following three privileges:

*Knowledge
*Learning and teaching of new knowledge 
*Political implications of innovation

Based on previous scientific knowledge, one or several are able to use it and/or build on it to innovate. Kleinman and Vallas, point out that scientists control the modification, mediation and contest of emerging knowledge.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with this knowledge can also teach future generations the same to keep this process moving forward. Woodhouse that states that engineers are among the top professionals that promote the new innovations without consequences.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|1997|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the foundation of the privileged position of science, that only a select have scientific and/or technological knowledge and capable of substantial feats, good or bad. Engineers and scientists have the powerful position of being able to choose the path of innovation for emerging technology. Technologists and scientists hold a privileged position additionally in that their innovations often have political implications. Woodhouse makes the comparison of innovation to legislative acts, stating that they both establish a framework that will follow for many generations.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"/&gt;

== Relationships between privileged positions of business and science ==

Business and science are part of an important societal circle specifically relating to the production and implementation of technology. In simple terms, scientists and technologists design and create, while businesses provide the means to create, produce and implement. As Woodhouse claims, it would be a mistake to overlook business executives' and elected officials' dependence on the technologists because innovation is so highly regarded.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"/&gt;

Businesses that rely on scientists and technologists cannot function without them, but have authority over them. Woodhouse claims that the one reason green technology has not emerged faster and stronger is because the brown chemistry formula fulfilled many of the needs of scientists and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, since brown chemistry was innovated over less toxic and recyclable green technologies, it is shown that business has more authority over that of technologists and scientists. Woodhouse points out that there has been considerable delay on a promising area of green chemistry: supercritical fluids. The opinions range from targeting the culprit as the complexity of the equipment, to maintenance difficulties, to the equipment costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the interconnection of business and science, and how technology can be slowed by technology and/or business (and vice versa). Woodhouse also states that twentieth-century chemists, chemical engineers, and chemical industry executives made central decisions which considerably modeled society's experiences with chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical industry, which includes scientists, technologists, and businessmen, uniquely controls what happens or what can happen to large number of people who are exposed to chemicals.

Business and science are considered of utmost importance in current developed countries. However, one working without the other has the potential to cause major issues. Woodhouse points out what the vice president of Shaw Carpets explained at a congressional hearing: that the V.P. is the person whose job it is to tell the chemists and chemical engineers that it is possible to produce carpets using "green" processes, because the students had not learned this from their respective university curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be many positive outcomes of the unison operation of business and science, and it is vital that this does occur in order to prevent major problems and unintended consequences.

'''Public humanities''' is the work of engaging diverse publics in reflecting on heritage, traditions, and history, and the relevance of the [[humanities]] to the current conditions of civic and cultural life. Public humanities is often practiced within federal, state, [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] and community-based cultural organizations that engage people in conversations, facilitate and present lectures, exhibitions, performances and other programs for the general public on topics such as history, philosophy, popular culture and the arts. 

Workers within the public humanities endeavor to create physical and virtual spaces where the public can engage in conversation, learning and reflection about issues and ideas.  Public humanities projects include exhibitions and programming related to historic preservation, oral history, archives, material culture, public art, cultural heritage, and cultural policy. The [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] notes that public humanities projects it has supported in the past include "interpretation at historic sites, television and radio productions, museum exhibitions, podcasts, short videos, digital games, websites, mobile apps, and other digital media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/divisions/public|title=Division of Public Programs|website=National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many practitioners of public humanities are invested in ensuring the [[accessibility]] and relevance of the humanities to the general public or [[community group]]s.

The American Council of Learned Societies' National Task Force on Scholarship and the Public Humanities suggests that the nature of public humanities work is to teach the public the findings of academic scholarship: it sees "scholarship and the public humanities not as two distinct spheres but as parts of a single process, the process of taking private insight, testing it, and turning it into public knowledge."&lt;ref name="Quay1989" /&gt; Others suggest a more balanced understanding of the ways in which history, heritage and culture are shared between the academy and the public, drawing on the notion of [[shared historical authority]].

Subfields of the public humanities include [[public history]], [[public sociology]], [[public folklore]], [[public anthropology]], [[public philosophy]], [[historic preservation]], [[museum studies]], [[museum education]], [[cultural heritage management]], [[community archaeology]], [[public art]], and [[public science]].

== Programs in Public Humanities ==
Several universities have established programs in the public humanities (or have otherwise expressed commitments to public humanities via the creation of centers, degrees, or certificate programs with investments in various forms of "public" work), including:

[[Image:Carlofelice.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Teatro Carlo Felice]], designed by [[Aldo Rossi]], who is considered the founder of neo-rationalism]]
In architecture, '''rationalism''' is an architectural current which mostly developed from Italy in the 1920s-1930s. [[Vitruvius]] had claimed in his work ''[[De Architectura]]'' that architecture is a science that can be comprehended rationally. This formulation was taken up and further developed in the architectural treatises of the [[Renaissance]]. Progressive art theory of the 18th-century opposed the [[Baroque]] use of [[illusionism]] with the classic beauty of truth and reason.

Twentieth-century rationalism derived less from a special, unified theoretical work than from a common belief that the most varied problems posed by the real world could be resolved by reason. In that respect it represented a reaction to [[historicism (art)|historicism]] and a contrast to [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Expressionism]].

==Enlightenment rationalism==

The name rationalism is retroactively applied to a movement in [[architecture]] that came about during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (more specifically, [[neoclassicism]]), arguing that architecture's intellectual base is primarily in science as opposed to reverence for and emulation of archaic traditions and beliefs. Rational architects, following the philosophy of [[René Descartes]] emphasized geometric forms and ideal proportions.&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Broadbent |first1=Geoffrey |title=Emerging Concepts in Urban Space Design |year=1990 |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold (International) |location=London |isbn=9780747600251}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81–84}}

The French Louis XVI style (better known as [[Neoclassicism]]) emerged in the mid-18th century with its roots in the waning interest of the Baroque period. The architectural notions of the time gravitated more and more to the belief that reason and natural forms are tied closely together, and that the rationality of science should serve as the basis for where structural members should be placed. Towards the end of the 18th century, [[Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand]], a teacher at the influential École Polytechnique in Paris at the time, argued that architecture in its entirety was based in science.

Other architectural theorists of the period who advanced rationalist ideas include Abbé [[Jean-Louis de Cordemoy]] (1631–1713),&lt;ref name="A History"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kostof |first1=Spiro |title=A History of Architecture: Settings and Rituals |year=1985 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780195034721}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|559}}&lt;ref name="Emergence 2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lefaivre |first1=Liane |last2=Tzonis |first2=Alexander |title=The Emergence of Modern Architecture: A Documentary History from 1000 to 1810 |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780415260244}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|265}} the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Carlo Lodoli]] (1690–1761),&lt;ref name="A History"/&gt;{{rp|560}} Abbé [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]] (1713–1769) and [[Quatremère de Quincy]] (1755–1849).&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"/&gt;{{rp|87–92}}

==Structural rationalism==
The term structural rationalism most often refers to a 19th-century French movement, usually associated with the theorists [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] and [[Auguste Choisy]]. 
Viollet-le-Duc rejected the concept of an ideal architecture and instead saw architecture as a rational construction approach defined by the materials and purpose of the structure.
The architect [[Eugène Train]] was one of the most important practitioners of this school, particularly with his educational buildings such as the [[Collège Chaptal]] and [[Lycée Voltaire (Paris)|Lycée Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The École Nationale des Arts Décoratifs in Paris Adapts to Meet the Twentieth Century |last1=Froissart-Pezone|first1=Rossella|last2=Wittman|first2=Richard|journal=Studies in the Decorative Arts |volume=7 |issue=1 |date=1999–2000|page=30

==Early 20th-century rationalism==
 [[Image:Como, ex casa del fascio 04.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The former Casa del Fascio in [[Como, Italy]], designed by [[Giuseppe Terragni]].]]

Architects such as [[Henri Labrouste]] and [[Auguste Perret]] incorporated the virtues of structural rationalism throughout the 19th century in their buildings. By the early 20th century, architects such as [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]] were exploring the idea that structure itself could create space without the need for decoration. This gave rise to [[modernism]], which further explored this concept. More specifically, the Soviet Modernist group [[ASNOVA]] were known as 'the Rationalists'.

Rational Architecture (Italian: ''Architettura razionale'') thrived in Italy from the 1920s to the 1940s. In 1926, a group of young architects – [[Sebastiano Larco]], [[Guido Frette]], [[Carlo Enrico Rava]], [[Adalberto Libera]], [[Luigi Figini]], [[Gino Pollini]], and [[Giuseppe Terragni]] (1904–43) founded the so-called [[Gruppo 7]], publishing their manifesto in the magazine ''Rassegna Italiana''. Their declared intent was to strike a middle ground between the classicism of the ''[[Novecento Italiano]]'' movement and the industrially inspired architecture of [[Futurism]].&lt;ref name="Modern Architecture"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frampton |first=Kenneth |year=2007 |title=Modern Architecture: A Critical History |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=New York |isbn=9780500203958}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|203}} Their "note" declared:

{{quote|The hallmark of the earlier avant garde was a contrived impetus and a vain, destructive fury, mingling good and bad elements: the hallmark of today's youth is a desire for lucidity and wisdom...This must be clear...we do not intend to break with tradition...The new architecture, the true architecture, should be the result of a close association between logic and rationality.&lt;ref name="Modern Architecture"/&gt;{{rp|203}}}}
[[Image:Palazzo_Gualino_in_Turin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Palazzo Gualino, under renovation, in [[Turin, Italy]] ]]
One of the first rationalist buildings was the [[Palazzo Gualino]] in [[Turin]], built for the financier [[Riccardo Gualino]] by the architects [[Gino Levi-Montalcini]] and [[Giuseppe Pagano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museotorino.it/view/s/9286e70e9b4c47c9828e92515148173e |title=Palazzo Gualino |publisher=MuseoTorino |accessdate=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gruppo 7 mounted three exhibitions between 1926 and 1931, and the movement constituted itself as an official body, the Movimento Italiano per l'Architettura Razionale (MIAR), in 1930. Exemplary works include Giuseppe Terragni's [[Casa del Fascio (Como)|Casa del Fascio]] in [[Como]] (1932–36), The Medaglia d'Oro room at the Italian Aeronautical Show in Milan (1934) by Pagano and [[Marcello Nizzoli]], and the Fascist Trades Union Building in [[Como]] (1938–43), designed by Cesare Cattaneo, Pietro Lingeri, Augusto Magnani, L. Origoni, and Mario Terragni.&lt;ref name="Modern Architecture"/&gt;{{rp|205–9}}

Pagano became editor of ''[[Casabella]]'' in 1933 together with Edoardo Persico. Pagano and Persico featured the work of the rationalists in the magazine, and its editorials urged the Italian state to adopt rationalism as its official style. The Rationalists enjoyed some official commissions from the Fascist government of Benito Mussolini, but the state tended to favor the more classically inspired work of the National Union of Architects. Architects associated with the movement collaborated on large official projects of the Mussolini regime, including the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] (begun in 1932) and the [[Esposizione Universale Roma]] (EUR) in the southern part of [[Rome]] (begun in 1936). The EUR features monumental buildings, many of which evocative of ancient Roman architecture, but absent ornament, revealing strong geometric forms.&lt;ref name="Modern Architecture"/&gt;{{rp|204–7}}

==Neo-rationalism==
In the late 1960s, a new rationalist movement emerged in architecture, claiming inspiration from both the Enlightenment and early-20th-century rationalists. Like the earlier rationalists, the movement, known as the Tendenza, was centered in Italy. Practitioners include [[Carlo Aymonino]] (1926–2010), [[Aldo Rossi]] (1931–97), and [[Giorgio Grassi]]. The Italian design magazine ''Casabella'' featured the work of these architects and theorists. The work of architectural historian [[Manfredo Tafuri]] influenced the movement, and the [[University Iuav of Venice]] emerged as a center of the Tendenza after Tafuri became chair of Architecture History in 1968.&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"/&gt;{{rp|157 et seq.}} A Tendenza exhibition was organized for the 1973 [[Milan Triennale]].&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"/&gt;{{rp|178–183}}

Rossi's book ''L'architettura della città'', published in 1966, and translated into English as ''The Architecture of the City'' in 1982, explored several of the ideas that inform Neo-rationalism. In seeking to develop an understanding of the city beyond simple functionalism, Rossi revives the idea of [[typology (urban planning and architecture)|typology]], following from Quatremère de Quincy, as a method for understanding buildings, as well as the larger city. He also writes of the importance of monuments as expressions of the collective memory of the city, and the idea of place as an expression of both physical reality and history.&lt;ref name="Emerging Concepts"/&gt;{{rp|166–72}}&lt;ref name="Post-Modernism"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jencks |first1=Charles |title=Post-Modernism: The New Classicism in Art and Architecture |year=1987 |publisher=Rizzoli |location=New York |isbn=9780847808359}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|178–80}}

Architects such as [[Leon Krier]], [[Maurice Culot]], and [[Demetri Porphyrios]] took Rossi's ideas to their logical conclusion with a revival of Classical Architecture and Traditional Urbanism.  Krier's witty critique of Modernism, often in the form of cartoons, and Porphyrios's well crafted philosophical arguments, such as "Classicism is not a Style", won over a small but talented group of architects to the classical point of view.  Organizations such as the Traditional Architecture Group at the [[RIBA]], and the [[Institute of Classical Architecture]] attest to their growing number, but mask the Rationalist origins.

In Germany, [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]] became the leading practitioner of German rationalism from the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="Post-Modernism"/&gt;{{rp|178–80}} Ungers influenced a younger generation of German architects, including [[Hans Kollhoff]], [[Max Dudler]], and [[Christoph Mäckler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Durth |first1=Werner |last2=May |first2=Roland |title=Schinkel's Order: Rationalist Tendencies in German Architecture |journal=Architectural Design |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=London |date=September 2007 |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=44–49 |doi=10.1002/ad.514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28927">The relationship between the level of '''religiosity''' and the level of '''education''' has been studied since the second half of the 20th century.

The parameters of the two components diverse: the "level of [[religiosity]]" remains a concept which is difficult to differentiate [[Scientifically based research|scientifically]], while the "[[International Standard Classification of Education|level of education]]" is easier to compile, such as [[Educational measurement|official data]] on this topic, because data on education is publicly accessible in many countries.

Different studies show contrasted conclusions regarding any link between the two concepts, depending on whether "religiosity" is measured by religious practices (attendance at places of worship, for example) or specific religious beliefs (belief in miracles, for example), with notable differences between nations. For example, an international study states that in some Western nations the intensity of beliefs decreases with education, but attendance and religious practice increases.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser" /&gt; Other studies indicate that the religious have higher education than the non-religious.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals" /&gt; Other studies find that the positive correlation with low or non religiosity and education has been reversed in the past few decades.&lt;ref name="Voas Brit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith Souls" /&gt;

In terms of university professors, one study concluded that in the US, the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities, were religious.&lt;ref name=gross2009 /&gt;

==Studies==

===Global studies===

A [[Pew Center]] study about religion and education around the world in 2016, found that [[Jews]] are most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 13.4 years of schooling;&lt;ref name="Pew2016"&gt;{{cite web |date=December 19, 2011 |title=Religion and Education Around the World |url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/12/21094148/Religion-Education-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jews]] also have the highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita (61%).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; Based on the study data, [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] have the lowest average levels of education, with an average of 5.6 years of schooling for both.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; About 36% of the world Muslim population and 41% of the world Hindu population have no formal schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] have the lowest average levels of higher education than any other major religious group, with only 8% and 10% respectively have [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

[[Christians]] ranked as the second most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 9.3 years of schooling.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Christians]] were found to have the second highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita while in absolute numbers ranked in the first place (220 million).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the study, Christians in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]] regions are highly educated since many of the world universities were built by the historic [[Christian denominations|Christian churches]],&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; in addition to the historical evidence that "Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic".&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of [[gender equality]] in educational attainment,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and the study suggests that one of the reasons is the encouragement of the [[Protestant Reformers]] in promoting the [[education of women]], which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

The [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]]—which includes [[atheists]], [[agnostics]] and those who describe their religion as “nothing in particular”—ranked as the third most educated religious group with an average of 8.8 years of schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and around 16% of unaffiliated have graduate and post-graduate degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

[[Buddhists]] have an average of 7.9 years of schooling, and around 12% of Buddhists have graduate and post-graduate degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study "there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]" as [[Muslim]] adults in this region are far less educated than their [[Christian]] counterparts,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the [[Christian school|educational facilities]] that were created by [[Christian missionaries]] during the colonial era for fellow believers.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

According to a 2015 global survey by [[WIN/GIA|Gallup International]], the most religious had lower levels of education, however, religious people in general were a majority in all educational levels.&lt;ref name=GallupInt2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Losing our Religion?

In one analysis of [[World Values Survey]] data by Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote noted that in 65 former socialist countries there is a negative relationship between years of education and belief in God, with similar negative correlations for other religious beliefs while, in contrast, there were strong positive correlations between years of education and belief in God in many developed countries such as England, France and the US.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser" /&gt; They concluded that "these cross-country differences in the education-belief relationship can be explained by political factors (such as communism) which lead some countries to use state controlled education to discredit religion". The study also concludes that, in the United States and other developed nations, "education raises religious attendance at individual level," while "at the same time, there is a strong negative connection between attendance and education across religious groups within the U.S. and elsewhere." The authors suggest that "this puzzle is explained if education both increases the returns to social connection and reduces the extent of religious belief," causing more educated individuals to sort into less fervent denominations.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/glaeser/files/w8080.pdf |title= Education and Religion |last1= Sacerdote |first1= Bruce |last2= Glaeser|first2= Edward L.|work= |publisher= National Bureau of Economic Research|page=29|date=January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
===Britain===

Research in nonreligion in Britain has shown that the positive relationship between education and non-religion has been reversed with generations after 1955. In other words, the nonreligious populations tend to have less education and religious populations tend to have higher education, even though religious affiliation has decreased for both.&lt;ref name="Voas Brit"&gt;{{cite book|last1=David Voas and Siobhan McAndrew|editor1-last=Arweck|editor1-first=Elisabeth|editor2-last=Bullivant|editor2-first=Stephen|editor3-last=Lee|editor3-first=Lois|title=Secularity and Non-religion|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415710442|chapter=Three Puzzles of Non-religion in Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===India===

A survey conducted by the ''Times of India'' revealed that 22% of [[IIT Bombay]] graduates do not believe in the existence of God, while another 30% do not know.&lt;ref name=toi2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Less than half of passing IIT batch believes in God’s existence|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Less-than-half-of-passing-IIT-batch-believes-in-Gods-existence/articleshow/46938504.cms|publisher= Times Of India|accessdate=29 September 2015}}

===Spain===

In 1980, a study was conducted in Spain that showed that many educated people were Catholic.&lt;ref name= "congress"&gt;{{cite web|last=Scofield|first=James|title=Spain: Religion|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+es0062)|work=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

According to the General Social Survey, which has collected data on Americans since 1972, people who are educated often are more religious by various measures. For instance, as of 2010 sociologist Philip Schwadel found that, with each additional year of education, the likelihood of attending religious services increased 15%, the likelihood of reading the Bible at least occasionally increased by 9%. The likelihood of switching to a mainline Protestant denomination increased by 13%.&lt;ref name="CNN GSS"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kavanagh|first1=Jim|title=Study: More educated tend to be more religious, by some measures|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/11/study-more-educated-tend-to-be-more-religious-by-some-measures/|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwadel said, “With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God...But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’”&lt;ref name="CNN GSS" /&gt;

Sociologist Bradley Wright reviewed results from the 2008 Pew US Religious Landscape Survey and noted that religious groups normally have significant levels of education compared to those who are non-religious. "The irony" he states "is that some of the religiously unaffiliated explain their rejection of religion in terms of superior learning, but several religious groups have much higher levels of education."

He found that [[Hindus]], [[Jews]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf|title=US Religious Landscape Survey: Diverse and Dynamic|format=PDF|publisher=The Pew Forum|page=85|publication-date=February 2008|accessdate=2012-09-17|ref=refEducationLevel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/faith-education-and-income/|title=Faith, Education and Income|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 13, 2011|first=David|last=Leonhardt|date=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]], [[Buddhists]], and [[Orthodox Christians]]&lt;ref name="Faith, Education and Income"&gt;[https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/faith-education-and-income/?_r=1 Faith, Education and Income]&lt;/ref&gt; have the highest levels of education. [[Catholics]], [[Mormons]], and [[Muslims]] are at about the national average.. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have by far the lowest education. Evangelicals are somewhat below the national average. The religiously unaffiliated are just slightly above average in levels of college education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Bradley R.E.|title=Christians are hate-filled hypocrites-- and other lies you've been told : a sociologist shatters myths from the secular and christian media|year=2010|publisher=Bethany House|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|isbn=9780764207464|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociological research by Patricia Snell and Christian Smith on many dimensions of general American youth have noted that older research on baby boomers showed correlations where higher education undermined religiosity, however, studies on today's youth have consistently shown that this has disappeared and now students in college are more likely religious than people who do not go to college.&lt;ref name="Smith Souls"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=Souls in Transition: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of Emerging adults|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195371796|pages=248–251|author2=Patricia Snell |quote=However, something very interesting emerged when scholars took a second look at the question more recently. They found that the religiously undermining effect of higher education on recent generation of youth disappeared. Most of the older research was conducted on baby boomers for whom college did indeed corrode religious faith and practice. But many studies more recently have shown that conventional wisdom about baby boomers does not apply to today's youth. Higher education no longer seem to diminish religion in emerging adults." "In every case, emerging adults are slightly more religious than those who are not in college, although only the differences in overall religiousness and service attendance are statistically significant. In short, if anything, it is ''not'' attending college that is associated with lower levels of religious practice, though those differences are slight.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]'s 2002 Index of Leading Religious Indicators for the US, the relationship between education and religiosity are complex. For instance, there are slight differences in belief in God and membership in a congregation: 88% of those with postgraduate degrees believe in God or a universal spirit, compared to 97% of those with a high school education or less; 70% of postgraduate degree holders say they are members of a congregation, compared to 64% of those with a high school education or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winseman|first1=Albert L.|title=Does More Educated Really = Less Religious?|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/7729/does-more-educated-really-less-religious.aspx|website=Gallup Poll|date=February 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by Barry Kosmin indicates that Americans with post-graduate education have a similar religious distribution and affiliation to the general population, with a higher "public religiosity" (i.e., membership in congregations and worship attendance), but slightly less "belief." Advanced education in U.S. does not seem to produce much religious skepticism since so many post-graduates are religious believers.&lt;ref name="Post ARIS 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kosmin|first=Barry|title=Religion and the Intelligentsia: Post-graduate Educated Americans 1990-2008|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/publications/religion-and-the-intelligentsia-post-graduate-educated-americans-1990-2008/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by Barry Kosmin and Ariela Keysar on college students looked at three worldviews — Religious, Secular, and Spiritual — and looked students from levels from freshmen to post-graduates from majors such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), Social and Behavioral Sciences, Arts and Humanities, and Undecided. The Religious were 31.8% of the total sample (40% from STEM, 27% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 27% from Arts and Humanities, and 5% from Undecided); the Secular were 28.2% of the total sample (38% from STEM, 29% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 30% from Arts and Humanities, and 3% from Undecided); the Spiritual were 32.4% of the total sample (29% from STEM, 36% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 31% from Arts and Humanities, and 4% from Undecided).&lt;ref name="Kosmin keysar College"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kosmin|first1=Barry|last2=Keysar|first2=Ariela|title=Religious, Spiritual and Secular: The emergence of three distinct worldviews among American college students|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/centers/isssc/Documents/ARIS_2013_College%20Students_Sept_25_final_draft.pdf|publisher=Trinity College|pages=8–9|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Neil Gross and Solon Simmons done on more than 1,400 professors from 20 disciplinary fields and religiosity found that the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities were religious believers. As a whole, university professors were less religious than the general US population, but it is hardly the case that the professorial landscape is characterized by an absence of religion. In the study, 9.8% were atheists, 13.1% were agnostic, 19.2% believe in a higher power, 4.3% believe in God some of the time, 16.6% had doubts but believed in God, 34.9% believed in God and had no doubts. At "elite" doctoral universities 36.5% were either atheists or agnostics and 20.4% believed in God without any doubts. Furthermore the authors noted, "religious skepticism represents a minority position, even among professors teaching at elite research universities."&lt;ref name=gross2009&gt;Neil Gross and Solon Simmons (2009).

However, both groups were still a minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Neil|title=How Religious are America’s College and University Professors?|url=http://religion.ssrc.org/reforum/Gross_Simmons.pdf|publisher=SSRC|author2=Solon Simmons |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study noted positive correlations, among nonreligious Americans, between levels of education and not believing in a deity.&lt;ref name="Zuckerman"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Phil | last1=Zuckerman | year=2009 | title=Atheism, Secularity, and Well-Being: How the Findings of Social Science Counter Negative Stereotypes and Assumptions | url=http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/Zuckerman_on_Atheism.pdf | journal=Sociology Compass | volume=3 | issue=6 | pages=949–971 | doi=10.1111/j.1751-9020.2009.00247.x | ref=harv | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228104545/http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/Zuckerman_on_Atheism.pdf | archivedate=2014-12-28 | df= }}

[[Frank Sulloway]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Michael Shermer]] of the [[California State University]] conducted a study that found in their polling sample of "credentialed" U.S. adults (12% had Ph.Ds and 62% were college graduates) 64% believed in God, and there was a [[correlation]] indicating that religious conviction diminished with education level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox said that people with less education have decreased in religiosity in America. Their views on family and work have been associated with this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler|first=Daniel|title=Less-educated Americans turning their backs on religion|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-08/asa-lea081511.php|work=American Sociological Association|publisher=Eureka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on secularity has noted that, in America, agnostics have significant levels of education, while atheists have relatively low levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Barry A. Kosmin and Ariela Keysar. ''Secularism &amp; Secularity: Contemporary International Perspectives''. Hartford, CT: Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC), 2007. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Christian Smith has done research on American evangelicals and has found that, on average, self-identified evangelicals have more years of education than fundamentalists, liberals, Roman Catholics, and the nonreligious, but slightly less than [[mainline Protestant]]s.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving|year=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226764192|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also found that evangelicals were the least likely to have high school education or less, the nonreligious were the most likely to have high school education or less, and higher proportions of evangelicals had studied at the graduate level than fundamentalists, liberals, and the nonreligious.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals" /&gt;

Sociologist Philip Schwadel found that higher levels of education "positively affects religious participation, devotional activities, and emphasizing the importance of religion in daily life", education is not correlated with disbelief in God, and correlates with greater tolerance for atheists' public opposition to religion and greater skepticism of "exclusivist religious viewpoints and biblical literalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Effects of Education on Americans’ Religious Practices, Beliefs, and Affiliations|last=Schwadel|first=Philip|year=2011|journal=Review of Religious Research|volume=53|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s13644-011-0007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: More educated tend to be more religious, by some measures|author=Jim Kavanagh|date=11 August 2011|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/11/study-more-educated-tend-to-be-more-religious-by-some-measures/|quote=With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God,’” he said. “But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cross-national sociological research by Norris and Inglehart notes a positive correlation between religious attendance among the more educated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Pippa|title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-64837-1|edition=2nd|author2=Ronald Inglehart |pages=267–268|quote= The effects of income become insignificant, however, the impact of education actually reverses in the United States: ''it is the more educated who attend church most frequently.'' It therefore appears that the typical socioeconomic profile of churchgoing is indeed somewhat distinctive in the United States when compared with other wealthy countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Pew Center]] study there is correlation between education and income: about 77% of American [[Hindus]] have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree, followed by [[Unitarian Universalists]] (67%), [[Jews]] (59%), [[Anglican]] (59%), [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] (56%) and [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]] (47%) and [[United Church of Christ]] (46%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/04/the-most-and-least-educated-u-s-religious-groups/|title=The most and least educated U.S. religious group|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cording to the same study about (43%) of American [[atheists]], and (42%) [[agnostics]], and (24%) of those who say their religion is “nothing in particular” have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree.

==In specific religious denominations==

===Mormons===
Studies of [[Mormons]] in the US show that Mormons with higher education attend church more regularly than less-educated Mormons. Survey research indicated that 41% of Mormons with only elementary school education attend church regularly, compared to 76% of Mormon college graduates and 78% of Mormons who went beyond their college degrees to do graduate study attending [[Church service|church]] regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Stan L. Albrecht, "The Consequential Dimension of Mormon Religiosity" Latter-Day Saint Social Life, Social Research on the LDS Church and its Members (Provo, Utah: BYU [[Religious Studies Center]], 1998), 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evangelical groups===
Edward Dutton studied findings that indicate that universities that are particularly transitional and prestigious tend to have (in contrast to less transitional universities), tightly differentiated and ‘fundamentalist’ student evangelical groups and higher levels of conversion while at university. He argued that Oxford University students are likely to be not just more intelligent in IQ terms than comparable students but more creative, more original in their thinking and more able to acquire knowledge —  factors Dutton found made religious experience more likely in an individual.&lt;ref name=dutton&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutton|first=Edward|title=Why does Jesus go to Oxford University? Conversion Experience, Creativity and Intelligence|url=http://www.jirrs.org/jirrs_nr_6/3-jirrs6-dutton.pdf|publisher=Journal for Interdisciplinary Research on Religion and Science|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1975, Norman Poythress studied a sample of 234 US college undergraduates, grouping them into relatively homogeneous religious types based on the similarity of their religious beliefs and compared their personality characteristics. He found that "Literally-oriented religious Believers did not differ significantly from Mythologically-oriented Believers on measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, or racial prejudice. Religious Believers as a group were found to be significantly less intelligent and more authoritarian than religious Skeptics." He used [[SAT]] scores as a measure of intelligence for this study.&lt;ref&gt;

===Christian fundamentalists===
Contrary to the researchers' expectations, fundamentalist 'converts' were not less educated people. However, a weak 'negative correlation' between education and [[Christian fundamentalism]] was found by Burton et al. (1989),&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Burton; Stephen Johnson; Joseph Tamney, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3511296 Education and Fundamentalism], ''Review of Religious Research'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; a study comparing the religious beliefs and educational achievements of white, [[Protestant]] residents of [[Delaware County, Indiana]].

{{Semiotics}}
'''Semiosphere''' is the sphere of [[semiosis]] in which [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] processes operate in the set of all interconnected [[Umwelt]]en. The concept was coined by [[Yuri Lotman]] in 1984 and is now applied to many fields, including cultural semiotics generally, [[biosemiotics]], zoosemiotics, geosemiotics, etc. The concept is treated more fully in the collection of Lotman's writings published in English under the title "Universe of the Mind: A Semiotic Theory of Culture"(1990)

==Discussion==
Juri Lotman, a semiotician at [[Tartu University]], Estonia, was inspired by [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]'s terms [[biosphere]] and [[noosphere]] to propose that a semiosphere comes into being when any two [[Umwelt]]en are communicating.{{huh|date=June 2017}} Later, [[Jesper Hoffmeyer]] suggested a variation to the effect that the [[community]] of [[organism]]s occupying the semiosphere will inhabit a "semiotic [[ecological niche|niche]]". This implies that the semiosphere may be partially independent of the Umwelten. [[Kalevi Kull]] argues that this suggestion is not consistent with the nature of semiosis which can only be a product of the behaviour of the organisms in the environment. It is the organisms that create the signs which become the constituent parts of the semiosphere. This is not an adaptation to the existing environment, but the continuous creation of a new environment. Kull believes that it is only possible to accept Hoffmeyer's view as an analogy to the concept of an ecological niche as it is traditionally used in [[biology]], so that the community develops according to the semiotic understanding of the processes which are responsible for the building of Umwelt.

'''Sexual repression''' is a state in which a person is prevented from expressing their own [[human sexuality|sexuality]]. Sexual repression is often associated with feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] or [[shame]], being associated with sexual impulses.&lt;ref&gt;Karen A. McClintock, ''Sexual Shame: An Urgent Call to Healing'', Fortress Press, Minneapolis, MN. ({{ISBN|0800632389}}) (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; What constitutes sexual repression is subjective and can vary greatly between cultures and moral systems. Many [[Religion and sexuality|religions]]{{which|date=November 2018}} have been accused of fostering sexual repression{{cn|date=November 2018}}.

Some ideologies{{which|date=November 2018}} seek to repress certain forms of sexual expression, such as [[homosexuality]]{{cn|date=November 2018}}, and some cultures{{which|date=November 2018}} even use [[violence|violent practices]] such as [[genital modification and mutilation]], [[honor killings]], or [[stoning]], in an attempt to regulate [[Human sexual activity|human sexual behavior]].

==History==
[[Sigmund Freud]] was the first to use the term widely, and argued that it was one of the roots of many problems in [[Western world|Western society]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilf Hey. [http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=597 "Sigmund Freud: Psychoanalysis and Sexual Repression"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518033909/http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=597 |date=2008-05-18 }}, vision.org&lt;/ref&gt; Freud believed that people's naturally strong instincts toward sexuality were repressed by people in order to meet the constraints imposed on them by civilized life. However, Freud's ideas about sexual repression have not been without their critics. According to sex therapist Bernard Apfelbaum, Freud did not base his belief in universal innate, natural sexuality on the strength of sexual desire he saw in people, but rather on its weakness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bapfelbaumphd.com/Sexual_Reality.html B. Apfelbaum.

==Female genital mutilation==
[[File:Fgm_map.gif|200px|thumb|Prevalence of FGM in Africa]]
{{Main|Female genital mutilation}}
Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting or female circumcision, "comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons".&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
The practice is concentrated in 27 countries in Africa as well as Iraqi Kurdistan, Yemen and Indonesia; and more than 125 million girls and women today are estimated to have been subjected to FGM.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

FGM does not have any health benefits, and has serious negative effects on health; including complications during [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

FGM is used as a way of controlling [[female sexuality]]; the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) states:&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

{{quote|FGM is often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, linking procedures to premarital [[virginity]] and marital fidelity. FGM is in many communities believed to reduce a woman's libido and therefore believed to help her resist "illicit" sexual acts.}}

FGM is condemned by international human rights instruments. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits FGM (Article 38).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168008482e&lt;/ref&gt; FGM is also considered a form a [[violence against women]] by the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] which was adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1993; according to which: ''Article Two: Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including [...] '''female genital mutilation''' [...]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male circumcision==
{{Main|Circumcision}}
[[File:Global Map of Male Circumcision Prevalence by Country.svg|thumb|300px|Male circumcision [[prevalence]] by country according to a World Health Organization's 2007 review.&lt;ref name=WHO_2007_GTDPSA&gt;{{cite web |title=Male circumcision: Global trends and determinants of prevalence, safety and acceptability |year=2007 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Male circumcision has been practiced as a surgical means of sexual repression in some cultures, although it may be practiced for various reasons, with the World Health Organization recommending it as a means of reducing [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Circumcision is also a religious tradition in Judaism and Islam. According to medieval Jewish theologian Moses Maimonides, the "reason" for male circumcision is "the wish to bring about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ in question, so that this activity be diminished and the organ be in as quiet a state as possible."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cirp.org/library/cultural/maimonides/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late-nineteenth century, circumcision of the penis was prescribed by John Harvey Kellogg as a "cure" for masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19924/19924-h/19924-h.htm#chapi133&lt;/ref&gt; William Acton, a leading authority on sexuality in mid-Victorian Britain, advocated male circumcision in order to prevent "undue excitement of the sexual desires … which it is our object to repress."&lt;ref&gt;Willliam Acton. The Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive Organs in Childhood, Youth, Adult Age, and Advanced Life, Considered in their Physiological, Social, and Moral Relations. Third Edition. London: Churchill, 1862, pp. 5–6. https://books.google.com.au/books?id=cVX7PaDkzGYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

A "biocultural analysis" of male circumcision supports the hypothesis "that a practical consequence of circumcision, complementary to any religious-symbolic function, is to make a circumcised male less sexually excitable and distractible, and, hence, more amenable to his group's authority figures."&lt;ref&gt;Immerman, Ronald S. &amp; Wade C. Mackey (1997) "A biocultural analysis of circumcision." Social Biology 44: 3–4, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honor killings==
{{Main|Honor killing}}
An honor killing is the [[homicide]] of a member of a family or social group by other members, due to the perpetrators' belief that the victim has brought shame or dishonor upon the family or community, usually for reasons such as refusing to enter an [[arranged marriage]], being in a relationship that is disapproved by their relatives, having [[sex outside marriage]], becoming the victim of [[rape]], dressing in ways which are deemed inappropriate, or engaging in [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] relations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honor%20killing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/honor+killing?s=t&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/13/world/europe/turkey-gay-killing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/02/23/arizona.iraqi.father/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to a UN Expert Group Meeting on good practices in legislation to address harmful practices against women:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw_legislation_2009/Expert%20Paper%20EGMGPLHP%20_Sherifa%20Zuhur%20-%20II_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|They [honor killings] stem from the deeply-rooted social belief that male family members (in some cases, mothers and other women are involved in planning or carrying out honor crimes) should control the sexuality of or protect the reputation of women in the family, and that they may contain their movements or kill them for blemishing family honor, even when rumors or false gossip are the reason for public suspicion.}}

==Same-sex sexual activity==
{{Further|Sodomy law}}
Various cultures attempt to repress homosexual sexual expression. As of 2014, same-sex sexual acts are punishable by prison in 70 countries, and in five other countries and in parts of two others, homosexuality is punishable with the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-25927595&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from criminal prosecution, LGBT individuals may also face social stigmatization and serious violence (see [[violence against LGBT people]]).

==Studies==
Some researchers{{who|date=November 2018}} have hypothesized a relationship between sexual repression and [[rape]]. However, they have been unable to find any support for this hypothesis - whether the tremendous difficulty of measuring sexual repression is to blame, or whether the theory is simply false, is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VYj_woVgA3EC&amp;pg=PA93 Mary E. Odem, Jody Clay-Warner, ''Confronting rape and sexual assault'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1998, p. 104.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual repression is often viewed as a key issue within [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[feminist views on sexuality]] vary widely.

===Michel Foucault===
[[Michel Foucault]], in his ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', neither refutes nor confirms what he calls the "repressive hypothesis." Instead, he says sexuality has become an important topic to understand and manipulate for the purpose of nation building. Through categorization of sexuality, the idea of repression was born. While he agrees sexuality has become much more controlled, he equates it to necessity. Furthermore, it is through [[psychiatric]] and medical discourse on sexuality that it has become repressed.

Foucault argues that religious confession as well as psychiatric procedure codify confession within as a means of extracting [[truth]]. Because the mechanisms of sex were obscure, it was elusive by nature and its mechanisms escaped observation. By integrating it into the beginnings of a scientific discourse, the nineteenth century altered the scope of confession. Confession tended no longer to be concerned solely with what the subject wished to hide but with what was hidden from himself. It had to be extracted by force, since it involved something that tried to stay hidden. This relationship of truth scientifically validated the view of the confessed which could assimilate, record, and verify this obscure truth.&lt;ref name="Foucault1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michel Foucault|title=The history of sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mbc5eMjLpoC|accessdate=5 January 2013|date=14 April 1990|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-679-72469-8|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repression in various countries==
{{Incomplete section|date=May 2017}}
Many countries{{which|date=November 2018}} have developed a much more liberal attitude{{cn|date=November 2018}} towards sexuality, but in some{{which|date=November 2018}} it has become less so{{cn|date=November 2018}}:

===China===
Reproduction-based sex was urged by [[Mao Zedong]], but later politicians instituted a [[one-child policy]]. In a country where atheism is popular, the restriction cannot be ascribed to religion but to nationalist motives.&lt;ref name="Body &amp; Society"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Sexual Repression in Maoist China: Ideology, Structure and the Ownership of the Body |journal=[[Body &amp; Society]] |date=September 2005 |last=Yuehong Zhang |first=Everett |volume=11 |issue=3 |doi=10.1177/1357034X05056188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''social edition''' is a form of textual scholarship that utilizes social media like Wikimedia or blogs to create annotated editions of texts. [[Constance Crompton|Crompton]], [[Alyssa Arbuckle|Arbuckle]] and [[Ray Siemens|Siemens]] describe that "Using social media allows us to integrate a new stage into the editorial process — a stage that fills the gap between an edition’s initial planning stages and its concluding blind peer review, which capitalizes on the engaged knowledge communities inside and outside the academy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://src-online.ca/index.php/src/article/viewFile/118/268 "Understanding the Social Edition Through Iterative Implementation: The Case of the Devonshire MS (BL Add MS 17492),"] with Constance Crompton, Alyssa Arbuckle, and the Devonshire MS Editorial Group.

'''Systematic musicology''' is an [[umbrella term]], used mainly in [[Central Europe]], for several subdisciplines and paradigms of [[musicology]]. "Systematic musicology has traditionally been conceived of as an interdisciplinary science, whose aim it is to explore the foundations of music from different points of view, such as acoustics, physiology, psychology, anthro- pology, music theory, sociology, and aesthetics." &lt;ref name="schneiderleman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leman|first1=Marc|last2=Schneider|first2=Albrecht|editor1-first=Marc|editor1-last=Leman|title=Music, Gestalt, and Computing. Studies in Cognitive and Systematic Musicology|chapter=Origin and Nature of Cognitive and Systematic Musicology: An Introduction|date=1997|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=3-540-63526-2|pages=13–30|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/BFb0034102|accessdate=16 June 2017|ref=Music, Gestalt, and Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important subdisciplines today are [[music psychology]], [[sociomusicology]] (music sociology), [[philosophy of music]] (music philosophy), [[music acoustics]] (physics of music), [[cognitive neuroscience of music]], and the computer sciences of music (including [[sound and music computing]], [[music information retrieval]], and [[computing in musicology]]). These subdisciplines and paradigms tend to address questions about [[music]] in general, rather than specific manifestations of music.

In the European tripartite model of musicology, musicology is regarded as a combination of three broad subdisciplines: [[ethnomusicology]], [[music history]] (or historical musicology), and systematic musicology. Ethnomusicology and historical musicology are primarily concerned with specific manifestations of music such as performances, works, traditions, genres, and the people who produce and engage with them (musicians, composers, social groups). Systematic musicology is different in that it tends not to put these specific manifestations in the foreground, although it of course refers to them. Instead, more general questions are asked about music. These questions tend to be answered either by analysing empirical data (based on observation) or by developing theory - or better, by a combination of both. The 19th-century positivist dream of discovering "laws" of music (by analogy to "laws" in other disciplines such as physics; cf. Adler, 1885), and of defining the discipline of systematic musicology in terms of such laws, slowly evaporated. Ideological trends stemming from [[modernism]] and later [[post-structuralism]] fundamentally altered the nature of the project.

Since systematic musicology brings together several parent disciplines, it is often regarded as being intrinsically interdisciplinary&lt;ref name="current"&gt;{{cite book|editor2-first=Marc|editor2-last=Leman|editor1-first=Rolf|editor1-last=Bader|editor3-first=Rolf-Inge|editor3-last=Godoi|title=Current Research in Systematic Musicology|date=2013|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-36098-5|url=https://link.springer.com/bookseries/11684|accessdate=13 December 2017|ref=Current Research in Systematic Musicology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schneidersystem"&gt;{{cite book|editor2-first=Bram|editor2-last=Gätjen|editor1-first=Klaus Wolfgang|editor1-last=Niemöller|title=Perspektiven und Methoden einer Systemischen Musikwissenschaft|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Frankfurt am Main|isbn=978-3-63139502-8|url=https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/40101?tab=toc|accessdate=13 December 2017|ref=Perspektiven und Methoden einer Systemischen Musikwissenschaft}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or as a system of interacting subdisciplines (hence the alternative name "systemic"). However, most systematic musicologists focus on just one or a select few of the many subdisciplines. Systematic musicologists who are oriented toward the [[humanities]] often make reference to fields such as [[aesthetics]], [[philosophy]], [[semiotics]], [[hermeneutics]], [[music criticism]], [[Media studies]], [[Cultural studies]], [[gender studies]], and (theoretic) [[sociology]]. Those who are oriented toward [[science]] tend to regard their discipline as empirical and data-oriented, and to borrow their methods and ways of thinking from [[psychology]], [[acoustics]], [[psychoacoustics]], [[physiology]], [[cognitive science]], and (empirical) [[sociology]].&lt;ref name=current&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently emerged areas of research which at least partially are in the scope of systematic musicology comprise [[cognitive musicology]], [[neuromusicology]], [[biomusicology]], and [[music cognition]] including [[embodied music cognition]]. As an academic discipline, systematic musicology is closely related to practically oriented disciplines such as [[music technology]], [[music information retrieval]], and [[musical robotics]].&lt;ref name=current&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic musicology is less unified than its sister disciplines historical musicology and ethnomusicology. Its contents and methods are more diverse and tend to be more closely related to parent disciplines, both academic and practical, outside of musicology. The diversity of systematic musicology is to some extent compensated for by interdisciplinary interactions within the system of subdisciplines that make it up.

The origins of systematic musicology in Europe can be traced to ancient Greece; philosophers such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristoxenus]] asked general questions about music. Historical musicology and ethnomusicology are much younger disciplines, and the relative importance of the three has fluctuated considerably during the past few centuries. Today, musicology's three broad subdisciplines are of approximately equal size in terms of the volume of research activity.

The '''technology adoption lifecycle''' is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical [[normal distribution]] or "bell curve". The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called "[[innovators]]", followed by "[[early adopters]]". Next come the '''early majority''' and '''late majority''', and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called "Laggards" or "phobics." For example, a phobic may only use a cloud service when it is the only remaining method of performing a required task, but the phobic may not have an in-depth technical knowledge of how to use the service.

The [[demographic]] and [[psychological]] (or "[[psychographic]]") profiles of each adoption group were originally specified by the North Central Rural Sociology Committee, Subcommittee for the Study of the Diffusion of Farm Practices, by agricultural researchers Beal and Bohlen in 1957.&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
The report summarized the categories as:&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
* [[innovators]] – had larger farms, were more educated, more prosperous and more risk-oriented
* [[early adopter]]s – younger, more educated, tended to be community leaders, less prosperous
* early majority – more conservative but open to new ideas, active in community and influence to neighbours
* late majority – older, less educated, fairly conservative and less socially active
* laggards – very conservative, had small farms and capital, oldest and least educated

The model has subsequently been adapted for many areas of technology adoption in the late 20th century.

==Adaptations of the model==
The model has spawned a range of adaptations that extend the concept or apply it to specific domains of interest.

In his book ''[[Crossing the Chasm]]'', [[Geoffrey Moore]] proposes a variation of the original lifecycle. He suggests that for discontinuous innovations, which may result in a Foster disruption based on s-curve, there is a gap or chasm between the first two adopter groups (innovators/early adopters), and the vertical markets.

Disruption as it is used today are of the [[Clayton M. Christensen]] variety. These disruptions are not s-curve based. 

In [[educational technology]], Lindy McKeown has provided a similar model (a pencil metaphor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm Pencil metaphor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128192012/http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm |date=2007-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) describing the [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] uptake in education. In [[medical sociology]], Carl May has proposed [[normalization process theory]] that shows how technologies become embedded and integrated in health care and other kinds of organisation.

Wenger, White and Smith, in their book ''Digital habitats: Stewarding technology for communities'', talk of technology stewards: people with sufficient understanding of the technology available and the technological needs of a community to steward the community through the technology adoption process.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rayna and Striukova (2009) propose that the choice of initial market segment has crucial importance for crossing the chasm, as adoption in this segment can lead to a cascade of adoption in the other segments. This initial market segment has, at the same time, to contain a large proportion of visionaries, to be small enough for adoption to be observed from within the segment and from other segment and be sufficiently connected with other segments. If this is the case, the adoption in the first segment will progressively cascade into the adjacent segments, thereby triggering the adoption by the mass-market.&lt;ref&gt; Rayna, Thierry, Striukova, Ludmila and Landau, Samuel, Crossing the Chasm or Being Crossed Out: The Case of Digital Audio Players (March 7, 2009). International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation, Vol. 1, No. 3, pp. 36-54, July-September 2009. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1392691&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One way to model product adoption&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, Luis. (2008) [http://scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures/lecture04.pdf Science of the Web] lectures at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt; is to understand that people's behaviours are influenced by their peers and how widespread they think a particular action is. For many format-dependent technologies, people have a non-zero payoff for adopting the same technology as their closest friends or colleagues. If two users both adopt product A, they might get a payoff ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0; if they adopt product B, they get ''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. But if one adopts A and the other adopts B, they both get a payoff of&amp;nbsp;0.

A threshold can be set for each user to adopt a product. Say that a node v in a graph has d neighbors: then v will adopt product A if a fraction p of its neighbors is greater than or equal to some threshold. For example, if v's threshold is 2/3, and only one of its two neighbors adopts product A, then v will not adopt A. Using this model, we can deterministically model product adoption on sample networks.

==History==
The technology adoption lifecycle is a [[sociological]] model that is an extension of an earlier model called ''the diffusion process'', which was originally published in 1957 by Joe M. Bohlen, George M. Beal and [[Everett M. Rogers]] at [[Iowa State University]] and which was originally published only for its application to [[agriculture]] and [[home economics]].&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957&gt;{{cite journal

Research Bulletin 372, Agricultural Experiment Station, Ames, Iowa.&lt;/ref&gt; Their original purpose was to track the purchase patterns of hybrid seed corn by farmers.

Beal, Rogers and Bohlen together developed a model called ''the diffusion process''&lt;ref&gt;Beal, George M., Everett M. Rogers, and Joe M. Bohlen (1957) "Validity of the concept of stages in the adoption process." ''Rural Sociology'' 22(2):166–168.&lt;/ref&gt; and later, Everett Rogers generalized the use of it in his widely acclaimed book 1962 ''[[Diffusion of innovations|Diffusion of Innovations]]''&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Everett M. (1962). ''Diffusion of Innovations'', Glencoe: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (now in its fifth edition{{cn|date=November 2016}}), describing how new ideas and technologies spread in different cultures. Others have since used the model to describe how innovations spread between states in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Robert L. (1985).

'''Terribilità''', the spelling in modern Italian, or '''terribiltà''', as [[Michelangelo]]'s 16th century contemporaries tended to spell it, is a quality of provoking  terror (the literal meaning), awe, or a sense of the sublime, in the viewer, that is ascribed to his art.  It is perhaps especially applied to his [[sculpture]]s, such as his figures of [[David (Michelangelo)|''David'']] or in [[Moses (Michelangelo)|''Moses'']].

[[Pope Julius II]] was apparently the first to describe Michelangelo as a ''uomo terribile'' ("terror-inducing man"), apparently describing his difficult character as much as his art. This ''terribilità'', also references the [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonics]] of humanists such as [[Marsilio Ficino]], who had known Michelangelo in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Lleó Cañal, Vicente, Revista de Libros:Tintoretto 2, 2 Abril 2007, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelangelo's friend and collaborator [[Sebastiano del Piombo]] reported in a letter to him of 15 October 1520 on a private audience with [[Pope Leo X]].  After praising Michelangelo's work, the pope continued "But he is ''terribile'', as you see; one cannot deal with him".  Sebastiano responded "that your ''terribile'' character did not harm anyone, and that you appear ''terribile'' for love of the great works you carry out."&lt;ref&gt;Exhibition handlist for "Michelangelo &amp; Sebastiano", 2017, National Gallery.

'''''The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism''''' is a 2003 book by the psychologist [[J. Michael Bailey]], published by [[Joseph Henry Press]].&lt;ref name="jhp"&gt;Bailey, J. Michael (2003). ''The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism''. Joseph Henry Press, {{ISBN|978-0-309-08418-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first section of the book, Bailey discusses gender-atypical behaviors and [[gender dysphoria]] in children, emphasizing the biological determination of gender.  In the second section he deals primarily with gay men, including the link between childhood gender dysphoria and male [[homosexuality]] later in life. Bailey reviews evidence that male homosexuality is congenital (a result of genetics and [[Prenatal#Prenatal period|prenatal]] environment), and he argues for the accuracy of some [[stereotype]]s about gay men.&lt;ref name="Bailey76"&gt;Bailey (2003), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; In the third section, Bailey summarizes evidence for a [[psychological typology]] of [[trans women]] that says there are two forms of [[transsexualism]] that affects transgender women: one that he describes as an extreme type of male homosexuality and one that is a sexual interest in having a female body, called [[autogynephilia]].

The book caused considerable controversy which led to complaints and a formal investigation by [[Northwestern University]], where Bailey was chair of the psychology department until shortly before the conclusion of the investigation. Northwestern ultimately found no basis for the complaints,&lt;ref name="Dreger2008"&gt;{{cite journal

==Summary==

''The Man Who Would Be Queen'' is divided into three sections: "The Boy Who Would Be Princess", "The Man He Might Become", and "Women Who Once Were Boys".

It starts with an anecdote about a child Bailey calls "Danny". Bailey writes of Danny's mother, who has been frustrated by other therapists she has seen about her son's "feminine" behavior.&lt;ref name="bailey16"&gt;Bailey (2003), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey discusses psychologist and sexologist [[Kenneth Zucker]]'s work with children whose parents have noticed significant gender-atypical behaviors.  Bailey uses the anecdote about Danny to describe [[gender identity disorder]], a label applied to males with significant feminine behaviors and females with significant masculine behaviors, such as [[cross-dressing]]. For example, this class includes boys that prefer to play with dolls and regularly identify with female characters in stories or movies, and girls that prefer to play with [[toy car]]s and identify with male characters. This section of the book also discusses some case studies of men who were, for varying reasons, [[sex assignment|reassigned]] to the female sex shortly after their birth, and emphasizes the fact that, despite this, they tended to exhibit typically male characteristics and often identified as men.

The second section deals primarily with gay men, including a suggested link between childhood [[gender identity disorder]] and male homosexuality later in life. Bailey discusses whether homosexuality is a congenitally or possibly even genetically related phenomenon. This discussion includes references to Bailey's studies as well as those of neuroscientist [[Simon LeVay]] and geneticist [[Dean Hamer]]. He also discusses the behavior of gay men and its stereotypically masculine and feminine qualities.

In the third section, Bailey summarizes a taxonomy of transsexual women that was proposed by [[Ray Blanchard]] about fifteen years earlier. According to Blanchard, there are two types of transsexual women: one described as an extreme form of male homosexuality, the other being motivated by [[autogynephilia|a sexual interest in having a female body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanchard | first1 = R. | last2 = Clemmensen | first2 = L.

==Reception==
The book elicited both strongly supportive and strongly negative reactions. The controversial aspects included the contents of the book, whether the research was conducted ethically, whether it should have been published by the National Academies Press, and whether it should have been promoted as a scientific work. According to [[Benedict Carey]]'s story in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "To many of Dr. Bailey’s peers, his story is a morality play about the corrosive effects of [[political correctness]] on [[academic freedom]]."&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt; Interviewed by Carey, bioethicist [[Alice Dreger]] argues that "what happened to Bailey is important, because the harassment was so extraordinarily bad and because it could happen to any researcher in the field. If we’re going to have research at all, then we’re going to have people saying unpopular things, and if this is what happens to them, then we’ve got problems not only for science but free expression itself."&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt;

However, critics such as [[Deirdre McCloskey]] think that the pointed criticism, including filing charges, was warranted: "Nothing we have done, I believe, and certainly nothing I have done, overstepped any boundaries of fair comment on a book and an author who stepped into the public arena with enthusiasm to deliver a false and unscientific and politically damaging opinion".&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt;  The concern over academic freedom was dismissed by Charles Allen Moser, who wrote: "The death of free speech and academic freedom has been highly exaggerated. Science is not free of politics, never has been, and never will be."&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;

===Positive reactions===
''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' concluded: "Despite its provocative title, a scientific yet superbly compassionate exposition."&lt;ref name="napsales"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10530 The Man Who Would Be Queen] via [[National Academies Press]].

===Negative reactions from the transgender community===

=== Negative reactions from outside the transgender community ===
Negative responses came from outside the transgender community as well. Liza Mundy of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' thought the book exceptionally dull despite the potentially interesting topic.&lt;ref name="mundy2003"&gt;Mundy, Liza (March 23, 2003). Codes of Behavior. ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Eli Coleman]] referred to the book as "an unfortunate setback in feelings of trust between the transgender community and sex researchers,"&lt;ref name="dreger2008"/&gt; and his colleague, Walter Bockting, wrote that it was "yet another blow to the delicate relationship between clinicians, scholars, and the transgender community."&lt;ref name="bockting2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bockting | first1 = Walter O. | year = 2005 | title = Biological reductionism meets gender diversity in human sexuality. [Review of the book The Man Who Would Be Queen.] | doi = 10.1080/00224490509552281 | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 267–270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]] Director [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] said the book promoted a derogatory explanation of transgender identity that would hurt many vulnerable transgender people, and that the book, which was written in a [[popular science]] style, did not support the material in a scientific manner.&lt;ref name="dreger2008"/&gt; Psychologist [[Randi Ettner]] said of Bailey, "He's set back the field 100 years, as far as I'm concerned."&lt;ref name="klein2004" /&gt;

Originally, the [[Lambda Literary Award|Lambda Literary Foundation]] nominated the book as a finalist in the [[transgender]] award category for 2003. Transgender people immediately protested the nomination and gathered thousands of petition signatures in just a few days. Under pressure from the petition, the Foundation withdrew the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2004/03/16/3 |title = Group rescinds honor for disputed book |first = Patrick |last = Letellier |authorlink =  |date = 2004-03-16 |work = Gay.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080505120340/http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2004%2F03%2F16%2F3 |archivedate = 2008-05-05 |accessdate = 2010-01-10 |deadurl = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Northwestern University professor of clinical medical humanities and [[bioethics]] [[Alice Dreger]] commented on Bailey's response to the negative reactions: "Bailey may claim he was not insensitive, but given the number of people he offended with his prose, he is obviously, objectively wrong—being perceived as insensitive by this many people surely means you have been insensitive. (Especially if you don’t get that.)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Dreger | first1 = A. D.| title = Response to the Commentaries on Dreger (2008)| journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior| volume = 37| issue = 3| pages = 503–510| year = 2008| doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9348-7| url = http://bioethics.northwestern.edu/faculty/work/dreger/dreger_commentary_response.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physician [[Charles Allen Moser]], though, believes that Bailey caused his own controversy by being mean spirited. "To call a transsexual who denies Autogynephilia vigorously autogynephilic or an autogynephile-in-denial is also inflammatory and inappropriate. One can convey the same point with more cautious language. In general, researchers should avoid inciting hostility from their subjects. Stating that a subject is in denial or misleading the researcher usually leads to an angry reaction. Ridiculing someone for their beliefs, religious, political, or gender identification is never a good strategy. Ignoring these common courtesies will probably lead to an ugly confrontation, such as this “controversy.” Being a researcher does not confer immunity from the consequences of incivility."&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Charles Moser | title = A Different Perspective | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 3 |date=June 2008 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9331-3 | pmid = 18431627 | pages=472–475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations against Bailey===

==== Alleged lack of formal written consent in interviews ====
Two of the transsexual women in Bailey's book, two who mistakenly thought they were represented in the book, and several organizations have accused him of ethical breaches in his work by talking to them about their life stories without obtaining formal written consent.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Robin. "Transsexual 'Subjects' Complain About Professor's Research Methods." ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' 25 July 2003, Vol. 49, Issue 46. ''"The book contains numerous observations and reports of interviews with me", C. Anjelica Kieltyka, one of the transsexual women, wrote in a letter this month to C. Bradley Moore, Northwestern's vice president for research. She added: "I did not receive, nor was I asked to sign, an informed-consent document."''&lt;/ref&gt;  All of the people were aware that Bailey was writing a book about trans women at the time of the interviews: some of them read the drafts of the book before publication,&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt; and several said they felt their stories had been told "accurately and sympathetically."&lt;ref name="nymag.com"/&gt; Bailey has denied that it is unethical for a university professor to talk to people in the same manner that [[journalist]]s do, or to write books with the resulting anecdotes. He also stated that the book was "popular and not 'scientific'"  so it was not required to follow IRB rules.&lt;ref name="McCarthyism" /&gt;

According to Dreger, whether federal regulations required professors to obtain formal approval from a university [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB) before interviewing people was uncertain at the time;&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt; she points out that shortly after publication of this book, the US Department of Health and Human Services, in conjunction with the [[Oral History Association]] and [[American Historical Association]], issued a formal statement that taking [[oral history|oral histories]], conducting interviews, collecting anecdotes, and similar activities do not constitute IRB-qualified research, and were never intended to be covered by clinical research rules, when such work is "neither systematic nor generalizable in the scientific sense."&lt;ref name="dreger2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OralHistory"&gt;{{Cite book

==== Alleged practice of psychology without a license ====
Also as cited as harassment of Bailey were legal complaints that Bailey was [[practicing psychology without a license]]. The basis for these complaints was that [[sex-reassignment surgery]] in the US requires authorization letters from two psychologists, and Bailey had written a second letter, at no charge and upon request, for some individuals Bailey had spoken with while writing the book. American bioethicist [[Alice Dreger]] notes that there was no legal basis for this claim, as Bailey received no compensation for his services, and was forthright in this letters about his qualifications, even attaching copies of his C.V: "Presumably all this was why [Illinois] never bothered to pursue the charge, although you’d never know that from reading the press accounts, which mentioned only the complaints, not that they had petered out."&lt;ref name="nymag.com"/&gt; State regulators took no action on these complaints.&lt;ref name="carey2007" /&gt;

'''''Grand traité d’instrumentation et d’orchestration modernes''''', abbreviated in [[English language|English]] as the '''''Treatise on Instrumentation''''' (sometimes '''''Treatise on Orchestration''''') is a technical study of [[Western culture|Western]] [[musical instrument]]s, written by [[Hector Berlioz]]. It was first published in 1844 after being serialised in many parts prior to this date and had a chapter added by Berlioz on [[conducting]] in 1855.

In 1904, [[Richard Strauss]] was asked to update the text to include some modern instruments and included musical examples from Wagner, and in 1905 the updated ''Treatise'' with a new preface by Strauss was published in German.&lt;ref&gt;''Instrumentationslehre'', Hector Berlioz and Richard Strauss, CF Peters, Edition Peters 3120, Leipzig 1905&lt;/ref&gt; The 1905 edition was translated into English in 1948.&lt;ref name="its" /&gt;

The book discusses the various technical aspects of instruments, such as chromatic [[Range (music)|range]], [[Timbre|tone quality]], and limitations. An explanation of the role of particular instruments within the [[orchestra]] is also provided. The book also provides orchestral excerpts from [[classical music|classical]] [[Sheet music|scores]] to give examples of techniques discussed. These examples are sometimes of works by Berlioz himself, while [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] are also frequently cited.&lt;ref name="its" /&gt;

Many composers studied the work closely, such as [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss|R. Strauss]], and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]].

__NOTOC__
'''User innovation''' refers to [[innovation]] by intermediate users (e.g. user [[firm]]s) or [[consumer]] users (individual [[end-user]]s or user [[communities]]), rather than by suppliers (producers or [[manufacturers]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bogers, M.; Afuah, A.; Bastian, B. (2010), "[http://www.marcelbogers.com/Pubs/Bogers-Afuah-Bastian_2010_JOM_Users-as-innovators.pdf Users as innovators: A review, critique, and future research directions]", Journal of Management, 36 (4): 857–875.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a concept closely aligned to [[co-design]], and has been proven to result in more innovative solutions than traditional consultation methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Val|last2=Ross|first2=Tracy|last3=Sims|first3=Ruth|last4=Parker|first4=Christopher J.|title=Empirical investigation of the impact of using co-design methods when generating proposals for sustainable travel solutions|journal=CoDesign||date=2015|volume=12|issue=4|pages=205-220|doi=10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric von Hippel]]&lt;ref&gt;von Hippel, E. (1986). Lead Users: A Source of Novel Product Concepts. Management Science, 32(7), 791-805. {{doi|10.1287/mnsc.32.7.791}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others observed that many products and services are actually developed or at least refined, by users, at the site of implementation and use. These ideas are then moved back into the supply network.  This is because products are developed to meet the widest possible need; when individual users face problems that the majority of consumers do not, they have no choice but to develop their own modifications to existing products, or entirely new products, to solve their issues.  Often, user innovators will share their ideas with manufacturers in hopes of having them produce the product, a process called free revealing.

Based on research on the evolution of Internet technologies and open source software [[Ilkka Tuomi]] {{Harv|Tuomi|2002}} further highlighted the point that users are fundamentally social. User innovation, therefore, is also socially and socio-technically distributed innovation. According to Tuomi,&lt;ref&gt;Tuomi, I: ''Networks of Innovation'', chapter 2. Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; key uses are often unintended uses invented by user communities that reinterpret and reinvent the meaning of emerging technological opportunities.

The existence of user innovation, for example, by users of industrial robots, rather than the manufacturers of robots {{Harv|Fleck|1988}} is a core part of the argument against the Linear Innovation Model {{Harv|Williams|1996}} i.e. innovation comes from research and development, is then marketed and 'diffuses' to end-users. Instead innovation is a non-linear process involving innovations at all stages.

In 1986 Eric von Hippel introduced the [[lead user]] method that can be used to systematically learn about user innovation in order to apply it in [[new product development]]. In 2007 another specific type of user innovator, the [[creative consumer]] was introduced. These are consumers who adapt, modify, or transform a proprietary offering as opposed to creating completely new products.&lt;ref&gt;Berthon, PR.; Pitt, LF.; McCarthy I. and Kates, SB. (2007) "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=959581 When customers get clever: Managerial approaches to dealing with creative consumers]", Business Horizons 50 (1), 39-47&lt;/ref&gt;

User innovation has a number of degrees: innovation of use, innovation in services, innovation in configuration of technologies, and finally the innovation of novel technologies themselves. While most user innovation is concentrated in use and configuration of existing products and technologies, and is a normal part of long term innovation, new technologies that are easier for end-users to change and innovate with, and new channels of communication are making it much easier for user innovation to occur and have an impact.

Recent research has focused on Web-based forums that facilitate user (or customer) innovation - referred to as [[virtual customer environment]], these forums help companies partner with their customers in various phases of product development as well as in other value creation activities. For example, [[Threadless]], a T-shirt manufacturing company, relies on the contribution of online community members in the design process. The community includes a group of volunteer designers who submit designs and vote on the designs of others. In addition to free exposure, designers are provided monetary incentives including a $2,500 base award as well as a percentage of T-shirt sales. These incentives allow Threadless to encourage continual user contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Magee,Joe. "[https://hbr.org/2008/10/the-contribution-revolution-letting-volunteers-build-your-business The Contribution Revolution: Letting Volunteers Build Your Business]", [[Harvard Business Review]], October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">"'''Viruses of the Mind'''" is an essay by British evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], first published in the book ''Dennett and His Critics: Demystifying Mind'' (1993).  Dawkins originally wrote the essay in 1991 and delivered it as a [[Voltaire Lecture]] on 6 November 1992 at the [[Conway Hall Humanist Centre]].  The essay discusses how religion can be viewed as a [[meme]], an idea previously expressed by Dawkins in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976).  Dawkins analyzes the propagation of religious ideas and behaviors as a memetic virus, analogous to how  [[virus|biological]] and [[computer virus]]es spread.  The essay was later published in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) and its ideas are further explored in the television programme, ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]'' (2006).

==Content==
Dawkins defines the "symptoms" of being infected by the "virus of religion", providing examples for most of them, and tries to define a connection between the elements of religion and its survival value (invoking [[Amotz Zahavi|Zahavi]]'s [[handicap principle]] of [[sexual selection]], applied to believers of a religion). Dawkins also describes religious beliefs as "mind-parasites", and as "gangs &lt;nowiki&gt;[that]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will come to constitute a package, which may be sufficiently stable to deserve a collective name such as Roman Catholicism ... or ... component parts to a single virus".

Dawkins suggests that religious belief in the "faith-sufferer" typically shows the following elements:
* It is impelled by some deep, inner conviction that something is true, or right, or virtuous: a conviction that doesn't seem to owe anything to [[evidence]] or reason, but which, nevertheless, the believer feels as totally compelling and convincing.
* The believer typically makes a positive virtue of faith's being strong and unshakable, despite it not being based upon evidence.
* There is a conviction that "mystery", ''per se'', is a good thing; the belief that it is not a virtue to solve mysteries but to enjoy them and revel in their insolubility.
* There may be intolerant behaviour towards perceived rival faiths, in extreme cases even the killing of opponents or advocating of their deaths. Believers  may be similarly violent in disposition towards [[Apostasy|apostates]] or [[Heresy|heretics]], even if those espouse only a slightly different version of the faith.
* The particular convictions that the believer holds, while having nothing to do with evidence, are likely to resemble those of the believer's parents.
* If the believer is one of the rare exceptions who follows a different religion from his parents, the explanation may be cultural transmission from a charismatic individual.
* The internal sensations of the 'faith-sufferer' may be reminiscent of those more ordinarily associated with sexual love.

Dawkins stresses his claim that religious beliefs do not spread as a result of evidence in their support, but typically by cultural transmission, in most cases from parents or from charismatic individuals. He refers to this as involving "[[epidemiology]], not evidence". Further Dawkins distinguishes this process from the spread of scientific ideas, which, he suggests, is constrained by the requirement to conform with certain virtues of standard methodology: "testability, evidential support, precision, quantifiability, consistency, intersubjectivity, repeatability, universality, progressiveness, independence of cultural milieu, and so on". He points out that faith "spreads despite a total lack of every single one of these virtues".

==Critical reactions==
[[Alister McGrath]], a Christian theologian, has also commented critically on Dawkins' analysis, suggesting that "memes have no place in serious scientific reflection",&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'' p. 125 quoting [[Simon Conway Morris]] is support&lt;/ref&gt; that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p.  126&lt;/ref&gt; that "evolution" of ideas is more [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] than Darwinian,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests there is no evidence that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' (pp. 137–138)&lt;/ref&gt; McGrath also cites a metareview of 100 studies and argues that "If religion is reported as having a positive effect on human well-being by 79% of recent studies in the field, how can it conceivably be regarded as analogous to a virus?"&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God'' p. 136 citing Koenig and Cohen ''The Link between Religion and Health'' OUP 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4175">'''World art studies''' is an expression used to define studies in the discipline of [[art history]], which focus on the [[history of art|history of visual arts worldwide]], its methodology, concepts and approach. The expression is also used within the academic curricula as title for specific art history courses and schools.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], and the courses at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are several expressions related to World art studies which are often used as interchangeable. Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme, ''World Art Studies''in ''Art History and Visual Studies'' in Europe: Transnational Discourses and National Frameworks, eds. Matthew Rampley, Thierry Lenain, Hubert Locher, Brill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; provide some more specific definitions as following

* ''World art studies'' is a concept conceived by the art historian [[John Onians]] in the early Nineties as a new field of studies, global and with a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref&gt;John Onians, ''World Art Studies and the Need for a New Natural History of Art'' in "Art Bulletin, n. 78, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of World art studies differentiates them from ''world art history'' and ''global art history''. The expression ''World art studies'' was used by John Onians to rename the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]]. The concept of 'World art studies'' is similar to the concept of ''Bildwissenschaft'' or ''image-ology'' is equally multidisciplinary in its approach to analysis of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme make reference to the publication edited by Klaus Sachs-Hombach ''Bildwissenschaft: Disziplinen, Themen, Methoden'', Surhkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Global art history'' refers to the study of art in present and recent past with a focus on the art worldwide and interrelated phenomena. This definition relies on the distinction operated by [[Bruce Mazlish]] between ''global history'' and ''world history''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Mazlish, ''An Introduction to Glocal History'' in ''Conceptualizing Global History'', ed. Bruce Mazlish and Ralph Buultjens, Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''World art history'' refers to the study of art of the whole human history. A remark made to this expression is the use of the world ''history'' in singular (history and not histories); the use of the plural is preferred by [[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]], [[Real Spaces|Real Spaces: World Art History and the Rise of Western Modernism]], Phaidon Press, New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]], ''Stories of Art, Routledge, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
