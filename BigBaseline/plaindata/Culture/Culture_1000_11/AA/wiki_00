{"id": "297267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297267", "title": "Allusion", "text": "Allusion\n\nAllusion is a figure of speech, in which an object or circumstance from unrelated context is referenced covertly or indirectly. It is left to the audience to make the direct connection; where the connection is directly and explicitly stated (as opposed to indirectly implied) by the author, it is instead usually termed a reference. In the arts, a literary allusion puts the alluded text in a new context under which it assumes new meanings and denotations. It is not possible to predetermine the nature of all the new meanings and inter-textual patterns that an allusion will generate. Literary allusion is closely related to parody and pastiche, which are also \"text-linking\" literary devices.\n\nIn a wider, more informal context, an allusion is a passing or casually short statement indicating broader meaning. It is an incidental mention of something, either directly or by implication, such as \"In the stock market, he met his Waterloo.\"\n\nIn the most traditional sense, \"allusion\" is a literary term, though the word has also come to encompass indirect references to any source, including allusions in film or the visual arts. In literature, allusions are used to link concepts that the reader already has knowledge of, with concepts discussed in the story. In the field of film criticism, a film-maker's intentionally unspoken visual reference to another film is also called an homage. It may even be sensed that real events have allusive overtones, when a previous event is inescapably recalled by a current one. \"Allusion is bound up with a vital and perennial topic in literary theory, the place of authorial intention in interpretation\", William Irwin observed, in asking \"What is an allusion?\"\n\nWithout the hearer or reader's comprehending the author's intention, an allusion becomes merely a decorative device. \nAllusion is an economical device, a figure of speech that uses a relatively short space to draw upon the ready stock of ideas, cultural memes or emotion already associated with a topic. Thus, an allusion is understandable only to those with prior knowledge of the covert reference in question, a mark of their cultural literacy.\n\nThe origin of \"allusion\" is in the Latin verb \"ludere, lusus est\" \"to play with, jest.\" Recognizing the point of allusion's condensed riddle also reinforces cultural solidarity between the maker of the allusion and the hearer: their shared familiarity with allusion bonds them. Ted Cohen finds such a \"cultivation of intimacy\" to be an essential element of many jokes. Some aspect of the referent must be invoked and identified for the tacit association to be made; the allusion is indirect in part because \"it depends on something more than mere substitution of a referent.\"\n\nThe allusion depends as well on the author's intent; a reader may search out parallels to a figure of speech or a passage, of which the author was unaware, and offer them as unconscious allusions—coincidences that a critic might not find illuminating. Addressing such issues is an aspect of hermeneutics.\n\nWilliam Irwin remarks that allusion moves in only one direction: \"If A alludes to B, then B does not allude to A. The Bible does not allude to Shakespeare, though Shakespeare may allude to the Bible.\" Irwin appends a note: \"Only a divine author, outside of time, would seem capable of alluding to a later text.\" This is the basis for Christian readings of Old Testament prophecy, which asserts that passages are to be read as allusions to future events due to Jesus's revelation in .\n\nAllusion differs from the similar term intertextuality in that it is an intentional effort on the author's part. The success of an allusion depends in part on at least some of its audience \"getting\" it. Allusions may be made increasingly obscure, until at last they are understood by the author alone, who thereby retreats into a private language (e.g. \"Ulalume\", by Edgar Allan Poe).\n\nIn discussing the richly allusive poetry of Virgil's \"Georgics\", R. F. Thomas distinguished six categories of allusive reference, which are applicable to a wider cultural sphere. These types are:\n\nA type of literature has grown round explorations of the allusions in such works as Alexander Pope's \"The Rape of the Lock\" or T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\".\n\nIn Homer, brief allusions could be made to mythic themes of generations previous to the main narrative because they were already familiar to the epic's hearers: one example is the theme of the Calydonian boarhunt. In Hellenistic Alexandria, literary culture and a fixed literary canon known to readers and hearers made a densely allusive poetry effective; the poems of Callimachus offer the best-known examples.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr., alluded to the Gettysburg Address in starting his \"I Have a Dream\" speech by saying 'Five score years ago...\"; his hearers were immediately reminded of Abraham Lincoln's \"Four score and seven years ago\", which opened the Gettysburg Address. King's allusion effectively called up parallels in two historic moments without overwhelming his speech with details.\n\nA sobriquet is an allusion. By metonymy one aspect of a person or other referent is selected to identify it, and it is this shared aspect that makes a sobriquet evocative: for example, \"the city that never sleeps\" is a sobriquet of (and therefore an allusion to) New York.\n\nAn allusion may become trite and stale through unthinking overuse, devolving into a mere cliché, as is seen in some of the sections below.\n\nAndy Warhol, a 20th-century American artist most famous for his pop-art images of Campbell soup cans and of Marilyn Monroe, commented on the explosion of media coverage by saying, \"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.\"\nToday, when someone receives a great deal of media attention for something fairly trivial, and he or she is said to be experiencing his or her \"15 minutes of fame\", that is an allusion to Andy Warhol's famous remark.\n\nAccording to the Book of Genesis, God destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, but Lot, the nephew of Abraham, was given time to escape with his family before the destruction. God commanded Lot and his family not to look back as they fled. Lot's wife disobeyed and looked back, and she was immediately turned into a pillar of salt as punishment for her disobedience.\n\nAn allusion to Lot's wife or to a pillar of salt is usually a reference to someone who unwisely chooses to look back once he or she has begun on a course of action or to someone who disobeys an explicit rule or command.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Cassandra, the daughter of Trojan king Priam, was loved by Apollo, who gave her the gift of prophecy. When Cassandra later angered Apollo, he altered the gift so that her prophecies, while true, would not be believed. Thus, her accurate warnings to the Trojans were disregarded, and disaster befell them.\n\nToday, a \"Cassandra\" refers to someone who predicts disasters or negative results, especially to someone whose predictions are disregarded.\n\nThis phrase comes from a novel by Joseph Heller. \"Catch-22\" is set on a U.S. Army Air Force base in World War II. \"Catch-22\" refers to a regulation that states an airman's request to be relieved from flight duty can only be granted if he is judged to be insane. However, anyone who does not want to fly dangerous missions is obviously sane, thus, there is no way to avoid flying the missions.\n\nLater in the book the old woman in Rome explains that Catch-22 means \"They can do whatever they want to do.\" This refers to the theme of the novel in which the authority figures consistently abuse their powers, leaving the consequences to those under their command. \n\nIn common speech, \"catch-22\" has come to describe any absurd or no-win situation.\n\nThe poetry of T. S. Eliot is often described as \"allusive\", because of his habit of referring to names, places or images that may only make sense in the light of prior knowledge. This technique can add to the experience, but for the uninitiated can make Eliot's work seem dense and hard to decipher.\n\nThe most densely allusive work in modern English may be \"Finnegans Wake\" by James Joyce. Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson wrote \"A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake\" (1944) that unlocked some of Joyce's most obscure allusions.\n\n"}
{"id": "17060601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17060601", "title": "Anxiety/uncertainty management", "text": "Anxiety/uncertainty management\n\nAnxiety/Uncertainty Management (AUM) theory was introduced by William B. Gudykunst to define how humans effectively communicate based on their balance of anxiety and uncertainty in social situations. Gudykunst believed that in order for successful intercultural communication a reduction in anxiety/uncertainty must occur. This is assuming that one person within the intercultural encounter is a stranger. AUM is a theory based on the Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT) which was introduced by Berger and Calabrese in 1974. URT provides much of the initial framework for AUM, and much like other theories in the communication field AUM is a constantly developing theory, based on the observations of human behaviour in social situations.\n\nURT is based on the human's thought process and their approach to social situation in which they have uncertainty. URT suggests that uncertainty stems from the human's attempts to \"[proactively predict] \"the other's attitudes, values, feelings, beliefs and behaviors\"\" during social encounters. Humans attempt to reduce their uncertainty in social encounters when there is a motivation to do so, URT highlights three core motivations; they anticipate other social interaction at another point in time, the recipient has something the human needs or wants as a form of reward and/or the recipient is acting in a strange or deviant which is unexpected.\n\nBerger identified 7 axioms and 21 theorems within URT (theoretical statements which are generally excepted, but can be used to observe behaviours to be further proved), with these theorems providing the inspiration for a multitude of expansions to the theory, one of which is AUM. AUM uses the foundations of URT to formulate 47 axioms, with AUM integrating the human anxiety management within social situations, as well as their uncertainty management. AUM builds on URT's focus on individual or one-to-one communication, as the axioms and theorems focus on intercultural and intergroup communications.\n\nAUM incorporates both the URT and the works of Stephan and Stephan on anxiety within his axioms to expand URT to explain intergroup communications. AUM focuses on both anxiety and uncertainty reduction, this highlights the major difference between URT and AUM, with the intended outcome of URT being simply to reduce uncertainty, whereas AUM's outcome was for cultural adaptation and not solely the reduction of uncertainty. The inherent difference is that managing anxiety is to maintain it between minimum and maximum thresholds along a spectrum while reducing anxiety is unidirectional. This realization, along with the introduction of mindfulness as a factor of effective communication, led Gudykunst to finally designate an appropriate name for his research: Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory (AUM).\n\nGudykunst assumed that at least one person in an intercultural encounter is a stranger. He argues that strangers undergo both anxiety and uncertainty; they don’t feel secure and they aren’t sure how to behave. Gudykunst noted that strangers and in-group members experience some degree of anxiety and uncertainty in any new interpersonal situation, but when the encounter takes place between people of different cultures, strangers are hyperaware of cultural differences. They then tend to overestimate the effect of cultural identity on the behavior of people in an alien society, while blurring individuals’ distinctions.\n\nThe purpose of the first iteration of AUM was to be a practical application with a high degree of utility. The format of AUM includes numerous axioms, which in turn converge on one another moving in the direction of effective communication. (See Figure X). The specific number of axioms has varied over the last fifteen years according to updated research in the field of cross-cultural communication.\n\nCommunication theories commonly focus on 4 levels: individual, interpersonal, intergroup, and cultural.\n\n• The individual level is the motivation for human communication, influencing the ways humans create and interpret messages (for example the need for group inclusion and self-concept support).\n\n• The interpersonal level is the way the message is exchanged when humans are communicating as an individual (for example one-on-one communication, intimate relationships and social networks).\n\n• The intergroup level is the exchange of messages when humans are communicating as a collective (for example social identities, collective self-esteem).\n\n• The cultural level is how people communicate similarly or differently dependant on their culture (for example dimensions of cultural variability).\n\nAUM focuses on interpersonal and intergroup levels of communication, with Gudykunst's axioms fitting into either the interpersonal or the intergroup categories. AUM discriminates between interpersonal and intergroup communications by examining predictions of behaviour. If the behaviour can be explained with cultural norms or with sociological norms, it can be classified as intergroup communication. When the behavior is best explained by psychological factors it is likely interpersonal communication. A second effective differentiator is to examine the identities that guide human behavior. When our behavior is guided by personal or human factors, interpersonal behaviors tend to occur. When it is guided by social factors the opposite is true.\n\nComplex theories such as AUM need to accept certain assumptions as true before the real content can be explored. Some metatheoretical assumptions Gudykunst makes on AUM are on the nature of reality, the way we gain knowledge, and the basis of human behavior. Gudykunst assumes that the basic processes of communication are the same across cultures; only the methods of interpretation vary. Also, he assumes these interpretations are how we gain data to create theories. Finally, and vital to AUM, he assumes that when humans are mindful they have greater control over their communications behaviors. This aspect of human nature is sometimes referred to as determinism.\n\nGudykunst also employs several theoretical assumptions. The first is that strangers will trigger both interpersonal and intergroup anxiety. The perspective he takes for the sake of developing axioms is that of the stranger immersed in an ingroup.\n\nAnother assumption deals with the concept of uncertainty. Gudykunst assumes that when uncertainty falls between an individual's minimum and maximum acceptable levels, effective communication will then take place. The maximum threshold is defined as the amount of uncertainty that we can possess and still comfortably predict the behavior of a stranger. Uncertainty above the minimum threshold keeps us from getting bored with the stranger and hence constraining communication.\n\nAnxiety for the purposes of anxiety/uncertainty management can be described as an apprehension based on the fear of negative consequences. It is more prevalent in intergroup relations because there is an added fear of appearing prejudiced when dealing with an outgroup. Similar to uncertainty, Gudykunst postulates that effective communication relies on managing anxiety between minimum and maximum thresholds. Once we reach our upper limit for anxiety, virtually all of our attention focuses on its source and not on effective communication. The concept of managing levels anxiety can be compared to managing eustress and distress to achieve optimum performance. The positive benefit of the optimum amount of anxiety is trust, or \"confidence that one will find what is desired from another rather than what is feared\" The negative consequence is avoidance. If we are overcome by anxiety we will simply choose not to communicate.\n\nAnother term needing a working definition for the purpose of anxiety/uncertainty management is \"effective communication\". Simply put, effective communication is the extent to which a message is interpreted by its recipient with the intended meaning from the sender. Communication is more effective when both the sender and receiver use the same frames of reference. However, in intercultural communication this is often untrue and interactions with strangers can in turn prove more difficult.\n\nFinally, the mechanism around which anxiety/uncertainty management revolves is mindfulness. When people communicate mindlessly, they tend to utilize broad categories and stereotypes to predict behavior. As mindfulness increases, the categories become more specific and typically more accurate predictors. Since being mindful makes us open to more information we are more likely to correctly identify the receiver's frame of interpretation.\n\nMindfulness refers to a conscious choice rather than scripted behavior. Em Griffin, author of the Communication book; \"A First Look At Communication Theory\" and Professor Emeritus of Communications at Wheaton College in Illinois defines mindfulness as \"the way that in-group members and strangers can reduce their anxiety and uncertainty to optimum levels\". Scripted behavior serves us well in familiar situations, but not in cross-cultural communication. William Howell suggests four levels of communication competence.\n\n\nGudykunst defined mindfulness as stage three (Conscious competence), in Howell's model. In this stage cognitive choice moderates the destructive force of doubt or fear. The last stage (Unconscious competence), is less competent than stage three and can quickly shift into oblivious incompetence. Mindfulness involves the creation of new categories, a new process of thinking, and formation of a kin which reinforces Delia's description of how a cognitively complex person uses a lot of interpersonal constructs.\n\nGudykunst uses two types of theoretical statements to construct his theory; axioms and theorems. Axioms are \"propositions that involve variables that are taken to be directly linked causally; axioms should therefore be statements that imply direct causal links among variables\" Some axioms do not apply in all situations. Boundary conditions specify when the axioms hold. The axioms can be combined to derive theorems. When combined the axioms and theorems form a \"casual process\" theory A primer in theory construction. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc. that explains effective communication. Dialectical processes influence much of our communication within specific interactions. To illustrate, uncertainty involves a dialectic between predictability and novelty. In the current version of the theory, dialectics are incorporated as boundary conditions for the axioms where applicable.\n\nGudykunst states that in generating the axioms for the theory he assumed that managing anxiety and uncertainty are “basic causes” influencing effective communication. Other variables (e.g. self-concepts, motivation, reactions to strangers, social categorization, situational processes, connections with strangers, ethical interactions, anxiety, uncertainty, mindfulness and effective communication), are treated as \"superficial causes\" of effective communication. The influence of these “superficial causes” on effective communication is mediated through anxiety and uncertainty. Being mindful allows us to engage in anxiety and uncertainty management.\n\nGudykunst uses 47 axioms as building blocks for the theorems of AUM. Axioms can be thought of as the lowest common denominators from which all causal theorems are derived.\n\nAxioms one through five all relate to our views of ourselves, or self-concepts. Gudykunst includes personal identities, social identities, and collective self-esteem in this category. Social identities are employed when we try to predict intergroup behavior and personal identities are naturally employed for interpersonal behavior. They both act in such a way as to help us manage uncertainty and anxiety by sufficiently predicting behavior. If either of these identities feels threatened, Gudykunst believes that we will attempt to raise collective self-esteem and hence fostering a more positive outcome. The greater our self-esteem, the better we are able to manage our anxiety.\n\nGudykunst's next set of axioms suggest that our motivation to interact with strangers is directly related to the fulfillment of needs. First, we have a need to trust others to behave favorably or at least in an expected manner. Second, and only in the context of intergroup relations, we need to feel inclusion with the group or anxiety will surely develop. Paradoxically, the third need that Gudykunst points out is our need for self-concept confirmation. We want to be included in the group, but not to the extent that our identity is lost in the crowd.\n\nWe tend to act more favorably toward strangers whose mannerisms and beliefs converge with our own. In this case, we have a greater propensity to exhibit empathy, tolerate more ambiguity, and have a less rigid social posture when seeking closure. A rigid attitude, or close-minded thinking, leads us to seek closure to an interaction in the most direct way possible. If we were to exhibit empathy and attempt to think more objectively about the perspective of the stranger, we should in turn be postured to accept more ambiguity and seek the most appropriate solution instead of the most direct.\n\nThe next seven axioms of this theory focus on how people order their social environments into categories. When people categorize themselves, they become aware of being members of ingroups and outgroups, which generates anxiety and uncertainty. People tend to have more categories for their ingroup than they do for an outgroup, but the more familiar they are with an outgroup, the more categories they see. The categories that people create for outgroups will lead to expectations about the behavior of a member of that group, which can be either positive or negative. Expectations then help people predict, accurately or inaccurately, a stranger's behavior.\n\nThe next four axioms are based on the situations in which communication occurs. People have different scripts they expect to follow for a given situation, much like actors may follow a movie script. Miscommunication occurs when people follow a script they assume the stranger with whom they are communicating to be familiar. People also react to strangers differently based on the conditions in which they interact. For example, cooperation was found to lead to positive feelings towards those one is working with. People also tend to have less anxiety when there are other members of their ingroups present. Power also affects communication, and a person who feels they have less power than the stranger in an interaction will feel more anxiety towards that interaction.\n\nThe next five axioms are based on connections between people. What the axioms come to is the more connected people feel to strangers, the less anxiety and uncertainty they feel in communicating with them. These connections come from attraction, interdependence, levels of intimacy, and number of the same people both communicators know.\n\nThe next three axioms are based on dignity and respect. Both dignity and respect are assumed to be returned when given to a stranger. This leads to moral inclusiveness, which is good for interactions with strangers because both sides expect the rules of fair play to apply to them. When strangers are considered morally excluded, they are treated almost as nonexistent, or as not deserving of respect or dignity. Moral inclusiveness applies not only to communication, but also to bystanders not actively involved in communication with strangers. For example, if a person makes an anti-prejudice statement, the people he or she is with are less likely to make a prejudiced statement towards a stranger.\n\nLanger states that mindfulness involves creating new categories, an openness to new information, and being aware of strangers' perspectives. Mindfulness is essential for effective communication and one needs to develop mindful ways of learning about strangers. Langer concludes that this should involve: openness to \"novelty\", awareness of distinctions, being sensitive to different contexts, an awareness of multiple perspectives, and an orientation to the present. For example, strangers are usually more mindful and able to \"negotiate potentially problematic social interactions more effectively\" than ingroup members. Therefore, ingroup members should be mindful of the process of communicating as opposed to being mindful of the outcome of the interaction.\n\nThe following five axioms are essential for effective communication because they focus on the basic causes and processes of effective communication whereas the previous 34 axioms focused on managing our anxiety and uncertainty when communicating with strangers.\n\nGudykunst believes that for the theory to be complete there must be a cultural level of analysis included and that the axioms regarding cultural variability should only be tested on the cultural level. It is necessary to address cross-cultural variability in the major components of the theory because different types of anxiety are emphasized more in some cultures than in others. This is because there are differences in the dynamics of stranger-ingroup relationships across cultures. For example, Triandis offers that collectivist cultures tend to make a stronger distinction between ingroup and outgroup members whereas members of individualistic cultures usually only draw as sharp of distinctions among differing ethnic groups.\n\nThere are many ways AUM theory can be applied. It can be effective in studying the behavior of a stranger adjusting to a new culture, as well as in examining how individuals communicate with strangers and often accurately predict their behavior; this is done when we are mindful. Gudykunst explains that some axioms can be combined to form theorems. These theorems that are generated might be consistent with previous research, while others might be useful for future study. He notes that not all axioms can be combined to form a new theorem. Huber and Sorrentino differentiate between certainty–oriented individuals and uncertainty-oriented individuals and argue that theories of interpersonal and intergroup relations have an \"uncertainty orientation\" bias. Gudykunst gives three reasons why AUM theory is not limited to uncertainty-oriented individuals. First, uncertainty-orientation is incorporated into the theory. Second, the superficial causes or factors that influence our uncertainty in a situation influence the amount of uncertainty we feel. Lastly, our personality characteristics influence our behavior only when we are not mindful. Gudykunst also defends the number of axioms in the theory because when the goal of a theory is to improve communication, one cannot afford to be vague. Gudykunst acknowledges that there are certain areas where additional research is needed. For instance, one cannot always be mindful when communicating. Potential problems then refer to the recognition of instances in which mindfulness is needed and defining the optimal levels of anxiety or uncertainty. Future research needs to develop ways to measure an individual's minimum and maximum thresholds of uncertainty and anxiety in the same way that anxiety and uncertainty are measured. AUM theory is in a constant state of revision and even the current version of the theory is not complete.\n\nGriffin identifies the complexity of the AUM theory as a weakness arguing, \"hypothetically, the 47 axioms could spawn over a thousand theorems.\"\n\nPotential expansion of the axioms as a result of incorporation of more cultural variability indicates the possibility of causing greater confusion and complication.\n\nTing-Toomey explores the content of AUM theory as a potential weakness demanding further revision of the theories. She points out five conceptual issues in relation to URT and the social penetration theory.\n\n\nThe AUM theory regards effective communication as a primary construct, defining effective communication as the attribution of the closest meaning to incoming messages as intended by the sender which would minimise misunderstanding. This view leads to two potential problems as the definition of effective communication and effective communication as the goal of ICC.\n\nThere are various reasons for human communication which lead to questioning the possibility and the necessity of attributing the closest meaning to such great variety of communication situations. The AUM theory regards effective communication as attribution of the closest meaning to the intended meaning diminishes communication mechanical and linear activity \"where messages are transferred from sender to receiver\".\n\nAUM theory defines the goal of effective communication as the decrease of miscommunication. Such perspective on communication is mechanical with little emotional attachment, regarding pure communication without misattribution as ideal. As great importance is given to efficiency, culture is referred to as “noise” that obstructs the smooth transition of communication.\n\nAnxiety/uncertainty management theory has been criticised for its heavy focus on the person being mindful during communications, with there being an assumption that a person should have to adopt a high level of consciousness throughout communication. However the theory is difficult to apply to instances where a person is compelled by emotion or irrationality, which overrides conscious thought to reach an end goal during communication.\n\nThe meta-theoretical assumptions specific to Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory have been critiqued by Masaki Yoshitake of the University of Oklahoma, who suggests that anxiety/uncertainty management theory is inherently inefficient when attempting to describe a universal experience shared between strangers and members of different cultures. Yoshitake states that it is questionable whether interpersonal communication is really a pure form of communication and suggests a difficulty to determine what is in the mind of a person from another culture altogether. Yoshitake asserts that pure communication never exists in the first place, as every attempt to share a direct experience is mitigated by the limitations of a person's own perceptions. This results in an ever-present \"otherness\" in communication. Such commentary is a product of Cartesian thought.\n\n"}

Arthropods play many roles in human culture, including as food, in art, in stories, and in mythology and religion. Many of these concern insects, which are important both economically and symbolically, from the work of honeybees to the scarabs of Ancient Egypt. Other arthropods with cultural significance include crustaceans such as crabs, lobsters, and crayfish, which are popular subjects in art, especially still lifes, and arachnids such as spiders and scorpions, whose venom has medical applications. The crab and the scorpion are astrological signs of the zodiac.\n\nCulture consists of the social behaviour and norms found in human societies and transmitted through social learning. Cultural universals in all human societies include expressive forms like art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies like tool usage, cooking, shelter, and clothing. The concept of material culture covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of social organization, mythology, philosophy, literature, and science. This article describes the roles played by arthropods in human culture.\n\nThe arthropods are a phylum of animals with jointed legs; they include the insects, arachnids such as spiders, myriapods, and crustaceans. Insects play many roles in culture including their direct use as food, in medicine, for dyestuffs, and in science, where the common fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\" serves as a model organism for work in genetics and developmental biology.\n\nCrustaceans are an important source of food, providing nearly 10,700,000 tons in 2007; the vast majority of this output is of decapods: crabs, lobsters, shrimps, crayfish, and prawns. Over 60% by weight of all crustaceans caught for consumption are shrimp and prawns, and nearly 80% is produced in Asia, with China alone producing nearly half the world's total. Non-decapod crustaceans are not widely consumed, with only 118,000 tons of krill being caught, despite krill having one of the greatest biomasses on the planet.\n\nCrabs make up 20% of all marine crustaceans caught, farmed, and consumed worldwide, amounting to 1.5 million tonnes annually. One species, \"Portunus trituberculatus\", accounts for one-fifth of that total. Other commercially important taxa include \"Portunus pelagicus\", several species in the genus \"Chionoecetes\", the blue crab (\"Callinectes sapidus\"), \"Charybdis\" spp., \"Cancer pagurus\", the Dungeness crab (\"Metacarcinus magister\"), and \"Scylla serrata\", each of which yields more than 20,000 tonnes annually.\n\nLobsters are caught using baited, one-way traps with a colour-coded marker buoy to mark cages. Lobster is fished in water between , although some lobsters live at . Cages are of plastic-coated galvanised steel or wood. A lobster fisher may tend as many as 2,000 traps. Around 2000, owing to overfishing and high demand, lobster aquaculture expanded. , no lobster aquaculture operation had achieved commercial success, mainly because lobsters eat each other (cannibalism) and the growth of the species is slow.\n\nSpiders are sometimes used as food. Cooked tarantula spiders are considered a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela – provided the highly irritant hairs, the spiders' main defence system, are removed first.\n\nInsects feature in a variety of ways in biomimicry, where for example the cooling system of termite mounds has been imitated in architecture.\n\nSpider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides, as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates. Australian funnel web spiders are a promising source, as most of the world's insect pests have had no opportunity to develop any immunity to their venom, and funnel web spiders thrive in captivity and are easy to \"milk\". It may be possible to target specific pests by engineering genes for the production of spider toxins into viruses that infect species such as cotton bollworms.\n\nBecause spider silk is both light and strong, attempts are being made to produce it in goats' milk and in the leaves of plants, by means of genetic engineering.\n\nThe Ch'ol Maya use a beverage created from the tarantula \"Brachypelma vagans\" for a condition they term 'tarantula wind', the symptoms of which include chest pain, asthma and coughing. The peptide GsMtx-4, found in the venom, has been studied for possible use in cardiac arrhythmia, muscular dystrophy, and glioma. Possible medical uses for other spider venoms have been investigated for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction.\n\nArthropods appear in folklore, in mythology, and in religion. Since Insects in mythology and in religion are covered elsewhere, this section focuses on other arthropods.\n\nBoth the constellation Cancer and the astrological sign Cancer are named after the crab, and depicted as a crab. William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse drew the Crab Nebula in 1848 and noticed its similarity to the animal; the Crab pulsar lies at the centre of the nebula. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature, especially the sea, and often depicted crabs in their art. In Greek mythology, Karkinos was a crab that came to the aid of the Lernaean Hydra as it battled Heracles. One of Rudyard Kipling's \"Just So Stories\", \"The Crab that Played with the Sea\", tells the story of a gigantic crab who made the waters of the sea go up and down, like the tides.\n\nIn the Japanese fairy tale \"My Lord Bag of Rice\", the warrior Fujiwara no Hidesato slays a giant centipede, Ōmukade, to help a dragon princess.\n\nSpiders have been depicted in stories, mythologies and the arts of many cultures for centuries. They have symbolized patience due to their hunting technique of setting webs and waiting for prey, as well as mischief and malice due to their venomous bites. The Italian tarantella is a dance supposedly to rid the young woman of the lustful effects of a bite by the tarantula wolf spider, \"Lycosa tarantula\". Web-spinning caused the association of the spider with creation myths, as they seem to produce their own worlds. Dreamcatchers are depictions of spiderwebs. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature, emphasising animals and often depicting spiders in their art.\n\nThe scorpion appeared as the astrological sign \"Scorpio\", in the twelve signs of the Zodiac, created by Babylonian astronomers during the Chaldean period, around 600 BC. In South Africa and South Asia, the scorpion is a significant animal culturally, appearing as a motif in art, especially in Islamic art in the Middle East. A scorpion motif is often woven into Turkish kilim flatweave carpets, for protection from their sting. The scorpion is perceived both as an embodiment of evil and a protective force that counters evil, such as a dervish's powers to combat evil. In another context, the scorpion portrays human sexuality. Scorpions are used in folk medicine in South Asia especially in antidotes for scorpion stings. In ancient Egypt the goddess Serket was often depicted as a scorpion, one of several goddesses who protected the Pharaoh.\n\nInsects feature in art, in literature, in film, and in music.\n\nThe \"Lobster Quadrille\", also known as \"The Mock Turtle's Song\", is a song recited by the Mock Turtle in \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", chapters 9 and 10, accompanied by a dance.\n\nThe surrealist artist Salvador Dali created a sculpture called \"Lobster Telephone\" with the crustacean in place of the traditional handset, resting in the cradle above the dial. The Surrealist filmmaker Luis Buñuel used scorpions in his 1930 classic \"L'Age d'or\" (\"The Golden Age\").\n"}

{"id": "2587694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2587694", "title": "Bereavement in Judaism", "text": "Bereavement in Judaism\n\nBereavement in Judaism () is a combination of \"minhag\" and \"mitzvah\" derived from Judaism's classical Torah and rabbinic texts. The details of observance and practice vary according to each Jewish community.\n\nIn Judaism, the principal mourners are the first-degree relatives: parent, child, sibling, and spouse. There are some customs that are unique to an individual mourning a parent.\n\nHalachot concerning mourning do not apply to those under thirteen years of age. Also, \"halachos\" of mourning do not apply when the deceased is aged 30 days or less.\n\nUpon receiving the news of the passing, the following blessing is recited:\n\nThere is also a custom of rending one's clothes at the moment one hears news of a passing. Another prevalent custom is to tear at the funeral so that the procedure is done properly.\n\n\nThe \"chevra kadisha\" (Hebrew: חברה קדישא \"holy society\") is a Jewish burial society usually consisting of volunteers, men and women, who prepare the deceased for proper Jewish burial. Their job is to ensure that the body of the deceased is shown proper respect, ritually cleansed, and shrouded.\n\nMany local \"chevra kadishas\" in urban areas are affiliated with local synagogues, and they often own their own burial plots in various local cemeteries. Some Jews pay an annual token membership fee to the \"chevra kadisha\" of their choice, so that when the time comes, the society will not only attend to the body of the deceased as befits Jewish law, but will also ensure burial in a plot that it controls at an appropriate nearby Jewish cemetery.\n\nIf no gravediggers are available, then it is additionally the function of the male society members to ensure that graves are dug. In Israel, members of \"chevra kadishas\" consider it an honor to not only prepare the body for burial but also to dig the grave for a fellow Jew's body, particularly if the deceased was known to be a righteous person.\n\nMany burial societies hold one or two annual fast days, especially the 7th day of Adar, Yartzeit of Moshe Rabbeinu. and organize regular study sessions to remain up to date with the relevant articles of Jewish law. In addition, most burial societies also support families during the \"shiva\" (traditional week of mourning) by arranging prayer services, preparing meals, and providing other services for the mourners.\n\nThere are three major stages to preparing the body for burial: washing (\"rechitzah\"), ritual purification (\"taharah\"), and dressing (\"halbashah\"). The term \"taharah\" is used to refer both to the overall process of burial preparation, and to the specific step of ritual purification.\n\nPrayers and readings from Torah, including Psalms, Song of Songs, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah are recited.\n\nThe general sequence of steps for performing \"taharah\" is as follows.\n\n\nAfter the closing of the casket, the \"chevra\" asks forgiveness of the deceased for any inadvertent lack of honor shown to the deceased in the preparation of the body for burial.\n\nThere is no viewing of the body and no open casket at the funeral. Sometimes the immediate family pay their final respects before the funeral.\nIn Israel caskets are not used at all, with the exception of military and state funerals. Instead, the body is carried to the grave wrapped in a \"tallit\" and placed directly in the earth. In the Diaspora, in general, a casket is only used if required by local law.\n\nFrom death until burial, it is traditional for guards or watchers (\"shomrim\") to stay with the deceased. It is traditional to recite Psalms (\"tehillim\") during this time.\n\nThe Jewish funeral consists of a burial, also known as an interment. Cremation is forbidden. Burial is considered to allow the body to decompose naturally, therefore embalming is forbidden. Burial is intended to take place in as short an interval of time after death as possible. Displaying of the body prior to burial does not take place. Flowers are usually not found at a traditional Jewish funeral but may be seen at statesmen's or heroes' funerals in Israel.\n\nIn Israel, the Jewish funeral service usually commences at the burial ground. In the United States and Canada, the funeral service commences either at a funeral home or at the cemetery. Occasionally the service will commence at a synagogue. In the case of a prominent individual, the funeral service can begin at a synagogue or a yeshivah. If the funeral service begins at a point other than at the cemetery, the entourage accompanies the body in a procession to the cemetery. Usually the funeral ceremony is brief and includes the recitation of psalms, followed by a eulogy, or \"hesped\" and finishes with a traditional closing prayer, the El Moley Rachamim. The funeral, the procession accompanying the body to the place of burial, and the burial, are referred to by the word \"levayah,\" meaning \"escorting.\" \"Levayah\" also indicates \"joining\" and \"bonding.\" This aspect of the meaning of \"levayah\" conveys the suggestion of a commonality among the souls of the living and the dead.\n\nYemenite Jews, prior to their immigration to the land of Israel, maintained an ancient practice during the funeral procession to halt at at least seven stations before the actual burial of the dead, beginning from the entrance of the house from whence the bier is taken, to the graveyard itself. This has come to be known as \"Ma'amad u'Moshav\", (lit. \"Standing and Sitting\"), or \"seven standings and sittings,\" and is mentioned in Tosefta \"Pesahim\" 2: 14-15, during which obsequies only men and boys thirteen years and older took part, but never women. At these stations, the bier is let down by the pallbearers upon the ground, and those accompanying will recite \"\"Hatzur Tamim Pe'ulo\",\" etc. \"\"Ana Bakoach\",\" etc., said in a doleful dirge-like melody, and which verses are followed by one of the party reading certain Midrashic literature and liturgical verse that speaks about death, and which are said to eulogize the deceased.\n\nThe mourners traditionally make a tear (\"keriah\" קריעה) in an outer garment before or at the funeral. The tear should be on the left side (over the heart and clearly visible) for a parent, including foster parents, and on the right side for siblings (including half-brothers and half-sisters), children, and spouses (and does not need to be visible). Non-Orthodox Jews will often make the \"keriah\" in a small black ribbon that is pinned to the lapel rather than in the lapel \"per se\".\n\nIn the instance when a mourner receives the news of the death and burial of a relative after an elapsed period of 30 days or more, there is no \"keriah\", or tearing of the garment, except in the case of a parent. In the case of a parent, the tearing of the garment is to be performed no matter how long a period has elapsed between the time of death and the time of receiving the news.\n\nIf a child of the deceased needs to change clothes during the \"shiva\" period, s/he must tear the changed clothes. No other family member is required to rend changed clothes during \"shiva\". Children of the deceased may never sew the rent clothes, but any other mourner may mend the clothing 30 days after the burial.\n\nA \"hesped\" is a eulogy, and it is common for several people to speak at the start of the ceremony at the funeral home, as well as \nprior to burial at the gravesite.\n\n\"and Abraham came to eulogize Sarah.\" Gen. 23:2 uses the word \"Lispod\" from which is derived the Hebrew term Hesped.\n\nThere is more than one purpose for the eulogy.\n\nSome people specify in their wills that nothing should be said about them.\n\nEulogies are forbidden on certain days; likewise on a Friday afternoon.\n\nSome other times are:\n\nA more general guideline is that when the Tachanun (supplication prayer) is omitted, it is permitted to deliver a brief eulogy emphasizing only the praise of the departed; the extensive eulogy is postponed, and may be said at another time during the year of mourning.\n\n\"Kevura\", or burial, should take place as soon as possible after death. The \"Torah\" requires burial as soon as possible, even for executed criminals. Burial is delayed \"for the honor of the deceased,\" usually to allow more time for far-flung family to come to the funeral and participate in the other post-burial rituals, but also to hire professionals, or to bury the deceased in a cemetery of their choice.\n\nRespect for the dead can be seen from many examples in the \"Torah\" and \"Tanakh\". For example, one of the last events in the \"Torah\" is the death of Moses when God himself buries him: \"[God] buried him in the depression in the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor. No man knows the place that he was buried, even to this day.\"\n\nIn many traditional funerals, the casket will be carried from the hearse to the grave in seven stages. These are accompanied by seven recitations of Psalm 91. There is a symbolic pause after each stage (which are omitted on days when a eulogy would also not be recited.)\n\nWhen the funeral service has ended, the mourners come forward to fill the grave. Symbolically, this gives the mourners closure as they observe, or participate in, the filling of the grave site. One custom is for all people present at the funeral to take a spade or shovel, held pointing down instead of up, to show the antithesis of death to life and that this use of the shovel is different from all other uses, to throw three shovelfuls of dirt into the grave.\n\nSome have the custom to initially use the shovel \"backwards\" for the first few shovelfuls. Even within those who do it, some limit this to just the first few participants.\n\nWhen someone is finished, they put the shovel back in the ground, rather than handing it to the next person, to avoid passing along their grief to other mourners. This literal participation in the burial is considered a particularly good mitzvah because it is one for which the beneficiary — the deceased — can offer no repayment or gratitude and thus it is a pure gesture.\n\nSome have a custom, once the grave is filled, to make a rounded topping shape.\n\nAfter burial, the Tziduk Hadin prayer may be recited affirming that Divine Judgment is righteous. The family of deceased may then be comforted by other mourners with the formula:\n\nThe first stage of mourning is \"aninut\", or \"intense mourning.\" \"Aninut\" lasts until the burial is over, or, if a mourner is unable to attend the funeral, from the moment he is no longer involved with the funeral itself.\n\nAn \"onen\" (a person in \"aninut\") is considered to be in a state of total shock and disorientation. Thus the \"onen\" is exempt from performing mitzvot that require action (and attention), such as praying and reciting blessings, wearing \"tefillin\" (phylacteries), in order to be able to tend unhindered to the funeral arrangements. However the \"onen\" is still obligated in commandments that forbid an action (such as not violating the Shabbat).\n\n\"Aninut\" is immediately followed by \"avelut\" (\"mourning\"). An \"avel\" (\"mourner\") does not listen to music or go to concerts, and does not attend any joyous events or parties such as marriages or Bar or Bat Mitzvahs, unless absolutely necessary. (If the date for such an event has already been set prior to the death, it is strictly forbidden for it to be postponed or cancelled.)\n\n\"Avelut\" consists of three distinct periods.\n\nThe first stage of \"avelut\" is \"shiva\" (), a week-long period of grief and mourning. Observance of \"shiva\" is referred to by English-speaking Jews as \"sitting \"shiva\"\". During this period, mourners traditionally gather in one home and receive visitors.\n\nWhen they get home, the mourners refrain for a week from showering or bathing, wearing leather shoes or jewelry, or shaving. In many communities, mirrors in the mourners' home are covered since they should not be concerned about their personal appearance. It is customary for the mourners to sit on low stools or even the floor, symbolic of the emotional reality of being \"brought low\" by the grief. The meal of consolation (\"seudat havra'ah\"), the first meal eaten on returning from the funeral, traditionally consists of hard-boiled eggs and other round or oblong foods. This is often credited to the Biblical story of Jacob purchasing the birthright from Esau with stewed lentils (Genesis 25:34); it is traditionally stated that Jacob was cooking the lentils soon after the death of his grandfather Abraham. During this seven-day period, family and friends come to visit or call on the mourners to comfort them (\"\"shiva\" calls\").\n\nIt is considered a great \"mitzvah\" (commandment) of kindness and compassion to pay a home visit to the mourners. Traditionally, no greetings are exchanged and visitors wait for the mourners to initiate conversation. The mourner is under no obligation to engage in conversation and may, in fact, completely ignore his/her visitors.\n\nVisitors will traditionally take on the hosting role when attending a Shiva, often bringing food and serving it to the mourning family and other guests. The mourning family will often avoid any cooking or cleaning during the Shiva period; those responsibilities become those of visitors.\n\nThere are various customs as to what to say when taking leave of the mourner(s). One of the most common is to say to them:\n\nDepending on their community's customs, others may also add such wishes as: \"You should have no more \"tza'ar\" (distress)\" or \"You should have only \"simchas\" (celebrations)\" or \"we should hear only \"besorot tovot\" (good tidings) from each other\" or \"I wish you a long life\".\n\nTraditionally, prayer services are organized in the house of mourning. It is customary for the family to lead the services themselves.\n\nIf the mourner returns from the cemetery after the burial before sundown, then the day of the funeral is counted as the first of the seven days of mourning. Mourning generally concludes in the morning of the seventh day. No mourning may occur on Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath), nor may the burial take place on Shabbat, but the day of Shabbat does count as one of the seven days. If a Jewish holiday occurs after the first day, that curtails the mourning period. If the funeral occurs during a festival, the start of the mourning period is delayed to the end of the festival. Some holidays, such as Rosh Hashanah, cancel the mourning period completely.\n\nThe thirty-day period following burial (including \"shiva\") is known as \"shloshim\" (). During \"shloshim\", a mourner is forbidden to marry or to attend a \"seudat mitzvah\" (religious festive meal). Men do not shave or get haircuts during this time.\n\nSince Judaism teaches that a deceased person can still benefit from the merit of \"mitzvot\" (commandments) performed in their memory, it is considered a special privilege to bring merit to the departed by learning Torah in their name. A popular custom is to coordinate a group of people who will jointly study the complete Mishnah during the \"shloshim\" period. This is due to the fact that \"Mishnah\" (משנה) and \"Neshamah\" (נשמה), soul, have the same (Hebrew) letters.\n\nThose mourning a parent additionally observe a twelve-month period (), counted from the day of death. During this period, most activity returns to normal, although the mourners continue to recite the mourner's kaddish as part of synagogue services for eleven months. In Orthodox tradition, this is an obligation of the sons (not daughters) as mourners. There remain restrictions on attending festive occasions and large gatherings, especially where live music is performed.\n\nA headstone (tombstone) is known as a \"matzevah\" (monument). Although there is no Halakhic obligation to hold an unveiling ceremony (the ritual became popular in many communities toward the end of the 19th century), there are varying customs about when it should be placed on the grave. Most communities have an unveiling ceremony a year after the death. Some communities have it earlier, even a week after the burial. In Israel it is done after the \"shloshim\" (the first 30 days of mourning). There is no universal restriction about the timing, other than the unveiling cannot be held during Shabbat, (work-restricted) Jewish holidays, or Chol Ha'Moed.\n\nAt the end of the ceremony, a cloth or shroud covering that has been placed on the headstone is removed, customarily by close family members. Services include reading of several psalms. Gesher HaChaim cites (chapters) \"33, 16, 17, 72, 91, 104, and 130; then one says Psalm 119 and recites the verses that spell the name of the deceased and the letters of the word \"Neshama\".\". This is followed by the Mourner's Kaddish (if a \"minyan\" is available), and the prayer \"El Malei Rachamim\". The service may include a brief eulogy for the deceased.\n\nOriginally, it was not common practice to place names on tombstones. The general custom for engraving the name of the deceased on the monument is a practice that goes back (only) \"the last several hundred years.\"\n\nJewish communities in Yemen, prior to their immigration to the Land of Israel, did not place headstones over the graves of the dead, except only on rare occasions, choosing rather to follow the dictum of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel who said: “They do not build monuments (i.e. tombstones) for the righteous. Their words, lo! They are their memorial!” Philosopher and Halachic decisor, Maimonides, likewise, ruled that it is not permissible to raise headstones over the graves of righteous men, but permits doing so for ordinary men. In contrast, the more recent custom of Spanish Jewry, following the teachings of the Ari z”l (\"Shaʿar Ha-Mitzvot, Parashat Vayeḥi\"), is to build tombstones over the grave, seeing it as part of the complete atonement and amendment for those who have died. Likewise, Rabbi Shelomo b. Avraham Aderet (RASHBA) wrote that it is a way of showing honor to the dead. In this manner the custom did spread, especially among the Jews of Spain, North Africa and Ashkenaz. Today, in Israel, all Jewish graves are marked with headstones.\n\n\"Yahrtzeit\", יאָרצײַט, means \"Time (of) Year\" in Yiddish. Alternative spellings include \"yortsayt\" (using the YIVO standard Yiddish orthography), \"Jahrzeit\" (in German), \"Yohr Tzeit\", \"yahrzeit\", and \"yartzeit\". The word is used by Yiddish speaking Jews, and refers to the anniversary of the day of death of a relative. Yahrtzeit literally means \"time of [one] year\".\n\nThe commemoration is known in Hebrew as \"nachala\" (\"legacy,\" or \"inheritance\"). This term is used by most Sephardic Jews, although some use the Ladino terms \"meldado\" or less commonly, \"anyos\" (\"years\"). It is widely observed, and based on the Jewish tradition that mourners are required to commemorate the death of a relative.\n\nJews are required to commemorate the death of parents, siblings, spouses, or children. \n\nThe \"Yahrtzeit\" usually falls annually on the Hebrew date of the deceased relative's death according to the Hebrew calendar. There are questions that arise as to what the date should be if this date falls on Rosh Chodesh or in a leap year of the Hebrew calendar. In particular, there are a few permutations, as follows:\n\nYahrzeit is done each year, for a full day on the date of death according to the Hebrew calendar. The Synagogue notifies members of the secular date.\n\nThe main \"halachic\" obligation is to recite the mourner's version of the \"Kaddish\" prayer three times (evening of the previous day, morning, and afternoon), and many attend synagogue for the evening, morning, and afternoon services on this day.\n\nDuring the morning prayer service the mourner's Kaddish is recited at least three times, two that are part of the daily service and one that is added in a house of mourning. Both there and in the synagogue, another Kaddish, the Rabbi's Kaddish, is also said in the morning service once in Nusach Ashkenaz and twice in Sfard/Sfardi.\n\nAs a widely practiced custom, mourners also light a special candle that burns for 24 hours, called a \"\"Yahrzeit\" candle\".\n\nLighting a yahrtzeit candle in memory of a loved one is a \"minhag\" (\"custom\") that is deeply ingrained in Jewish life honoring the memory and souls of the deceased.\n\nSome Jews believe that strict Jewish law requires that one should fast on the day of a parent's Yahrzeit; although most believe this is not required, some people do observe the custom of fasting on the day of the \"Yahrtzeit\", or at least refraining from meat and wine. Among many Orthodox Jews it has become customary to make a siyum by completing a tractate of Talmud or a volume of the Mishnah on the day prior to the \"Yahrtzeit\", in the honor of the deceased. A \"halakha\" requiring a \"siyum\" (\"celebratory meal\"), upon the completion of such a study, overrides the requirement to fast.\n\nMany synagogues will have lights on a special memorial plaque on one of the synagogue's walls, with names of synagogue members who have died. Each of these lights will be lit for individuals on their \"Yahrzeit\" (and in some synagogues, the entire Hebrew month). All the lights will be lit for a \"Yizkor\" service. Some synagogues will also turn on all the lights for memorial days, such as \"Yom Ha'Shoah\".\n\nSome have a custom to visit the cemetery on fast days (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 559:10) and before Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur (581:4, 605), when possible, and for a \"Yahrzeit.\" During the first year the grave is often visited on the shloshim, and the yartzeit (but may be visited at any time).\n\nEven when visiting Jewish graves of someone that the visitor never knew, the custom is to place a small stone on the grave using the left hand. This shows that someone visited the gravesite, and is also a way of participating in the mitzvah of burial. Leaving flowers is not a traditional Jewish practice. Another reason for leaving stones is to tend the grave. In Biblical times, gravestones were not used; graves were marked with mounds of stones (a kind of cairn), so by placing (or replacing) them, one perpetuated the existence of the site.\n\nThe tradition to travel to the graveside on the occasion of a Yahrzeit is ancient.\n\nKaddish Yatom (\"heb.\" קדיש יתום \"lit. \"Orphan's Kaddish\"\") or the \"Mourner's\" Kaddish, is said at all prayer services, as well as at funerals and memorials. Customs for reciting the Mourner's Kaddish vary markedly among various communities. In many Ashkenazi synagogues, particularly Orthodox ones, it is customary that everyone in the synagogue stands. In Sephardi synagogues, most people sit for most sayings of Kaddish. In many non-Orthodox Ashkenaz ones, the custom is that only the mourners themselves stand and chant, while the rest of the congregation sits, chanting only responsively. \n\nIn many Sephardic communities, Hashkabóth (\"remembrance\") prayers are recited for the deceased in the year following death, on the deceased's death anniversary (\"nahalah\" or \"años\"), and upon request by the deceased's relatives. Some Sephardic communities also recite Hashkabóth for all their deceased members on Yom Kippur, even those who died many years before.\n\n\"Yizkor\" (\"remembrance\") prayers are recited by those that have lost either one or both of their parents. These may additionally says Yizkor for other relatives. Some might also say Yizkor for a deceased close friend. It is customary in many communities for those with both parents alive to leave the synagogue during the Yizkor service while it is said.\"\n\nThe Yizkor prayers are recited four times a year, and are intended to be recited in a synagogue with a minyan; if one is unable to be with a minyan, one can recite it without one. These four Yizkor services are held on Yom Kippur, Shemini Atzeret, on the last day of Passover, and on Shavuot (the second day of Shavuot, in communities that observe Shavuot for two days).\n\nThe \"El Malei Rachamim\" prayer, in which God is asked to remember and grant repose to the souls of the departed, is recited as the primary prayer of the \"Yizkor\" services.\n\nYizkor is customarily not said within the first year of mourning, until the first \"yahrzeit\" has passed. This practice is a custom and historically not regarded to be obligatory.\n\nIn Sephardic custom there is no Yizkor prayer, but the \"Hashkabóth\" serve a similar role in the service.\n\nAv Harachamim is a Jewish memorial prayer that was written in the late 11th Century, after the destruction of the German Jewish communities around the Rhine river by Crusaders. It is recited on many Shabbatot before Musaf, and also at the end of the Yizkor service.\n\nMost Jewish communities of size have non-profit organizations that maintain cemeteries and provide \"chevra kadisha\" services for those in need. They are often formed out of a synagogue's women's group.\n\nZAKA (heb. זק\"א \"abbr. for Zihui Korbanot Asson lit. \"Identifying Victims of Disaster\"\" – חסד של אמת \"Hessed shel Emet lit. \"True Kindness\"\" – איתור חילוץ והצלה), is a community emergency response team in the State of Israel, officially recognized by the government. The organization was founded in 1989. Members of ZAKA, most of whom are Orthodox, assist ambulance crews, identify the victims of terrorism, road accidents and other disasters and, where necessary, gather body parts and spilled blood for proper burial. They also provide first aid and rescue services, and help with the search for missing persons. In the past they have responded in the aftermath of disasters around the world.\n\nThe Hebrew Free Burial Association is a non-profit agency whose mission is to ensure that all Jews receive a proper Jewish burial, regardless of their financial ability. Since 1888, more than 55,000 Jews have been buried by HFBA in their cemeteries located on Staten Island, New York, Silver Lake Cemetery and Mount Richmond Cemetery.\n\nFormed in 1854 for the purpose of \"…procuring a piece of ground suitable for the purpose of a burying ground for the deceased of their own faith, and also to appropriate a portion of their time and means to the holy cause of benevolence…,\" the Hebrew Benevolent Society of Los Angeles established the first Jewish cemetery in Los Angeles at Lilac Terrace and Lookout Drive in Chavez Ravine (current home to Dodger Stadium). In 1968, a plaque was installed at the original site, identifying it as California Historical Landmark #822.\n\nIn 1902, because of poor environmental conditions due to the unchecked expansion of the oil industry in the area, it was proposed by Congregation B'nai B'rith to secure a new plot of land in what is now East LA, and to move the buried remains to the new site, with a continued provision for burial of indigent people. This site, the Home of Peace Memorial Park, remains operational and is the oldest Jewish cemetery in Los Angeles. The original society is now known as the \"Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles\".\n\nBeing an organ donor is absolutely prohibited by some, and permitted, in principle, by others.\n\nAccording to some Jewish denominations, once death has been clearly established, provided that instructions have been left in a written living will, donation may be done. However, there are a number of practical difficulties for those who wish to adhere strictly to Jewish law. For example, someone who is dead by clinical standards may not yet be dead according to Jewish law. Jewish law does not permit donation of organs that are vital for survival from a donor who is in a near-dead state but who is not yet dead according to Jewish law. Orthodox and Haredi Jews may need to consult their rabbis on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSince 2001, with the founding of the Halachic Organ Donor Society, organ donation has become more common in modern orthodox Jewish communities, especially with the support of rabbis like Moshe Tendler and Norman Lamm.\n\nHalakha (Jewish law) forbids cremation.\n\nAn ancient historian described as \"a distinguishing characteristic\" that \n\"Jews buried, rather than burned, their dead.\" Judaism stresses burial in the earth (included entombment, as in caves) as a religious duty of laying a person's remains to rest. This, as well as the belief that the human body is created in the image of the divine and is not to be vandalized before or after death, teaches the belief that it was necessary to keep the whole body intact in burial, in anticipation of the eventual resurrection of the dead in the messianic age. Nevertheless, some Jews who are not religiously adherent, or who have attached to an alternative movement or religious stream that does not see some or all the laws of the Torah as binding upon them, have chosen cremation, either for themselves prior to death, or for their loved ones, a choice made in 2016 by more than 50% of non-Jews in the United States.\n\nAs Judaism considers suicide to be a form of murder, a Jew who commits suicide is denied some important after-death privileges: No eulogies should be given for the deceased, and burial in the main section of the Jewish cemetery is normally not allowed.\n\nIn recent times, most people who die by suicide have been deemed to be the unfortunate victims of depression or of a serious mental illness. Under this interpretation, their act of \"self-murder\" is not deemed to be a voluntary act of self-destruction, but rather the result of an involuntary condition. They have therefore been looked upon as having died of causes beyond their control.\n\nAdditionally, the Talmud (in Semakhot, one of the minor tractates) recognizes that many elements of the mourning ritual exist as much for the living survivors as for the dead, and that these elements ought to be carried out even in the case of the suicide.\n\nFurthermore, if reasonable doubt exists that the death may not have been suicide or that the deceased might have changed her mind and repented at the last moment (e.g., if it is unknown whether the victim fell or jumped from a building, or if the person falling changed her mind mid-fall), the benefit of the doubt is given and regular burial and mourning rituals take place. Lastly, the suicide of a minor is considered a result of a lack of understanding (\"da'at\"), and in such a case, regular mourning is observed.\n\nHalakha (Jewish law) forbids tattoos, and there is a persistent myth that this prevents burial in a Jewish cemetery, but this is not true. A small minority of burial societies will not accept a corpse with a tattoo, but Jewish law does not mention burial of tattooed Jews, and nearly all burial societies have no such restriction. Removing the tattoo of a deceased Jew is forbidden as it would be considered \"damaging the body\". This case has been one of public interest in the current generations due to the large population tattooed in Nazi concentration camps between 1940 and 1945. However, it must be noted that, since those tattoos were forced upon the recipients in a situation where any resistance could expect official murder or brutality, their presence is not in any way reflective of any violation of Jewish law on the part of both the living and deceased; rather under these circumstances it shows adherence to the positive command to preserve innocent life, including one's own, by passively allowing the mark to be applied.\n\nThere is no mourning for an Apostate Jew according to Jewish law. (See that article for a discussion of precisely what actions and motivations render a Jew an \"apostate.\")\n\nIn the past several centuries, the custom developed among Ashkenazic Orthodox Jews (including Hassidic and Haredi Jews), that the family would \"sit shiva\" if and when one of their relatives would leave the fold of traditional Judaism. The definition of \"leaving the fold\" varies within communities; some would sit \"shiva\" if a family member married a non-Jew; others would only sit \"shiva\" if the individual actually converted to another faith, and even then, some would make a distinction between those who chose to do so of their own will, and those who were pressured into conversion. (In Sholom Aleichem's Tevye, when the title character's daughter converts to Christianity to marry a Christian, Tevye sits \"shiva\" for her and generally refers to her as \"dead.\") At the height of the Mitnagdim (anti-Hassidic) movement, in the early-to-mid nineteenth century, some Mitnagdim even sat \"shiva\" if a family member joined Hassidism. (It is said that when Leibel Eiger joined Hassidism, his father, Rabbi Shlomo Eiger sat \"shiva\", but his grandfather, the famed Rabbi Akiva Eiger, did not. It is also said that Leibel Eiger came to be \"menachem avel\" [console the mourner]). By the mid-twentieth century, however, Hassidism was recognized as a valid form of Orthodox Judaism, and thus the (controversial) practice of sitting \"shiva\" for those who realign to Hassidism ceased to exist.\n\nToday, some Orthodox Jews, particularly the more traditional ones (such as many Haredi and Hassidic communities), continue the practice of sitting \"shiva\" for a family member who has left the religious community. More liberal Jews, however, may question the practice, eschewing it as a very harsh act that could make it much more difficult for the family member to return to traditional practice if/when s/he would consider doing so.\n\nThe Rohr Jewish Learning Institute teaches courses on the spiritual purpose of bereavement and the soul after death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYizkor definition\n\n\n"}
{"id": "920487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=920487", "title": "Blood brother", "text": "Blood brother\n\nBlood brother can refer to one of two things: a male related by birth, or two or more men not related by birth who have sworn loyalty to each other. This is in modern times usually done in a ceremony, known as a blood oath, where each person makes a small cut, usually on a finger, hand or the forearm, and then the two cuts are pressed together and bound, the idea being that each person's blood now flows in the other participant's veins. The act may carry a risk due to blood-borne diseases. In modern times, some gangs have also been rumored to make blood pacts. The process usually provides a participant with a heightened symbolic sense of attachment with another participant.\n\nThe Norsemen entering into the pact of foster brotherhood () involved a rite whereby they let their blood flow while they ducked underneath an arch formed by a strip of turf propped up by a spear or spears. An example is described in \"Gísla saga\". In \"Fóstbræðra saga\", the bond of Thorgeir Havarsson (Þorgeir Hávarsson) and Thormod Bersason (Þormóð Bersason) is sealed by such ritual as well, the ritual being called a \"leikr\".\n\n\"Örvar-Oddr's saga\" contains another notable account of blood brotherhood. Örvar-Oddr, after fighting the renowned Swedish warrior Hjalmar to a draw, entered into foster-brotherhood with him \n\nIn the mythology of northern Europe, Gunther and Högni became the blood brothers of Sigurd when he married their sister Gudrun; in Wagner's \"Ring Cycle\", the same occurs between Gunther and Wagner's version of Sigurd, Siegfried, which is marked by the \"Blood Brotherhood Leitmotiv\". Additionally, it is briefly stated in Lokasenna that Odin and Loki are blood brothers.\n\nAmong the Scythians, the covenantors would allow their blood to drip into a cup; the blood was subsequently mixed with wine and drunk by both participants. Every man was limited to having at most three blood brotherhoods at any time, lest his loyalties be distrusted; as a consequence, blood brotherhood was highly sought after and often preceded by a lengthy period of affiliation and friendship (Lucian, \"Toxaris\"). \n4th-century BC depictions of two Scythian warriors drinking from a single drinking horn (most notably in a gold appliqué from Kul-Oba) have been associated with the Scythian oath of blood brotherhood.\n\nThe Hungarian hajduks had a similar ceremony, though the wine was often replaced with milk so that the blood would be more visible.\n\nIn Asian cultures, the act and ceremony of becoming blood brothers is generally seen as a tribal relationship, that is, to bring about alliance between tribes. It was practiced for this reason most notably among the Mongols and early Chinese.\n\nIn Romance of the Three Kingdoms\",\" the Chinese classical literature, the three main characters took an oath of blood brother. In Mongolian history, Genghis Khan the Great had an anda, blood brother in Mongolian.\n\nThe blood oath was used in much the same fashion as has already been described in much of \nSub-Saharan Africa. The British colonial administrator Lord Lugard is famous for having become blood brothers with numerous African chiefs as part of his political policy while in Africa. A powerful blood brother of his was the \nKikuyu chieftain Waiyaki Wa Hinga.\n\nThere may be some evidence that Native Americans performed blood oathes to bring about alliances between tribes.\n\nBlood brothers among larger groups were common in ancient Southeastern Europe where, for example, whole companies of soldiers would become one family through the ceremony. It was perhaps most prevalent in the Balkans during the Ottoman era, as it helped the oppressed people to fight the enemy more effectively; blood brotherhoods were common in what is today Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Montenegro, Serbia, Republic of Macedonia. Christianity also recognized sworn brotherhood in a ceremony (known as , in the Eastern Orthodox churches; known as in the Roman Catholic church). The tradition of intertwining arms and drinking wine is also believed to be a representation of becoming blood brothers.\n\nBlood brotherhood, highly ritualized and subjected to a strong code, was a common practice in the Caucasus, especially among the mountaineers. Some relics of this tradition survive to this day.\n\n\n\n"}

This generation resonates with Generation X and Millennials in the Western world. They were born at a time when the middle class had the majority, higher education was extremely valued and hard work would promise a bright future.\n\nThe Burnt Generation shaped their future dreams based on their parents' values and lifestyle. These values described success, convenience and social acceptance as simply achievable goals through hard work and right education. Their parents, a Baby Boomer-like generation, had rebuilt the country after World War II, established public education and women’s rights, nationalized the oil industry, and enhanced the public health system. Although there was a growing dissatisfaction with the government and Shah’s approach to a variety of political and social issues, the public's assumption was that those issues would be resolved through a democratic system.\n\nAfter the Shah's exile in the 1979 revolution, the clash between various political groups and new government created a suspicious environment that deeply affected the beliefs and values of the Burnt Generation. They are marked by lack of optimism for the future, nihilism, cynicism, skepticism, political apathy, alienation and distrust in traditional values and institutions which describe the similarities between Gen X and the Burnt Generation.\n\nAnother important event that influenced this generation was the Cultural Revolution and the shutting down colleges and universities for several years. After reopening, every applicant had to pass an interview with the government-approved committees and women were only allowed to apply for certain limited majors. At that time, many of Burnt Generation, ranged between 13 and 25 years old, were fighting in the Iran–Iraq War, which lasted from 1980 to 1988 with a million casualties on both sides.\n\nAs a result of growing up in that environment, they either have strong religious beliefs or are completely distrustful of religion and God. Some believe in God but disconnect themselves from any religious beliefs or groups. Their most common values include loyalty to family and friends, compassion, and high work ethics. The uncertainties of their future, either for those who lived in Iran or elsewhere, leave a deep sense of insecurity in the Burnt Generation.\n"}
{"id": "57976171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57976171", "title": "Chu (Daoism)", "text": "Chu (Daoism)\n\nChu (廚, lit. \"kitchen\") is a Daoist name used for various religious practices including communal \"chu\" (Kitchen) banquet rituals in Way of the Celestial Masters liturgy, the legendary \"xingchu\" (行廚, Mobile Kitchen) associated with Daoist \"xian\" (\"transcendents; 'immortals'\"), and \"wuchu\" (五廚, Five Kitchens) representing the \"wuzang\" (五臟, Five Viscera) in \"neidan\" meditation techniques.\n\n\"Chú\" (\"kitchen; to cook; a cook\") can be written with three Chinese characters 廚, 㕑, and 厨. The common traditional Chinese character 廚 combines the \"house radical\" 广 with a phonetic indicator \"shù\" 尌 (joining \"zhù\" 壴 \"drum\" and \"cùn\" 寸 \"hand\"); and the variant traditional character 㕑 has \"cliff radical\" 厂 instead of 广. The simplified Chinese character 厨 omits the 士 element in 壴, leading to a \"graphic folk etymology\" of \"A 厂 'room' for cooking 豆 'beans' with your 寸 'hands'.\" (Bishop 2016). The Chinese logograph 廚 was anciently used as a loan character for \"chú\" 櫥 (with the \"wood radical\" 木, \"cabinet\") or \"chú\" 幮 (\"cloth radical\" 巾, \"a screen used for a temporary kitchen\").\n\nThe Modern Standard Chinese lexicon uses \"chu\" in many compound words, for instance, \"chúfáng\" (廚房 with 房 \"room\", \"kitchen\"), \"chúshī\" (廚師 with 師 \"master\", \"cook; chef\"), \"chúdāo\" (廚刀 with 刀 \"knife\", \"kitchen knife\"), and \"páochú\" (庖廚 with 庖 \"kitchen\", meaning \"kitchen\").\n\nIn Daoist specialized vocabulary, \"chu\" names a Kitchen-feast communal meal, and sometimes has a technical meaning of \"magic\", \"used to designate the magical recipes through which one becomes invisible\" (Maspero 1981: 290). The extensive semantic field of \"chu\" can be summarized in some key Daoist expressions: ritual banquets, communion with divinities, granaries (\"zang\" 藏, a word that also denotes the viscera), visualization of the Five Viscera (\"wuzang\" 五臟, written with the \"flesh radical\" ⺼), and abstention from cereals (\"bigu\"), and other food proscriptions (Mollier 2008a: 279). According to Daoist classics, when \"bigu\" \"grain avoidance\" techniques were successful, \"xingchu\" (行廚, Mobile Kitchens or \"tianchu\" (天廚, Celestial Kitchens) were brought in gold and jade vessels by the \"yunü\" (玉女, Jade Women) and \"jintong\" (金僮, Golden Boys), associated with the legendary Jade Emperor (Despeux 2008: 233-234).\n\nChinese Buddhist terminology applies \"chu\" (廚, cf. 櫥 \"cabinet\") \"kitchen; kitchen cupboard\" to denote the \"cabinet for an image or relic of the Buddhas\", translating Sanskrit \"bhakta-śālā\" \"food-hall\" or \"mahânasa\" \"kitchen\" (Digital Dictionary of Buddhism).\n\nIn Chinese astronomy, \"Tiānchú\" (天廚, Celestial Kitchen) is the name of an asterism in the constellation Draco, located next to \"Tiānbàng\" (天棓, Celestial Flail), and \"Nèichú\" (內廚, Inner Kitchen).\n\nThere is no standard English translation for either Daoist \"chu\" (廚, Kitchen) or \"xingchu\" (行廚, Mobile Kitchen). The former is rendered as:\nThese Anglophone scholars render Chinese \"chu\" as either English \"kitchen\" (\"a room for preparing food\"), optionally clarified with \"K-\", -\"festival\" or -\"feast\", or \"cusine\" (\"a characteristic style of cooking, often associated with a place of origin\"). The latter follows Francophone sinologists, for instance Maspero (1971) and Mollier (1999), who accurately translated Chinese \"chu\" as French \"cuisine\" (\"kitchen; cooking\") and \"xingchu\" as \"cusine de voyage\" (\"travel kitchen\"). Although English \"kitchen\" and French \"cuisine\" are doublets deriving from Latin \"cocīna\" (\"cooking; kitchen\"), they are false friends with significant semantic differences between English \"kitchen\" and \"cuisine\". Chinese usually translates English \"kitchen\" as chúfáng (廚房, \"kitchen\") and \"cuisine\" as \"pēngrèn\" (烹飪, \"art of cooking\").\nThe term \"xingchu\" (行廚) has been translated as\nJoseph Needham calls Ware's \"Traveling Canteen\" a \"bizarre translation\" (1976: 29). While Maspero uniquely interprets the \"xing\" (行) in \"xingchu\" as a verb (\"to perform\"), the other scholars read it as a modifier (\"to go; to move\") translated as \"traveling\", \"mobile\", or \"movable\" (cf. \"movable feast\"). The \"chu\" noun in \"xingchu\" is translated as English \"kitchen\", \"cuisine\", or \"canteen\". However, the latter ambiguous word has several meanings besides \"canteen\" (\"a cafeteria or snack bar provided by an organization\"), \"canteen\" (\"a small water bottle\"), and British English \"canteen\" (\"a case or box containing a cutlery set\"). To further complicate translating \"xingchu\", \"travelling canteen\" was the 18th-century equivalent of a picnic basket. In modern terms, the \"xingchu\" is comparable with a mobile kitchen (Sivin's translation), military field kitchen, food truck, or food cart.\n\nThe \"chu\" (廚, Kitchen), also known as \"fushi\" (福食, \"good luck meal\"), was a religious banquet that usually involved preliminary fasting and purification before consuming a meal of vegetarian food and Chinese wine. The banquet was hosted by families on the occasion of births and deaths, prepared for a ritually-fixed number of parishioners, and accompanied by specific ritual gifts to the Daoist priest. Although the Kitchen Feast became a regular element of organized Daoist religious traditions, scholars do not know the date when it was introduced into the liturgy. One early textual record is the c. 499 \"Zhen'gao\" saying that Xu Mi (許谧, 303-376) offered a Kitchen meal to five persons (Stein 1979: 57). \n\nThese communal \"chu\" Kitchen banquets have a pre-Daoist antecedent in popular Chinese folk religion: the term \"chu\" was anciently used for the ceremonial meals organized by communities to honor the \"she\" (社, God of the Soil). Although orthodox Daoists criticized, and sometimes banned, these \"chuhui\" (廚會, \"cuisine congregations\") for making immoral animal sacrifices, they nevertheless perpetuated the custom by adapting and codifying it (Mollier 2008a: 279). \"Chu\" kitchen-feasts have many features in common with another Daoist ritual meal, the \"zhāi\" (齋, \"fast; purification; retreat\"), and the two are frequently treated as having the same functions. The 7th-century Daoist \"Zhaijielu\" (齋戒錄, Records of Fasting) suggested that \"zhai\" were anciently called \"shehui\" (社會, \"festival gatherings of the soil god\"—now the modern Chinese word for \"society\"), which was later changed into \"zhaihui\" (齋會) (Stein 1979: 75).\nThe Way of the Celestial Masters religion, founded by Zhang Daoling in 142 CE, celebrated \"chu\" kitchen festivals at New Year and the annual \"sanhui\" (三會, Three Assemblies), which were major Daoist festivals held in the first, seventh, and tenth lunar months, when believers assembled at their local parish to report any births, deaths, or marriages, so that the population registers could be updated. Parishioners who had reason to celebrate on these occasions would host a \"chu\" feast for other members of the community in proportion to the significance of their auspicious event and their means. Accounts of these banquets \"emphasize both the sharing of food and the affirmation of the unique, religious merit-based social order of the Daoist community\" (Kleeman 2008: 839-840).\n\nThe \"chu\" sacrament had three levels of banquets and ritual gifts, depending upon what the family was celebrating. For the birth of a boy, the \"shangchu\" (上廚, Superior Ceremony of the Kitchen) was a banquet offered to the priest and ten members of the parish, with gifts to the priest of a hundred sheets of paper, a pair of ink brushes, an inkstick, and an ink scraper. For the birth of a girl, it was the less expensive \"zhongchu\" (中廚, Middle Ceremony of the Kitchen) with a banquet for five parishioners, and the gifts, which the parents had to provide within one month following the birth, were a mat, a wastebasket, and a broom. For the death of a family member, the \"xiachu\" (下廚, Inferior Ceremony of the Kitchen), also called \"jiechu\" (解廚, Kitchen of Deliverance), is not described in Daoist texts, and we only know that the rival Buddhist polemicists claimed it was a \"great orgy\" (Maspero 1981: 290). \n\nThe anti-Daoist \"Erjiaolun\" (二教論, Essay on Two Religions) by the Buddhist monk Dao'an (312–385) said \"chu\" kitchen-feasts were intended to bring about \"jiěchú\" (解除, \"liberation and elimination\") from pollution and sins, which were connected with the soil god and tombs (Stein 1979: 71). The parallel passage in the 6th-century \"Bianhuolun\" (辯惑論, Essay on Debating Doubts) uses the homophonous graphic variant of \"jiěchú\" (解廚, \"liberation kitchen\"), thus connecting both \"chú\" \"kitchen\" and \"chú\" \"liberation\" to non-Daoist gods of the soil (Stein 1979: 74).\n\nDaoist sources record that the people invited to a \"chu\" Kitchen feast would first observe a period of purification that included fasting and abstention from sex. Kitchen rituals lasted for one, three, or seven days. Participants consumed exclusively vegetarian food and moderate amounts of wine, which was considered as a mandatory element of the banquet (Mollier 2008a: 279). For the Superior Kitchens five \"sheng\" of wine (about a liter) per person was planned, for the Middle Kitchens, four \"sheng\", and for the Inferior Kitchen three. The participants \"must have departed a bit happy, but not drunk.\" (Maspero 1981: 290). The leftovers were given to other parishioners who could thereby share in the ritual. \n\nBesides annual festivals on fixed dates like the Three Assemblies, \"chu\" Kitchen ceremonies were also performed in special circumstances, particularly when there was disease, sin, or death pollution. They were believed to have exorcistic and salvific powers and to confer good luck or merit upon the adepts (Mollier 2008a: 279). Kitchen ceremonies often involved Daoist ritual \"jiao\" (醮, \"offerings\") of cakes and pieces of fabric in order to obtain particular favors, such as petitions for recovery from illnesses, prayers for rain in time of drought, and thanksgivings for favors received. An altar was laid out in the open air, and the priest recited prayers (Maspero 1981: 34-35).\n\nGe Hong's c. 318 \"Baopuzi\" (see below) mentions profligately expensive \"chu\" Kitchen Feasts in contrasting heterodox \"yaodao\" (妖道, \"demonic cults\"), which involved sacrificing animals to gods who enjoyed their blood, with the undefined term \"Lijia dao\" (李家道, \"religion of the adepts of Li\") (Stein 1979: 56). The context praises the contemporary charlatan healer Li Kuan (李寬) for not following the ancient tradition of animal sacrifice, while blaming him for extravagance. \nThe more than a hundred ways for dealing with demons [諸妖道百餘種] all call for slaying living creatures so that their blood may be drunk. Only the doctrine of the Lis [李家道] is slightly different. Yet, though it does no butchering, whenever its \"good-luck food\" is served [每供福食], it includes varieties of mixtures without limit. In planning the meal, one strives for sumptuousness, and the rarest things must be purchased. Several dozen may work in the kitchen [或數十人廚], and costs for food can run high indeed. In tum, these are not completely disinterested affairs, and they might well be classed with things to be forbidden. (tr. Ware 1966: 158) \n\nIn Daoist hagiographies and stories, the esoteric ability to summon a \"xingchu\" (行廚, Mobile Kitchen) was a standard trope for the powers of a \"xian\" transcendent. The \"xingchu\", which Campany called a \"curious business\" (2002: 29), was a sumptuous banquet of rare delicacies, exotic foods, and wines that could be instantly served up by spirits anywhere on command.\n\nThe tradition of \"xingchu\" \"meditational cuisines\" or \"contemplative cuisines\" seems to have developed in a parallel and complementary manner to the \"chu\" \"communal cuisine liturgy\" (Mollier 2008a: 280). \"Xian\" transcendents were portrayed as eschewing what counted in China as ordinary foods, especially grains (see \"bigu\"), and instead eating superior, longevity-inducing substitutes such as sesame seeds and \"lingzhi\" mushrooms, typically found in distant and legendary places removed from the heartland of agriculture-based Chinese civilization. Transcendents were frequently depicted as winged beings able to fly long distances rapidly and summoning a \"xingchu\" banquet at will eliminated the need to travel across the world and heavens in order to obtain rare foodstuffs of immortality (Campany 2005: 46-47).\n\nThe Jin Dynasty Daoist scholar Ge Hong compiled the two primary sources of information about \"xingchu\" Mobile Kitchens, the \"Baopuzi\" and \"Shenxian zhuan\". Ge portrayed adepts seeking \"xian\"-hood as avoiding ordinary food such as grains, instead eating \"rare, exotic foodstuffs from the far reaches of the cosmos\", marvelous products conveying the \"numinous power\" suggested by their peculiarity. \"The ability to command at will a spirit-hosted serving of exotic food and drink in elegant vessels may seem trivial, but when one recalls that many Daoist scriptures prohibit the feasting on sacrificial meats and liquors enjoyed by the aristocracy, and that many adepts did their work on mountains and were isolated from agricultural communities and markets, the practice assumes a more serious aspect.\" (Campany 2002: 221)\n\nThe c. 318 CE \"Inner Chapters\" of the \"Baopuzi\" (Master Who Embraces Simplicity) have nine occurrences of the word \"xingchu\" (行廚, Mobile Kitchen). Seven of them are in contexts of alchemical medicines and elixirs, most of which have poisonous toxic heavy metal ingredients. The \"Baopuzi\" uses two related verbs for beckoning a Mobile Kitchen: \"zhì\" (至, \"arrive at; reach; come\") and \"zhì\" (致, \"cause to arrive at; get to; come to\"). The other two \"xingchu\" usages are in proper names of a Daoist amulet and book, the \"Xingchu fu\" (行廚符, Amulet of the Traveling Kitchen), and the \"Xingchu jing\" (行廚經, Scripture of the Traveling Kitchen). The \"Baopuzi\" also lists another book titled \"Riyue chushi jing\" (日月廚食經, Scripture of the Kitchen Meals of the Sun and the Moon) (19, Ware 1966: 384, 380, 381).\n\nThree of the seven \"Baopuzi\" elixirs are said to have dual purpose usages, long-term consumption is said to grant \"xian\" transcendence, including the ability to summon \"xingchu\", and short-term consumption provides a panacea—specifically for eliminating the Three Corpses or Three Worms, demons that live within the human body and hasten their host's death, and the Nine Worms or Nine Vermin, broadly meaning internal worms and parasites. First, the \"Xian Menzi dan\" (羡門子丹, Master Xian Men's Elixir) is prepared from wine and cinnabar. \"After it has been taken for one day the Three Worms and all illnesses are immediately purged from the patient. If taken for three years, it will confer geniehood and one is sure to be served by two fairies, who can be employed to summon the Traveling Canteen [可役使致行廚].\" (4, tr. Ware 1966: 84; cf. Campany 2002: 290). Second, a list of methods for eating and drinking realgar says, \"In each case it confers Fullness of Life; all illnesses are banished; the Three Corpses drop from the body; scars disappear; gray hair tums black; and lost teeth are regenerated. After a thousand days, fairies [translating \"yunu\" 玉女 Jade Maiden] will come to serve you and you can use them to summon the Traveling Canteen [以致行廚].\" (11, tr. Ware 1966: 188). Third, consuming pure, unadulterated lacquer will put a man in communication with the gods and let him Enjoy Fullness of Life. When eaten with pieces of crab in mica or jade water, \"The Nine Insects will then drop from you, and the bad blood will leave you through nose-bleeds. After a year, the six-\"chia\" gods and the Traveling Canteen will come to you [一年六甲行廚至也].\" (11, tr. Ware 1966: 190). This \"liujia\" (六甲, Six \"Jia\" Gods) and the \"liuyin\" (六陰, Six Yin) below refer to astrological Dunjia divination. An alternate translation is \"the six \"jia\" and the traveling canteen will arrive\" (Campany 2002: 75),\n\nThe remaining four \"Baopuzi\" formulas are said to create stronger and more versatile elixirs. Fourth, the \"Jiuguang dan\" (九光丹, Ninefold Radiance Elixir) is made by processing certain unspecified ingredients with the \"wushi\" (五石, Five Minerals, see Cold-Food Powder), i.e., cinnabar, realgar, purified potassium alum, laminar malachite, and magnetite (Needham et al. 1976: 86). Each mineral is put through five alchemical cycles and assumes five hues, so that altogether twenty-five hues result, each with specific powers, for example, the blue elixir will revive a recently deceased person. \"If you wish to summon the Traveling Canteen [欲致行廚], smear your left hand with a solution of black elixir; whatever you ask for will be at your beck and call, and everything you mention will arrive without effort. You will be able to summon any thing or any creature in the world.\" (tr. Ware 1966: 82-83, noting \"fragrant foods served in plates of gold and cups of jade\"). Fifth, the \"Baopuzi\" quotes from \"Shennong sijing\" (神農四經, Shennong's Four Classics), \"Medicines of the highest type put the human body at ease and protract life so that people ascend and become gods in heaven, soar up and down in the air, and have all the spirits at their service. Their bodies grow feathers and wings, and the Traveling Canteen comes whenever they wish [行廚立至].\" (11, tr. Ware 1966: 177). Sixth, the method of Wu Chengzi (務成子) compounds alchemical gold from realgar, yellow sand, and mercury, and then forms it into small pills. Coating the pills with different substances will produce magical effects, for instance, if one is smeared with ram's blood and thrown into a stream, \"the fish and the dragons will come out immediately, and it will be easy to catch them.\" And, \"If it is coated with hare's blood and placed in a spot belonging to the Six Yin, the Traveling Canteen and the fairies will appear immediately and place themselves at your disposal [行廚玉女立至], to a total of sixty or seventy individuals.\" (16, tr. Ware 1966: 276). Seventh, Liu Gen (劉根, or Liu Jun'an 劉君安), who Ware wrongly identifies as the Daoist prince and author Liu An (劉安, Campany 2002: 248), learned the art of metamorphosis from an alchemical text attributed to the Mohist founder Mozi, the \"Mozi wuxing ji\" (墨子五行記, Master Mo's Records of the Five Phases), and successfully used its medicines and amulets, \"By grasping a pole he becomes a tree. He plants something, and it immediately produces edible melons or fruit. He draws a line on the ground, and it becomes a river; he piles up dirt and it becomes a hill. He sits down and causes the Traveling Canteen to arrive [坐致行廚].\" (19, tr. Ware 1966: 316).\n\nThe c. 318 \"Shenxian zhuan\" (Hagiographies of Divine Transcendents) uses \"xingchu\" (行廚, Mobile Kitchen) six times. The hagiography of Wang Yuan gives a detailed description of summoning a \"xingchu\". Other adepts who are also said to have this ability include Li Gen, Liu Jing, Zuo Ci, Liu Zheng, and Taixuan nü (Campany 2002: 222).\nFirst, the hagiography of Wang Yuan (王遠) and Magu (Cannabis Maiden) says Wang was a Confucianist scholar who quit his official post during the reign (146-168 CE) of Emperor Huan of Han and went into the mountains to study Daoist techniques. Wang achieved \"xian\" transcendence through \"shijie\" \"liberation by means of a simulated corpse\", described with the traditional cicada metaphor, his \"body disappeared; yet the cap and garments were completely undisturbed, like a cicada shell.\" During his travels, Wang met the peasant Cai Jing (蔡經), whose physiognomy indicated he was destined to become a transcendent, so Wang took him on as a disciple, taught him the basic techniques, and left. Soon afterwards Cai also used alchemical \"shijie\" liberation, his body became extremely hot, and his flesh and bones melted away for three days. \"Suddenly he had vanished. When his family looked inside the blanket, only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell.\" (tr. Campany 2002: 260).\n\nAfter Cai had been gone for \"over a decade\", he unexpectedly returned home, looking like a young man, announced to his family that Lord Wang would visit on the \"seventh day of the seventh month\" (later associated with the Cowherd and Weaver Girl lovers' festival), and ordered them to \"prepare great quantities of food and drink to offer to his attendants.\" When Wang Yuan and his heavenly entourage arrived on the auspicious \"double-seven\" day, he invited his old friend Magu to join their celebration because it had been over five hundred years since she had been \"in the human realm.\" When the Cannabis Maiden and her attendants arrived at Cai's household,\nShe appeared to be a handsome woman of eighteen or nineteen; her hair was done up, and several loose strands hung down to her waist. Her gown had a pattern of colors, but it was not woven; it shimmered, dazzling the eyes, and was indescribable – it was not of this world. She approached and bowed to Wang, who bade her rise. When they were both seated, they called for the travelling canteen [坐定召進行廚]. The servings were piled up on gold platters and in jade cups without limit. There were rare delicacies, many of them made from flowers and fruits, and their fragrance permeated the air inside [Cai's home] and out. When the meat was sliced and served, [in flavor] it resembled broiled \"mo\" and was announced as \"kirin\" meat. (tr. Campany 2002: 262) \nCompare Maspero's translation, \"everyone steps forth to 'perform the Kitchen'\" (1981: 291). Guo Pu's commentary to the \"Classic of Mountains and Seas\" described the \"mò\" (貘, giant panda) as \"bear-like, black and white, and metal-eating\" (tr. Harper 2013: 216); and the mystical \"qilin\" beast is sometimes identified as a Chinese unicorn (Penny 2008: 731).\n\nWang Yuan then announced to the Cai family that he had brought some exceptional wine from the Tianchu (天廚, Heavenly Kitchen) asterism.\nI wish to present you all with a gift of fine liquor. This liquor has just been produced by the celestial kitchens. Its flavor is quite strong, so it is unfit for drinking by ordinary people; in fact, in some cases it has been known to burn people's intestines. You should mix it with water, and you should not regard this as inappropriate.\" With that, he added a \"dou\" of water to a \"sheng\" of liquor, stirred it, and presented it to the members of Cai Jing's family. On drinking little more than a \"sheng\" of it each, they were all intoxicated. After a little while, the liquor was all gone. (tr. Campany 2002: 263) \nIn traditional Chinese units of measurement , a \"dǒu\" (斗) was approximately equivalent to 10 liters and a \"shēng\" 升) approximately 1 liter. \n\nSecond, the \"Shenxian zhuan\" narrative of Li Gen (李根) says he studied under Wu Dawen (吳大文) and obtained a method for producing alchemical gold and silver.\nLi Gen could transform himself [into other forms] and could enter water and fire [without harm]. He could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive, and with it could serve twenty guests [坐致行廚能供二十人]. All the dishes were finely prepared, and all of them contained strange and marvelous foods from the four directions, not things that were locally available. (tr. Campany 2002: 219) \n\nThird, Liu Jing (劉京) was an official under Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180-157 BCE) who \"abandoned the world and followed Lord Zhang 張君 of Handan to study the Way.\" By using methods for subsisting on \"efflorescence of vermilion\" pills [朱英丸] and \"cloud-mother [mica]\" pills, Liu \"lived to be one hundred thirty years old. To look at him, one would judge him to be a person in his thirties.\" He could also foretell the auspiciousness of future events. (tr. Campany 2002: 249).\n\nThe Shangqing (Supreme Purity) tradition \"Han Wu Di neizhuan\" (漢武帝内傳, Esoteric Traditions of Han Emperor Wu), which was written between 370 and 500, has some later accretions that resemble \"Shenxian zhuan\" (Campany 2002: 76). The passage about Liu Jing says,\nLater he served Ji Zixun [薊子訓, i.e., Ji Liao 薊遼] as his teacher. Zixun transmitted to him all the secret essentials of the Five Thearchs, Numinous Flight (\"lingfei\", 靈飛), the six \"jia\" spirits, the Twelve Matters (\"shier shi\" 十二事), and the Perfected Forms of the Ten Continents of Divine Transcendents (shenxian shizhou zhenxiang 神仙十洲真形). Liu Jing practiced them all according to the instructions, and they were mightily efficacious. He could summon ghosts and spirits, immediately cause wind and rain to arise, cause the traveling canteen to arrive [名致行廚], and appear and disappear at will. He also knew the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of people's future affairs and of particular days. (tr. Campany 2002: 449) \n\nFourth, the transcendent Zuo Ci (左慈) was a \"fangshi\" (\"method master\") famous for his abilities at divination, \"fenshen\" multilocation, and shapeshifting (Pregadio 2008: 1305),\nSeeing that the fortunes of the Han house were about to decline, he sighed and said, \"As we move into this declining [astral] configuration, those who hold eminent offices are in peril, and those of lofty talent will die. Winning glory in this present age is not something to be coveted.\" So he studied arts of the Dao. He understood particularly well [how to summon] the six \"jia\" spirits, how to dispatch ghosts and other spirits, and how to sit down and call for the traveling canteen [坐致行廚]. (tr. Campany 2002: 279) \n\nFifth, the \"Shenxian zhuan\" says that Liu Zheng (劉政) used the same alchemical text attributed to Mozi that the \"Baopuzi\" says was used by Liu Gen (劉根, or Liu Jun'an 劉君安, see Campany 2002: 240-249).\nLater he arranged [a copy of] Master Mo's Treatise on the Five Phases (\"Mozi wuxing ji\" 墨子五行記) and, [based on it], ingested \"efflorescence of vermilion\" pills. He lived for more than one hundred eighty years, and his complexion was that of a youth. He could transform himself into other shapes and conceal his form; multiply one person into a hundred or a hundred into a thousand or a thousand into ten thousand; conceal a military force of three brigades by forming them into a forest or into birds and beasts, so that they could easily take their opponents' weapons without their knowledge. Further, he was capable of planting fruits of all types and causing them immediately to flower and ripen so as to be ready to eat. He could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive [生致行廚], setting out a complete meal for up to several hundred people. His mere whistling could create a wind to set dust swirling and blow stones about. (tr. Campany 2002: 322) \nTranscendental whistling was an ancient Daoist yogic technique.\n\nSixth, the brief hagiography of the female transcendent Taixuan nü (太玄女, Woman of the Grand Mystery) says.\nThe Woman of the Grand Mystery was surnamed Zhuan 顓 and named He 和. While still young, she was bereaved of her husband, so she practiced the Way. Disciplining herself in the arts of the Jade Master, (Yuzi) she could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive [坐致行廚], and there was no sort of transformation she could not accomplish. (tr. Campany 2002: 367). \n\nIn addition, the \"Shenxian zhuan\" hagiography for Mao Ying (茅盈) describes what sounds like a \"xingchu\" without using the name (Campany 2002: 328). After twenty years studying the Dao, Mao Ying returned home to his parents and announced that he had been commanded to enter heaven and become a transcendent. The people of his home village came to give him a going-away party, and Mao said,\n\"I am touched by your sincere willingness to send me off, and I deeply appreciate your intention. But please come empty-handed; you need not make any expenditure. I have a means whereby to provide a feast for us all.\" On the appointed day, the guests all arrived, and a great banquet was held. Awnings of blue brocade were spread out, and layers of white felt were spread out beneath them. Rare delicacies and strange fruits were piled up and arrayed. Female entertainers provided music; the sounds of metal and stone mingled together, and the din shook Heaven and Earth; it could be heard from several \"li\" away. Of the more than one thousand guests present that day, none failed to leave intoxicated and sated. (tr. Campany 2002: 327) \nMao Ying and his brothers Mao Gu (茅固) and Mao Zhong (茅衷) are considered of the founders of the Shangqing School of Daoism.\n\nShangqing Daoists took the stock literary phrase \"zuo zhi xingchu\" (坐致行廚)—used above in the \"Baopuzi\" for Liu Gen, \"sits down and causes the Traveling Canteen to arrive\" (tr. Ware), and in the \"Shenxian zhuan\" for Li Gen, Zuo Ci, and Taixuan nü, \"sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive\" (tr. Campany)—and actualized it as a visualization technique for \"making the movable cuisines come [while] sitting [in meditation]\" (tr. Mollier). \"This method, accessible only to the initiate who possessed the proper series of talismans (\"fu\" 符) and had mastered certain visualization techniques, conferred powers to become invisible, to cause thunder, and to call for rain.\" This form of sitting meditation was so popular during the Tang period that Chinese Esoteric Buddhism also adopted it. (Mollier 2008a: 280)\n\nFollowing upon the Celestial Masters liturgical Kitchen feasts and \"xian\" transcendents' Mobile Kitchens, the third stage of Daoist \"chu\" traditions was the Tang dynasty (618–907) \"wǔchú\" (五廚, Five Kitchens) contemplation technique, which recast the concept of ritual banquets in terms of psychophysiological \"neidan\" Internal Alchemy (Verellen 2004: 351). In Chinese cosmological wuxing Five Phases correspondence theory, the \"wuchu\" Five Kitchens or \"wuzang\" (五臟, Five Viscera / Orbs) system includes not only the physiological internal organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and spleen), but also the associated psychological range of mental and emotional states (Roth 1999: 41-42). The 735 \"Wuchu jing\" (五廚經, Scripture of the Five Kitchens), which poetically describes a visualization practice for circulating \"qi\" energies through the Five Viscera, was so popular that Tang Buddhists forged the esoteric \"Sānchú jīng\" (三廚經, Sutra of the Three Kitchens) based on the Daoist text (Mollier 2008b: 1051).\n\nThere are two extant editions of \"Wuchu jing\" (translated by Kohn 2010: 198-206). First, the 763 Tang \"Daozang\" (Daoist Canon) edition titled \"Laozi shuo Wuchu jing zhu\" (老子說五廚經, Commentary to the Scripture of the Five Kitchens as Revealed by Laozi) contains a preface dated 735 and a commentary, both signed by Yin Yin (尹愔, d. 741). The reduplicatedly named Yin Yin was a prominent Daoist and Confucian scholar under Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (r. 712-756), and abbot of the Suming guan (肅明觀, Abbey of Reviving Light) temple in the capital Chang'an. The late Tang Celestial Master Zhao Xianfu (趙仙甫, fl. 732) also wrote a commentary (Verellen 2004: 351). Second, the 1019 \"Yunji Qiqian\" (Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel) anthology edition titled \"Wuchu jing qifa\" (五廚經氣法, Energetic Methods of the Scripture of the Five Kitchens), also includes Yin's commentary, with slight variations, such as noting the text was presented to the emperor in 736 (Verellen 2004: 351). The \"qi\" \"energetic\" methods of the text are recommended by Sima Chengzhen (司馬承禎, 647–735) in his \"Fuqi jingyi lun\" (服氣精義論, Essay on the Essential Meaning of Breath Ingestion) text on physical self-cultivation (Mollier 2008b: 1051). Although the presence of Yin's preface might suggest a Tang date for the \"Wuchu jing\", the origins of this text may be much earlier. Ge Hong's c. 318 \"Baopuzi\" mentions a \"Xingchu jing\" (行廚經, Scripture of the Movable Kitchens) and a \"Riyue chushi jing\" (日月廚食經, Scripture of the Kitchen Meals for the Sun and the Moon), which could be the ancestors of the received texts (Mollier 2008b: 1051). \n\nThe c. 905 \"Daojiao lingyan ji\" (道教靈驗記, Record of Daoist Miracles, written by the Daoist priest, author, and court official Du Guangting, says a Buddhist monk fraudulently transformed the \"Wuchu jing\" Scripture of the Five Kitchens into the \"Sanchu jing\" (三廚經, Sutra of the Three Kitchens). Du records that the Chinese Buddhist canon of the Tang period contained a text titled \"Fo shuo san tingchu jing\" (佛說三停廚經, Sutra of the Three Interrupted Kitchens, Preached by the Buddha) (Verellen I992: 248-249). According to Du Guangting, the monk Xingduan (行端), who had \"a presumptuous and fraudulent disposition\", saw that the widely-circulated Daoist \"Wuchu jing\" consisted of five stanzas (\"jì\" 偈, \"\"gatha\"; poetic verse; versified utterance\") of incantations (\"zhòu\" 咒, \"\"mantra\"; religious incantation; mystical invocation\"), rearranged them, and expanded the title into \"Fo shuo san tingchu jing\" (佛說三停廚經). \"The five incantations he turned into 'five sutras spoken by Tathagata,' and at the end he added a hymn. The additional phrases amounted to no less than a page.\" Verellen suggests that the scripture, with its \"Buddho-Daoist content and quasi-magical use\", originated as a late Six Dynasties (220-589) Tantric \"zhoujing\" (咒經, \"incantations scripture\", cf. the \"Divine Incantations Scripture\"). (1992: 250-51).\n\nDu Guangting gives a lengthy narrative about the Daoist miracle involving supernatural retribution for Xingduan's forgery. One day after the monk had already given several copies of the altered scripture to others, a \"divine being eight or nine feet tall\" and holding a sword reprimands him for the counterfeiting and brandishes his sword to strike the monk. As Xingduan \"wards off the blow with his hand, several fingers are lopped off\", he begs for mercy, and the Daoist deity agrees to spare his life if he retrieves and destroys all the fakes. Xingduan and his companions search everywhere for the texts, but can only find half of them, the remainder having already been carried abroad by Buddhist monks. Xingduan prepares ten fresh copies of the original scripture, offers incense, repents, and burns the altered copies. Then the divine being reappears and announces: \"Having vilified the sage's text, restitution won't save you—you do not deserve to escape death\", the monk falls prostrate and dies on the spot (Verellen 1992: 251). \n\nIn the present day, early copies of this apocryphal Buddhist sutra have been preserved. Four textual versions were discovered in the Chinese Dunhuang manuscripts, two versions, dated 1099 and 1270, are kept in the Japanese Mount Kōya manuscripts. In addition, the modern Japanese Taishō Tripiṭaka canon includes the text (Mollier 2009: 26-28).\n\nThe highly abstract \"Wuchu jing\" mystical poem comprises five stanzas consisting of four five-character lines each. The \"Yunqi qiqian\" edition shows that the five stanzas were associated with the Five Directions of space: east (lines 1-4), south (lines 5-8), north (lines 9-12), west (lines 13-16), and center (lines 17-20) (Verellen 2004: 351). For example, the first four lines (tr. Kohn 2010: 200-201):\nThe content of the \"Wuchu jing\" guides adepts toward a detached mental state of non-thinking and equanimity. The Five Kitchens refer to \"neidan\" Internal Alchemy \"\"qi\"-processing on a subtle-body level\", and signify the energetic, transformative power of the Five Viscera (Kohn 2010: 71). Yin Yin's introduction says,\nAs long as you dwell in the \"qi\" of universal oneness [一氣] and in the harmony of cosmic peace [泰和], the five organs [五臟] are abundant and full and the five spirits [五神] are still and upright. \"When the five organs are abundant, all sensory experiences are satisfied; when the five spirits are still, all cravings and desires are eliminated. This scripture expounds on how the five organs taking in \"qi\" is like someone looking for food in a kitchen. Thus, its title: \"Scripture of the Five Kitchens.\" (tr. Kohn 2010: 200) \nCommenting on Yin's interpretation, Du Guangting claims more explicitly that practicing this scripture will enable an adept to stop eating. (Verellen 2004: 352)\n\nTechniques in the \"Wuchu jing\" (五廚經, Scripture of the Five Kitchens) mainly involve visualizing the Five Viscera of the body and chanting incantations. These methods supposedly allow the adept to obtain satisfaction and harmony, and, after some years of training, even transcendence (Mollier 2008a: 279-280). Despite this concern with the human body, the text strongly emphasizes mental restructuring over physical practices, saying that \"accumulating cultivation will not get you to detachment\" and that methods of ingestion are ultimately useless. However, reciting the scripture is beneficial, especially if combined with mental and ethical practices, so that \"you will easily get the true essentials of cultivating the body-self and protecting life.\" More specifically, chanting the text one hundred times and practicing the harmonization of the five \"qi\" allows adepts to abstain from grain and eliminate hunger (Mollier 1999: 62-63). Many present-day Daoists consider the \"Wuchu jing\" as a talismanic text to be chanted for protection (Kohn 2010: 71).\n\n\n"}

Moldova (application No. 27138/04) was a case decided by European Court of Human Rights in 2010. Ciubotaru sought to have his ethnicity changed from Moldovan to Romanian on his birth and marriage certificates, which Moldova refused. The Court found that Moldova's procedure for changing ethnicity of record violated Article 8 (right to private life) of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nIn 2002, when applying to have his old Soviet identity card replaced with a Moldovan one, Mr. Ciubotaru submitted that his ethnicity was Romanian. As he was told that his application would not be accepted unless he indicated Moldovan ethnicity, as in his and his parents' Soviet documents, he complied.\n\nAfterwards he requested the relevant State authority to change his ethnic identity entry from “Moldovan” to “Romanian”. His request was refused with the argument that since his parents had not been recorded as ethnic Romanians in their birth and marriage certificates, it was impossible for him to be recorded as an ethnic Romanian. He was advised to search the archives for traces of Romanian origin of his ancestors. Appeals to domestic courts were refused.\n\nThe Court found for Ciubotaru. The Court explained that it understood that authorities should be able to refuse a claim to change ethnicity of record when the claim is based purely on unsubstantiated subjective grounds. However, Moldova's legal requirements created insurmountable barriers on an individual wishing to record an ethnicity other than the ethnicity that Soviet authorities defined for the individual's parents. The Court also found that Ciubotaru's claim was based on more than merely subjective grounds, as Ciubotaru could produce objectively verifiable links with Romanian ethnic groups. Evidence such as language, name, and empathy cannot be relied on under Moldovan law in force.\n\nThe Court concluded, that the procedure of changing ethnicity record violated Article 8 (right to private life) of the European Convention on Human Rights, and ordered Moldova to pay the applicant 5,000 Euros.\n\nJudge Mijović filed a concurring opinion, pointing that \"I consider self-identification primarily as a matter of personal perception rather than a matter based on objective grounds, and that is why I do not share the Chamber's reasoning in the judgment\".\n\n"}
{"id": "596663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=596663", "title": "Clinical lycanthropy", "text": "Clinical lycanthropy\n\nClinical lycanthropy is defined as a rare psychiatric syndrome that involves a delusion that the affected person can transform into, has transformed into, or is a non-human animal. Its name is associated with the mythical condition of lycanthropy, a supernatural affliction in which humans are said to physically shapeshift into wolves. It is purported to be a rare disorder.\n\nAffected individuals believe that they are in the process of transforming into an animal or have already transformed into an animal. It has been associated with the altered states of mind that accompany psychosis (the mental state that typically involves delusions and hallucinations) with the transformation only seeming to happen in the mind and behavior of the affected person.\n\nA study on lycanthropy from the McLean Hospital reported on a series of cases and proposed some diagnostic criteria by which lycanthropy could be recognised:\n\n\nAccording to these criteria, either a delusional belief in current or past transformation or behavior that suggests a person thinks of themselves as transformed is considered evidence of clinical lycanthropy. The authors note that, although the condition seems to be an expression of psychosis, there is no specific diagnosis of mental or neurological illness associated with its behavioral consequences.\n\nIt also seems that lycanthropy is not specific to an experience of human-to-wolf transformation; a wide variety of creatures have been reported as part of the shape-shifting experience. A review of the medical literature from early 2004 lists over thirty published cases of lycanthropy, only the minority of which have wolf or dog themes. Canines are certainly not uncommon, although the experience of being transformed into a hyena, cat, horse, bird or tiger has been reported on more than one occasion. Transformation into frogs, and even bees, has been reported in some instances. In Japan, transformation into foxes and dogs was usual (, ). A 1989 case study described how one individual reported a serial transformation, experiencing a change from human to dog, to horse, and then finally cat, before returning to the reality of human existence after treatment. There are also reports of people who experienced transformation into an animal only listed as \"unspecified\".\n\nThere is a case study of a psychiatric patient who had both clinical lycanthropy and Cotard delusion. The term \"ophidianthropy\" refers to the delusion that one has been transformed into a snake. Two case studies have been reported.\n\nClinical lycanthropy is a rare condition and is largely considered to be an idiosyncratic expression of a psychotic episode caused by another condition such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or clinical depression.\n\nHowever, there are suggestions that certain neurological conditions and cultural influences may result in the expression of the human-animal transformation theme that defines the condition.\n\nOne important factor may be differences or changes in parts of the brain known to be involved in representing body shape (e.g., see proprioception and body image). A neuroimaging study of two people diagnosed with clinical lycanthropy showed that these areas display unusual activation, suggesting that when people report their bodies are changing shape, they may be genuinely perceiving those feelings.\n\nIn rare cases, individuals may believe that other people have transformed into animals. This has been termed \"lycanthropic intermetamorphosis\" and \"lycanthropy spectrum\". A 2009 study reported that, after the consumption of the drug MDMA (Ecstasy), a man displayed symptoms of paranoid psychosis by claiming that his relatives had changed into various animals such as a boar, a donkey and a horse.\n\nCatherine Clark Kroeger has written that several parts of the Bible refer to King Nebuchadnezzar's behavior in the book of Daniel 4 as a being manifestation of clinical lycanthropy. Neurologist Andrew J. Larner has written that the fate of Odysseus's crew due to the magic of Circe may be one of the earliest examples of clinical lycanthropy.\n\nAlso, it is believed that the king of Armenia Tiridates III also suffered from this disorder. He was cured by Gregory the Illuminator. As a sign of gratitude, Tiridates proclaimed Christianity as the state religion during 301, thus making Armenia the first Christian state.\n\nAccording to Persian tradition, the Buyid prince Majd ad-Dawla was suffering from an illusion that he was a cow. He was cured by Avicenna.\n\nNotions that lycanthropy was due to a medical condition go back to the seventh century, when the Alexandrian physician Paulus Aegineta attributed lycanthropy to Melancholia or an \"excess of black bile\". During 1563, a Lutheran physician named Johann Weyer wrote that werewolves suffered from an imbalance in their melancholic humour and exhibited the physical symptoms of paleness, \"a dry tongue and a great thirst\" as well as sunken, dim and dry eyes. Even King James VI and I in his 1597 treatise \"Daemonologie\" does not blame werewolf behaviour on delusions created by the Devil but \"an excess of melancholy as the culprit which causes some men to believe that they are wolves and to 'counterfeit' the actions of these animals\". The perception of an association between mental illness and animalistic behaviour can be traced throughout the history of folklore from many different countries.\n\n"}
{"id": "1460069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1460069", "title": "Clip show", "text": "Clip show\n\nA clip show is an episode of a television series that consists primarily of excerpts from previous episodes. Most clip shows feature the format of a frame story in which cast members recall past events from past installments of the show, depicted with a clip of the event presented as a flashback. Clip shows are also known as cheaters, particularly in the field of animation. Clip shows are often played before series finales, or once syndication becomes highly likely. Other times, however, clip shows are simply produced for budgetary reasons (i.e. to avoid additional costs from shooting in a certain setting, or from casting actors to appear in new material).\n\nClip shows have their origin in theatrical short films and serials. Every serial chapter always had a brief recap showing where the previous chapter left off, but, beginning in 1936, entire chapters were largely devoted to material that audiences had already seen. In these recap chapters (also called \"economy chapters\"),\nprevious chapters were summarized for those who may have missed some episodes (which were unlikely to be rerun). The practice began with the Republic Pictures serial \"Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island\". Adverse weather conditions slowed the filming of this outdoor adventure budgeted for 12 chapters, and screenwriter Barry Shipman was forced to create two more chapters to recoup the lost production costs. Shipman wrote a few scenes in which the screen characters recount their adventures to date, and stock footage from previous chapters is shown instead of new sequences. Shipman's brainstorm was a convenient way to economize on production, and soon Republic made the recap chapter standard procedure.\n\nMovie studios often resorted to old footage to save money. The most famous example is the short comedies of The Three Stooges which, from 1949 until 1957, borrowed lengthy sequences and often entire storylines from old shorts. Only a few new scenes would be filmed as a framework for the old footage. This practice was adopted because the studios could charge more money for \"new\" films than for old ones.\n\nAnimation studios were also known to periodically make cartoon shorts - often referred to as \"cheaters\" - made up primarily of clips for earlier cartoons in order to save money. Examples of this include \"Betty Boop's Rise to Fame\" (Fleischer/Paramount, 1934), \"What's Cookin' Doc?\" (1944, Schlesinger/Warner Bros.) and a regular yearly series of \"Tom & Jerry\" \"cheaters\" such as \"Smitten Kitten\" (1952, MGM).\n\nOne variant of the modern clip show is the compilation episode, using clips from the most popular episodes, assembled together in one episode, sometimes without a frame story as such.\n\nAnother format is to have a host who describes various characters and characteristics of the show to introduce various clips from past episodes. For example, a special one-hour clip show episode of \"All in the Family\" featured actor Henry Fonda discussing the main characters on the show followed by relevant clips from previous episodes; a similar two-part clip show appeared on \"Three's Company\", hosted by Lucille Ball. This format was parodied in a clip show for \"The Simpsons\" (\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\"), in which fictional actor Troy McClure—a recurring \"Simpsons\" character—introduced the clips.\n\nA third variation, used in a two-part clip show episode of \"Cheers\" featured the entire cast of the show, including former cast members, sitting on a stage while being interviewed by talk host John McLaughlin about their characters on the show, with clips of previous episodes mixed in. A similar clip episode of \"Barney Miller\" aired after the death of cast member Jack Soo, with flashbacks introduced by the rest of the cast highlighting Soo's character Detective Sergeant Nick Yamana.\n\n\"\" had a flashback episode 2 episodes in to the series. The two main leads reminisce on the previous episode and other adventures they went on. The episode was highly praised.\n\nIn the \"\" episode \"The Ember Island Players\", the show's main characters watch a play about themselves based upon the events of the series thus far. Although the episode contains no actual footage from previous episodes, the actors recount many scenes from the series and show all the significant plot events. \"The Ember Island Players\" was the last episode before the four-part series finale.\n\nThe NBC sitcom \"Community\" used the clip show format with the episode \"Paradigms of Human Memory\", but rather than using clips from previous episodes, the cut-away scenes in that episode were all newly shot. In some cases the clips were set in events of previous episodes, and in other cases the clips showed events that had never before occurred on the show, such as visiting an Old West ghost town, taking over for a glee club killed in a bus crash or going on a fishing trip. The creator of \"Community\", Dan Harmon, used the same format in another one of his shows, \"Rick and Morty\", where all the clips were completely new and related to the episode, 'Total Rickall', in some way.\n\nIn anime, a common type of episode is the Recap episode, which presents clips from previous episodes in a manner to remind viewers of the story so far and help newer viewers catch up on the plot and details.\n\nWhile clip shows do reduce production costs, they were originally employed in an era when there were far fewer program outlets and it was less likely that episodes from previous seasons would be aired again. Clip shows typically received strong ratings, and it was expected for any successful comedy series to feature clip shows regularly in its later years. However, the episodes were subject to some ridicule due to their forced or \"corny\" framing devices (such as a family sitting peacefully around a fireplace) and the frequently awkward transitions between the frame story and the clips (such as characters staring into space while the screen blurs to represent \"remembering\").\n\nDaytime soap operas frequently present clip shows as a way to commemorate a show's milestone anniversary or the death of a long-running character. Many fans take advantage of the shows in order to see vintage clips of a particular soap opera. One example was an episode of \"As the World Turns\" in which seven of the longest running characters were stranded in a forest and remembered some of their best moments, all in honor of \"AtWT\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 50th anniversary.\n\nAnother common rationale for a clip show is the lack of a new show to air, due to failure to meet production schedules. For example, the computer-animated series \"\" used clip shows four times for this purpose, interrupting in-progress story arcs. Similarly, the \"Moonlighting\" season 3 episode \"The Straight Poop\" helped to fill out a production schedule that was rife with delays: in 15 weeks since that season began, only 8 episodes of the \"weekly\" series had been broadcast. \"Chappelle's Show\" resorted to producing \"five\" clip shows (using material from only 25 episodes) over the course of its first two seasons.\n\nOther times budgetary considerations force clip shows. At the end of its second season, \"\" had one more episode to shoot. However, Paramount cut that show's budget to make up for an episode earlier in the season that had gone over budget—and, similarly, over schedule, leaving only three days for principal photography. Because the season had gotten off to a slow start due to a writers' strike, the producers had no scripts set aside for future use as they normally would have. The result was \"\", in which the \"clips\" were the induced dreams of a comatose William T. Riker. The episode is widely considered among the worst of any \"Star Trek\" series.\n\nClip shows today tend to offset such criticism by trying to make the frame tale surrounding the clips compelling, or by presenting clip shows without any framing device. A show might also diffuse the awkwardness by indulging in self-parody, explicitly acknowledging or intentionally over-playing the device. Many series have included parody clip shows using \"clips\" from episodes which never happened. The \"South Park\" episode \"City on the Edge of Forever\" shows scenes from previous episodes, but the details are always wrong, and in the end, everyone gets ice cream. As another example, \"\" ran a clip show as its second episode, even though there was only one prior episode from which to pull material. The aforementioned \"Moonlighting\" clip episode, in typical fashion for the show, used a framing story that broke the fourth wall to determine if the characters themselves were the source of the show's notorious production delays, and ended with the characters promising a \"new episode next week!\".\n\nThe clip show has been employed more seriously as a means to bring viewers up to date on highly serialized dramas, such as on \"Lost\", \"Once Upon a Time\" and the reimagined \"Battlestar Galactica\". Many anime dramas used similar techniques, particularly when a series ran for more episodes in one season than could be reasonably rerun (such as \"Mobile Suit Gundam Wing\" running for 49 episodes, which were originally aired weekly).\n\nSometimes clip shows air before or during a series finale as a way for audiences to reminisce about their favorite moments. Some examples of shows that have used clip shows in this sense are: \"Animaniacs\", \"Frasier\", \"The Golden Girls\", \"Seinfeld\", \"Friends\", \"Thunderbirds\", \"Everybody Loves Raymond\", \"The Outer Limits\", \"Stargate SG-1\"/\"Atlantis\", and \"Cheers\".\n\nClip shows are also a way to compile the best episodes or sketches from a series to air in a single, concise package when rerunning a whole episode or series is implausible. The annual Scottish New Year special \"Scotch and Wry\" was condensed into four feature film-length episodes for home video release. \"Carson's Comedy Classics\" compiled memorable sketches from the first 20 seasons of \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" for airing in syndication. Surviving content from Bozo the Clown and other Chicago children's television programs was incorporated into \"\", an annual holiday special.\n\n\n"}

The idea of cultural policy was developed at UNESCO in the 1960s. Generally, this involves governments setting in place processes, legal classifications, regulations, legislation and institutions (e.g., galleries, museums, libraries, opera houses, etc.) which promote and facilitate cultural diversity and creative expressions in a range of art forms and creative activities. Cultural policies vary from one country to another, but generally they aim to improve the accessibility of arts and creative activities to citizens and promote the artistic, musical, ethnic, sociolinguistic, literary and other expressions of all people in a country. In some countries, especially since the 1970s, there is an emphasis on supporting the culture of Indigenous peoples and marginalized communities and ensuring that cultural industries (e.g., filmmaking or TV production) are representative of a country's diverse cultural heritage and ethnic and linguistic demographics. \n\nCultural policy can be done at a nation-state level, at a sub-national level (e.g., U.S. states or Canadian provinces), at a regional level or at a municipal level (e.g., a city government creating a museum or arts centre). Examples of cultural policy-making at the nation-state level could include anything from funding music education or theatre programs at little to no cost, to hosting corporate-sponsored art exhibitions in a government museum, to establishing legal codes (such as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service’s 501(c)(3) tax designation for not-for-profit enterprises) and creating political institutions (such as the various ministries of culture and departments of culture and the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts in the United States), arts granting councils, and cultural institutions such as galleries and museums. Similar significant organisations in the United Kingdom include the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), and Arts Council England.\n\nThroughout much of the twentieth century, many of the activities that compose cultural policy in the 2010s were governed under the title of \"arts policy\". Arts policy includes direct funding to artists, creators and art institutions and indirect funding to artists and arts institutions through the tax system (e.g., by making donations to arts charities tax deductible). However, as Kevin Mulcahy has observed, \"cultural policy encompasses a much broader array of activities than were addressed under arts policy. Whereas arts policy was effectively limited to addressing aesthetic concerns (e.g., funding art galleries and opera houses), the significance of the transformation to cultural policy can be observed in its demonstrable emphases on cultural identity, valorization of indigineity [Indigenous people's culture] and analyses of historical dynamics (such as hegemony and colonialism).\" A general trend in Western industrialized nations is a shift, since the 1970s and 1980s, away from solely supporting a small number of relatively elite, professionalized art forms and institutions (e.g., Classical music, painting, sculpture, art galleries) to also supporting amateur and community cultural and creative activities (e.g., community theatre) and cultural forms which were not considered part of the Western canon by previous generations (e.g., traditional music such as blues, World music, and so on).\n\nPrior to the twentieth century, the arts were typically supported by the patronage of the church, aristocrats such as kings and queens, and wealthy merchants. During the nineteenth century, artists increased their use of the private marketplace to earn revenue. For example, the composer Beethoven put on public concerts for which admission was charged. During the twentieth century, governments began to take over some of the arts patronage roles. Governments' first efforts to support culture were typically the establishment of archives, museums and libraries. Over the twentieth century, governments established a range of other institutions, such as arts councils and departments of culture. The first departments of culture typically supported the major arts that are part of the Western canon, such as painting and sculpture, and the major performing arts (Classical music and theatre).\n\nIn the twentieth century, Western governments in the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many European nations developed arts policy measures to promote, support and protect the arts, artists and arts institutions. These governments' arts policy initiatives generally had two aims: supporting excellence in the arts and broadening access to the arts by citizens. An example of an arts policy initiative that supports excellence would be a government grant program which provides funding to the highest-achieving artists in the country. A concrete example would be a literary prize of $100,000 for the best fiction authors from the country, as selected by a panel of top experts. An example of an arts policy initiative that aims at increasing access to the arts would be a music in the schools program funded by the government. A concrete example would be a program which funded an orchestra or jazz quartet and paid them to play free concerts in elementary schools. This would enable children from lower- and middle-income families to hear live music. \n\nThe two goals, supporting excellence and broadening access, are often trade-offs, as any increase in emphasis on one policy objective typically has an adverse effect on the other goal. To give an example, if a hypothetical country has a $12 million per year grant program for orchestras in the country, if the government focuses on the goal of supporting musical excellence, it may decide to provide $4 million per year to the three top orchestras in the country, as determined by a panel of independent professional music critics, conductors and music professors. This decision would strongly support the goal of enhancing excellence, as funding would only go to the top musical groups. However, this approach would only enable citizens in three cities to have access to professional orchestras.\n\nOn the other hand, if the government was focusing on broadening access to symphony concerts, it might direct the independent panel to pick 12 orchestras in the country, with the stipulation that only one orchestra per city be selected. By proving $1 million per year to 12 orchestras in 12 cities, this would enable citizens from 12 cities in the country to see live orchestra shows. However, by funding 12 orchestras, this would mean that funding would go to ensembles that do not meet the highest standards of excellence. Thus, excellence and broadening access are often trade-offs.\n\nCultural policy, while a small part of the budgets of even the most generous of governments, governs a sector of immense complexity. It entails “a large, heterogeneous set of individuals and organizations engaged in the creation, production, presentation, distribution, and preservation of and education about aesthetic heritage, and entertainment activities, products and artifacts”. A cultural policy necessarily encompasses a broad array of activities and typically involves public support for:\n\nSome governments may place policy areas from this list in other ministries or departments. For example, national parks may be assigned to an environment department, or public humanities may be delegated to an education department. \n\nSince culture is a public good (i.e., contributes a public value to society for which it is hard to exclude non-payers, as all of society benefits from arts and culture) and something that is generally viewed as a merit good, governments have pursued programs to promote greater accessibility. In this way of thinking, significant aesthetic works such as paintings and sculptures should be made broadly available to the public. In other words, “high culture” should not be the exclusive preserve of a particular social class or of a metropolitan location. Rather, the benefits of the highest reaches of cultural excellence should be made in an egalitarian manner; national cultural treasures should be accessible without regard to the impediments of class circumstances, educational attainment or place of habitation. A democratic state cannot be seen as simply indulging the aesthetic preferences of a few, however enlightened, or of overtly infusing art with political values. Consequently, a democratic cultural policy must articulate its purposes in ways that demonstrate how the public interest is being served. These purposes have often been expressed as involving either the creation of cultural democracy or the democratization of culture.\n\nThe objective of cultural democratization is the aesthetic enlightenment, enhanced dignity, and educational development of the general citizenry. “Dissemination was the key concept with the aim of establishing equal opportunity for all citizens to participate in publicly organized and financed cultural activities”. To further this goal, performances and exhibitions are low cost; public art education promotes equality of aesthetic opportunity; national institutions tour and perform in work places, retirement homes and housing complexes.\n\nAs indicated earlier, the “democratization of culture” is a top-down approach that promulgates certain forms of cultural programming that are deemed to be a public good. Clearly, such an objective is open to criticism for what is termed cultural elitism; that is, the assumption that some aesthetic expressions are inherently superior - at least as determined by a cognoscenti concerned with the acquisition of cultural capital. “The problem with this policy [is] that, fundamentally, it intend[s] to create larger audiences for performances whose content [is] based on the experience of society’s privileged groups. In sum, it has… taken for granted that the cultural needs of all society’s members [are] alike”. The objective of cultural democracy, on the other hand, is to provide for a more participatory (or populist) approach in the definition and provision of cultural opportunities.\n\nThe coupling of the concept of democratization of culture to cultural democracy has a pragmatic as well as a philosophical component. Cultural patronage in democratic governments is markedly different from patronage by wealthy individuals or corporations. Private or politically paramount patrons are responsible only to themselves and are free to indulge in their tastes and preferences. Democratic governments, on the other hand, are responsible to the electorate and are held accountable for their policy decisions.\n\nThe two objectives just discussed - dissemination of high culture and participation in a broader range of cultural activities - evoke a related debate about the content of public culture: “elitist” or “populist.” \nProponents of the elitist position argue that cultural policy should emphasize aesthetic quality as the determining criterion for public subvention. This view is typically supported by the major cultural organizations, creative artists in the traditionally defined field of the fine arts, cultural critics, and the well-educated, well-to-do audiences for these art forms. Ronald Dworkin terms this the “lofty approach,” which “insists that art and culture must reach a certain degree of sophistication, richness, and excellence in order for human nature to flourish, and that the state must provide this excellence if the people will not or cannot provide it for themselves”. Advocates of the elitist position generally focus on supporting the creation, preservation and performance of works of the Western canon, a group of artworks that are viewed as the best artistic and cultural products of Western society.\n\nBy contrast, the populist position advocates defining culture broadly and inclusively and making this culture broadly available. The populist approach emphasizes a less traditional and more pluralist notion of artistic merit and consciously seeks to create a policy of cultural diversity. With a focus on personal enhancement, the populist’s position posits very limited boundaries between amateur and professional arts activities. Indeed, the goal is to provide opportunities for those outside the professional mainstream. To give an example, whereas an elite approach advocates support for professional musicians, particularly those from Classical music, a populist approach would advocate support for amateur, community singers and musicians.\n\n“Proponents of populism are frequently advocates of minority arts, folk arts, ethnic arts, or counter-cultural activities” as Kevin V. Mulcahy said. Cultural “elitists,” on the other hand, argue in support of excellence over amateurism and favor an emphasis on aesthetic discipline over “culture as everything.” There are “two key tensions for national cultural policy between the goals of excellence versus access, and between government roles as facilitator versus architect”.\nKevin V. Mulcahy argued that in effect, elitism is cultural democracy as populism is to the democratization of culture. Unfortunately, there has been a tendency to see these positions as mutually exclusive, rather than complementary. “Elitists” are denounced as “high brow snobs” advocating an esoteric culture which focuses on art music and the types of art seen in museums and galleries; populists are dismissed as “pandering philistines” promoting a trivialized and commercialized culture, as they endorse the value of popular music and folk art. However, these mutual stereotypes belie complementariness between two bookends of an artistically autonomous and politically accountable cultural policy. There is a synthesis that can be termed a “latitudinarian approach” to public culture; that is, one that is aesthetically inclusive and broadly accessible.\n\nSuch a public-cultural policy would remain faithful to the highest standards of excellence from a broad range of aesthetic expressions while providing the widest possible access to people from different geographic locales, socio-economic strata, and educational background, as Dr. Mulcahy said. In conceiving of public policy as an opportunity to provide alternatives not readily available in the marketplace, public cultural agencies would be better positioned to complement the efforts of the private sector rather than duplicate their activities. Similarly, cultural agencies can promote community development by supporting artistic heritages that are at a competitive disadvantage in a cultural world that is increasingly profit-driven. In sum, excellence should be viewed as the achievements of greatness from a horizontal, rather than a vertical, perspective and a cultural policy as supporting the totality of these varieties of excellence.\n\nThese attitudes about a public cultural responsibility stand in marked contrast to much of the rest of the world, where culture is a question of historic patrimony, or the national identities of peoples, whether in independent states or regions within more powerful states. Inevitably, sensitive issues are involved in any discussion of culture as a public policy. However, given the demands in a democratic system that public policies show a return to the taxpayer, cultural policy has frequently argued for support on the basis of utility. It can be argued that there is a parity between the state’s responsibility for its citi’ social-economic-physical needs and their access to culture and opportunities for artistic self-expression. However, the aesthetic dimension of public policy has never been widely perceived as intuitively obvious or politically imperative. Accordingly, the cultural sector has often argued its case from the secondary, ancillary benefits that result from public support for programs that are seemingly only aesthetic in nature. Cultural policy is not typically justified solely on the grounds that it is a good-in-itself, but rather that it yields other good results.\n\nThe future of cultural policy would seem to predict an increasingly inexorable demand that the arts “carry their own weight” rather than rely on a public subsidy to pursue “art for art’s sake”. Kevin V. Mulcahy dubbed this “cultural Darwinism” is most pronounced in the United States where public subsidy is limited and publicly supported aesthetic activities are expected to demonstrate a direct public benefit. Non-American cultural institutions are less constrained by the need to maintain diversified revenue streams that demand high levels of earned income and individual and corporate donations to compensate for limited government appropriations.\n\nOn the other hand, cultural institutions everywhere are increasingly market-driven in their need for supplementary funds and as a justification for continued public support. The American model of an essentially privatized culture is increasingly attractive to governments seeking to curtail their cultural subsidies. In a system of mixed funding, public culture can nurture the arts groups and cultural activities that contribute to individual self-worth and community definition even if counting for less in the economic bottom-line. At root, a cultural policy is about creating public spheres that are not dependent upon profit motives nor validated by commercial values. As political democracy is dependent upon the existence of civil society and socio-economic pluralism, cultural policy stands as an essential public commitment in realizing these fundamental preconditions.\n\nOne of the available and yet underappreciated tools in cultural policy at the national level is the reduction of VAT rates for cultural goods and services. Economic theory can be used to explain how reduced fiscal rates are expected to decrease prices and increase quantities of consumed cultural goods and services. Fiscal policy can be an important part of cultural policy, in particular the VAT rate discounts on cultural consumption, yet it receives less attention than deserved.\n\nAt the international level UNESCO is in charge of cultural policy. Contact information for ministries of culture and national arts councils in 160 countries is available from the website of the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies (IFACCA). On a local scale, subnational (e.g., state or provincial governments), city and local governments offer citizens and local authorities the opportunity to develop arts and culture with the Agenda 21 for Culture.\n\nCultural policy research is a field of academic inquiry that grew out of cultural studies in the 1990s. It grew out of the idea that cultural studies should not only be critical, but also try to be useful. In the 2010s, there are many departments of Cultural Policy Studies around the world.\n\n\n\n"}

Under preparation for 25 years, it has been edited by Dr. Kapil Kapoor with contribution from over 2000 scholars.\n\nThe encyclopaedia provides conceptual perspective and a general understanding of the different facets of Hinduism. It does not confine itself to religion alone, and has in it entries on art, history, language, literature, philosophy, polity, sciences, and women's studies. The editorial introduction records:\n\nOn 3–4 April 2010, a preview and blessings ceremony for the \"Encyclopedia of Hinduism\" was held at Parmarth Niketan, attended by the Dalai Lama, M.M. Swami Gurusharananand, Swami Avdheshanand Giri, Sant Shri Rameshbhai Oza, Swami Ramdev, Sant Shri Morari Bapu and other religious leaders as well as top political leaders, including Shri L.K.

And it could be in-language…or it could be bilingual that reaches a very specific community.”\n\nIn addition to news, television, radio, online, print, and magazine outlets that qualify as ethnic media, academic John D.H. Downing adds musical culture and forms of religious expression to the ethnic media mix. Downing finds, “these may, along with language and dialect, act as a media force somewhere between shock absorption and psychic validation in the often fraught atmosphere between the ethnic majority and ethnic minorities.”\n\nDowning finds that ethnic media tends to circulate, “within at least three different sectors, namely, indigenous nations and communities, recent migrants…and settled subordinate ethnic groups.”\n\nAnalogous to the debate as to \"what\" qualifying factors constitute alternative media, the domain of \"what\" qualifying factors that classify a respective ethnic media outlet as an alternative media outlet is also, at play.\n\nThus, ethnic media is not by definitional default alternative media.\n\nAgain, the work of academics and grassroots practitioners, such as John D.H. Downing, Yu Shi, Clemencia Rodriguez, and Inga Buchbinder of New America Media provide definitional assistance for this complex and overdetermined zone. Discernment of whether or not a respective ethnic media outlet qualifies as an alternative media outlet is dependent upon the outstanding contextual information, and should be assessed on a case by case evaluation.\n\nYu Shi’s work puts forth a seven-pronged test for evaluating the “alternative media role” of ethnic media in the United States: “reference has to be made to their (1) individual place of origin, (2) historical evolution, (3) production process, (4) distribution pattern, (5) ownership, (6) self-identity (non-profit or for-profit; alternative or commercial; or in between), and (7) connection to power groups in local and transnational settings.”\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

People generally return an eyebrow flash, unless it was given by someone whom they do not know, or someone who looks away immediately after. The message must be interpreted in context. Psychologists and sociologists say that eyebrow raising can be a reaction to fear or surprise.\n\nGrammer et al. define an eyebrow flash as a contraction of the inner brow raiser muscle (M. Frontalis, pars medialis) and the outer brow raiser muscle (M. frontalis, pars lateralis) as defined by the Facial Action Coding System. An eyebrow flash is subdivided into three time intervals: the onset (the time during which the eyebrows raise to their maximal position), the apex (the time during which the eyebrows are in their maximal position), and the offset (the time during which the eyebrows lower to their original state).\n\nA study conducted in 1987 recorded approximately 67 hours of unstaged social interactions conducted by 255 individuals from three locations: Western New Guinea, Papua New Guinea, and Upper Orinoco. The study found significant differences in the age and sex of senders and receivers among the populations studied; for instance, Eipo men from Western New Guinea were more likely to be senders, while Trobriand men from Papua New Guinea were more likely to be receivers. Across all three cultures, a lowering of the eyelids or a head movement often coincided with the beginning of an eyebrow flash. Additionally, people from all three cultures exhibited longer-duration eyebrow flashes at the openings of conversations than during conversations.\n"}
{"id": "2105880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105880", "title": "Fanagalo", "text": "Fanagalo\n\nFanagalo is a pidgin (simplified language) based primarily on Zulu, with English and a small Afrikaans input. It is used as a lingua franca, mainly in the gold, diamond, coal and copper mining industries in South Africa and to a lesser extent in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Although it is used as a second language only, the number of speakers was estimated as \"several hundred thousand\" in 1975. Once the British left, English became the lingua franca enabling different tribes in the same country to communicate with each other, and Fanagalo use declined.\n\nFanagalo is the only Zulu-based pidgin language, and is a rare example of a pidgin based on an indigenous language rather than on the language of a colonising or trading power.\n\nThe variety in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) is known as Chilapalapa and is influenced by Shona, while the variety in Zambia (Northern Rhodesia), called Cikabanga (pronounced, and sometimes spelt, Chikabanga), is influenced by Bemba.\n\nThe name \"Fanagalo\" comes from strung-together Nguni forms fana-ga-lo meaning \"like + of + that\" and has the meaning \"do it like this\", reflecting its use as a language of instruction.\n\nOther spellings of the name are \"Fanakalo\" and \"Fanekolo\". It is also known as \"Isikula, Lololo\" or \"Isilololo, Piki\" or \"Isipiki\", and \"Silunguboi\". \n\nIn the Nguni tongues, the prefix \"Mu-\" or \"Ma-\" implies the singular, while \"Bu-\" or \"Ba-\" signifies the plural – hence \"Muntu\" = a man; \"Bantu\" = men, particularly when applied to tribes, e.g. \"Ma-tabele\". Similarly, the prefix \"Chi-\" or \"Si-\" indicates the language spoke by that tribe. e.g. men of the \"Lozi\" tribe are called \"Ba-rotse\", and they speak \"Si-lozi\"; Bembas speak Chiwemba; Tswanas live in Botswana, or as it used to be called, Bechuanaland.\n\nChi-lapa-lapa thus is the \"language\" derived from \"lapa\" = \"there\", with repetition for emphasis.\n\nFanagalo is one of a number of African pidgin languages that developed during the colonial period to promote ease of communication. suggests that it developed in the nineteenth century in KwaZulu-Natal Province as a way for English colonists to communicate with their servants and was also used as a lingua franca between English and Dutch/Afrikaans speaking colonists.\n\nFanagalo was used extensively in gold and diamond mines because the South African mining industry employed workers on fixed contracts from across southern and central Africa: including Congo, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Malawi and Mozambique. With workers originating from a range of countries and having a vast range of different mother tongues, Fanagalo provided a simple way to communicate and is still used as a training and operating medium. Fifteen hours instruction was considered sufficient for an initiate to become reasonably fluent. See Witwatersrand Native Labour Association.\n\nAdendorff describes two variants of the language, Mine Fanagalo and Garden Fanagalo. The latter name refers to its use with servants in households. It was previously known as Kitchen Kaffir. (The term \"kaffir\" tended, in Southern Africa, to be used as a derogatory term for black people, and is now considered extremely offensive. It is derived from the Arab word Kafir, meaning unbeliever.)\n\nIn the mid-20th century in South Africa there were Government efforts to promote and standardise Fanagalo as a universal second language, under the name of \"Basic Bantu\".\n\nIn contrast, mining companies in the early 21st century have attempted to phase out Fanagalo in favour of the pre-existing, local languages. Ravyse (2018) discusses Fanagalo's apparent resistance to opposing official policy, in spite of its ongoing stigma as a language for the illiterate. Fanagalo has become intertwined with the culture of the mining industry, and its continuation seems to hinge on the ongoing favour of its speaking community, rather than industry policy. \n\nMining aside, Adendorff also suggests that Fanagalo has unfavourable and negative connotations for many South Africans. However, he raises the point that Fanagalo is sometimes used between white South Africans, particularly expatriates, as a signal of South African origin and a way of conveying solidarity in an informal manner. That role has of late largely been taken over by Afrikaans; even among English speaking South African expatriates.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, holiday makers from the Rhodesias often used to go on holiday to Lourenço Marques in Mozambique (now Maputo), where many people speak Portuguese – but most also spoke a form of Fanagalo.\n\nAll three languages are currently experiencing a revival in their popularity as a lingua franca, now freed from connotations of \"colonialism\" and valued for their intrinsic usefulness.\n\nRhodesian comedian Wrex Tarr was famous for routines that make extensive use of Chilapalapa.\n\nMine Fanagalo in South Africa and Zimbabwe is based mostly on Zulu vocabulary (about 70%), with English (about 25%) and some words from Afrikaans (5%). It does not have the range of Zulu inflections, and it tends to follow English word order. \n\nAdendorff describes Mine Fanagalo and Garden Fanagalo as being basically the same pidgin. He suggests that Garden Fanagalo should be seen as lying towards the English end of a continuum, and Mine Fanagalo closer to the Zulu end.\n\nSeveral key features differentiate Fanagalo from the Nguni languages (such as Zulu and Xhosa). \"Lo\" functions as both an article and a demonstrative, while only a demonstrative in Zulu. \"Lapha\" is used to mean \"here\", also meaning \"there\" when the first syllable is stressed, and is also used as a general preposition for location. (It works for anything such as \"on\", or \"near\", etc.) Zulu, on the other hand, only uses \"lapha\"to mean \"here\". Additionally, Fanagalo only uses free pronouns: \"mina\", \"tina\", \"wena\", \"ena\", meaning \"I, we, you, he/she/it/they\". Zulu only uses pronouns for emphasis, relying instead on verb agreement markers, much like Spanish. \n\nThe past tense of verbs is marked by the suffix \"-ile\" (\"hamba \"I go, go!\", \"hambile\" \"I went\"), and the future with the modal \"azi\" (\"azi hamba\" \"will go\").\"\n\nHere are two examples (all letters are pronounced):-\n\n\"Koki Lobin\"\nCock Robin\n\n\"Zonke nyoni lapa moyo ena kala, ena kala\"\nAll birds of air, they cried, they cried\n\"Ena izwile ena file lo nyoni Koki Lobin\"\nThey heard the death the bird Cock Robin\n\"Ena izwile, ena file, ena izwile ena file Cocky Lobin.\"\n\n\"Kubani ena bulalile Koki Lobin?\"\nWho they killed Cock Robin\n\"Mina kruma lo Sparrow\"\nMe, said the sparrow\n\"Na lo picannin bow and arrow kamina\"\nWith the little bow & arrow of mine\n\"Mina bulalile Koki Lobin.\"\nI killed Cock Robin\n\n\"TANDAZO\"\n\n\"Baba ga tina, Wena kona pezulu,\"\nFather of ours, You are above\n\" Tina bonga lo Gama ga wena; \"\nWe thank (for) the name of you\n\"Tina vuma lo mteto ga wena Lapa mhlaba, fana na pezulu.\"\n\"Niga tina namuhla lo zinkwa yena izwasisa;\"\nGive us today etc., etc... \n\"Futi, yekelela masono gatina,\"\n\"Loskati tina yekelela masono ga lomunye.\"\n\"Hayi letisa tina lapa lo cala; Kodwa, sindisa tina ku lo bubi,\"\n\"Ndaba Wena kona lo-mteto, lo mandla, na lo dumela, Zonkeskat.

The traveler is later rewarded or has their life saved by a person or animal who is actually the soul of the dead person; the grateful dead is a form of the donor.\n\nThe \"grateful dead\" story is Aarne–Thompson–Uther type 505.\n\nAn ancient Egyptian text explains the principle of reciprocity in which the deceased calls for a blessing on the person who remembers his name and helps him into a happy afterlife:\nBut if there be a man, any one whomsoever, who beholdeth this writing and causeth my soul and my name to become established among those who are blessed, let it be done for him likewise after his final arriving (at the end of life's voyage) in recompense for what was done by him for me, Osiris.\n\nOne variant is the Book of Tobit.

{"id": "7115965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7115965", "title": "IETF language tag", "text": "IETF language tag\n\nAn IETF language tag is an abbreviated language code (for example, \"en\" for English, \"pt-BR\" for Brazilian Portuguese, or \"nan-Hant-TW\" for Min Nan Chinese as spoken in Taiwan using traditional Han characters) defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in the \"BCP 47\" document series, which is currently composed of normative RFC 5646 (referencing the related RFC 5645) and RFC 4647, along with the normative content of the \"IANA Language Subtag Registry\". Components of language tags are drawn from ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166-1, and UN M.49.\n\nThese language tags are used in a number of modern computing standards, including those from the IETF related to the Internet protocols such as HTTP, those from the World Wide Web Consortium such as HTML, XML and PNG, and those from other private standardization bodies such as SGML or Unicode (in some of its standard annexes), or from national or regional standard bodies like ANSI or Ecma (for example in some of their standards related to computing languages, or bibliographic references and documents classification used in institutional libraries).\n\nIETF language tags were first defined in RFC 1766, edited by Harald Tveit Alvestrand, published in March 1995. The tags used ISO 639 two-letter language codes and ISO 3166 two-letter country codes, and allowed registration of whole tags that included variant or script subtags of three to eight letters.\n\nIn January 2001 this was updated by RFC 3066, which added the use of ISO 639-2 three-letter codes, permitted subtags with digits, and adopted the concept of language ranges from HTTP/1.1 to help with matching of language tags.\n\nThe next revision of the specification came in September 2006 with the publication of RFC 4646 (the main part of the specification), edited by Addison Philips and Mark Davis and <nowiki>RFC 4647</nowiki> (which deals with matching behaviour). <nowiki>RFC 4646</nowiki> introduced a more structured format for language tags, added the use of ISO 15924 four-letter script codes and UN M.49 three-digit geographical region codes, and replaced the old registry of tags with a new registry of subtags. The small number of previously defined tags that did not conform to the new structure were grandfathered in order to maintain compatibility with <nowiki>RFC 3066</nowiki>.\n\nThe current version of the specification, RFC 5646, was published in September 2009. The main purpose of this revision was to incorporate three-letter codes from ISO 639-3 and 639-5 into the Language Subtag Registry, in order to increase the interoperability between ISO 639 and BCP 47.\n\nEach language tag is composed of one or more \"subtags\" separated by hyphens (-). Each subtag is composed of basic Latin letters or digits only.\n\nWith the exceptions of private-use language tags beginning with an \"x-\" prefix and grandfathered language tags (including those starting with an \"i-\" prefix and those previously registered in the old Language Tag Registry), subtags occur in the following order:\n\nSubtags are not case-sensitive, but the specification recommends using the same case as in the Language Subtag Registry, where region subtags are UPPERCASE, script subtags are Title Case, and all other subtags are lowercase. This capitalization follows the recommendations of the underlying ISO standards.\n\nOptional script and region subtags are preferred to be omitted when they add no distinguishing information to a language tag. For example, \"es\" is preferred over \"es-Latn\", as Spanish is fully expected to be written in the Latin script; \"ja\" is preferred over \"ja-JP\", as Japanese \"as used in Japan\" does not differ markedly from Japanese as used elsewhere.\n\nNot all linguistic regions can be represented with a valid region subtag: the subnational regional dialects of a primary language are registered as variant subtags. For example, the \"valencia\" variant subtag for the Valencian dialect of Catalan is registered in the Language Subtag Registry with the prefix \"ca\". As this dialect is spoken almost exclusively in Spain, the region subtag \"ES\" can normally be omitted.\n\nIETF language tags have been used as locale identifiers in many applications. It may be necessary for these applications to establish their own strategy for defining, encoding and matching locales if the strategy described in <nowiki>RFC 4647</nowiki> is not adequate.\n\nThe use, interpretation and matching of IETF language tags is currently defined in <nowiki>RFC 5646</nowiki> and <nowiki>RFC 4647</nowiki>. The Language Subtag Registry lists all currently valid public subtags. Private-use subtags are not included in the Registry as they are implementation-dependent and subject to private agreements between third parties using them. These private agreements are out of scope of BCP 47.\n\nAlthough some types of subtags are derived from ISO or UN core standards, they do not follow these standards absolutely, as this could lead to the meaning of language tags changing over time. In particular, a subtag derived from a code assigned by ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166, or UN M.49 remains a valid (though deprecated) subtag even if the code is withdrawn from the corresponding core standard. If the standard later assigns a new meaning to the withdrawn code, the corresponding subtag will still retain its old meaning.\n\nThis stability was introduced in RFC 4646.\n\nRFC 4646 defined the concept of an \"extended language subtag\" (sometimes referred to as \"extlang\"), although no such subtags were registered at that time.\n\nRFC 5645 and RFC 5646 added primary language subtags corresponding to ISO 639-3 codes for all languages that did not already exist in the Registry. In addition, codes for languages encompassed by certain macrolanguages were registered as extended language subtags. Sign languages were also registered as extlangs, with the prefix \"sgn\". These languages may be represented either with the subtag for the encompassed language alone (\"cmn\" for Mandarin) or with a language-extlang combination (\"zh-cmn\"). The first option is preferred for most purposes. The second option is called \"extlang form\" and is new in RFC 5646.\n\nWhole tags that were registered prior to RFC 4646 and are now classified as \"grandfathered\" or \"redundant\" (depending on whether they fit the new syntax) are deprecated in favor of the corresponding ISO 639-3–based language subtag, if one exists. To list a few examples, \"nan\" is preferred over \"zh-min-nan\" for Min Nan Chinese; \"hak\" is preferred over \"i-hak\" and \"zh-hakka\" for Hakka Chinese; and \"ase\" is preferred over \"sgn-US\" for American Sign Language.\n\nISO 639-5 defines language collections with alpha-3 codes in a different way than they were initially encoded in ISO 639-2 (including one code already present in ISO 639-1). Specifically, the language collections are now all defined in ISO 639-5 as inclusive, rather than some of them being defined exclusively. This means that language collections have a broader scope than before, in some cases where they could encompass languages that were already encoded separately within ISO 639-2.\n\nFor example, the ISO 639-2 code \"afa\" was previously associated with the name \"Afro-Asiatic (Other)\", excluding languages such as Arabic that already had their own code. In ISO 639-5, this collection is named \"Afro-Asiatic languages\" and includes all such languages. ISO 639-2 changed the exclusive names in 2009 to match the inclusive ISO 639-5 names.\n\nTo avoid breaking implementations that may still depend on the older (exclusive) definition of these collections, ISO 639-5 defines a grouping type attribute for all collections that were already encoded in ISO 639-2 (such grouping type is not defined for the new collections added only in ISO 639-5).\n\nBCP 47 defines a \"Scope\" property to identify subtags for language collections. However, it does not define any given collection as inclusive or exclusive, and does not use the ISO 639-5 grouping type attribute, although the description fields in the Language Subtag Registry for these subtags match the ISO 639-5 (inclusive) names. As a consequence, BCP 47 language tags that include a primary language subtag for a collection may be ambiguous as to whether the collection is intended to be inclusive or exclusive.\n\nISO 639-5 does not define precisely which languages are members of these collections; only the hierarchical classification of collections is defined, using the inclusive definition of these collections. Because of this, RFC 5646 does not recommend the use of subtags for language collections for most applications, although they are still preferred over subtags whose meaning is even less specific, such as \"Multiple languages\" and \"Undetermined\".\n\nIn contrast, the classification of individual languages within their macrolanguage is standardized, in both ISO 639-3 and the Language Subtag Registry.\n\nScript subtags were first added to the Language Subtag Registry when RFC 4646 was published, from the list of codes defined in ISO 15924. They are encoded in the language tag after primary and extended language subtags, but before other types of subtag, including region and variant subtags.\n\nSome primary language subtags are defined with a property named \"Suppress-Script\" which indicates the cases where a single script can usually be assumed by default for the language, even if it can be written with another script. When this is the case, it is preferable to omit the script subtag, to improve the likelihood of successful matching. A different script subtag can still be appended to make the distinction when necessary. For example, \"yi\" is preferred over \"yi-Hebr\" in most contexts, because the Hebrew script subtag is assumed for the Yiddish language.\n\nAs another example, \"zh-Hans-SG\" may be considered equivalent to \"zh-Hans\", because the region code is probably not significant; the written form of Chinese used in Singapore uses the same simplified Chinese characters as in other countries where Chinese is written. However, the script subtag is maintained because it is significant.\n\nNote that ISO 15924 includes some codes for script variants (for example, \"Hans\" and \"Hant\" for simplified and traditional forms of Chinese characters) that are unified within Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646. These script variants are most often encoded for bibliographic purposes, but are not always significant from a linguistic point of view (for example, \"Latf\" and \"Latg\" script codes for the Fraktur and Gaelic variants of the Latin script, which are mostly encoded with regular Latin letters in Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646). They may occasionally be useful in language tags to expose orthographic or semantic differences, with different analysis of letters, diacritics, and digraphs/trigraphs as default grapheme clusters, or differences in letter casing rules.\n\nTwo-letter region subtags are based on codes assigned, or \"exceptionally reserved\", in ISO 3166-1. If the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency were to reassign a code that had previously been assigned to a different country, the existing BCP 47 subtag corresponding to that code would retain its meaning, and a new region subtag based on UN M.49 would be registered for the new country. UN M.49 is also the source for numeric region subtags for geographical regions, such as codice_1 for South America.\n\nRegion subtags are used to specify the variety of a language \"as used in\" a particular region. They are appropriate when the variety is regional in nature, and can be captured adequately by identifying the countries involved, as when distinguishing British English (\"en-GB\") from American English (\"en-US\"). When the difference is one of script or script variety, as for simplified versus traditional Chinese characters, it should be expressed with a script subtag instead of a region subtag; in this example, \"zh-Hans\" and \"zh-Hant\" should be used instead of \"zh-CN\" and \"zh-HK\".\n\nWhen a distinct language subtag exists for a language that could be considered a regional variety, it is often preferable to use the more specific subtag instead of a language-region combination. For example, \"ar-DZ\" (Arabic as used in Algeria) may be better expressed as \"arq\" for Algerian Spoken Arabic.\n\n\"Extension subtags\" (not to be confused with \"extended language subtags\") allow additional information to be attached to a language tag that does not necessarily serve to identify a language. One use for extensions is to encode locale information, such as calendar and currency.\n\nExtension subtags are composed of multiple hyphen-separated character strings, starting with a single character (other than \"x\"), called a \"singleton\". Each extension is described in its own IETF RFC, which identifies a Registration Authority to manage the data for that extension. IANA is responsible for allocating singletons.\n\nTwo extensions have been assigned as of January 2014.\n\nExtension T allows a language tag to include information on how the tagged data was transliterated, transcribed, or otherwise transformed. For example, the tag \"en-t-jp\" could be used for content in English that was translated from the original Japanese. Additional substrings could indicate that the translation was done mechanically, or in accordance with a published standard.\n\nExtension T is described in RFC 6497, published in February 2012. The Registration Authority is the Unicode Consortium.\n\nExtension U allows a wide variety of locale attributes found in the Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) to be embedded in language tags. These attributes include calendar and time zone data, collation order, currency, number system, and keyboard identification. Tags containing a \"u-\" extension are more likely to be used to identify locale data sets than for purely linguistic content.\n\nSome examples include:\n\nExtension U is described in RFC 6067, published in December 2010. The Registration Authority is the Unicode Consortium.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5477429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5477429", "title": "Little Emperor Syndrome", "text": "Little Emperor Syndrome\n\nThe Little Emperor Syndrome (or Little Emperor Effect) was an aspect/view of Mainland China's one-child policy where children of modern upper class and wealthier Chinese families gain seemingly excessive amounts of attention from their parents and grandparents. Combined with increased spending power due to China's growing economic strength within the family unit and parents' general desire for their child to experience the benefits they themselves were denied, the phenomenon is generally considered to be problematic. The British journalist Andrew Marshall even argues that it is shaping modern Chinese society in unexpected ways that may culminate into a future \"behavioral time-bomb\".\n\nLittle Emperors were primarily an urban phenomenon. The one-child policy generally only applied to urban communities and, given the value of labor, one child families are not prevalent within rural communities. Economic development has not had as large an impact outside of urban centers.\n\nModern China's economic growth has tremendously elevated the annual per capita income of urban areas as women have become increasingly represented in the workforce, frequently resulting in families with two sources of income. This greatly improved purchasing power coupled with excessive pampering of only children is the cause of increased spending on children. From toys to clothes, parents shower their child in material goods and give in to every demand; it is common for children to be the \"best-dressed members of their families.\"\n\nRecently, it has become common for most of a family's income to be spent on the child. This effect has become considerable enough to be noticed on a global scale: marketing groups attribute a near doubling of platinum Jewellery sales in China to \"China's 'spoiled brat' generation.\"\n\nLittle Emperors also bear the burden of heavy expectations. Parents who feel they lost their chance in the Cultural Revolution (\"compensation syndrome\") put immense pressure on these children to succeed and compete academically. From an early age parents push their only child to educational extremes as they cater to their whims; \"though many of these precocious kids can recite the English alphabet or read newspapers in traditional Chinese characters by the time they're 10, their parents often still perform basic tasks for them: fixing their hair, tying their shoes, wiping their bottoms.\" Boarding school, private English lessons, music lessons and an additional range of extracurricular activities are the normal fare.\n\nOne factor frequently associated with the Little Emperor effect is the \"four-two-one\" family structure, which refers to the collapse of the traditionally large Chinese family into four grandparents and two parents doting on one child. Beyond the obvious further funneling of resources towards the whims and potential of the only child, this four-two-one reconfiguration of the familial structure has distinct ramifications for Chinese society. The Little Emperors of the one-child policy have warped the traditional family beyond recognition; \"in the past, the power in a household devolved from the father,\" who ruled over a multitude of offspring.\n\nNow the household structures itself entirely around the one child. This shift from earlier structures that supported the culture of filial piety has caused much concern; \"traditionally, a great number of children, particularly sons, was seen as proof of the family's standing and it guaranteed the continuity of ancestor-worshipping customs.\" The most salient issue stems from the worry about who will look after the elderly. Aside from a potentially radical shift in cultural norms concerning the treatment of the elderly, this new family structure poses a purely demographic problem: \"the composition of the dependent population is shifting away from children toward elderly population.\"\n\nMany Chinese families use traditional Confucian values to teach their only child. Confucianism considers Ren (love and social responsibility) the core emotion that inspires other moral concepts in personal motivation. The child often receives too much love and has been highly mentally and physically restricted to devote themselves to a heavy load of schoolwork, considering that the economic future of the family depends on their success. Such a situation can directly lead to the overindulgence of the child thus reversing traditional Confucian values of Ren (仁) and filial piety (xiao 孝). There is also evidence that many young Chinese feel heavily burdened and a huge sense of responsibility toward their parents, understanding that their success can have crucial consequences for their family.\n\nDepending on specific family conditions and a child's outlook, this burden can lead to a diligent lifestyle by youngsters or to a more rebellious attitude to traditional codes or to not being able to cope with such pressure nor to develop self-discipline.\n\nThe combination of immense pressure to excel and extreme pampering is reported to have resulted in a stunting of social and emotional growth. The perceived maladjustment of the Little Emperors is an exaggerated subject within the media; \"the government has [tried] to cope with the Little Emperor problem through frequent cautionary stories in the press.\" These stories depict children hanging themselves after being denied sweets and cases of matricide in retribution for a scolding or late dinner. The discussion of Little Emperors has saturated public discussion concerning the one-child policy in Chinese and international media.\n\nPsychological studies do not support this view or, at best, offered mixed results. Results from earlier studies are inconsistent with some more recent studies that suggest there are no reliable differences between only children and those with siblings. However, a survey published in 2013 on 431 Beijing adults finds that those who had grown up after the introduction of the one-child policy were lacking \"entrepreneurial drive and the willingness to take risks. This even had a significant impact on career choices.\n\n"}
{"id": "651326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=651326", "title": "Macaronic language", "text": "Macaronic language\n\nMacaronic language refers to text using a mixture of languages, particularly bilingual puns or situations in which the languages are otherwise used in the same context (rather than simply discrete segments of a text being in different languages). The term can also denote hybrid words, which are effectively \"internally macaronic\". A rough equivalent in spoken language is code-switching, a term in linguistics referring to using more than one language or dialect within the same conversation.\n\nMacaronic Latin in particular is a jumbled jargon made up of vernacular words given Latin endings, or for Latin words mixed with the vernacular in a pastiche (compare dog Latin).\n\nThe word \"macaronic\" comes from the New Latin \"macaronicus\" which is from the Italian \"maccarone\" (\"dumpling\", regarded as coarse peasant fare). The term can have derogatory overtones, and is usually reserved for works where the mixing of languages has a humorous or satirical intent or effect. It is a matter of debate whether the term can be applied to mixed-language literature of a more serious nature and purpose.\n\nTexts that mixed Latin and vernacular language apparently arose throughout Europe at the end of the Middle Ages—a time when Latin was still the working language of scholars, clerics and university students, but was losing ground to vernacular among poets, minstrels and storytellers.\n\nAn early example is from 1130, in the Gospel book of Munsterbilzen Abbey. The following sentence mixes late Old Dutch and Latin:\n<poem>\nTesi samanunga was edele unde scona\net omnium virtutum pleniter plena\n</poem>\nTranslated: \"This community was noble and pure, and completely full of all virtues.\"\n\nThe \"Carmina Burana\" (collected c.1230) contains several poems mixing Latin with Medieval German or French. Another well-known example is the first stanza of the famous carol \"In Dulci Jubilo\", whose original version (written around 1328) had Latin mixed with German, with a hint of Greek. While some of those early works had a clear humorous intent, many use the language mix for lyrical effect.\n\nAnother early example is in the Middle English recitals \"The Towneley Plays\" (c.1460). In \"The Talents\" (play 24), Pontius Pilate delivers a rhyming speech in mixed English and Latin.\n\nA number of English political poems in the 14th century alternated (Middle) English and Latin lines, such as in MS Digby 196:\n<poem>The taxe hath tened [ruined] vs alle,\n\nSeveral Anthems also contain both Latin and English. In the case of 'Nolo mortem pecatoris' by Thomas Morley, the Latin is used as a refrain:\n\n<poem>\nNolo mortem peccatoris; Haec sunt verba Salvatoris.\nFather I am thine only Son, sent down from heav’n mankind to save.\nFather, all things fulfilled and done according to thy will, I have.\nFather, my will now all is this: Nolo mortem peccatoris.\nFather, behold my painful smart, taken for man on ev’ry side;\nEv'n from my birth to death most tart, no kind of pain I have denied,\nbut suffered all, and all for this: Nolo mortem peccatoris.\n</poem>\nTranslated: \"'I do not wish the death of the wicked'; These are the words of the Saviour.\" An allusion to John 3:17 and 2 Peter 3:9.\n\nThe term \"macaronic\" is believed to have originated in Padua in the late 15th century, apparently from \"maccarona\", a kind of pasta or dumpling eaten by peasants at that time. (That is also the presumed origin of \"maccheroni\".) Its association with the genre comes from the \"Macaronea\", a comical poem by Tifi Odasi in mixed Latin and Italian, published in 1488 or 1489. Another example of the genre is \"Tosontea\" by Corrado of Padua, which was published at about the same time as Tifi's \"Macaronea\".\n\nTifi and his contemporaries clearly intended to satirize the broken Latin used by many doctors, scholars and bureaucrats of their time. While this \"macaronic Latin\" (\"macaronica verba\") could be due to ignorance or carelessness, it could also be the result of its speakers trying to make themselves understood by the vulgar folk without resorting to their speech.\n\nAn important and unusual example of mixed-language text is the \"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\" of Francesco Colonna (1499), which was basically written using Italian syntax and morphology, but using a made-up vocabulary based on roots from Latin, Greek, and occasionally others. However, while the \"Hypnerotomachia\" is contemporary with Tifi's \"Macaronea\", its mixed language is not used for plain humor, but rather as an aesthetic device to underscore the fantastic but refined nature of the book.\n\nTifi's \"Macaronea\" was a popular success, and the writing of humorous texts in macaronic Latin became a fad in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in Italian, but also in many other European languages. An important Italian example was \"Baldo\" by Teofilo Folengo, who described his own verses as \"a gross, rude, and rustic mixture of flour, cheese, and butter\".\n\nMacaronic verse is especially common in cultures with widespread bilingualism or language contact, such as Ireland before the middle of the nineteenth century. Macaronic traditional songs such as \"Siúil A Rúin\" are quite common in Ireland. In Scotland, macaronic songs have been popular among Highland immigrants to Glasgow, using English and Scottish Gaelic as a device to express the alien nature of the anglophone environment. An example:\n\nWhen I came down to Glasgow first,\na-mach air Tìr nan Gall.\nI was like a man adrift,\nair iomrall 's doll air chall.\n\nFolk and popular music of the Andes frequently alternates between Spanish and the given South American language of its region of origin.\n\nSome Classical Persian poems were written with alternating Persian and Arabic verses or hemistichs, most famously by Saadi and Hafez. Such poems were called \"molamma‘\" (, literally \"speckled\", plural \"molamma‘āt\" ), Residing in Anatolia, in some of his poems Rumi mixed Persian with Arabic as well as the local languages of Turkish and Greek.\n\nMacaronic verse was also common in medieval India, where the influence of the Muslim rulers led to poems being written in alternating indigenous Hindi and the Persian language. This style was used by the famous poet Amir Khusro and played a major role in the rise of the Urdu or Hindustani language.\n\nThe Sublime song \"Caress Me Down\" alternates between English and Spanish lyrics, at some points between verses, at others between lines within a verse, and occasionally between phrases within a line.\n\nOccasionally language is unintentionally macaronic. One particularly famed piece of schoolyard Greek in France is Xenophon's line \"they did not take the city; but in fact they had no hope of taking it\" (, \"ouk élabon pólin; álla gàr elpìs éphē kaká\"). Read in the French manner, this becomes \"Où qu'est la bonne Pauline? A la gare. Elle pisse et fait caca.\" (\"Where is Pauline the maid? At the [railway] station. She's pissing and taking a shit.\") In English literature, the untranslated line makes an appearance in James Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\".\n\nMacaronic text is still used by modern Italian authors, e.g. by Carlo Emilio Gadda and Beppe Fenoglio. Other examples are provided by the character Salvatore in Umberto Eco's \"The Name of the Rose\", and the peasant hero of his \"Baudolino\". Dario Fo's \"Mistero Buffo\" (\"Comic Mystery Play\") features grammelot sketches using language with macaronic elements.\n\nThe 2001 novel \"The Last Samurai\" by Helen DeWitt includes portions of Japanese, Classical Greek, and Inuktitut, although the reader is not expected to understand the passages that are not in English.\n\nMacaronic games are used by the literary group Oulipo in the form of interlinguistic homophonic transformation: replacing\na known phrase with homophones from another language. The archetypal example is by François Le Lionnais, who transformed John Keats' \"A thing of beauty is a joy forever\" into \"Un singe de beauté est un jouet pour l'hiver\": 'A monkey of beauty is a toy for the winter'. Another example is the book \"Mots d'Heures\".\n\nMacaronisms figure prominently in \"The Trilogy\" by the Polish novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz, and are one of the major compositional principles for James Joyce's novel \"Finnegans Wake\".\n\nTwo well-known examples of non-humorous macaronic verse are Byron's \"Maid of Athens, ere we part\" (1810, in English with a Greek refrain); and Pearsall's translation of the carol \"In Dulci Jubilo\" (1837, in mixed English and Latin verse).\n\nAn example of modern humorous macaronic verse is the anonymous English/Latin poem \"Carmen Possum\" (\"The Opossum's Song\"), which is sometimes used as a teaching and motivational aid in elementary Latin language classes. Other similar examples are \"The Motor Bus\" by A. D. Godley, and the anonymous \"Up I arose in verno tempore\".\n\nRecent examples are the \"mużajki\" or 'mosaics' (2007) of Maltese poet Antoine Cassar mixing English, Spanish, Maltese, Italian, and French; works of Italian writer Guido Monte; and the late poetry of Ivan Blatný combining Czech with English. \n\nBrian P. Cleary's \"What Can I C'est?\" makes use of macaronic verse, as do other poems in his book \"Rainbow Soup: Adventures in Poetry\":\n\nMy auntie Michelle is big in the BON\n(As well as the hip and the thigh).\nAnd when she exhales, OUI haul out our sails\nAnd ride on the wind of VERSAILLES.\n\nA whole body of comic verse exists created by John O'Mill, pseudonym of Johan van der Meulen, a teacher of English at the Rijks HBS (State Grammar School), Breda, the Netherlands. These are in a mixture of English and Dutch, often playing on common mistakes made when translating from the latter to the former.\n\nThe finale of act 1 of Gilbert and Sullivan's Savoy Opera Iolanthe has several instances of humorous macaronic verse. \n\nFirst, the three Lords mix Italian and Latin phrases into their discussion of Iolanthe's age:\nLord Mountararat: This gentleman is seen, / With a maid of seventeen, / A-taking of his \"dolce far niente\"...\nLord Chancellor: Recollect yourself, I pray, / And be careful what you say- / As the ancient Romans said, \"festina lente\"...\nLord Tolloller: I have often had a use / For a thorough-bred excuse / Of a sudden (which is English for \"repente\")...\nLord Mountararat: Now, listen, pray to me, / For this paradox will be / Carried, nobody at all \"contradicente\"...\n\nThen, the chorus of peers sing macaronic verse as they attempt to resist the fairies' powers:\nOur lordly style you shall not quench with base \"canaille\"! (That word is French.) \nDistinction ebbs before a herd of vulgar \"plebs\"! (A Latin word.)\nTwould fill with joy and madness stark the \"oι πoλλoί\"! (A Greek remark.) \nOne Latin word, one Greek remark, and one that's French.\n\n'Macaronisms' are frequently used in films, especially comedies. In Charlie Chaplin's anti-war comedy \"The Great Dictator\", the title character speaks English mixed with a parody of German (e.g. \"Cheese-und-cracken\"). This was also used by Benzino Napaloni, the parody character of Benito Mussolini, using Italian foods (such as salami and ravioli) as insults.\n\nOther movies featuring macaronic language are the Italian historical comedies \"L'armata Brancaleone\" and \"Brancaleone alle crociate\" (d. Mario Monicelli), which mix modern and medieval Italian as well as Latin (sometimes in rhyme, and sometimes with regional connotations, such as the Italo-Normans using words from modern Sicilian).\n\nMacaronic language appearing in popular songs include Dean Martin's \"That's Amore\" (Italian and English), the Beatles’ \"Michelle\" (French and English), The Clash’s \"Spanish Bombs\" and José Feliciano’s \"Feliz Navidad\" (Spanish and English), the Talking Heads \"Psycho Killer\" (French and English), and The Weeknd's Montreal (French and English).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "329625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=329625", "title": "Mimesis", "text": "Mimesis\n\nMimesis (; \"mīmēsis\", from μιμεῖσθαι \"mīmeisthai\", \"to imitate\", from \"mimos\", \"imitator, actor\") is a critical and philosophical term that carries a wide range of meanings, which include imitation, representation, mimicry, \"imitatio\", receptivity, nonsensuous similarity, the act of resembling, the act of expression, and the presentation of the self.\n\nIn ancient Greece, mimesis was an idea that governed the creation of works of art, in particular, with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, truth, and the good. Plato contrasted mimesis, or imitation, with diegesis, or narrative. After Plato, the meaning of mimesis eventually shifted toward a specifically literary function in ancient Greek society, and its use has changed and been reinterpreted many times since.\n\nOne of the best-known modern studies of mimesis, understood as a form of realism in literature, is Erich Auerbach's \"\", which opens with a famous comparison between the way the world is represented in Homer's \"Odyssey\" and the way it appears in the \"Bible\". From these two seminal Western texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of representation that spans the entire history of Western literature, including the Modernist novels being written at the time Auerbach began his study. In art history, \"mimesis\", \"realism\" and \"naturalism\" are used, often interchangeably, as terms for the accurate, even \"illusionistic\", representation of the visual appearance of things.\n\nMimesis has been theorised by thinkers as diverse as Plato, Aristotle, Philip Sidney, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Adam Smith, Gabriel Tarde, Sigmund Freud, Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, Erich Auerbach, Paul Ricœur, Luce Irigaray, Jacques Derrida, René Girard, Nikolas Kompridis, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Michael Taussig, Merlin Donald, and Homi Bhabha.\n\nBoth Plato and Aristotle saw in mimesis the representation of nature, including human nature, as reflected in the dramas of the period. Plato wrote about mimesis in both \"Ion\" and \"The Republic\" (Books II, III, and X). In \"Ion\", he states that poetry is the art of divine madness, or inspiration. Because the poet is subject to this divine madness, instead of possessing \"art\" or \"knowledge\" – \"techne\" – of the subject (532c), the poet does not speak truth (as characterized by Plato's account of the Forms). As Plato has it, truth is only the concern of the philosopher. As culture in those days did not consist in the solitary reading of books, but in the listening to performances, the recitals of orators (and poets), or the acting out by classical actors of tragedy, Plato maintained in his critique that theatre was not sufficient in conveying the truth (540c). He was concerned that actors or orators were thus able to persuade an audience by rhetoric rather than by telling the truth (535b).\n\nIn Book II of \"The Republic\", Plato describes Socrates' dialogue with his pupils. Socrates warns we should not seriously regard poetry as being capable of attaining the truth and that we who listen to poetry should be on our guard against its seductions, since the poet has no place in our idea of God.\n\nIn developing this in Book X, Plato told of Socrates' metaphor of the three beds: one bed exists as an idea made by God (the Platonic ideal, or form); one is made by the carpenter, in imitation of God's idea; one is made by the artist in imitation of the carpenter's.\n\nSo the artist's bed is twice removed from the truth. Those who copy only touch on a small part of things as they really are, where a bed may appear differently from various points of view, looked at obliquely or directly, or differently again in a mirror. So painters or poets, though they may paint or describe a carpenter, or any other maker of things, know nothing of the carpenter's (the craftsman's) art, and though the better painters or poets they are, the more faithfully their works of art will resemble the reality of the carpenter making a bed, nonetheless the imitators will still not attain the truth (of God's creation).\n\nThe poets, beginning with Homer, far from improving and educating humanity, do not possess the knowledge of craftsmen and are mere imitators who copy again and again images of virtue and rhapsodise about them, but never reach the truth in the way the superior philosophers do.\n\nSimilar to Plato's writings about mimesis, Aristotle also defined mimesis as the perfection, and imitation of nature. Art is not only imitation but also the use of mathematical ideas and symmetry in the search for the perfect, the timeless, and contrasting being with becoming. Nature is full of change, decay, and cycles, but art can also search for what is everlasting and the first causes of natural phenomena. Aristotle wrote about the idea of four causes in nature. The first, the formal cause, is like a blueprint, or an immortal idea. The second cause is the material cause, or what a thing is made out of. The third cause is the efficient cause, that is, the process and the agent by which the thing is made. The fourth, the final cause, is the good, or the purpose and end of a thing, known as \"telos\".\n\nAristotle's \"Poetics\" is often referred to as the counterpart to this Platonic conception of poetry. \"Poetics\" is his treatise on the subject of mimesis. Aristotle was not against literature as such; he stated that human beings are mimetic beings, feeling an urge to create texts (art) that reflect and represent reality.\n\nAristotle considered it important that there be a certain distance between the work of art on the one hand and life on the other; we draw knowledge and consolation from tragedies only because they do not happen to us. Without this distance, tragedy could not give rise to catharsis. However, it is equally important that the text causes the audience to identify with the characters and the events in the text, and unless this identification occurs, it does not touch us as an audience. Aristotle holds that it is through \"simulated representation\", mimesis, that we respond to the acting on the stage which is conveying to us what the characters feel, so that we may empathise with them in this way through the mimetic form of dramatic roleplay. It is the task of the dramatist to produce the tragic enactment in order to accomplish this empathy by means of what is taking place on stage.\n\nIn short, catharsis can only be achieved if we see something that is both recognisable and distant. Aristotle argued that literature is more interesting as a means of learning than history, because history deals with specific facts that have happened, and which are contingent, whereas literature, although sometimes based on history, deals with events that could have taken place or ought to have taken place.\n\nAristotle thought of drama as being \"an imitation of an action\" and of tragedy as \"falling from a higher to a lower estate\" and so being removed to a less ideal situation in more \"tragic\" circumstances than before. He posited the characters in tragedy as being better than the average human being, and those of comedy as being worse.\n\nMichael Davis, a translator and commentator of Aristotle writes:\nIt was also Plato and Aristotle who contrasted mimesis with diegesis (Greek διήγησις). Mimesis \"shows\", rather than \"tells\", by means of directly represented action that is enacted. Diegesis, however, is the \"telling\" of the story by a narrator; the author narrates action indirectly and describes what is in the characters' minds and emotions. The narrator may speak as a particular character or may be the \"invisible narrator\" or even the \"all-knowing narrator\" who speaks from above in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.\n\nIn Book III of his \"Republic\" (c. 373 BCE), Plato examines the style of poetry (the term includes comedy, tragedy, epic and lyric poetry): All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (diegesis) and imitation or representation (mimesis). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the dithyramb is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in epic poetry. When reporting or narrating, \"the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else\"; when imitating, the poet produces an \"assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture\". In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as himself or herself.\n\nIn his \"Poetics\", Aristotle argues that kinds of poetry (the term includes drama, flute music, and lyre music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their \"medium\", according to their \"objects\", and according to their \"mode\" or \"manner\" (section I); \"For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality, as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us\" (section III).\n\nThough they conceive of mimesis in quite different ways, its relation with diegesis is identical in Plato's and Aristotle's formulations.\n\nIn ludology, mimesis is sometimes used to refer to the self-consistency of a represented world, and the availability of in-game rationalisations for elements of the gameplay. In this context, mimesis has an associated grade: highly self-consistent worlds that provide explanations for their puzzles and game mechanics are said to display a higher degree of mimesis. This usage can be traced back to the essay \"Crimes Against Mimesis\".\n\nDionysian imitatio is the influential literary method of imitation as formulated by Greek author Dionysius of Halicarnassus in the 1st century BCE, which conceived it as technique of rhetoric: emulating, adaptating, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.\n\nDionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of \"mimesis\" formulated by Aristotle's in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with \"imitation of nature\" instead of the \"imitation of other authors\". Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' \"imitatio\" and discarded Aristotle's \"mimesis\".\n\nMimesis, or imitation, as he referred to it, was a crucial concept for Samuel Taylor Coleridge's theory of the imagination. Coleridge begins his thoughts on imitation and poetry from Plato, Aristotle, and Philip Sidney, adopting their concept of imitation of nature instead of other writers. His middling departure from the earlier thinkers lies in his arguing that art does not reveal a unity of essence through its ability to achieve sameness with nature. Coleridge claims:\nHere, Coleridge opposes imitation to copying, the latter referring to William Wordsworth's notion that poetry should duplicate nature by capturing actual speech. Coleridge instead argues that the unity of essence is revealed precisely through different materialities and media. Imitation, therefore, reveals the sameness of processes in nature.\n\nThe Belgian feminist Luce Irigaray used the term to describe a form of resistance where women imperfectly imitate stereotypes about themselves so as to show up these stereotypes and undermine them.\n\nIn \"Mimesis and Alterity\" (1993), the anthropologist Michael Taussig examines the way that people from one culture adopt another's nature and culture (the process of mimesis) at the same time as distancing themselves from it (the process of alterity). He describes how a legendary tribe, the \"white Indians\", or Cuna, have adopted in various representations figures and images reminiscent of the white people they encountered in the past (without acknowledging doing so).\n\nTaussig, however, criticises anthropology for reducing yet another culture, that of the Cuna, for having been so impressed by the exotic technologies of the whites that they raised them to the status of gods. To Taussig this reductionism is suspect, and he argues this from both sides in his \"Mimesis and Alterity\" to see values in the anthropologists' perspective while simultaneously defending the independence of a lived culture from the perspective of anthropological reductionism.\n\nIn \"Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World\" (1978), René Girard posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: \"It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world,\" but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: \"rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "70174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70174", "title": "Moral", "text": "Moral\n\nA moral (from Latin \"morālis\") is a message that is conveyed or a lesson to be learned from a story or event. The moral may be left to the hearer, reader, or viewer to determine for themselves, or may be explicitly encapsulated in a maxim. A moral is a lesson in a story or in real life.\n\nAs an example of an explicit maxim, at the end of Aesop's fable of the Tortoise and the Hare, in which the plodding and determined tortoise won a race against the much-faster yet extremely arrogant hare, the stated moral is \"slow and steady wins the race\". However, other morals can often be taken from the story itself; for instance, that arrogance or overconfidence in one's abilities may lead to failure or the loss of an event, race, or contest.\n\nThe use of stock characters is a means of conveying the moral of the story by eliminating complexity of personality and depicting the issues arising in the interplay between the characters, enables the writer to generate a clear message. With more rounded characters, such as those typically found in Shakespeare's plays, the moral may be more nuanced but no less present, and the writer may point it out in other ways (see, for example, the Prologue to \"Romeo and Juliet\").\n\nThroughout the history of recorded literature, the majority of fictional writing has served not only to entertain but also to instruct, inform or improve their audiences or readership. In classical drama, for example, the role of the chorus was to comment on the proceedings and draw out a message for the audience to take away with them; while the novels of Charles Dickens are a vehicle for morals regarding the social and economic system of Victorian Britain.\n\nMorals have typically been more obvious in children's literature, sometimes even being introduced with the phrase: \"The moral of the story is …\". Such explicit techniques have grown increasingly out of fashion in modern storytelling, and are now usually only included for ironic purposes.\n\nSome examples are: \"Better to be safe than sorry\" (precautionary principle), \"The evil deserves no aid\", \"Be friends with whom you don't like\", \"Don't judge people by the way they look\", \"Slow and steady wins the race\", \"Once started down the dark path, forever will it hold your destiny\", and \"Your overconfidence is your weakness\". Aesop's Fables are the most famous of stories with strong moral conclusions.\n\nMorals were one of the main purposes of literature during 1780–1830, especially in children's literature. Part of the reason for this was the writings of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the 18th century, which brought attention to children as an audience for literature. Following in their line of thought, Thomas Day (1748–1789) wrote \"Sandford and Merton\", elevating the outstanding morals of one young boy above the rapscallion nature of another. Maria Edgeworth (1776–1849) was another prominent author of moral tales, writing about how a wise adult can educate a child; one of her more famous stories is \"The Purple Jar\". During this time, the theme of \"a young heroine or hero gaining wisdom and maturity was taken up by many other writers\" (p. 93).\n\nThe ability of children to derive moral lessons from stories and visual media develops around the age of 9 or 10 years.\n\n"}

Its main objective is to engage visitors in learning experiences to enhance their curiosity and interest on their objects and collections. \n\nIn a seminal report called \"Excellence and Equity\" published in 1992 by the American Association of Museums (now the American Alliance of Museums), the educational role of museums was identified as the core to museums' service to the public. According to the report, \"...the public dimensions of museums leads them to perform the public service of education—a term that in its broadest sense includes exploration, study, observation, critical thinking, contemplation and dialogue\". As museum education has developed as a field of study and interest in its own right, efforts have been made to record its history and to establish a research agenda to strengthen its position as a discipline in the wider work of museums.\n\nIn his first report as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Education and Culture during John F. Kennedy's administration, in 1968, Philip H. Coombs emphasized the increment of the educative needs of the world’s population after World War II. In it, he mentions the diversity of non-formal education activities that constitute, or should constitute an important complement to formal education to the total educational efforts of any country. To Coombs, non-formal education had the potential to satisfy the learning demands of both, individuals and collectivities, because unlike formal and traditional education, which is rigid with its contents and programs, it is flexible and, when planning and designing educational activities, it takes into consideration local variations of culture, economy and society, which counteracts the tendency of developing countries to just imitate education models of developed countries.\n\nIn a work written by Coombs in conjunction with M. Ahmed, non-formal education is defined as \"...any organized educational activity outside the established formal system—whether operating separately or as an important feature of some broader activity—that is intended to serve identifiable learning clienteles and learning objective\". Afterwards, Coombs and Ahmed add the idea that non-formal education is any systematic educative activity, organized outside from the official framework to facilitate educative experiences for all people, regardless of age, genre, nationality, social, economic or health situation. Throughout his career, Coombs encouraged and impulsed the professional development of people responsible of non-formal education, which will be determining to the development and professionalization of the educative areas in institutions devoted to non-formal education.\n\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, art museums were very new institutions to the average visitor, who was seen wandering with no clear direction through the galleries, and with no clear idea on how to appreciate and study the exhibitions. In 1906, architect J. Randolph Coolidge Jr. was appointed the temporary director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. He experimented with a guiding system in the galleries, to help visitors orient themselves throughout their walk across the exhibitions.\n\nAn article published in the June bulletin of the museum that same year, features one of the first uses of the term docent and the description of its functions:\"It has been proposed to the Trustees to consider the permanent appointment of one or more persons of intelligence and education who could act as intermediaries between Curators and the many who would be glad to avail themselves of trained instruction in our galleries. Through these docents, as it has been proposed to call them, the heads of departments could instruct many more persons than it would be possible for them to accompany through the galleries; and illustrated lectures upon the collections prepared in the departments might be regularly given by these specially qualified aids both in the Museum and in the class rooms of neighboring schools and colleges.\"\n\n\"Excellence in Practice: Museum Education Principles and Standards\" was developed by the Education Committee of the American Association of Museums to help guide and inform the practice of Museum Education.\n\"The Journal of Museum Education\" (JME) is a journal covering the theory, training and practice of the museum education field from the Museum Education Roundtable. Articles are written by museum, education, and research professionals. \"The Museum Education Monitor\" was a monthly email newsletter that tracked and recorded research and resources in museum education worldwide. Publication of \"the Museum Education Monitor\" ended in 2015.\n\"Art Museum Teaching\" is a digitally published resource and collaborative online forum for reflecting on issues of teaching, learning, and experimental practice in the field of art museum education. \n\"The Journal of Museum Studies\" is an independent, not-for-profit publication dedicated to creating and preserving a digital archive of scholarly articles in the field of museum studies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2393552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2393552", "title": "New World", "text": "New World\n\nThe New World is one of the names used for the majority of Earth's Western Hemisphere, specifically the Americas (including nearby islands such as those of the Caribbean and Bermuda).\n\nThe term originated in the early 16th century after Europeans made landfall in what would later be called the Americas in the age of discovery, expanding the geographical horizon of classical geographers, who had thought of the world as consisting of Africa, Europe, and Asia, collectively now referred to as the Old World (a.k.a. Afro-Eurasia).\n\nThe phrase gained prominence after the publication of a pamphlet titled \"Mundus Novus\" attributed to Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci. \n\nThe Americas were also referred to as the \"fourth part of the world\".\n\nThe terms \"Old World\" vs. \"New World\" are meaningful in historical context and for the purpose of distinguishing the world's major ecozones, and to classify plant and animal species that originated therein.\n\nOne can speak of the \"New World\" in a historical context, e.g., when discussing the voyages of Christopher Columbus, the Spanish conquest of Yucatán and other events of the colonial period. For lack of alternatives, the term is also still useful to those discussing issues that concern the Americas and the nearby oceanic islands, such as Bermuda and Clipperton Island, collectively.\n\nThe term \"New World\" is used in a biological context, when one speaks of Old World (Palearctic, Afrotropic) and New World species (Nearctic, Neotropic). Biological taxonomists often attach the \"New World\" label to groups of species that are found exclusively in the Americas, to distinguish them from their counterparts in the \"Old World\" (Europe, Africa and Asia), e.g. New World monkeys, New World vultures, New World warblers.\n\nThe label is also often used in agriculture. Asia, Africa, and Europe share a common agricultural history stemming from the Neolithic Revolution, and the same domesticated plants and animals spread through these three continents thousands of years ago, making them largely indistinct and useful to classify together as \"Old World\". Common Old World crops (e.g., barley, lentils, oats, peas, rye, wheat), and domesticated animals (e.g., cattle, chickens, goats, horses, pigs, sheep) did not exist in the Americas until they were introduced by post-Columbian contact in the 1490s (see \"Columbian Exchange\"). Conversely, many common crops were originally domesticated in the Americas before they spread worldwide after Columbian contact, and are still often referred to as \"New World crops\"; common beans (\"phaseolus\"), maiz, and squash – the \"three sisters\" – as well as the avocado, tomato, and wide varieties of capsicum (bell pepper, chili pepper, etc.), and the turkey were originally domesticated by pre-Columbian peoples in Mesoamerica, while agriculturalists in the Andean region of South America brought forth the cassava, peanut, potato, quinoa and domesticated animals like the alpaca, guinea pig and llama. Other famous New World crops include the cashew, cocoa, rubber, sunflower, tobacco, and vanilla, and fruits like the guava, papaya and pineapple. There are rare instances of overlap, e.g., the calabash (bottle-gourd), cotton, and yam, and the dog, are believed to have been domesticated separately in both the Old and New World, their early forms possibly brought along by Paleo-Indians from Asia during the last glacial period.\n\nIn wine terminology, \"New World\" has a different definition. \"New World wines\" include not only North American and South American wines, but also those from South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and all other locations outside the traditional wine-growing regions of Europe, North Africa and the Near East.\n\nThe term \"New World\" (\"Mundus Novus\") was first coined by the Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci, in a letter written to his friend and former patron Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici in the Spring of 1503, and published (in Latin) in 1503–04 under the title \"Mundus Novus\". Vespucci's letter contains arguably the first explicit articulation in print of the hypothesis that the lands discovered by European navigators to the west were not the edges of Asia, as asserted by Christopher Columbus, but rather an entirely different continent, a \"New World\".\n\nVespucci first approached this realization in June 1502, during a famous chance meeting between two different expeditions at the watering stop of \"Bezeguiche\" (the Bay of Dakar, Senegal) – his own outgoing expedition, on its way to chart the coast of newly discovered Brazil, and the vanguard ships of the Second Portuguese India armada of Pedro Álvares Cabral, returning home from India. Having already visited the Americas in prior years, Vespucci probably found it difficult to reconcile what he had already seen in the West Indies, with what the returning sailors told him of the East Indies. Vespucci wrote a preliminary letter to Lorenzo, while anchored at Bezeguiche, which he sent back with the Portuguese fleet – at this point only expressing a certain puzzlement about his conversations. Vespucci was finally convinced when he proceeded on his mapping expedition through 1501–02, covering the huge stretch of coast of eastern Brazil. After returning from Brazil, in the Spring of 1503, Amerigo Vespucci composed the \"Mundus Novus\" letter in Lisbon to Lorenzo in Florence, with its famous opening paragraph:\n\nVespucci's letter was a publishing sensation in Europe, immediately (and repeatedly) reprinted in several other countries.\n\nWhile Amerigo Vespucci is usually credited for coming up with the term \"New World\" (\"Mundus Novus\") for the Americas in his 1503 letter, certainly giving it its popular cachet, similar terms had nonetheless been used and applied before him.\n\nThe Venetian explorer Alvise Cadamosto had used the term \"un altro mundo\" (\"another world\") to refer to sub-Saharan Africa, which he explored in 1455 and 1456 on behalf of the Portuguese. However, this was merely a literary flourish, not a suggestion of a new \"fourth\" part of the world. Cadamosto was quite aware sub-Saharan Africa was firmly part of the African continent.\n\nThe Italian-born Spanish chronicler Peter Martyr d'Anghiera often shares credit with Vespucci for designating the Americas as a new world. Peter Martyr used the term \"Orbe Novo\" (literally, \"New Globe\", but often translated as \"New World\") in the title of his history of the discovery of the Americas as a whole, which began to appear in 1511 (cosmologically, \"orbis\" as used here refers to the whole hemisphere, while \"mundus\" refers to the land within it). Peter Martyr had been writing and circulating private letters commenting on Columbus's discoveries since 1493 and, from the start, doubted Columbus's claims to have reached East Asia (\"the Indies\"), and consequently came up with alternative names to refer to them. Only a few weeks after Columbus's return from his first voyage, Peter Martyr wrote letters referring to Columbus's discovered lands as the \"western antipodes\" (\"antipodibus occiduis\", letter of May 14, 1493), the \"new hemisphere of the earth\" (\"novo terrarum hemisphaerio\", September 13, 1493), and in a letter dated November 1, 1493, refers to Columbus as the \"discoverer of the new globe\" (\"Colonus ille novi orbis repertor\"). A year later (October 20, 1494), Peter Martyr again refers to the marvels of the New Globe (\"Novo Orbe\") and the \"Western hemisphere.\"(\"ab occidente hemisphero\").\n\nChristopher Columbus touched the continent of South America in his 1498 third voyage. In his own 1499 letter to the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, reporting the results of his third voyage, Columbus relates how the massive waters of the Orinoco delta rushing into the Gulf of Paria implied that a previously unknown continent must lie behind it. However, bowing to the classical tripartite division of the world, Columbus discards that hypothesis and proposes instead that the South American landmass is not a \"fourth\" continent, but rather the terrestrial paradise of Biblical tradition, not a previously unknown \"new\" part of the world, but a land already \"known\" (but location undiscovered) by Christendom. In another letter (to the nurse of Prince John, written 1500), Columbus refers to having reached a \"new heavens and world\" (\"nuevo cielo e mundo\") and that he had placed \"another world\" (\"otro mundo\") under the dominion of the Kings of Spain.\n\nThe Vespucci passage above applied the \"New World\" label to merely the continental landmass of South America. At the time, most of the continent of North America was not yet discovered, and Vespucci's comments did not eliminate the possibility that the islands of the Antilles discovered earlier by Christopher Columbus might still be the eastern edges of Asia, as Columbus continued to insist down to his dying day. A critical step in the transition was the conference of navigators (\"Junta de Navegantes\") assembled by the Spanish monarchs at Toro in 1505, and continued at Burgos in 1508, to digest all existing information about the Indies, come to an agreement on what had really been discovered, and set out the future goals of Spanish exploration. Amerigo Vespucci attended both conferences, and seems to have had an outsized influence on them – Vespucci ended up being appointed the first \"piloto mayor\", the chief of navigation of Spain, at Burgos. Although the proceedings of the Toro-Burgos conferences are missing, it is almost certain that Vespucci articulated his recent \"New World\" thesis to his fellow navigators there. It was during these conferences when Spanish officials seem to have finally accepted that the Antilles and the known stretch of Central America were definitely \"not\" the Indies they had originally sought, and Columbus had insisted they were, and set out the new goal for Spanish explorers: to find a sea passage or strait through the Americas which would permit them to sail to Asia proper. In English usage the term \"New World\" was problematic and only accepted relatively late.\n\nWhile it became generally accepted after Vespucci that Columbus's discoveries were not Asia but a \"New World\", the geographic relationship between the two continents was still unclear. That there must be a large ocean between Asia and the Americas was implied by the known existence of vast continuous sea along the coasts of East Asia. Given the size of the Earth as calculated by Eratosthenes this left a large space between Asia and the newly discovered lands. \n\nEven prior to Vespucci, several maps, e.g. the Cantino planisphere of 1502 and the Canerio map of 1504, placed a large open ocean between China on the east side of the map, and the inchoate largely water-surrounded North American and South American discoveries on the western side of map. However, out of uncertainty, they depicted a finger of the Asian land mass stretching across the top to the eastern edge of the map, suggesting it carried over into the western hemisphere (e.g. the Cantino Planisphere denotes Greenland as \"Punta d'Asia\" – \"edge of Asia\"). Some maps, e.g. the 1506 Contarini–Rosselli map and the 1508 Johannes Ruysch map, bowing to Ptolemaic authority and Columbus's assertions, have the northern Asian landmass stretching well into the western hemisphere and merging with known North America (Labrador, Newfoundland, etc.). These maps place the island of Japan near Cuba and leave the South American continent – Vespucci's \"New World\" proper – detached and floating below by itself. The Waldseemüller map of 1507, which accompanied the famous \"Cosmographiae Introductio\" volume (which includes reprints of Vespucci's letters) comes closest to modernity by placing a completely open sea (with no stretching land fingers) between Asia on the eastern side and the New World (being represented two times in the same map in a different way: with and without a sea passage in the middle of what is now named Central America) on the western side – which (on what is now named South America) that same map famously labels simply \"America\". However, Martin Waldseemüller's map of 1516 retreats considerably from his earlier map and back to classical authority, with the Asian land mass merging into North America (which he now calls \"Terra de Cuba Asie partis\"), and quietly drops the \"America\" label from South America, calling it merely \"Terra Incognita\".\n\nThe western coast of the New World – the Pacific Ocean – was only discovered in 1513 by Vasco Núñez de Balboa. But it would take a few more years – Ferdinand Magellan's voyage of 1519–22 – to determine that the Pacific definitely formed a single large body of water separating Asia from the Americas. It would be several more years before the Pacific Coast of North America was mapped, dispelling lingering doubts. Until the discovery of the Bering Straits in the 17th century, there was no absolute confirmation that Asia and North America were not connected, and some European maps of the 16th century still continued to hopefully depict North America connected by a land bridge to Asia (e.g. the 1533 Johannes Schöner globe).\n\nIn 1524, the term was used by Giovanni da Verrazzano in a record of his voyage that year along the Atlantic coast of North America, land that is now part of the United States and Canada.\n"}

A pitch is used throughout different stages of production, such as casting and distribution, as well as to urge film producers to further fund a project. Filmmakers who devise a pitch tend to manufacture a production package, which is handed out to each potential investor during the pitch. The package contains the basic information for the filmmaker's project, such as a plot synopsis and budgeting values. Sometimes, filmmakers will produce an independent pitch trailer as a part of the package to help potential financiers better visualize the project and the filmmaker's vision.\n\nThough pitches are usually made on the basis of a full script or teleplay, animated productions for both film and television are often pitched on the basis of storyboards alone. For example, the animated television show \"Phineas and Ferb\" was pitched from a storyboard. Co-founders of the project, Dan Povenmire and Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh, needed to convince overseas executives for The Walt Disney Company to greenlight the series, so they drew a storyboard and recorded it as a reel. They then mixed it and dubbed it over with sound effects, voices, and narrative, then sent the recording to the executives, who accepted it.\n\nTelevision pitches can also be devised by the network or company that produces the program. Certain networks are pitched the idea of including a character in a series in order to boost ratings. Such pitches have been used with \"Oliver\" in \"The Brady Bunch\" and \"Luke\" on \"Growing Pains\". Networks also try to force their ideas on series' producers through their pitches, though their approach is business-oriented and their ideas are generally not favored by writers and viewers. In 1992, the crew of the animated series \"Rugrats\" was approached by Nickelodeon, which pitched the idea of a \"Rugrats\" Hanukkah special. Paul Germain, co-creator of the series, responded by suggesting a passover special, which he dubbed a \"funny idea.\" After they closed production for that special, they began considering the Hanukkah special and eventually created it in 1996 as the episode \"A Rugrats Chanukah.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1854841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1854841", "title": "Pivot language", "text": "Pivot language\n\nA pivot language, sometimes also called a bridge language, is an artificial or natural language used as an intermediary language for translation between many different languages – to translate between any pair of languages A and B, one translates A to the pivot language P, then from P to B. Using a pivot language avoids the combinatorial explosion of having translators across every combination of the supported languages, as the number of combinations of language is linear (formula_1), rather than quadratic formula_2 – one need only know the language A and the pivot language P (and someone else the language B and the pivot P), rather than needing a different translator for every possible combination of A and B.\n\nThe disadvantage of a pivot language is that each step of retranslation introduces possible mistakes and ambiguities – using a pivot language involves two steps, rather than one. For example, when Hernán Cortés communicated with Mesoamerican Indians, he would speak Spanish to Gerónimo de Aguilar, who would speak Mayan to Malintzin, who would speak Nahuatl to the locals.\n\nEnglish, French, Russian, and Arabic are often used as pivot languages. Interlingua has been used as a pivot language in international conferences and has been proposed as a pivot language for the European Union. Esperanto was proposed as a pivot language in the Distributed Language Translation project and has been used in this way in the Majstro Tradukvortaro at the Esperanto website Majstro.com. The Universal Networking Language is an artificial language specifically designed for use as a pivot language.\n\nPivot coding is also a common method of translating data for computer systems. For example, the internet protocol, XML and high level languages are pivot codings of computer data which are then often rendered into internal binary formats for particular computer systems.\n\nUnicode was designed to be usable as a pivot coding between various major existing character encodings, though its widespread adoption as a coding in its own right has made this usage unimportant.\n\nCurrent statistical machine translation (SMT) systems use parallel corpora for source (s) and target (t) languages to achieve their good results, but good parallel corpora are not available for all languages. A pivot language (p) enables the bridge between two languages, to which existing parallel corpora are entirely or partially not yet at hand.\n\nPivot translation can be problematic because of the potential lack of fidelity of the information forwarded in the use of different corpora. From the use of two bilingual corpora (s-p & p-t) to set up the s-t bridge, linguistic data are inevitably lost. Rule-based machine translation (RBMT) helps the system rescue this information, so that the system does not rely entirely on statistics but also on structural linguistic information.\n\nThree basic techniques are used to employ pivot language in MT: (1) \"triangulation\", which focuses on phrase paralleling between source and pivot (s-p) and between pivot and target (p-t); (2) \"transfer\", which translates the whole sentence of the source language to a pivot language and then to the target language; and (3) \"synthesis\", which builds a corpus of its own for system training.\n\nThe triangulation method (also called \"phrase table multiplication\") calculates the probability of both translation correspondences and lexical weight in s-p and p-t, to try to induce a new s-t phrase table. The transfer method (also called \"sentence translation strategy\") simply carries a straightforward translation of s into p and then another translation of p into t without using probabilistic tests (as in triangulation). The synthetic method uses an existing corpus of s and tries to build an own synthetic corpus out of it that is used by the system to train itself. Then a bilingual s-p corpus is synthesized to enable a p-t translation.\n\nA direct comparison between triangulation and transfer methods for SMT systems has shown that triangulation achieves much better results than transfer.\n\nAll three pivot language techniques enhance the performance of SMT systems. However, the \"synthetic\" technique doesn't work well with RBMT, and systems' performances are lower than expected. Hybrid SMT/RBMT systems achieve better translation quality than strict-SMT systems that rely on bad parallel corpora.\n\nThe key role of RBMT systems is that they help fill the gap left in the translation process of s-p → p-t, in the sense that these parallels are included in the SMT model for s-t.\n\n"}

{"id": "21621618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21621618", "title": "Post-80s", "text": "Post-80s\n\nThe Post-'80 (also the Post-1980, ) is a colloquial term which refers to the generation, especially in urban cities, whose members were born between 1980 and 1989 in Mainland China after the introduction of the one-child policy. This generation, the first to grow up entirely within the reformist era, currently ranges in age from to , making up a major portion of China's young adult demographic.\n\nIn English, this group is also sometimes called China's Generation Y after the use of the term in the book \"China’s Generation Y\" by Michael Stanat in 2005 (though he references the dates 1981–1995).\n\n\nIt is a generation of approximately 240 million people born between 1980 and 1990, although characteristics of the after-eighty generation have also been seen in those born in the 1990s. Growing up in modern China, this generation has been characterized by its optimism for the future, newfound excitement for consumerism, entrepreneurship, and acceptance of its historic role in transforming modern China into an economic superpower.\n\nThese people are also distinguished by their increased access to digital media such as computers, MP3 players and mobile phones. Post-'80ers in China often experience a palpable generation gap between them and their elders; while their parents lived during the Mao Zedong era, experienced famine and political instability and lack proper education because of the policies set forth under the Cultural Revolution, they live in an environment of tremendous economic growth and social change, high technology, and rigorous education standards. There is also a significant generation gap between them and Post-'90, who are even more thoroughly entrenched in digitality and capitalism.\n\nA clash between tradition and modern influences is noticeable in purchasing habits, career pursuits, and daily interaction between child and elders. Furthermore, young adults have been indirectly affected by forced government shutdowns of thousands of Internet bars each year that prevent the excessive use of the Internet. Young people are also affected by China's large socioeconomic divide between urban and rural residents and societal problems resulting from modernization.\n\nThe Post-'80 generation illuminates important questions not only about China's future but also those of the United States and the global economy. Several factors that may influence the generation are individualism, consumerism, modernization, and technology.\n\nWhen parents over-indulge their only child, who has no siblings as a result of the One Child Policy, the indulged children may be referred to as \"little emperors\" (\"xiaohuangdi\" 小皇帝). Many Chinese families have the 4-2-1 format: 4 grandparents, 2 parents, one child. Parents and grandparents eat less and spend less money on themselves, only so the youngster could feel physically and mentally strong, focus on one's studies and be successful later on in life.\n\nAlmost all Chinese families usually adopt a set of traditional Confucian values when raising their only child. Because Confucianism considers \"Ren\" (仁; love and social responsibility) the core emotion that develops moral conceptions into genuine personal motivation, a child who has received too much familial attention but also endured high mental and physical restrictions because the economic future of the family depends on their academic success directly leads to a situation that is often considered in academic and popular discourse as over-indulging the children, in opposition to concepts of \"Ren\" and filial piety (孝; \"xiao\"). There is substantial evidence that many young Chinese feel a heavy burden and a huge responsibility towards their parents, understanding that their performances in school or other domains can be of crucial consequences towards their family.\n\nDepending on the specific family conditions and children's mental healthy condition, this burden could lead to a diligent lifestyle by youngsters or to a more rebellious attitude to traditional Confucian codes or not being able to cope with such pressure nor develop self-discipline.\n\nWhile being nurtured by parents and relatives gives children some clear advantages and opportunities, the fact that a child doesn't have sibling who 'compete' with him or her in a younger age could also lead to some psychological difficultes as the child grows. \"Lacking adapting capabilities\" () is a description which is commonly associated with the new post-'80 generation. Since such children don't need to put any efforts in order to gain parents' attention or to win family resources, they develop no competitive abilities and have weak social skills once they are older and need to be self-sufficient.\n\nTraditionally seen as a rite of passage, marriage has been linked as milestones to adulthood. Yet, the Chinese millennials are late bloomers when it comes to marriage. Although some members of the millennials are well in their 30s, statistics show they are still living their lives as bachelors or bachelorettes. \n\nHaving grown up in times of modern consumerism and popular media, rather than the ideals of the Cultural Revolution, many single-children are inclined to spend large amounts of money on themselves and thus are a cornerstone of retail sales. Families which are well-off economically sometimes allow their children to indulge in the new materialistic sphere, while poorer families often still make efforts to keep their children inside the consumers' race, allowing them to purchase new clothes, new cell-phone brands, etc.\n\nPost-'80 in Hong Kong and the after-eighty generation in mainland China are for the most part different. The term Post-'80 () came into use in Hong Kong between 2009 and 2010, particularly during the course of the opposition to the Guangzhou-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, during which a group of young activists came to the forefront of the Hong Kong political scene. They are said to be \"post-materialist\" in outlook, and they are particularly vocal in issues such as urban development, culture and heritage, and political reform. Their campaigns include the fight for the preservation of Lee Tung Street, the Star Ferry Pier and the Queen's Pier, Choi Yuen Tsuen Village, real political reform (on June 23), and a citizen-oriented West Kowloon Cultural District. Their discourse mainly develops around themes such as anti-colonialism, sustainable development, and democracy.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Census, among the population that was never married, there was a large increase in the proportions for those in their 20s and 30s in 2011 in comparison to 1981. For young adults aged 25 to 29, the proportion who were never married increased from 26.0% of the population in 1981 to close to 73.1% in 2011. Even among individuals in their early 30s, the proportion of men who were never married increased from 15.0% in 1981 to 54.0% in 2011. For women, the increase was from 10.5% in 1981 to 43.4% in 2011. \n\n"}
{"id": "3420992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3420992", "title": "Psychological thriller", "text": "Psychological thriller\n\nPsychological thriller is a thriller narrative which emphasizes the unstable or delusional psychological states of its characters. In terms of context and convention, it is a subgenre of the broader ranging thriller narrative structure, with similarities to Gothic and detective fiction in the sense of sometimes having a \"dissolving sense of reality\". It is often told through the viewpoint of psychologically stressed characters, revealing their distorted mental perceptions and focusing on the complex and often tortured relationships between obsessive and pathological characters. Psychological thrillers often incorporate elements of mystery, drama, action, and paranoia. Not to be confused with psychological horror, which involves more terror than psychosomatic themes.\n\nPeter Hutchings states varied films have been labeled psychological thrillers, but it usually refers to \"narratives with domesticated settings in which action is suppressed and where thrills are provided instead via investigations of the psychologies of the principal characters.\" A distinguishing characteristic of a psychological thriller is it emphasizes the mental states of its characters: their perceptions, thoughts, distortions, and general struggle to grasp reality.\n\nAccording to director John Madden, psychological thrillers focus on story, character development, choice, and moral conflict; fear and anxiety drive the psychological tension in unpredictable ways. Madden stated their lack of spectacle and strong emphasis on character led to their decline in Hollywood popularity. Psychological thrillers are suspenseful by exploiting uncertainty over characters' motives, honesty, and how they see the world. Films can also cause discomfort in audiences by privileging them with information they wish to share with the characters; guilty characters may suffer similar distress by virtue of their knowledge.\n\nHowever, James N. Frey defines psychological thrillers as a style, rather than a subgenre; Frey states good thrillers focus on the psychology of their antagonists and build suspense slowly through ambiguity. Creators and/or film distributors or publishers who seek to distance themselves from the negative connotations of horror often categorize their work as a psychological thriller. The same situation can occur when critics label a work to be a psychological thriller in order to elevate its perceived literary value.\n\n\nMany psychological thrillers have emerged over the past years, all in various media (film, literature, radio, etc.). Despite these very different forms of representation, general trends have appeared throughout the narratives. Some of these consistent themes include:\n\n\nIn psychological thrillers, characters often have to battle an inner struggle. Amnesia is a common plot device used to explore these questions. Character may be threatened with death, be forced to deal with the deaths of others, or fake their own deaths. Psychological thrillers can be complex, and reviewers may recommend a second or third viewing to \"decipher its secrets.\" Common elements may include stock characters, such as a hardboiled detective and serial killer, involved in a cat and mouse game. Sensation novels, examples of early psychological thrillers, were considered to be socially irresponsible due to their themes of sex and violence. These novels, among others, were inspired by the exploits of real-life detective Jack Whicher. Water, especially floods, is frequently used to represent the unconscious mind, such as in \"What Lies Beneath\" and \"In Dreams\". Psychological thrillers may not always be concerned with plausibility. Peter Hutchings defines the giallo, an Italian subgenre of psychological thrillers, as violent murder mysteries that focus on style and spectacle over rationality. According to Peter B. Flint of \"The New York Times\", detractors of Alfred Hitchcock accused him of \"relying on slick tricks, illogical story lines and wild coincidences\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26791", "title": "Satire", "text": "Satire\n\nSatire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.\n\nA feature of satire is strong irony or sarcasm—\"in satire, irony is militant\"—but parody, burlesque, exaggeration, juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and double entendre are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. This \"militant\" irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist wishes to attack.\n\nSatire is nowadays found in many artistic forms of expression, including internet memes, literature, plays, commentary, television shows, and media such as lyrics.\n\nThe word satire comes from the Latin word \"satur\" and the subsequent phrase \"lanx satura.\" \"Satur\" meant \"full\" but the juxtaposition with \"lanx\" shifted the meaning to \"miscellany or medley\": the expression \"lanx satura\" literally means \"a full dish of various kinds of fruits\".\n\nThe word \"satura\" as used by Quintilian, however, was used to denote only Roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed hexameter form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as \"satire\". Quintilian famously said that \"satura,\" that is a satire in hexameter verses, was a literary genre of wholly Roman origin (\"satura tota nostra est\"). He was aware of and commented on Greek satire, but at the time did not label it as such, although today the origin of satire is considered to be Aristophanes' Old Comedy. The first critic to use the term \"satire\" in the modern broader sense was Apuleius.\n\nTo Quintilian, the satire was a strict literary form, but the term soon escaped from the original narrow definition. Robert Elliott writes:\nThe word \"satire\" derives from \"satura\", and its origin was not influenced by the Greek mythological figure of the \"satyr\". In the 17th century, philologist Isaac Casaubon was the first to dispute the etymology of satire from satyr, contrary to the belief up to that time.\n\nLaughter is not an essential component of satire; in fact there are types of satire that are not meant to be \"funny\" at all. Conversely, not all humour, even on such topics as politics, religion or art is necessarily \"satirical\", even when it uses the satirical tools of irony, parody, and burlesque.\n\nEven light-hearted satire has a serious \"after-taste\": the organizers of the Ig Nobel Prize describe this as \"first make people laugh, and then make them think\".\n\nSatire and irony in some cases have been regarded as the most effective source to understand a society, the oldest form of social study. They provide the keenest insights into a group's collective psyche, reveal its deepest values and tastes, and the society's structures of power. Some authors have regarded satire as superior to non-comic and non-artistic disciplines like history or anthropology. In a prominent example from ancient Greece, philosopher Plato, when asked by a friend for a book to understand Athenian society, referred him to the plays of Aristophanes.\n\nHistorically, satire has satisfied the popular need to debunk and ridicule the leading figures in politics, economy, religion and other prominent realms of power. Satire confronts public discourse and the collective imaginary, playing as a public opinion counterweight to power (be it political, economic, religious, symbolic, or otherwise), by challenging leaders and authorities. For instance, it forces administrations to clarify, amend or establish their policies. Satire's job is to expose problems and contradictions, and it's not obligated to solve them. Karl Kraus set in the history of satire a prominent example of a satirist role as confronting public discourse.\n\nFor its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions. The satiric impulse, and its ritualized expressions, carry out the function of resolving social tension. Institutions like the ritual clowns, by giving expression to the antisocial tendencies, represent a safety valve which re-establishes equilibrium and health in the collective imaginary, which are jeopardized by the repressive aspects of society.\n\nThe state of political satire in a given society reflects the tolerance or intolerance that characterizes it, and the state of civil liberties and human rights. Under totalitarian regimes any criticism of a political system, and especially satire, is suppressed. A typical example is the Soviet Union where the dissidents, such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov were under strong pressure from the government. While satire of everyday life in the USSR was allowed, the most prominent satirist being Arkady Raikin, political satire existed in the form of anecdotes that made fun of Soviet political leaders, especially Brezhnev, famous for his narrow-mindedness and love for awards and decorations.\n\nSatire is a diverse genre which is complex to classify and define, with a wide range of satiric \"modes\".\n\nSatirical literature can commonly be categorized as either Horatian, Juvenalian, or Menippean.\n\nHoratian satire, named for the Roman satirist Horace (65–8 BCE), playfully criticizes some social vice through gentle, mild, and light-hearted humour. Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) wrote Satires to gently ridicule the dominant opinions and \"philosophical beliefs of ancient Rome and Greece\" (Rankin). Rather than writing in harsh or accusing tones, he addressed issues with humor and clever mockery. Horatian satire follows this same pattern of \"gently [ridiculing] the absurdities and follies of human beings\" (Drury). \nIt directs wit, exaggeration, and self-deprecating humour toward what it identifies as folly, rather than evil. Horatian satire's sympathetic tone is common in modern society.\nA Horatian satirist's goal is to heal the situation with smiles, rather than by anger. Horatian satire is a gentle reminder to take life less seriously and evokes a wry smile. A Horatian satirist makes fun of general human folly rather than engaging in specific or personal attacks. Shamekia Thomas suggests, \"In a work using Horatian satire, readers often laugh at the characters in the story who are the subject of mockery as well as themselves and society for behaving in those ways.\" Alexander Pope has been established as an author whose satire \"heals with morals what it hurts with wit\" (Green). Alexander Pope—and Horatian satire—attempt to teach.\n\nExamples:\n\nJuvenalian satire, named for the writings of the Roman satirist Juvenal (late first century – early second century AD), is more contemptuous and abrasive than the Horatian. Juvenal disagreed with the opinions of the public figures and institutions of the Republic and actively attacked them through his literature. \"He utilized the satirical tools of exaggeration and parody to make his targets appear monstrous and incompetent\" (Podzemny). Juvenal satire follows this same pattern of abrasively ridiculing societal structures. Juvenal also, unlike Horace, attacked public officials and governmental organizations through his satires, regarding their opinions as not just wrong, but evil.\n\nFollowing in this tradition, Juvenalian satire addresses perceived social evil through scorn, outrage, and savage ridicule. This form is often pessimistic, characterized by the use of irony, sarcasm, moral indignation and personal invective, with less emphasis on humor. Strongly polarized political satire can often be classified as Juvenalian.A Juvenal satirist's goal is generally to provoke some sort of political or societal change because he sees his opponent or object as evil or harmful. A Juvenal satirist mocks \"societal structure, power, and civilization\" (Thomas) by exaggerating the words or position of his opponent in order to jeopardize their opponent's reputation and/or power. Jonathan Swift has been established as an author who \"borrowed heavily from Juvenal's techniques in [his critique] of contemporary English society\" (Podzemny).\n\nExamples:\n\nSee Menippean satire.\nIn the history of theatre there has always been a conflict between engagement and disengagement on politics and relevant issue, between satire and grotesque on one side, and jest with teasing on the other. Max Eastman defined the spectrum of satire in terms of \"degrees of biting\", as ranging from satire proper at the hot-end, and \"kidding\" at the violet-end; Eastman adopted the term kidding to denote what is just satirical in form, but is not really firing at the target. Nobel laureate satirical playwright Dario Fo pointed out the difference between satire and teasing (\"sfottò\"). Teasing is the reactionary side of the comic; it limits itself to a shallow parody of physical appearance. The side-effect of teasing is that it humanizes and draws sympathy for the powerful individual towards which it is directed. Satire instead uses the comic to go against power and its oppressions, has a subversive character, and a moral dimension which draws judgement against its targets. Fo formulated an operational criterion to tell real satire from \"sfottò\", saying that real satire arouses an outraged and violent reaction, and that the more they try to stop you, the better is the job you are doing. Fo contends that, historically, people in positions of power have welcomed and encouraged good-humoured buffoonery, while modern day people in positions of power have tried to censor, ostracize and repress satire.\n\nTeasing (\"sfottò\") is an ancient form of simple buffoonery, a form of comedy without satire's subversive edge. Teasing includes light and affectionate parody, good-humoured mockery, simple one-dimensional poking fun, and benign spoofs. Teasing typically consists of an impersonation of someone monkeying around with his exterior attributes, tics, physical blemishes, voice and mannerisms, quirks, way of dressing and walking, and/or the phrases he typically repeats. By contrast, teasing never touches on the core issue, never makes a serious criticism judging the target with irony; it never harms the target's conduct, ideology and position of power; it never undermines the perception of his morality and cultural dimension. \"Sfottò\" directed towards a powerful individual makes him appear more human and draws sympathy towards him. Hermann Göring propagated jests and jokes against himself, with the aim of humanizing his image.\n\nTypes of satire can also be classified according to the topics it deals with. From the earliest times, at least since the plays of Aristophanes, the primary topics of literary satire have been politics, religion and sex. This is partly because these are the most pressing problems that affect anybody living in a society, and partly because these topics are usually taboo. Among these, politics in the broader sense is considered the pre-eminent topic of satire. Satire which targets the clergy is a type of political satire, while religious satire is that which targets religious beliefs. Satire on sex may overlap with blue comedy, off-color humor and dick jokes.\n\nScatology has a long literary association with satire, as it is a classical mode of the grotesque, the grotesque body and the satiric grotesque. Shit plays a fundamental role in satire because it symbolizes death, the turd being \"the ultimate dead object\". The satirical comparison of individuals or institutions with human excrement, exposes their \"inherent inertness, corruption and dead-likeness\". The ritual clowns of clown societies, like among the Pueblo Indians, have ceremonies with filth-eating. In other cultures, sin-eating is an apotropaic rite in which the sin-eater (also called filth-eater), by ingesting the food provided, takes \"upon himself the sins of the departed\". Satire about death overlaps with black humor and gallows humor.\n\nAnother classification by topics is the distinction between political satire, religious satire and satire of manners. Political satire is sometimes called topical satire, satire of manners is sometimes called satire of everyday life, and religious satire is sometimes called philosophical satire. Comedy of manners, sometimes also called satire of manners, criticizes mode of life of common people; political satire aims at behavior, manners of politicians, and vices of political systems. Historically, comedy of manners, which first appeared in British theater in 1620, has uncritically accepted the social code of the upper classes. Comedy in general accepts the rules of the social game, while satire subverts them.\n\nAnother analysis of satire is the spectrum of his possible tones: wit, ridicule, irony, sarcasm, cynicism, the sardonic and invective.\n\nSatire is found not only in written literary forms. In preliterate cultures it manifests itself in ritual and folk forms, as well as in trickster tales and oral poetry.\n\nIt appears also in graphic arts, music, sculpture, dance, cartoon strips, and graffiti. Examples are Dada sculptures, Pop Art works, music of Gilbert and Sullivan and Erik Satie, punk and rock music. In modern media culture, stand-up comedy is an enclave in which satire can be introduced into mass media, challenging mainstream discourse. Comedy roasts, mock festivals, and stand-up comedians in nightclubs and concerts are the modern forms of ancient satiric rituals.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of what we might call satire, The Satire of the Trades, is in Egyptian writing from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. The text's apparent readers are students, tired of studying. It argues that their lot as scribes is not only useful, but far superior to that of the ordinary man. Scholars such as Helck think that the context was meant to be serious.\n\nThe Papyrus Anastasi I (late 2nd millennium BC) contains a satirical letter which first praises the virtues of its recipient, but then mocks the reader's meagre knowledge and achievements.\n\nThe Greeks had no word for what later would be called \"satire\", although the terms cynicism and parody were used. Modern critics call the Greek playwright Aristophanes one of the best known early satirists: his plays are known for their critical political and societal commentary, particularly for the political satire by which he criticized the powerful Cleon (as in \"The Knights\"). He is also notable for the persecution he underwent. Aristophanes' plays turned upon images of filth and disease. His bawdy style was adopted by Greek dramatist-comedian Menander. His early play \"Drunkenness\" contains an attack on the politician Callimedon.\n\nThe oldest form of satire still in use is the Menippean satire by Menippus of Gadara. His own writings are lost. Examples from his admirers and imitators mix seriousness and mockery in dialogues and present parodies before a background of diatribe. As in the case of Aristophanes plays, menippean satire turned upon images of filth and disease.\n\nThe first Roman to discuss satire critically was Quintilian, who invented the term to describe the writings of Gaius Lucilius. The two most prominent and influential ancient Roman satirists are Horace and Juvenal, who wrote during the early days of the Roman Empire. Other important satirists in ancient Latin are Gaius Lucilius and Persius. \"Satire\" in their work is much wider than in the modern sense of the word, including fantastic and highly coloured humorous writing with little or no real mocking intent. When Horace criticized Augustus, he used veiled ironic terms. In contrast, Pliny reports that the 6th-century-BC poet Hipponax wrote \"satirae\" that were so cruel that the offended hanged themselves.\n\nIn the 2nd century AD, Lucian wrote \"True History\", a book satirizing the clearly unrealistic travelogues/adventures written by Ctesias, Iambulus, and Homer. He states that he was surprised they expected people to believe their lies, and stating that he, like they, has no actual knowledge or experience, but shall now tell lies as if he did. He goes on to describe a far more obviously extreme and unrealistic tale, involving interplanetary exploration, war among alien life forms, and life inside a 200 mile long whale back in the terrestrial ocean, all intended to make obvious the fallacies of books like \"Indica\" and \"The Odyssey\".\n\nMedieval Arabic poetry included the satiric genre \"hija\". Satire was introduced into Arabic prose literature by the Afro-Arab author Al-Jahiz in the 9th century. While dealing with serious topics in what are now known as anthropology, sociology and psychology, he introduced a satirical approach, \"based on the premise that, however serious the subject under review, it could be made more interesting and thus achieve greater effect, if only one leavened the lump of solemnity by the insertion of a few amusing anecdotes or by the throwing out of some witty or paradoxical observations. He was well aware that, in treating of new themes in his prose works, he would have to employ a vocabulary of a nature more familiar in \"hija\", satirical poetry.\" For example, in one of his zoological works, he satirized the preference for longer human penis size, writing: \"If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the mule would belong to the (honorable tribe of) Quraysh\". Another satirical story based on this preference was an \"Arabian Nights\" tale called \"Ali with the Large Member\".\n\nIn the 10th century, the writer Tha'alibi recorded satirical poetry written by the Arabic poets As-Salami and Abu Dulaf, with As-Salami praising Abu Dulaf's wide breadth of knowledge and then mocking his ability in all these subjects, and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing As-Salami in return. An example of Arabic political satire included another 10th-century poet Jarir satirizing Farazdaq as \"a transgressor of the Sharia\" and later Arabic poets in turn using the term \"Farazdaq-like\" as a form of political satire.\n\nThe terms \"comedy\" and \"satire\" became synonymous after Aristotle's \"Poetics\" was translated into Arabic in the medieval Islamic world, where it was elaborated upon by Islamic philosophers and writers, such as Abu Bischr, his pupil Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from Greek dramatic representation and instead identified it with Arabic poetic themes and forms, such as \"hija\" (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the \"art of reprehension\", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troubled beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the Latin translations of the 12th century, the term \"comedy\" thus gained a new semantic meaning in Medieval literature.\n\nUbayd Zakani introduced satire in Persian literature during the 14th century. His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses, often political or bawdy, and often cited in debates involving homosexual practices. He wrote the \"Resaleh-ye Delgosha\", as well as \"Akhlaq al-Ashraf\" (\"Ethics of the Aristocracy\") and the famous humorous fable \"Masnavi Mush-O-Gorbeh\" (Mouse and Cat), which was a political satire. His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written, in league with the other great works of Persian literature. Between 1905 and 1911, Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi and other Iranian writers wrote notable satires.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, examples of satire were the songs by Goliards or vagants now best known as an anthology called Carmina Burana and made famous as texts of a composition by the 20th-century composer Carl Orff. Satirical poetry is believed to have been popular, although little has survived. With the advent of the High Middle Ages and the birth of modern vernacular literature in the 12th century, it began to be used again, most notably by Chaucer. The disrespectful manner was considered \"unchristian\" and ignored, except for the moral satire, which mocked misbehaviour in Christian terms. Examples are \"Livre des Manières\" by (~1178), and some of Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\". Sometimes epic poetry (epos) was mocked, and even feudal society, but there was hardly a general interest in the genre.\n\nDirect social commentary via satire returned with a vengeance in the 16th century, when farcical texts such as the works of François Rabelais tackled more serious issues (and incurred the wrath of the crown as a result).\n\nTwo major satirists of Europe in the Renaissance were Giovanni Boccaccio and François Rabelais. Other examples of Renaissance satire include \"Till Eulenspiegel\", \"Reynard the Fox\", Sebastian Brant's \"Narrenschiff\" (1494), Erasmus's \"Moriae Encomium\" (1509), Thomas More's \"Utopia\" (1516), and \"Carajicomedia\" (1519).\n\nThe Elizabethan (i.e. 16th-century English) writers thought of satire as related to the notoriously rude, coarse and sharp satyr play. Elizabethan \"satire\" (typically in pamphlet form) therefore contains more straightforward abuse than subtle irony. The French Huguenot Isaac Casaubon pointed out in 1605 that satire in the Roman fashion was something altogether more civilised. Casaubon discovered and published Quintilian's writing and presented the original meaning of the term (satira, not satyr), and the sense of wittiness (reflecting the \"dishfull of fruits\") became more important again. Seventeenth-century English satire once again aimed at the \"amendment of vices\" (Dryden).\n\nIn the 1590s a new wave of verse satire broke with the publication of Hall's \"Virgidemiarum\", six books of verse satires targeting everything from literary fads to corrupt noblemen. Although Donne had already circulated satires in manuscript, Hall's was the first real attempt in English at verse satire on the Juvenalian model. The success of his work combined with a national mood of disillusion in the last years of Elizabeth's reign triggered an avalanche of satire—much of it less conscious of classical models than Hall's — until the fashion was brought to an abrupt stop by censorship.\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment, an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th centuries advocating rationality, produced a great revival of satire in Britain. This was fuelled by the rise of partisan politics, with the formalisation of the Tory and Whig parties—and also, in 1714, by the formation of the Scriblerus Club, which included Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, John Gay, John Arbuthnot, Robert Harley, Thomas Parnell, and Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke. This club included several of the notable satirists of early-18th-century Britain. They focused their attention on Martinus Scriblerus, \"an invented learned fool... whose work they attributed all that was tedious, narrow-minded, and pedantic in contemporary scholarship\". In their hands astute and biting satire of institutions and individuals became a popular weapon. The turn to the 18th century was characterized by a switch from Horatian, soft, pseudo-satire, to biting \"juvenal\" satire.\n\nJonathan Swift was one of the greatest of Anglo-Irish satirists, and one of the first to practise modern journalistic satire. For instance, In his \"A Modest Proposal\" Swift suggests that Irish peasants be encouraged to sell their own children as food for the rich, as a solution to the \"problem\" of poverty. His purpose is of course to attack indifference to the plight of the desperately poor. In his book \"Gulliver's Travels\" he writes about the flaws in human society in general and English society in particular. John Dryden wrote an influential essay entitled \"A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire\" that helped fix the definition of satire in the literary world. His satirical \"Mac Flecknoe\" was written in response to a rivalry with Thomas Shadwell and eventually inspired Alexander Pope to write his satirical \"The Rape of the Lock\". Other satirical works by Pope include the \"Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot\".\n\nAlexander Pope (b. May 21, 1688) was a satirist known for his Horatian satirist style and translation of the \"Iliad\". Famous throughout and after the long 18th century, Pope died in 1744. Pope, in his \"The Rape of the Lock\", is delicately chiding society in a sly but polished voice by holding up a mirror to the follies and vanities of the upper class. Pope does not actively attack the self-important pomp of the British aristocracy, but rather presents it in such a way that gives the reader a new perspective from which to easily view the actions in the story as foolish and ridiculous. A mockery of the upper class, more delicate and lyrical than brutal, Pope nonetheless is able to effectively illuminate the moral degradation of society to the public. \"The Rape of the Lock\" assimilates the masterful qualities of a heroic epic, such as the \"Iliad\", which Pope was translating at the time of writing \"The Rape of the Lock\". However, Pope applied these qualities satirically to a seemingly petty egotistical elitist quarrel to prove his point wryly.\n\nDaniel Defoe pursued a more journalistic type of satire, being famous for his \"The True-Born Englishman\" which mocks xenophobic patriotism, and \"The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters\"—advocating religious toleration by means of an ironical exaggeration of the highly intolerant attitudes of his time.\n\nThe pictorial satire of William Hogarth is a precursor to the development of political cartoons in 18th-century England. The medium developed under the direction of its greatest exponent, James Gillray from London. With his satirical works calling the king (George III), prime ministers and generals (especially Napoleon) to account, Gillray's wit and keen sense of the ridiculous made him the pre-eminent cartoonist of the era.\n\nEbenezer Cooke (1665–1732), author of \"The Sot-Weed Factor\" (1708), was among the first American colonialists to write literary satire. Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) and others followed, using satire to shape an emerging nation's culture through its sense of the ridiculous.\n\nSeveral satiric papers competed for the public's attention in the Victorian era (1837–1901) and Edwardian period, such as \"Punch\" (1841) and \"Fun\" (1861).\n\nPerhaps the most enduring examples of Victorian satire, however, are to be found in the Savoy Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan. In fact, in \"The Yeomen of the Guard\", a jester is given lines that paint a very neat picture of the method and purpose of the satirist, and might almost be taken as a statement of Gilbert's own intent:\n\nNovelists such as Charles Dickens (1812-1870) often used passages of satiric writing in their treatment of social issues.\n\nContinuing the tradition of Swiftian journalistic satire, Sidney Godolphin Osborne (1808-1889) was the most prominent writer of scathing \"Letters to the Editor\" of the London Times. Famous in his day, he is now all but forgotten. His maternal grandfather William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland was considered to be a possible candidate for the authorship of the Junius letters. If this were true, we can read Osborne as following in his grandfather's satiric \"Letters to the Editor\" path. Osborne's satire was so bitter and biting that at one point he received a public censure from Parliament's then Home Secretary Sir James Graham. Osborne wrote mostly in the Juvenalian mode over a wide range of topics mostly centered on British government's and landlords' mistreatment of poor farm workers and field laborers. He bitterly opposed the New Poor Laws and was passionate on the subject of Great Britain's botched response to the Irish Famine and its mistreatment of soldiers during the Crimean War.\n\nLater in the nineteenth century, in the United States, Mark Twain (1835–1910) grew to become American's greatest satirist: his novel \"Huckleberry Finn\" (1884) is set in the antebellum South, where the moral values Twain wishes to promote are completely turned on their heads. His hero, Huck, is a rather simple but goodhearted lad who is ashamed of the \"sinful temptation\" that leads him to help a runaway slave. In fact his conscience, warped by the distorted moral world he has grown up in, often bothers him most when he is at his best. He is prepared to do good, believing it to be wrong.\n\nTwain's younger contemporary Ambrose Bierce (1842–1913) gained notoriety as a cynic, pessimist and black humorist with his dark, bitterly ironic stories, many set during the American Civil War, which satirized the limitations of human perception and reason. Bierce's most famous work of satire is probably \"The Devil's Dictionary\" (1906), in which the definitions mock cant, hypocrisy and received wisdom.\n\nKarl Kraus is considered the first major European satirist since Jonathan Swift. In 20th-century literature, satire was used by English authors such as Aldous Huxley (1930s) and George Orwell (1940s), which under the inspiration of Zamyatin's Russian 1921 novel \"We\", made serious and even frightening commentaries on the dangers of the sweeping social changes taking place throughout Europe. Many social critics of this same time in the United States, such as Dorothy Parker and H. L. Mencken, used satire as their main weapon, and Mencken in particular is noted for having said that \"one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand syllogisms\" in the persuasion of the public to accept a criticism. Novelist Sinclair Lewis was known for his satirical stories such as \"Main Street\" (1920), \"Babbitt\" (1922), \"Elmer Gantry\" (1927; dedicated by Lewis to H. L. Menchen), and \"It Can't Happen Here\" (1935), and his books often explored and satirized contemporary American values. The film \"The Great Dictator\" (1940) by Charlie Chaplin is itself a parody of Adolf Hitler; Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the concentration camps.\nIn the United States 1950s, satire was introduced into American stand-up comedy most prominently by Lenny Bruce and Mort Sahl. As they challenged the taboos and conventional wisdom of the time, were ostracized by the mass media establishment as \"sick comedians\". In the same period, Paul Krassner's magazine \"The Realist\" began publication, to become immensely popular during the 1960s and early 1970s among people in the counterculture; it had articles and cartoons that were savage, biting satires of politicians such as Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, the Vietnam War, the Cold War and the War on Drugs. This baton was also carried by the original National Lampoon magazine, edited by Doug Kenney and Henry Beard and featuring blistering satire written by Michael O'Donoghue, P.J. O'Rourke, and Tony Hendra, among others. Prominent satiric stand-up comedian George Carlin acknowledged the influence \"The Realist\" had in his 1970s conversion to a satiric comedian.\n\nA more humorous brand of satire enjoyed a renaissance in the UK in the early 1960s with the satire boom, led by such luminaries as Peter Cook, Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, and Dudley Moore, whose stage show \"Beyond the Fringe\" was a hit not only in Britain, but also in the United States. Other significant influences in 1960s British satire include David Frost, Eleanor Bron and the television program \"That Was The Week That Was\".\n\nJoseph Heller's most famous work, \"Catch-22\" (1961), satirizes bureaucracy and the military, and is frequently cited as one of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century. Departing from traditional Hollywood farce and screwball, director and comedian Jerry Lewis used satire in his self-directed films \"The Bellboy\" (1960), \"The Errand Boy\" (1961) and \"The Patsy\" (1964) to comment on celebrity and the star-making machinery of Hollywood.\nThe film \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964) starring Peter Sellers was a popular satire on the Cold War.\n\nContemporary popular usage of the term \"satire\" is often very imprecise. While satire often uses caricature and parody, by no means all uses of these or other humorous devices are satiric. Refer to the careful definition of satire that heads this article.\nSatire is used on many UK television programmes, particularly popular panel shows and quiz shows such as \"Mock the Week\" (2005) and \"Have I Got News for You\" (1990–ongoing). It is found on radio quiz shows such as \"The News Quiz\" (1977–ongoing) and \"The Now Show\" (1998–ongoing). One of the most watched UK television shows of the 1980s and early 1990s, the puppet show \"Spitting Image\" was a satire of the royal family, politics, entertainment, sport and British culture of the era. Court Flunkey from \"Spitting Image\" is a caricature of James Gillray, intended as a homage to the father of political cartooning. Created by DMA Design in 1997, satire features prominently in the British video game series \"Grand Theft Auto\".\n\nThe television program \"South Park\" (1997–ongoing) relies almost exclusively on satire to address issues in American culture, with episodes addressing anti-Semitism, militant atheism, homophobia, environmentalism, corporate culture, political correctness and anti-Catholicism, among many other issues.\n\nAustralian Chris Lilley produces comedy art in the style of mockumentaries (\"\", \"Summer Heights High\", \"Angry Boys\") and his work is often described as complex social satire.\nStephen Colbert's television program, \"The Colbert Report\" (2005–14), is instructive in the methods of contemporary American satire. Colbert's character is an opinionated and self-righteous commentator who, in his TV interviews, interrupts people, points and wags his finger at them, and \"unwittingly\" uses a number of logical fallacies. In doing so, he demonstrates the principle of modern American political satire: the ridicule of the actions of politicians and other public figures by taking all their statements and purported beliefs to their furthest (supposedly) logical conclusion, thus revealing their perceived hypocrisy or absurdity.\n\nThe American sketch comedy television show \"Saturday Night Live\" is also known for its satirical impressions and parodies of prominent persons and politicians, among some of the most notable, their parodies of U.S. political figures Hillary Clinton and of Sarah Palin.\n\nOther political satire includes various political causes in the past, including the relatively successful Polish Beer-Lovers' Party and the joke political candidates Molly the Dog and Brian Miner.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a popular modern satirist is Sir Terry Pratchett, author of the internationally best-selling \"Discworld\" book series. One of the most well-known and controversial British satirists is Chris Morris, co-writer and director of \"Four Lions\".\n\nIn Canada, satire has become an important part of the comedy scene. Stephen Leacock was one of the best known early Canadian satirists, and in the early 20th century, he achieved fame by targeting the attitudes of small town life. In more recent years, Canada has had several prominent satirical television series and radio shows. Some, including \"CODCO\", \"The Royal Canadian Air Farce\", \"This Is That\", and \"This Hour Has 22 Minutes\" deal directly with current news stories and political figures, while others, like \"History Bites\" present contemporary social satire in the context of events and figures in history. The Canadian organization \"Canada News Network\" provides commentary on contemporary news events that are primarily Canadian in nature. Canadian songwriter Nancy White uses music as the vehicle for her satire, and her comic folk songs are regularly played on CBC Radio.\n\nCartoonists often use satire as well as straight humour. Al Capp's satirical comic strip \"Li'l Abner\" was censored in September 1947. The controversy, as reported in \"Time\", centred on Capp's portrayal of the US Senate. Said Edward Leech of Scripps-Howard, \"We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables.\" Walt Kelly's \"Pogo\" was likewise censored in 1952 over his overt satire of Senator Joe McCarthy, caricatured in his comic strip as \"Simple J. Malarky\". Garry Trudeau, whose comic strip \"Doonesbury\" focuses on satire of the political system, and provides a trademark cynical view on national events. Trudeau exemplifies humour mixed with criticism. For example, the character Mark Slackmeyer lamented that because he was not legally married to his partner, he was deprived of the \"exquisite agony\" of experiencing a nasty and painful divorce like heterosexuals. This, of course, satirized the claim that gay unions would denigrate the sanctity of heterosexual marriage.\nLike some literary predecessors, many recent television satires contain strong elements of parody and caricature; for instance, the popular animated series \"The Simpsons\" and \"South Park\" both parody modern family and social life by taking their assumptions to the extreme; both have led to the creation of similar series. As well as the purely humorous effect of this sort of thing, they often strongly criticise various phenomena in politics, economic life, religion and many other aspects of society, and thus qualify as satirical. Due to their animated nature, these shows can easily use images of public figures and generally have greater freedom to do so than conventional shows using live actors.\n\nNews satire is also a very popular form of contemporary satire, appearing in as wide an array of formats as the news media itself: print (e.g. \"The Onion\", \"Canada News Network\", \"Private Eye\"), \"Not Your Homepage,\" radio (e.g. \"On the Hour\"), television (e.g. \"The Day Today\", \"The Daily Show\", \"Brass Eye\") and the web (e.g. Mindry.in, The Fruit Dish, Scunt News, Faking News, El Koshary Today, The Giant Napkin, Unconfirmed Sources and The \"Onion\"s website). Other satires are on the list of satirists and satires. Another internet-driven form of satire is to lampoon bad internet performers. An example of this is the Internet meme character Miranda Sings.\n\nIn an interview with \"Wikinews\", Sean Mills, President of \"The Onion\", said angry letters about their news parody always carried the same message. \"It's whatever affects that person\", said Mills. \"So it's like, 'I love it when you make a joke about murder or rape, but if you talk about cancer, well my brother has cancer and that's not funny to me.' Or someone else can say, 'Cancer's \"hilarious\", but don't talk about rape because my cousin got raped.' Those are rather extreme examples, but if it affects somebody personally, they tend to be more sensitive about it.\"\n\nZhou Libo, a comedian from Shanghai, is the most popular satirist in China. His humour has interested middle-class people and has sold out shows ever since his rise to fame.\n\nLiterary satire is usually written out of earlier satiric works, reprising previous conventions, commonplaces, stance, situations and tones of voice. Exaggeration is one of the most common satirical techniques. Contrarily diminution is also a satirical technique.\n\nFor its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions. In Germany and Italy satire is protected by the constitution.\n\nSince satire belongs to the realm of art and artistic expression, it benefits from broader lawfulness limits than mere freedom of information of journalistic kind. In some countries a specific \"right to satire\" is recognized and its limits go beyond the \"right to report\" of journalism and even the \"right to criticize\". Satire benefits not only of the protection to freedom of speech, but also to that to culture, and that to scientific and artistic production.\n\nIn September 2017 The Juice Media received an e-mail from the Australian National Symbols Officer requesting that the use of a satirical logo, called the \"Coat of Harms\" based on the Australian Coat of Arms, no longer be used as they had received complaints from the members of the public. Coincidentally 5 days later a Bill was proposed to Australian parliament to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995. If successfully passed those found to be in breach of the new amendment can face 2–5 years imprisonment\n\nAs of June 2018, the Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017 was before the Australian Senate with the third reading moved 10 May 2018.\n\nDescriptions of satire's biting effect on its target include 'venomous', 'cutting', 'stinging', vitriol. Because satire often combines anger and humor, as well as the fact that it addresses and calls into question many controversial issues, it can be profoundly disturbing.\n\nBecause it is essentially ironic or sarcastic, satire is often misunderstood. A typical misunderstanding is to confuse the satirist with his persona.\n\nCommon uncomprehending responses to satire include revulsion (accusations of poor taste, or that \"it's just not funny\" for instance) and the idea that the satirist actually does support the ideas, policies, or people he is attacking. For instance, at the time of its publication, many people misunderstood Swift's purpose in \"A Modest Proposal\", assuming it to be a serious recommendation of economically motivated cannibalism.\n\nSome critics of Mark Twain see \"Huckleberry Finn\" as racist and offensive, missing the point that its author clearly intended it to be satire (racism being in fact only one of a number of Mark Twain's known concerns attacked in \"Huckleberry Finn\"). This same misconception was suffered by the main character of the 1960s British television comedy satire \"Till Death Us Do Part\". The character of Alf Garnett (played by Warren Mitchell) was created to poke fun at the kind of narrow-minded, racist, little Englander that Garnett represented. Instead, his character became a sort of anti-hero to people who actually agreed with his views. (The same situation occurred with Archie Bunker in American TV show \"All in the Family\", a character derived directly from Garnett.)\n\nThe Australian satirical television comedy show \"The Chaser's War on Everything\" has suffered repeated attacks based on various perceived interpretations of the \"target\" of its attacks. The \"Make a Realistic Wish Foundation\" sketch (June 2009), which attacked in classical satiric fashion the heartlessness of people who are reluctant to donate to charities, was widely interpreted as an attack on the Make a Wish Foundation, or even the terminally ill children helped by that organisation. Prime Minister of the time Kevin Rudd stated that The Chaser team \"should hang their heads in shame\". He went on to say that \"I didn't see that but it's been described to me. ...But having a go at kids with a terminal illness is really beyond the pale, absolutely beyond the pale.\" Television station management suspended the show for two weeks and reduced the third season to eight episodes.\n\nThe romantic prejudice against satire is the belief spread by the romantic movement that satire is something unworthy of serious attention; this prejudice has held considerable influence to this day. Such prejudice extends to humour and everything that arouses laughter, which are often underestimated as frivolous and unworthy of serious study. For instance, humor is generally neglected as a topic of anthropological research and teaching.\n\nBecause satire criticises in an ironic, essentially indirect way, it frequently escapes censorship in a way more direct criticism might not. Periodically, however, it runs into serious opposition, and people in power who perceive themselves as attacked attempt to censor it or prosecute its practitioners. In a classic example, Aristophanes was persecuted by the demagogue Cleon.\n\nIn 1599, the Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift and the Bishop of London Richard Bancroft, whose offices had the function of licensing books for publication in England, issued a decree banning verse satire. The decree, now known as the Bishops' Ban of 1599, ordered the burning of certain volumes of satire by John Marston, Thomas Middleton, Joseph Hall, and others; it also required histories and plays to be specially approved by a member of the Queen's Privy Council, and it prohibited the future printing of satire in verse.\n\nThe motives for the ban are obscure, particularly since some of the books banned had been licensed by the same authorities less than a year earlier. Various scholars have argued that the target was obscenity, libel, or sedition. It seems likely that lingering anxiety about the Martin Marprelate controversy, in which the bishops themselves had employed satirists, played a role; both Thomas Nashe and Gabriel Harvey, two of the key figures in that controversy, suffered a complete ban on all their works. In the event, though, the ban was little enforced, even by the licensing authority itself.\n\nIn 2005, the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy caused global protests by offended Muslims and violent attacks with many fatalities in the Near East. It was not the first case of Muslim protests against criticism in the form of satire, but the Western world was surprised by the hostility of the reaction: Any country's flag in which a newspaper chose to publish the parodies was being burnt in a Near East country, then embassies were attacked, killing 139 people in mainly four countries; politicians throughout Europe agreed that satire was an aspect of the freedom of speech, and therefore to be a protected means of dialogue. Iran threatened to start an International Holocaust Cartoon Competition, which was immediately responded to by Jews with an Israeli Anti-Semitic Cartoons Contest.\n\nIn 2006 British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen released \"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\", a \"mockumentary\" that satirized everyone, from high society to frat boys. The film was criticized by many. Although Baron Cohen is Jewish, some complained that it was antisemitic, and the government of Kazakhstan boycotted the film. The film itself had been a reaction to a longer quarrel between the government and the comedian.\n\nIn 2008, popular South African cartoonist and satirist Jonathan Shapiro (who is published under the pen name Zapiro) came under fire for depicting then-president of the ANC Jacob Zuma in the act of undressing in preparation for the implied rape of 'Lady Justice' which is held down by Zuma loyalists. The cartoon was drawn in response to Zuma's efforts to duck corruption charges, and the controversy was heightened by the fact that Zuma was himself acquitted of rape in May 2006. In February 2009, the South African Broadcasting Corporation, viewed by some opposition parties as the mouthpiece of the governing ANC, shelved a satirical TV show created by Shapiro, and in May 2009 the broadcaster pulled a documentary about political satire (featuring Shapiro among others) for the second time, hours before scheduled broadcast. Apartheid South Africa also had a long history of censorship.\n\nOn December 29, 2009, Samsung sued Mike Breen, and the \"Korea Times\" for $1 million, claiming criminal defamation over a satirical column published on Christmas Day, 2009.\n\nOn April 29, 2015, the UK Independence Party (UKIP) requested Kent Police investigate the BBC, claiming that comments made about Party leader Nigel Farage by a panelist on the comedy show \"Have I Got News For You\" might hinder his chances of success in the general election (which would take place a week later), and claimed the BBC breached the Representation of the People Act. Kent Police rebuffed the request to open an investigation, and the BBC released a statement, \"Britain has a proud tradition of satire, and everyone knows that the contributors on \"Have I Got News for You\" regularly make jokes at the expense of politicians of all parties.\"\n\nSatire is occasionally prophetic: the jokes precede actual events. Among the eminent examples are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There is often a formal distinction between the balloon that indicates thoughts and the one that indicates words spoken aloud: the balloon that conveys thoughts is often referred to as a thought bubble.\n\nOne of the earliest antecedents to the modern speech bubble were the \"speech scrolls\", wispy lines that connected first person speech to the mouths of the speakers in Mesoamerican art between 600 and 900 AD.\n\nIn Western graphic art, labels that reveal what a pictured figure is saying have appeared since at least the 13th century. These were in common European use by the early 16th century. Word balloons (also known as \"banderoles\") began appearing in 18th-century printed broadsides, and political cartoons from the American Revolution (including some published by Benjamin Franklin) often used them. They later fell out of fashion, but by 1904 had regained their popularity, although they were still considered novel enough to require explanation. With the development of the comics industry in the 20th century, the appearance of speech balloons has become increasingly standardized, though the formal conventions that have evolved in different cultures (USA as opposed to Japan, for example), can be quite distinct.\n\nRichard F. Outcault's Yellow Kid is generally credited as the first American comic strip character. His words initially appeared on his yellow shirt, but word balloons very much like those in use today were added almost immediately, as early as 1896. By the start of the 20th century, word balloons were ubiquitous, and since that time only a very few American comic strips and comic books have relied on captions, notably Hal Foster's \"Prince Valiant\" and the early \"Tarzan\" comic strip in the 1930s. In Europe, where text comics were more common, speech balloons slowly caught on with well known examples like Alain Saint-Ogan's \"Zig et Puce\" (1925), Hergé's \"The Adventures of Tintin\" (1929) and Rob-Vel's \"Spirou\" (1938).\n\nThe most common is the speech bubble. It comes in two forms for two circumstances: an in-panel character and an off-panel character. An in-panel character (one who is fully or mostly visible in the panel of the strip of comic that the reader is viewing) uses a bubble with a pointer, called a tail, directed towards the speaker.\n\nWhen one character has multiple balloons within a panel, often only the balloon nearest to the speaker's head has a tail, and the others are connected to it in sequence by narrow bands. This style is often used in Mad Magazine, due to its \"call-and-response\" dialogue-based humor.\n\nAn off-panel character (the comic book equivalent of being \"off screen\") has several options, some of them rather unconventional. The first is a standard speech bubble with a tail pointing toward the speaker's position. The second option, which originated in manga, has the tail pointing \"into\" the bubble, instead of out. (This tail is still pointing towards the speaker.) The third option replaces the tail with a sort of bottleneck that connects with the side of the panel. It can be seen in the works of Marjane Satrapi (author of \"Persepolis\").\n\nIn American comics, a bubble without a tail means that the speaker is not merely outside the reader's field of view but invisible to the viewpoint character, often as an unspecified member of a crowd.\n\nCharacters distant (in space or time) from the scene of the panel can still speak, in squared bubbles without a tail; this usage, equivalent to voice-over in film, is not uncommon in American comics for dramatic contrast. In contrast to captions, the corners of such balloons never coincide with those of the panel; for further distinction they often have a double outline, a different background color, or quotation marks.\n\nThought bubbles come in two forms: the chain thought bubble and the \"fuzzy\" bubble.\n\nThe chain thought bubble is the almost universal symbol for thinking in cartoons. It consists of a large, cloud-like bubble containing the text of the thought, with a chain of increasingly smaller circular bubbles leading to the character. Some artists use an elliptical bubble instead of a cloud-shaped one.\n\nOften animal characters like Snoopy and Garfield \"talk\" using thought bubbles. Thought bubbles may also be used in circumstances when a character is gagged or otherwise unable to speak.\n\nAnother, less conventional thought bubble has emerged: the \"fuzzy\" thought bubble. Used in manga (by such artists as Ken Akamatsu), the fuzzy bubble is roughly circular in shape (generally), but the edge of the bubble is not a line but a collection of spikes close to each other, creating the impression of fuzziness. Fuzzy thought bubbles do not use tails, and are placed near the character who is thinking. This has the advantage of reflecting the TV equivalent effect: something said with an echo.\n\nWriters and artists can refuse to use thought bubbles, expressing the action through spoken dialogue and drawing; they are sometimes seen as an inefficient method of expressing thought because they are attached directly to the head of the thinker, unlike methods such as caption boxes, which can be used both as an expression of thought and narration while existing in an entirely different panel from the character thinking. However, they are restricted to the current viewpoint character. An example is Alan Moore and David Lloyd's \"V for Vendetta\", wherein during one chapter, a monologue expressed in captions serves not only to express the thoughts of a character but also the mood, status and actions of three others.\n\nThe shape of a speech balloon can be used to convey further information. Common ones include the following:\n\nCaptions are generally used for narration purposes, such as showing location and time, or conveying editorial commentary. They are generally rectangular and positioned near the edge of the panel. Often they are also colored to indicate the difference between themselves and the word balloons used by the characters, which are almost always white. Increasingly in modern comics, captions are frequently used to convey an internal monologue or typical speech.\n\nSome characters and strips use highly unconventional methods of communication. Perhaps the most notable is the Yellow Kid, an early American comic strip. His (but not the other characters') words would appear on his large, smock-like shirt. A short-run American animated TV series of the early 1980s used this same concept, but with changing phrases on the \"T-shirts\" worn by the animal-based characters, depending on the characters' thoughts. \n\nAlso noteworthy are the many variations on the form created by Dave Sim for his comic \"Cerebus the Aardvark\". Depending on the shape, size, and position of the bubble, as well as the texture and shape of the letters within it, Sim could convey large amounts of information about the speaker. This included separate bubbles for different states of mind (drunkenness, etc.), for echoes, and a special class of bubbles for one single floating apparition.\n\nAn early pioneer in experimenting with many different types of speech balloons and lettering for different types of speech was Walt Kelly, in his \"Pogo\" strip. Deacon Mushrat speaks in blackletter, P.T. Bridgeport speaks in circus posters, Sarcophagus MacAbre speaks in condolence cards, \"Mr. Pig\" (a take on Nikita Khrushchev) speaks in faux Cyrillic, etc.\n\nIn the famous French comic series \"Asterix\", Goscinny and Uderzo use bubbles without tails to indicate a distant or unseen speaker. They have also experimented with using different types of lettering for characters of different nationalities to indicate they speak a different language that Asterix may not understand; Goths speak in blackletter, Greeks in angular lettering (though always understood by the Gaulish main characters, so it is more of an accent than a language), Norse with \"Nørdic åccents\", Egyptians in faux hieroglyphs (depictive illustrations and rebuses), etc. Another experiment with speech bubbles was exclusive to one book, \"Asterix and the Roman Agent\". The agent in question is a vile manipulator who creates discord in a group of people with a single innocent-sounding comment. His victims start quarreling and ultimately fighting each other while speaking in green-colored speech bubbles.\n\nFont variation is a common tactic in comics. \"The Sandman\" series, written by Neil Gaiman and lettered by Todd Klein, features many characters whose speech bubbles are written with a font that is exclusive to them. For examples, the main character, the gloomy Dream, speaks in wavy-edged bubbles, completely black, with similarly wavy white lettering. His sister, the scatterbrained and whimsical Delirium speaks in bubbles in a many-colored explosive background with uneven lettering, and the irreverent raven Matthew speaks in a shaky angular kind of bubble with scratchy lettering. Other characters, such as John Dee, have special shapes of bubbles for their own.\n\nIn \"Mad\"'s recurring \"Monroe\" comic strip, certain words are written larger or in unusual fonts for emphasis.\n\nIn manga, there is a tendency to include the speech necessary for the storyline in balloons, while small scribbles outside the balloons add side comments, often used for irony or to show that they're said in a much smaller voice. Satsuki Yotsuba in the manga series Negima is notable because she speaks almost \"entirely\" in side scribble.\n\nSpeech bubbles are used not only to include a character's words, but also emotions, voice inflections and unspecified language.\n\nOne of the universal emblems of the art of comics is the use of a single punctuation mark to depict a character's emotions, much more efficiently than any possible sentence. A speech bubble with a single big question mark (?) (often drawn by hand, not counted as part of the lettering) denotes confusion or ignorance. An exclamation mark (!) indicates surprise or terror. This device is broadly used in the European comic tradition, the Belgian artist Hergé's \"The Adventures of Tintin\" series being a good example. Sometimes, the punctuation marks stand alone above the character's head, with no bubble needed.\n\nIn manga, the ellipsis (i.e. three dots) is also used to express silence in a much more significant way than the mere absence of bubbles. This is specially seen when a character is supposed to say something, to indicate a stunned silence or when a sarcastic comment is expected by the reader. The ellipsis, along with the big drop of sweat on the character's temple—usually depicting shame, confusion, or embarrassment caused by other people's actions—is one of the Japanese graphic symbols that have taken root in comics all around the world, although they are still rare in Western tradition. Japanese even has a sound effect for \"deafening silence\", .\n\nIn many comic books, words that would be foreign to the narration but are displayed in translation for the reader are surrounded by angle brackets or chevrons .\n\nGilbert Hernandez's series about Palomar is written in English, but supposed to take place mainly in a Hispanic country. Thus, what's supposed to be representations of Spanish speech is written without brackets, but occasional actual English speech is written within brackets, to indicate that it is unintelligible to the main Hispanophone characters in the series.\n\nSome comics will have the actual foreign language in the speech balloon, with the translation as a footnote; this is done with Latin aphorisms in \"Asterix\".\n\nAnother convention is to put the foreign speech in a distinctive lettering style; for example, \"Asterix\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Goths speak in blackletter.\n\nSince the Japanese language uses two writing directionalities (vertical, which is the traditional direction; and horizontal, as most other languages), manga has a convention of representing translated foreign speech as horizontal text.\n\nIt is a convention in American comics that the sound of a snore is represented as a series of Z's, dating back at least to Rudolph Dirks' early 20th-century strip \"The Katzenjammer Kids\". This practice has even been reduced to a single letter Z, so that a speech bubble with this letter standing all alone (again, drawn by hand rather than a font type) means the character is sleeping in most humorous comics. This can be seen, for instance, in Charles Schulz's \"Peanuts\" comic strips.\n\nOriginally, the resemblance between the 'z' sound and that of a snore seemed exclusive to the English language, but the spread of American comics has made it a frequent feature in other countries. An exception to this is in Japanese manga, where the usual symbol for sleep is a large bubble coming out of the character's nose.\n\nSinging characters usually have musical notes drawn into their word balloons. Archie Comics' Melody Valentine, a character in their \"Josie and the Pussycats\" comic, has musical notes drawn into her word balloons at all times, to convey that she speaks in a sing-song voice.\n\nThe above-mentioned Albert Uderzo in the \"Asterix\" series decorates speech bubbles with beautiful flowers depicting an extremely soft, sweet voice (usually preceding a violent outburst by the same character).\n\nA stormy cloud with a rough lightning sticking out of it, either in a bubble or just floating above the character's head as a modified 'cloudy' thought bubble, depicts anger, not always verbally expressed.\n\nLight bulbs are sometimes used when the character comes up with an idea or solution to a problem.\n\nIn the Western world, it is common to replace profanity with a string of nonsense symbols (&%$@*$#), sometimes called grawlixes. In comics that are usually addressed to children or teenagers, bad language is censored by replacing it with more or less elaborate drawings and expressionistic symbols. For example, instead of calling someone a swine, a pig is drawn in the speech bubble.\n\nOne example is the Spanish \"Mortadelo\" series, created by Francisco Ibáñez. Although not specifically addressed to children, \"Mortadelo\" was born during Francisco Franco's dictatorship, when censorship was the order of the day and the slightest attempt of rough language was prohibited. When Ibáñez's characters are angry, donkey heads, lightning, lavatories, billy goats and even faux Japanese characters are often seen in their bubbles.\n\nWhen \"Mortadelo\" was portrayed on film by Spanish director Javier Fesser in 2003, one of the critiques made to his otherwise successful adaptation was the character's use of words that never appeared in the comics. Fesser claimed: \"When you see a bubble speech containing a lightning falling on a pig, what do you imagine the character's saying?\"\n\nIn order for comic strip and graphic novel dialogue to make sense, it has to be read in order. Thus, conventions have evolved in the order in which the communication bubbles are read. The individual bubbles are read in the order of the language. For example, in English, the bubbles are read from left to right in a panel, while in Japanese, it is the other way around. Sometimes the bubbles are \"stacked\", with two characters having multiple bubbles, one above the other. Such stacks are read from the top down. Poor use of speech balloons can unintentionally make the proper reading order ambiguous, confusing the reader.\n\nTraditionally, a cartoonist or occupational letterer would draw in all the individual letters in the balloons and sound effects by hand. A modern alternative, used by most comics today and universal in English-translated manga, is to letter with computer programs. The fonts used usually emulate the style of hand-lettering.\n\nTraditionally, most mainstream comic books are lettered entirely in upper-case, with a few exceptions:\n\nWhen hand-lettering, upper-case lettering saves time and effort because it requires drawing only three guidelines, while mixed-case lettering requires five.\n\nIn a few comics, uppercase and lowercase are used as in ordinary writing. Since the mid-1980s, mixed case lettering has gradually become more widely used in mainstream books. Some comics, such as \"Pearls Before Swine\", also use lowercase speech to mark a distinctive accent (in this case, the male crocodiles’ accented speech, opposed to all other characters who use standard uppercase speech).\n\nFrom 2002–2004, Marvel Comics experimented with mixed-case lettering in all its books. Most mainstream titles have since returned to traditional all upper-case lettering.\n\nIn many comics, although the lettering is entirely in capital letters, serif versions of \"I\" are used exclusively where a capital I would appear in normal print text, and a sanserif (i.e., a simple vertical line) is used in all other places. This reduces confusion with the number one, and also serves to indicate when the personal pronoun \"I\" is meant. This lettering convention can be seen in computer fonts such as Blambot's \"DigitalStrip.ttf\" and \"AnimeAce.ttf\" fonts, which make no other distinction between lower- and uppercase letters.\n\nIn several occasions, comics artists have used balloons (or similar narrative devices) as if they have true substance, usually for humorous meta-like purposes. In \"Peanuts\", for example, the notes played by Schroeder occasionally take substance and are used in various ways, including Christmas decorations or perches for birds. Sometimes balloons can be influenced by the strip's environment: in the Italian strip \"Sturmtruppen\" they freeze and crack when the temperature is very low, or an Archie comic strip where two men from Alaska remarked on how cold it was, by saying the speech balloons froze as they said them, and the words had to be thawed out to be heard.\n\nIn the Flemish \"Suske en Wiske\" series, on one occasion a thought bubble full of mathematical formulas is cut open with scissors and its contents emptied in a bag, to be saved for later (in a manner not unlike the pensieve in the Harry Potter series). In the same series, speech balloons are occasionally even held and blown up to function as actual balloons or the words of the speech bubble are occasionally shown coming out the side of the speech bubble, to signify that the speaker is moving so fast that their words can't keep up with them, i.e. at supersonic speed.\n\nIn the novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\", the last words of a murdered Toon (cartoon character) are found under his body in the form of a speech balloon.\n\nMany digital artists generate speech balloons with general-purpose illustration software. Products like Comic Book Creator for Microsoft Windows, Comic Life for Mac OS X and Windows target the non-professional end of the market.\n\n\n"}

variety used by a population for public purposes, or a variety that has undergone standardization.\nTypically, varieties that become standardized are the local dialects spoken in the centers of commerce and government, where a need arises for a variety that will serve more than local needs.\nStandardization typically involves a fixed orthography, codification in authoritative grammars and dictionaries and public acceptance of these standards.\nA standard written language is sometimes termed by the German word \"Schriftsprache\".\n\nA pluricentric language has multiple interacting standard varieties.\nExamples include English, French, Portuguese, German, Korean, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Swedish, Armenian and Chinese.\nMonocentric languages, such as Russian and Japanese, have only one standardized version.\n\nA standard variety is developed from a group of related varieties.\nThis may be done by elevating a single variety, such as the local variety of a center of government or culture.\nAlternatively, a new variety may be defined as a selection of features from existing varieties.\nA fixed orthography is typically created for writing the variety.\nIt may be codified in normative dictionaries and grammars, or by an agreed collection of exemplary texts.\nWhether these dictionaries and grammars are created by private individuals (like \"Webster's Dictionary\") or by state institutions, they become standard if they are treated as authorities for correcting language.\nA fixed written form and subsequent codification make the standard variety more stable than purely spoken varieties, and provide a base for further development or \"ausbau\".\nThis variety becomes the norm for writing, is used in broadcasting and for official purposes, and is the form taught to non-native learners.\n\nThrough this process, the standard variety acquires prestige and a greater functional importance than local varieties.\nThose varieties are said to be dependent on, or heteronomous with respect to, the standard variety, because speakers read and write the standard, refer to it as an authority is such matters as specialist vocabulary, and any standardizing changes in their speech are towards that standard.\nIn some cases, such as Standard English, this process may take place over an extended period without government intervention.\nIn others it may be deliberately directed by official institutions, such as the Académie française or Real Academia Española, and can proceed much more quickly.\n\nLanguage standardization is often linked to the formation, or attempted formation, of nation states, as language is seen as the vehicle of a shared culture.\nDifferent national standards derived from a dialect continuum may be regarded as different languages, even if they are mutually intelligible.\nThe Scandinavian languages, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, are often cited as examples.\n\nIn other cases governments or neighbouring populations may seek to deny a standard independent status.\nIn response, developers of a standard may base it on more divergent varieties.\nThus after Norway became independent at the start of the 20th century, the Bokmål standard based on the speech of Oslo was felt to be too similar to Danish by Ivar Aasen, who developed a rival Nynorsk standard based on western varieties.\nSimilarly, when a standard was developed in the Yugoslav republic of Macedonia from local varieties within a continuum with Serbia to the north and Bulgaria to the east, it was deliberately based on varieties from the west of the republic that were most different from standard Bulgarian.\nNow known as Macedonian, it is the national standard of the independent Republic of Macedonia, but viewed by Bulgarians as a dialect of Bulgarian.\n\nChinese consists of hundreds of local varieties, many of which are not mutually intelligible, usually classified into seven to ten major groups, including Mandarin, Wu, Yue, Hakka and Min.\nBefore the 20th century, most Chinese spoke only their local variety.\nFor two millennia, formal writing had been done in Literary Chinese (or Classical Chinese), a style modelled on the classics and far removed from any contemporary speech.\nAs a practical measure, officials of the late imperial dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as \"Guānhuà\" (literally \"speech of officials\").\n\nIn the early 20th century, many Chinese intellectuals argued that the country needed a standardized language.\nBy the 1920s, Literary Chinese had been replaced as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on Mandarin dialects.\nIn the 1930s, Standard Chinese was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect, but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties and its syntax based on the written vernacular.\nIt is the official spoken language of the People's Republic of China (where it is called \"Pǔtōnghuà\" \"common speech\") and of the Republic of China governing Taiwan (as \"Guóyǔ\" \"national language\"), and one of the official languages of Singapore (as \"Huáyǔ\" \"Chinese language\").\nStandard Chinese now dominates public life, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese.\n\nDutch is a monocentric language, with all speakers using the same standard form (authorized by the Dutch Language Union) based on a Dutch orthography employing the Latin alphabet when writing. A process of standardisation of Dutch started in the Middle Ages, especially under the influence of the Burgundian Ducal Court in Dijon (Brussels after 1477). Till then every region spoke a different Middle Dutch dialect. The dialects of the County of Flanders and the Duchy of Brabant were the most influential around this time. The process of standardisation became much stronger at the start of the 16th century, mainly based on the urban dialect of Antwerp. In 1585 Antwerp fell to the Spanish army: many from the Southern Netherlands fled to the Northern Netherlands (that declared itself independent from Spain), especially to the province of Holland, where they influenced the urban dialects. In 1637, a further important step was made towards a unified language, when the Statenvertaling, the first major Bible translation into Dutch, was created that people from all over the new republic could understand. It used elements from various dialects but was predominantly based on the urban dialects of Holland of post 16th century.\n\nIn British English the standard, known as Standard English (SE), is historically based on the language of the medieval English court of Chancery. The late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the establishment of this standard as the norm of \"polite\" society, that is to say of the upper classes. The spoken standard has come to be seen as a mark of good education and social prestige. Although often associated with the RP accent, SE can be spoken with any accent, such as General American, General Australian, etc.\n\nThe standard form of Modern Greek is based on the Southern dialects; these dialects are spoken mainly in the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, Attica, Crete and the Cyclades.\n\nTwo standardised registers of the Hindustani language have legal status India: Standard Hindi (one of 23 co-official national languages) and Urdu (Pakistan’s official tongue), resultantly, Hindustani often called “Hindi-Urdu\".\n\n\"An Caighdeán Oifigiúil\" (\"The Official Standard\"), often shortened to \"An Caighdeán\", is official standard of the Irish language. It is taught in most schools in Ireland, though with strong influences from local dialects. It was first published by the translators in Dáil Éireann in the 1950s. As of September 2013, the first major revision of the Caighdeán Oifigiúil is available, both online and in print. Among the changes to be found in the revised version are, for example, various attempts to bring the recommendations of the Caighdeán closer to the spoken dialect of Gaeltacht speakers, including allowing further use of the nominative case where the genitive would historically have been found.\n\nStandard Italian is derived from the Tuscan dialect, specifically from its Florentine variety — the Florentine influence upon early Italian literature established that dialect as base for the standard language of Italy. In particular, Italian became the language of culture for all the people of Italy, thanks to the prestige of the masterpieces of Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarca, Giovanni Boccaccio, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Francesco Guicciardini. It would later become the official language of all the Italian states, and after the Italian unification it became the national language of the Kingdom of Italy. Modern Standard Italian's lexicon has been deeply influenced by almost all regional languages of Italy while its received pronunciation (known as \"Pronuncia Fiorentina Emendata\", Amended Florentine Pronunciation) is based on the accent of Romanesco (Roman dialect); these are the reasons why Standard Italian differs significantly from the Tuscan dialect.\n\nClassical Latin was the literary standard dialect of Latin spoken by higher socioeconomic classes, as opposed to the Vulgar Latin which is the generic term of the colloquial sociolects of Latin spoken across the Roman Empire by uneducated and less-educated classes. The Latin brought by Roman soldiers to Gaul, Iberia, or Dacia was not identical to the Latin of Cicero, and differed from it in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar.\n\nIn Brazil, actors and journalists usually adopt an unofficial, but de facto, spoken standard Portuguese, originally derived from the middle-class dialect of Rio de Janeiro, but that now encompasses educated urban pronunciations from the different speech communities in the southeast. In that standard, represents the phoneme when it appears at the end of a syllable (whereas in Rio de Janeiro this represents ) the rhotic consonant spelled is pronounced in the same situation (whereas in São Paulo this is usually an alveolar flap or trill). European and African dialects have differing realizations of than Brazilian dialects, with the former using and and the latter using , , or .\n\nFour standard variants of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian are spoken in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia. They all have the same dialect basis (Štokavian). These variants do differ slightly, as is the case with other pluricentric languages, but not to a degree that would justify considering them as different languages. The differences between the variants do not hinder mutual intelligibility and do not undermine the integrity of the system as a whole. Compared to the differences between the variants of English, German, French, Spanish, or Portuguese, the distinctions between the variants of Serbo-Croatian are less significant. Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro in their constitution have all named the language differently.\n\nIn Somalia, Northern Somali (or North-Central Somali) forms the basis for Standard Somali, particularly the Mudug dialect of the northern Darod clan. Northern Central Somali has frequently been used by famous Somali poets as well as the political elite, and thus has the most prestige among other Somali dialects.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1045467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1045467", "title": "Traveler's diarrhea", "text": "Traveler's diarrhea\n\nTraveler's diarrhea (TD) is a stomach and intestinal infection. TD is defined as the passage of unformed stool (one or more by some definitions, three or more by others) while traveling. It may be accompanied by abdominal cramps, nausea, fever, and bloating. Occasionally bloody diarrhea may occur. Most travelers recover within four days with little or no treatment. About 10% of people may have symptoms for a week.\nBacteria are responsible for more than half of cases. The bacteria enterotoxigenic \"Escherichia coli\" (ETEC) are typically the most common except in Southeast Asia, where \"Campylobacter\" is more prominent. About 10% to 20% of cases are due to norovirus. Protozoa such as \"Giardia\" may cause longer term disease. The risk is greatest in the first two weeks of travel and among young adults. People affected are more often from the developed world.\nRecommendations for prevention include eating only properly cleaned and cooked food, drinking bottled water, and frequent hand washing. The oral cholera vaccine, while effective for cholera, is of questionable use for traveler's diarrhea. Preventive antibiotics are generally discouraged. Primary treatment includes drinking lots of fluids and replacing lost salts (oral rehydration therapy). Antibiotics are recommended for significant or persistent symptoms, and can be taken with loperamide to decrease diarrhea. Hospitalization is required in less than 3% of cases.\nEstimates of the percentage of people affected range from 20 to 50% among travelers to the developing world. TD is particularly common among people travelling to Asia (except Japan), the Middle East, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America. The risk is moderate in Southern Europe, Russia, and China. TD has been linked to later irritable bowel syndrome and Guillain–Barré syndrome. It has colloquially been known by a number of names, including \"Montezuma's revenge\" and \"Delhi belly\".\n\nThe onset of TD usually occurs within the first week of travel, but may occur at any time while traveling, and even after returning home, depending on the incubation period of the infectious agent. Bacterial TD typically begins abruptly, but \"Cryptosporidium\" may incubate for seven days, and \"Giardia\" for 14 days or more, before symptoms develop. Typically, a traveler experiences four to five loose or watery bowel movements each day. Other commonly associated symptoms are abdominal cramping, bloating, fever, and malaise. Appetite may decrease significantly. Though unpleasant, most cases of TD are mild, and resolve in a few days without medical intervention.\n\nBlood or mucus in the diarrhea, significant abdominal pain, or high fever suggests a more serious cause, such as cholera, characterized by a rapid onset of weakness and torrents of watery diarrhea with flecks of mucus (described as \"rice water\" stools). Medical care should be sought in such cases; dehydration is a serious consequence of cholera, and may trigger serious sequelae—including, in rare instances, death—as rapidly as 24 hours after onset if not addressed promptly.\n\nInfectious agents are the primary cause of travelers' diarrhea. Bacterial enteropathogens cause about 80% of cases. Viruses and protozoans account for most of the rest.\n\nThe most common causative agent isolated in countries surveyed has been enterotoxigenic \"Escherichia coli\" (ETEC). Enteroaggregative \"E. coli\" is increasingly recognized. \"Shigella\" spp. and \"Salmonella\" spp. are other common bacterial pathogens. \"Campylobacter\", \"Yersinia\", \"Aeromonas\", and \"Plesiomonas\" spp. are less frequently found. Mechanisms of action vary: some bacteria release toxins which bind to the intestinal wall and cause diarrhea; others damage the intestines themselves by their direct presence.\n\nWhile viruses are associated with less than 20% of adult cases of traveler's diarrhea, they may be responsible for nearly 70% of cases in infants and children. Diarrhea due to viral agents is unaffected by antibiotic therapy, but is usually self-limited. Protozoans such as \"Giardia lamblia\", \"Cryptosporidium\" and \"Cyclospora cayetanensis\" can also cause diarrhea. Pathogens commonly implicated in travelers' diarrhea appear in the table in this section.\n\nA subtype of traveler's diarrhea afflicting hikers and campers, sometimes known as wilderness diarrhea, may have a somewhat different frequency of distribution of pathogens.\n\nThe primary source of infection is ingestion of fecally contaminated food or water. Attack rates are similar for men and women.\n\nThe most important determinant of risk is the traveler's destination. High-risk destinations include developing countries in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Among backpackers, additional risk factors include drinking untreated surface water and failure to maintain personal hygiene practices and clean cookware. Campsites often have very primitive (if any) sanitation facilities, making them potentially as dangerous as any developing country.\n\nAlthough traveler's diarrhea usually resolves within three to five days (mean duration: 3.6 days), in about 20% of cases, the illness is severe enough to require bedrest, and in 10%, the illness duration exceeds one week. For those prone to serious infections, such as bacillary dysentery, amoebic dysentery, and cholera, TD can occasionally be life-threatening. Others at higher-than-average risk include young adults, immunosuppressed persons, persons with inflammatory bowel disease or diabetes, and those taking H2 blockers or antacids.\n\nTravelers often get diarrhea from eating and drinking foods and beverages that have no adverse effects on local residents. This is due to immunity that develops with constant, repeated exposure to pathogenic organisms. The extent and duration of exposure necessary to acquire immunity has not been determined; it may vary with each individual organism. A study among expatriates in Nepal suggests that immunity may take up to seven years to develop—presumably in adults who avoid deliberate pathogen exposure.\nConversely, immunity acquired by American students while living in Mexico disappeared, in one study, as quickly as eight weeks after cessation of exposure.\n\nRecommendations include avoidance of questionable foods and drinks, on the assumption that TD is fundamentally a sanitation failure, leading to bacterial contamination of drinking water and food. While the effectiveness of this strategy has been questioned, given that travelers have little or no control over sanitation in hotels and restaurants, and little evidence supports the contention that food vigilance reduces the risk of contracting TD, guidelines continue to recommend basic, common-sense precautions when making food and beverage choices:\n\n\nIf handled properly, thoroughly cooked fresh and packaged foods are usually safe. Raw or undercooked meat and seafood should be avoided. Unpasteurized milk, dairy products, mayonnaise, and pastry icing are associated with increased risk for TD, as are foods and beverages purchased from street vendors and other establishments where unhygienic conditions may be present.\n\nAlthough safe bottled water is now widely available in most remote destinations, travelers can treat their own water if necessary, or as an extra precaution. \nTechniques include boiling, filtering, chemical treatment, and ultraviolet light; boiling is by far the most effective of these methods. Boiling rapidly kills all active bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Prolonged boiling is usually unnecessary; most microorganisms are killed within seconds at water temperature above 55–70 °C (130–160 °F). The second-most effective method is to combine filtration and chemical disinfection. Filters eliminate most bacteria and protozoa, but not viruses. Chemical treatment with halogens—chlorine bleach, tincture of iodine, or commercial tablets—have low-to-moderate effectiveness against protozoa such as \"Giardia\", but work well against bacteria and viruses. \nUV light is effective against both viruses and cellular organisms, but only works in clear water, and it is ineffective unless manufacturer's instructions are carefully followed for maximum water depth/distance from UV source, and for dose/exposure time. Other claimed advantages include short treatment time, elimination of the need for boiling, no taste alteration, and decreased long-term cost compared with bottled water. The effectiveness of UV devices is reduced when water is muddy or turbid; as UV is a type of light, any suspended particles create shadows that hide microorganisms from UV exposure.\n\nBismuth subsalicylate four times daily reduces rates of traveler's diarrhea. Though many travelers find a four-times-per-day regimen inconvenient, lower doses have not been shown to be effective. Potential side effects include black tongue, black stools, nausea, constipation, and ringing in the ears. Bismuth subsalicylate should not be taken by those with aspirin allergy, kidney disease, or gout, nor concurrently with certain antibiotics such as the quinolones, and should not be taken continuously for more than three weeks. Some countries do not recommend it due to the risk of rare but serious side effects.\n\nA hyperimmune bovine colostrum to be taken by mouth is marketed in Australia for prevention of ETEC-induced TD. As yet, no studies show efficacy under actual travel conditions.\n\nThough effective, antibiotics are not recommended for prevention of TD in most situations because of the risk of allergy or adverse reactions to the antibiotics, and because intake of preventive antibiotics may decrease effectiveness of such drugs should a serious infection develop subsequently. Antibiotics can also cause vaginal yeast infections, or overgrowth of the bacterium \"Clostridium difficile\", leading to pseudomembranous colitis and its associated severe, unrelenting diarrhea.\n\nAntibiotic may be warranted in special situations where benefits outweigh the above risks, such as immunocompromised travelers, chronic intestinal disorders, prior history of repeated disabling bouts of TD, or scenarios in which the onset of diarrhea might prove particularly troublesome. Options for prophylactic treatment include the quinolone antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin), azithromycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, though the latter has proved less effective in recent years. Rifaximin may also be useful. Quinolone antibiotics may bind to metallic cations such as bismuth, and should not be taken concurrently with bismuth subsalicylate. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should not be taken by anyone with a history of sulfa allergy.\n\nThe oral cholera vaccine, while effective for prevention of cholera, is of questionable use for prevention of TD. A 2008 review found tentative evidence of benefit. A 2015 review stated it may be reasonable for those at high risk of complications from TD. Several vaccine candidates targeting ETEC or \"Shigella\" are in various stages of development.\n\nOne 2007 review found that probiotics may be safe and effective for prevention of TD, while another review found no benefit. A 2009 review confirmed that more study is needed, as the evidence to date is mixed.\n\nMost cases of TD are mild and resolve in a few days without treatment, but severe or protracted cases may result in significant fluid loss and dangerous electrolytic imbalance. Dehydration due to diarrhea can also alter the effectiveness of medicinal and contraceptive drugs. Adequate fluid intake (oral rehydration therapy) is therefore a high priority. Commercial rehydration drinks are widely available; alternatively, purified water or other clear liquids are recommended, along with salty crackers or oral rehydration salts (available in stores and pharmacies in most countries) to replenish lost electrolytes. Carbonated water or soda, left open to allow dissipation of the carbonation, is useful when nothing else is available. In severe or protracted cases, the oversight of a medical professional is advised.\n\nIf diarrhea becomes severe (typically defined as three or more loose stools in an eight-hour period), especially if associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, or blood in stools, medical treatment should be sought. Such patients may benefit from antimicrobial therapy. A 2000 literature review found that antibiotic treatment shortens the duration and severity of TD; most reported side effects were minor, or resolved on stopping the antibiotic.\n\nThe antibiotic recommended vary based on the recommendation being traveled too. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are no longer recommended because of high levels of resistance to these agents. Antibiotics are typically given for three to five days, but single doses of azithromycin or levofloxacin have been used. Rifaximin and rifamycin are approved in the U.S. for treatment of TD caused by ETEC. If diarrhea persists despite therapy, travelers should be evaluated for bacterial strains resistant to the prescribed antibiotic, possible viral or parasitic infections, bacterial or amoebic dysentery, \"Giardia\", helminths, or cholera.\n\nAntimotility drugs such as loperamide and diphenoxylate reduce the symptoms of diarrhea by slowing transit time in the gut. They may be taken to slow the frequency of stools, but not enough to stop bowel movements completely, which delays expulsion of the causative organisms from the intestines. They should be avoided in patients with fever, bloody diarrhea, and possible inflammatory diarrhea. Adverse reactions may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hives or rash, and loss of appetite. Antimotility agents should not, as a rule, be taken by children under age two.\n\nAn estimated 10 million people—20 to 50% of international travelers—develop TD each year. It is more common in the developing world, where rates exceed 60%, but has been reported in some form in virtually every travel destination in the world.\n\n\"Montezuma's revenge\" (var. \"Moctezuma's revenge\") is a colloquial term for traveler's diarrhea contracted in Mexico. The name refers to Moctezuma II (1466–1520), the Tlatoani (ruler) of the Aztec civilization who was overthrown by the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés in the early 16th century, thereby bringing large portions of what is now Mexico and Central America under the rule of the Spanish crown.\n\nWilderness diarrhea, also called wilderness-acquired diarrhea (WAD) or backcountry diarrhea, refers to diarrhea among backpackers, hikers, campers and other outdoor recreationalists in wilderness or backcountry situations, either at home or abroad. It is caused by the same fecal microorganisms as other forms of traveler's diarrhea, usually bacterial or viral. Since wilderness campsites seldom provide access to sanitation facilities, the infection risk is similar to that of any developing country. Water treatment, good hygiene, and dish washing have all been shown to reduce the incidence of WAD.\n"}

{"id": "37208440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37208440", "title": "Verbal language in dreams", "text": "Verbal language in dreams\n\nVerbal language in dreams is the speech—most commonly in the form of a dialogue between the dreamer him/herself and other dream characters—which forms part of the overall (mostly imagistic) dream scenario. Historically, there have been abundant references to verbal language in dreams going back millennia. Early in the twentieth century German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin presented a large corpus of dream speech, almost all from his own dreams and virtually all deviant, without any pretense that this was representative of dream speech in general. The first systematic elicitation of verbal language in dreams from a large subject pool under methodological protocols was presented beginning in the early 1980s, along with detailed analyses as well as theoretical consideration of the implications for various dream models, from the psychoanalytic approach to more recent theories.\n\nTraditionally, dreams have been defined predominantly in imagistic terms. Prominent dream theories of the modern era from Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic model (1900) to the present have similarly placed emphasis of the visual aspects of dreams. Yet, even the earliest of written sources, such as the Hebrew Bible and The Odyssey make clear that dreams need not be \"silent movies\"; they may be \"talkies\" incorporating a \"sound track\" abounding in verbal dialogues or monologues.\n\nA survey by Heynick of several books containing over 300 dreams, both genuine reports and dreams incorporated into works of fiction, showed that some three-quarters contained verbal dialogue or explicit reference to speech in the dream. As a specimen of a dream with dialogue as part of a famous work of fiction, Heynick cites the dream of Charles Swann, the main character in Proust's \"Swann's Way\" (1913; italics added):\n\nThe painter remarked to Swann [the dreamer] \"that Napoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately after Odette. \"They had obviously arranged it between them,\"\" he added; \"they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff, but they wouldn't say good-bye together, it might have looked odd. She is his mistress.\" The strange young man burst into tears. Swann endeavored to console him. \"After all, she is quite right,\" he said to the young man, drying his eyes for him and taking off his fez to make him feel more at ease. \"I've advised her to do that myself a dozen times. Why be so distressed? He was obviously the man to understand her.\"\n\nIn 1906 Kraepelin, a pioneer of the somatic approach to psychiatry and of the methodical classification of psychiatric disorders, published a 105-page monograph \"Über Sprachstörungen im Traume\" (On Speech Disorders in Dreams). As the title suggests, Kraepelin's declared aim was to analyze only deviant specimens of speech from dreams. Specimens reflecting correct speech processes were excluded from his study. To this end, Kraepelin assembled in the course of twenty years 286 specimens, the vast majority drawn from his own dreams, with no pretense to nonselectivity. He apparently drew in large measure from hypnagogic and occasionally hypnopompic dreamlets (experienced when falling asleep and waking up), which differ phenomologically from full-fledged dreams and are characterized by different neurological indices as well.\n\nKraepelin meticulously classified his collection of dreams according to the nature of the deviances from correct normal speech in wakefulness. Three-fifths of his specimens were grouped as disorders of word selection, including large numbers of neologisms (non-existing words, typically formed by combinations of existing words or their components); just over one-fifth as disorders of discourse (actaphasia, usually involving the incorrect choice of language dependency relations; and agrammatism, the faulty construction of complex sentences); and just under one fifth as disorders of thought. Although it was well known at the time that the speech of normal people in wakefulness is often fraught with errors, Kraepelin prized his corpus of deviant dream speech for the profound nature of many of the errors they contained, different from the common slips of the tongue made by mentally healthy people in everyday life. He likened various specimens of his dream speech corpus to the speech in waking life of patients with dementia praecox (schizophrenia), speech confusion, and aphasia. Kraeplin saw his dream experiences as affording him (a normal person) first-hand insight into these pathological processes. He further speculated on neurological concomitants involving the activities and interaction of areas of the brain—the cerebral cortex, Wernicke's coil, Broca's coil—which are different from in normal wakefulness. Although several of Kraepelin's dream speech specimens are amenable to interpretation for their latent sexual significance, he had no interest in the psychoanalytic approach and made no reference to his contemporary Freud in any of his writings.\n\nPrior to the 1980s, therefore, no indices or standards existed that were representative of the verbal language component of the dreams of a large general population. But beginning in 1983, Heynick reported in a series of publications the results of two experiments designed to evaluate, first, the linguistic competence and, subsequently, the pragmatic competence of the dreamer in the dreaming state, using large subject pools drawn from the general population (in this case in the Netherlands) and following careful protocols designed to avoid selectivity and maximize accuracy of recall.\n\nThe term \"linguistic performance,\" central to this experiment, derives from the transformational-generative (TG) revolution in linguistics in the second half of the twentieth century and the concomitant emergence of the field of formal psycholinguistics. The TG model of language generation assumes an ideal \"linguistic competence\" on the part of the speaker, theoretically enabling him or her to generate all the infinite number of well-formed sentences in the native language while generating none of the ill-formed sentences. That in actual use, i.e., linguistic performance, the speaker is limited in, among other things, the complexity or elaboration of the sentences he or she can generate, and often produces utterances which are ill-formed, is due to the limitations of the various auxiliary psychological mechanisms at the speaker's disposal, such as limited short-term memory, perceptual limitations, and defective feedback, as well as to factors such as deliberate changes in structure in mid-sentence, and unconscious interference of the Freudian type.\n\nAll the above has traditionally applied to the native speaker in the waking state. The experiment explored the linguistic performance of the native speaker in the dreaming state.\n\n78 Dutch subjects sleeping at home recorded on special forms following precise protocol instructions a total of 566 Dutch utterances directly recalled and transcribed from 566 dreams which had been in progress prior to alarm clock awakening in the morning. (For just over 80 percent of all awakenings, there was either no dream in progress at the time of awakening or no verbal material to be reported from the dream.) The subjects reported (as part of the questionnaire form) that 60 percent of the utterances were said by him or herself in the dream scenario; 40 percent by someone else, usually addressed to the dreamer.\nWord-count analysis showed the utterances in the corpus to have a wide range of length, with a mean utterance length of 7.5 words and a mean sentence length of 6.5 words. The declarative sentences in the corpus were analyzed for complexity (sentential elaboration) using in particular the number of subordinate clauses per unit as an index. The corpus when classed into three groups according to the education level of the subject-dreamers showed that those with most education had the highest sentential elaboration; those with the least, the lowest; with those with intermediate education scoring in between. (There were no standards available for absolute comparison with the sentential elaboration in spoken Dutch in waking life by the three education-level groups in the general population; however, the relative degree of sentential elaboration of the dream corpus of the three education-level groups accorded with the relative indices for written Dutch by the three educational-level groups, which were available for comparison.)\n\n72 of the 566 utterances were marked by their respective subjects (in response to one of the questions on the form) as deviating from wakeful usage, although analysis of the same specimens by two academic linguists deemed the large majority of those marked utterances to be fully acceptable Dutch. Fewer than 5 percent of all utterances clearly deviated from correct wakeful speech. These included semantic anomalies, faulty lexical substitutions, neologisms (word-blends), non-existent proper names, language mixing, and (in two instances) syntactic errors.\n\nThe subjects in the above experiment were not asked to report the full dream scenario during which the utterances were made. Excluded, therefore, from the analysis was any consideration of \"pragmatic competence,\" the \"knowledge of condition and manner or appropriate use [of his or her linguistic ability] in conformity with various purposes,\" which forms part of the broader field of language psychology (rather than formal psycholinguistics).\nDream utterances \"plus\" their dream scenario contexts were gathered in a second experiment, again following carefully defined protocols, this time using the telephone elicitation technique. (Volunteer subjects were awakened on random nights at random hours, on average no more than once a week.) 77 dream reports from 33 subjects were tape-recorded and transcribed. These contained 92 dream speech utterances elicited verbatim from the subjects immediately after provoked awakening (to minimize deterioration in memory recall) plus an additional 113 utterances (81 in direct verbatim form, 32 in indirect form) contained in the subsequent telling of the entire dream. 40 percent of the utterances were said by the dreamer; 60 percent by someone else in the dream scenario, usually addressed to the dreamer (a reversal of the proportions in the linguistic performance experiment).\n\nFive scorers, working independently but achieving a high degree of interscorer reliability, rated the appropriateness of each of the 205 dreams utterances to their situational context in the dream. Averaged out (and rounded off), 67% of the utterances were deemed to be \"entirely suitable to the narrative\"; 20% \"not entirely suitable\"; 7% \"largely unsuitable\"; and 4% \"entirely unsuitable.\"\n\nAs an example, in the following dream all lines of dialogue were deemed by all scorers (in the first instance, by four or the five scorers) to be fully suitable to the narrative:\n\nI was sitting in the garden and reading old magazines. [...] My son [...] took a little girlfriend along, also about five, and she started looking through the magazines. And they were getting wet, since she had such a cold that her nose ran. And I said \"that she, your little girlfriend, should rinse her nose with the lotah\", that's a jug used in yoga [instead of a handkerchief]. I use it myself, too. So I let her do it, but because she was so small, it didn't go right, and she started to cry. And then she walked home. So I said to my little boy, \"I'll go to her mother and tell her what happened, otherwise she'll think 'what a strange lady.'\" [...] Then that girl came out again, and my son had already told her mother that I had tried to help her get rid of her cold with the lotah. I simply knew that he had said that, but I didn't hear him say that literally. Then I said to that girl \"\"In the future, when you catch a cold, you should go to the doctor and have him write out a prescription for medicine.\"\n\nIn general, the dreamer as (to continue the film metaphor) \"script-writer\" appears to have at his or her command not just a \"story grammar\" capable of generating a reasonably, though not always, coherent overall scenario, but also the linguistic pragmatic competence to generate verbal dialogue which is usually, though again not always, appropriate to that scenario.\n\nThe abundance of verbal language in dreams—typically in the form of dialogue between the dreamer and other characters in the dream scenario—which generally shows a syntactic and lexical well-formedness comparable to speech in the waking state, and which in addition is, far more often than not, appropriate to the dream context, has, in Heynick's theoretical analysis, profound consequences for overall dream theories, past and present.\n\nFreud's psychoanalytic model of the mind and, in particular, his theory of dream generation and its function posit the existence of two global modes of mental functioning. The primary process, characterized by such mechanisms as condensations, displacements, and reversals (and the absence of any sense of negation) is theoretically characteristic of the infantile mode of thinking. It is superseded in the course of ontogeny by the development of the conscious part of the mind, which in the older child and adult is governed by the secondary process, adhering to the rules of grammar and logic. The verbal language which the developing child acquires is for Freud by definition a secondary process. The primary process in psychoanalytic theory is however not banished from the mind, but is contained in the unconscious, where it continues to characterize the mode of functioning of that part of the psyche.\n\nThe unconscious with its primary process mode—along with its repressed ideational content from early childhood, such as the Oedipus complex—provides, in Freud's theory, the driving force and initial input to dreams. Freud attributed the generation of a more or less coherent dream narrative to the process of \"secondary revision,\" which might (he vacillated on this issue) be \"a contribution on the part of waking thought to the construction of dreams\" rather than part of the \"dream work\" proper. The dream-like features which one experiences in dreams, such as condensations, displacements (symbolism), and reversals, are the manifestations of the primary-process input to the dream generation process.\n\nYet the dreams of Freud's own and those of his patients, which he provides in \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" and elsewhere, typically abound in verbal dialogue, which is always syntactically well-formed, often complex (containing subordinate clauses) and usually, though not always, semantically well-formed and appropriate to the context of the dream.\n\nAs an example, Heynick cites, among others, the \"dream of Irma's injection, which Freud himself considered to be of central importance to the development of his dream theory:\n\nI said to Irma: \"If you still get pains, it's really your own fault.\" She replied: \"If you only knew what pains I've got in my throat and stomach and abdomen—it's choking me.\" [...] I at once \"called in\" Dr. M. [who] looked quite different from usual; he was very pale, he walked with a limp and his chin was clean shaven. [...] My friend Leopold was [...] saying, \"She has a dull area down on the left.\" He also indicated that a portion of the skin of the left shoulder was infiltrated. (I noticed this, just as he did, in spite of her dress.) [...] M. said: \"\"There's no doubt it's an infection, but no matter, dysentery will supervene and the toxin will be eliminated.\"\n\nVirtually all the deep personal significance which Freud in his analysis attributed to his Irma dream would be lost without the verbal dialogue. Yet the utterances are fully grammatical; they contain properly embedded and conjoined clauses, two conditional phrases, a future tense, and two instances of negation. All words are proper German (in the original). Semantically most of the dialogue appears appropriate to the overall scenario, except the last which is medically absurd.\n\nFreud was apparently confronted with the enigma of how the generation of speech, a secondary process par excellence, could be functioning at such a apparently high level of adequacy during dreaming, the input and motive power of which involves a theoretically primary process. Freud attempted to resolve this problem by introducing his \"replay hypothesis\" (as Heynick terms it), according to which the dialogue in dreams is merely a repeating, in the same or similar words, of speech actually said or heard by the dreamer recently in waking life, usually on the day before the dream, only slightly modified (if at all) by the above-mentioned process of \"secondary revision.\" This theoretical regression to an infantile mimicking of speech thus denied to the dreaming process proper any substantial language functioning or (in modern terms) linguistic competence.\n\nWith a view to testing the validity of Freud's replay hypothesis, the subject-dreamers in the above-mentioned experiment on linguistic competence were asked with regard to each of their dream speech specimens whether they could recall having said the utterance prior to the dream in waking life in the same or similar words. The subjects deemed that to have been the case on the day before the dream for 8% of the utterances and for the week before the dream (including the day before the dream) for 14% of the utterances. Such low figures appear to invalidate Freud's replay hypothesis.\n\nAlthough no neo-Freudians treat the phenomenon of dream speech per se, proposed revisions to the psychoanalytic model of the mind by theorists such as Gill, Holt and Noy, beginning in the late 1960s, variously included the redefining of the place of speech generation (in wakefulness, but this would also apply to speech during dreaming) whereby it would no longer necessarily be classified as a strictly secondary process. Such revisions would, Heynick points out, potentially make the phenomenon of verbal language in dreams less anomalous in the psychoanalytic scheme, and without the need to resort, as Freud did, to the replay hypothesis as an \"ad hoc\" expedient.\n\nThe activation-synthesis hypothesis of dream generation first proposed by Harvard University psychiatrists John Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley in the late 1970s drew upon the discovery earlier in the decade of the ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) impulses which during the nightly REM periods (the physiological stage of sleep which is most associated with the phenomenological experience of vivid dreaming) are fired off from the brain stem and travel to the visual areas of the cortex.\n\nIn the visual area of the cortex, according to the model, the impulses call up largely at random a series of images (=activation). The dreamer's sleeping consciousness automatically tries to integrate these images into a more or less coherent story, while, for example, linking them with fragments of memory from the past (=synthesis). (Similar mechanisms involving the PGO impulses have been incorporated into other dream models, namely Francis Crick and Graeme Mitchison's reverse learning theory and Michael Jouvet's endogenous learning hypothesis.)\nThe activation-synthesis hypothesis, although based on neurological data more advanced than was ever available to Freud, is reminiscent of Freud's psychoanalytic model in that the initial input to the process is primitive and chaotic, onto which some order in imposed by a cognitively more advanced process. But as for the psychological interpretation of dreams the authors of the activation-synthesis hypothesis are outspokenly anti-Freudian, in that in their model the initial input to the dreaming process (the PGO-impulses) are devoid of any depth-psychology significance, Oedipal or whatever. (If the dream acquires any significance relating to the dreamer's personality. history, and present circumstances, this occurs in the manner in which the more or less randomly evoked images are integrated into a story during the synthesis stage, analogous to what a subject may \"see\" in the random ink-blots of a Rorschach test.)\n\nBe this as it may, the activation-synthesis hypothesis with its overwhelming emphasis on visual areas of the cortex is silent as to how the extensive verbal language may be generated and integrated into the dream scenario. Heynick cites as ironic a specimen dream which Hobson presents as exemplary of production by the activation-synthesis model:\n\nI am in Willianstown, Massachusetts, talking to a colleague, Van, who is wearing a white shirt (he usually wears blue) open at the neck (he is normally necktied, and even collar-clipped) and khakis (he usually sports flannels). Casual. Van says, as if by the way, \"that he attended the committee meeting that has yesterday considered my candidacy for an invited lecture series.\" (I know from his tone that he is going to deliver bad news.) The committee has decided against it because \"\"They don't feel that psychoanalysis should be confronted with laboratory data.\"\nI allowed at how bad this idea was. \"It's the wrong reason,\" I said. \"And their timing is off, because Adolf Grünbaum is just about to publish his important new book in which he insists that that is precisely what psychoanalysis must do.\" Van ignores this statement, appearing never to have heard of A.G.\nWe go out a door (which is on the corner of the building) to behold the beautiful Williams campus. A red-brick wall extends down a green lawn to the classic white Puritan buildings.\nVan says, \"They chose Mary\" (or seems to say that) \"reflecting their priorities to attract a speaker who might help them with their fund-raising efforts.\" \"\"That's why you have such beautiful buildings,\" I note, \"and why there is nothing in them.\"\"\n\nHobson presents this specimen as an example of how dreams can sometimes reflect personal concerns—in this case relating to his academic squabbles with his colleagues due to his anti-psychoanalytic stance within the psychiatric profession. As Heynick points out, the personal significance in this dream is in fact derived almost exclusively from the verbal dialogue, without which the dream would lose all its meaning.\n\nThe psychoneirics (from Greek; psycho = mind + oneiros = dream) model of dream generation, formulated by Foulkes from the late 1970s onwards, is cited as an exemplary model (though not necessarily the only possible type of model) of how the generation of verbal language can be incorporated into the generation of the overall dream scenario. Patterned on the psycholinguistic model of speech production (in wakefulness), the psychoneirics model is basically non-neurological. It views dream generation in humans as, like speech in humans, a skillful cognitive act, in fact possibly drawing upon the selfsame cognitive abilities.\n\nThe input to the dreaming process involves (not unlike the activation-synthesis hypothesis of dreaming) the diffuse activation of memory elements. Psychoneirics focuses on the midrange dream generation processes (regardless of whether or not the dream happens to include verbal dialogue) as involving \"schematic selection\" and \"element activation,\" analogous to the syntactic frame (sentence structure) selection and word selection of psycholinguistic models. (The dream-like features of dreams, such as condensations (composite images) and anomalous narrative shifts, are seen as residual flux of the dream production mechanism, which is otherwise doing a reasonably good job of developing the initial input into a coherent narrative.) Under this theoretical assumption that the human dream-generation ability and speech-generation ability (in wakefulness) derive from similar cognitive capacities, the psychoneirics model can claim to seamlessly account for the generation of verbal dialogue within dreams.\n\nThe data presented in the above experiments is considered as having implications not just for the evaluation of the various existing models of dream generation, but also for models of speech generation in general, that is in everyday life.\n\nDreaming is a state of consciousness different from the normal wakeful state. With regard to actions within the dream, dreaming consciousness is presumably characterized by a diminished capacity for deliberate intention on the part of the dreamer (including intention of what to say or, as scriptwriter, what to have other characters say) and a diminished attention to, or diminished ability to receive and monitor feedback from, the actions (including speech acts) as they are being carried out in the dream. The characteristics of dialogue in dreams indicate that despite the presumed diminished intention, attention and feedback on the part of the dreamer as speaker-listener and scriptwriter, the utterances generated, far more often than not, are semantically and syntactically well-formed and appropriate to the overall scenario. The implication is that the human capacity for language in general (that is, in everyday wakefulness) can largely rely on processes which, once they are triggered when the conditions match those required for their operation, can generate verbal utterances automatically, outside of awareness and without the need for intervention by the speaker except at points where some critical choice is made.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

This status is exhibited through the sociolinguistic behaviours of a mother-tongue speaker. A speaker who exhibits positive vernacular orientation is one who exhibits a preferred status for their mother tongue in such things as patterns of language use, language attitudes, social networks and even levels of language proficiency. Likewise, a speaker who exhibits negative vernacular orientation is one who exhibits a preferred status for a language other than their mother tongue in these areas of sociolinguistic behaviour.\n\nAn example of research into vernacular orientation as expressed in a community can be found at . This is a study on vernacular orientation in the Talysh community of the city of Sumgayit in the Republic of Azerbaijan for the purpose of gaining a greater understanding of its causes. Vernacular orientation is described in three areas of sociolinguistic behaviour: patterns of vernacular language use, vernacular language proficiency and frequency of vernacular-speaking individuals in social networks. Data was collected through personal interviews. The questionnaires for these interviews were developed using a qualitative-relational research approach. The description of vernacular orientation takes the form of a criteria-based typology of which an analysis of influential factors is ultimately made. This analysis of influential factors demonstrates the interaction between vernacular orientation as described in the typology and the contextual elements of the family, socio-economic dynamics and individual attitudes.\n"}
{"id": "30049818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30049818", "title": "Welfare culture", "text": "Welfare culture\n\nWelfare culture refers to the behavioral consequences of providing poverty relief (i.e., welfare) to low-income individuals. Welfare is considered a type of social protection, which may come in the form of remittances, such as 'welfare checks', or subsidized services, such as free/reduced healthcare, affordable housing, and more. Pierson (2006) has acknowledged that, like poverty, welfare creates behavioral ramifications, and that studies differ regarding whether welfare empowers individuals or breeds dependence on government aid. Pierson also acknowledges that the evidence of the behavioral effects of welfare varies across countries (such as Norway, France, Denmark, and Germany), because different countries implement different systems of welfare.\n\nIn the United States, the debate over the impact of welfare traces back as far as the New Deal, but it later became a more mainstream political controversy with the birth of modern welfare under President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. The term \"welfare culture,\" however, was not coined until 1986, by Lawrence Mead.\n\nWelfare may be used to refer to any government-based aid used to promote the well-being of its citizens. In recent decades, however, welfare has been restricted to refer to the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program (TANF), which provides monthly stipends for indigent families that meet a specific array of criteria.\n\nThe term \"welfare culture\" uses the more broad interpretation of welfare, all government social programs. However, scholars like David Ellwood and Lawrence Summers (1985) believe that the debate over welfare culture could be more accurate if each specific welfare program were examined individually. Specific programs include Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment benefits, and disability benefits.\n\nKent R. Weaver argues that most scholars cite the Social Security Act of 1935 as the origin of the American welfare state. That reform enacted a wide expanse of services for the poor and financially stressed, including unemployment benefits, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (later replaced in by the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program under the Clinton administration), retirement income stipends, subsidized housing, and many others.\n\nScholars such as June Axinn and Mark J. Stern (2007) estimate that the Social Security Act of 1935 and the newly institutionalized programs accompanying the New Deal increased the capacity to find employment, avoid starvation, and secure some form of affordable housing. Furthermore, economist Robert Cohen (1973) estimated that the New Deal sparked a reduction in unemployment from 20% to 15% by the end of the 1940s.\nStanley Feldman and John Zaller (1992) cite a number of economists and political historians who opposed government-based aid, because such critics credit the economic stimulus during World War II as the true solution to the unemployment and poverty of the Great Depression. During the war, American industries began to produce military weapons, food, and other material needs for the troops. The new economic incentive, in addition to a net export and an influx in gold, reduced interest rates, increased investments, and sparked job growth. Christine Romber (1992) and various other economic historians began to criticize the New Deal as the cause for unnecessary and unjustified reliance on government programs.\n\nHowever, Jerold Rusk (2008), a political scientist, recognizes a consensus among economic, history, and political scholars, which acknowledges that the effects of the New Deal are difficult to separate from the effects of World War II, which prevents any legitimate conclusion from being drawn on the debate.\n\nIn the early 1960s, President Johnson began his War on Poverty by introducing many new elements to welfare, including Medicare, Medicaid, increases in subsidized public housing, and more. David Frum (2002) believed such increases in government programs were counterproductive and found positive correlations between government aid and those who could not stay above the poverty line without such aid. Frum concluded that welfare bred dependence on the government.\nDuring the Johnson administration, a sociologist, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, published a study on the impacts of welfare on behavior during the 1960s. His report, \"\" (1965), is commonly referred to as the \"Moynihan Report.\"\n\nThe Moynihan Report advocates for increased welfare for poor black families but that welfare does not empower the destitute to find solutions to their financial troubles. Moynihan stated, \"The breakdown of the negro family has led to a startling increase in welfare dependency.\" Welfare, although helpful, was a reactive measure failing to address the true roots of poverty. Moynihan concluded that more proactive means to empower black families include the promotion of vocational training and a value in education.\n\nJohnson's precedent for increasing welfare benefits hit its pinnacle in the late 1970s under President Jimmy Carter when Temporary Assistance to Needy Family (TANF) recipients were receiving $238 a month, adjusted for inflation. According to the Census Bureau, a strong correlation with poverty reduction is noted, suggesting a link between welfare and empowerment. Poverty dropped from 23% of the population to 12% during the Johnson years. Poverty did not see an increase again until 1982 with 15% of Americans facing poverty, two years after welfare programs experienced serious cuts under President Ronald Reagan.\n\nHowever, the findings are not without their criticisms. According to the US Census Bureau, poverty had already begun to decrease before Johnson passed the Equal Opportunity Act. Additionally, unemployment reached some of its lowest rates in history under President Dwight Eisenhower near the end of the 1950s. Before Eisenhower left office, unemployment was estimated to be less than 5%.\n\nIn 1986, Lawrence Mead introduced a series of studies on welfare culture. Mead compared changes in income levels and welfare benefits across urban dwellers from the 1960s through the 1980s. Mead's studies suggest that over half of all welfare recipients will not need to stay on welfare for more than 10 years, but only 12% will be off welfare in less than 3 years. Mead concludes that welfare has demonstrated some proven effects for helping impoverished families meet their basic needs and find employment, thus acting as a tool for empowerment. However, Mead acknowledges that the welfare system can do better. Mead believes welfare culture could breed empowerment more effectively if mandatory participation in education/job training programs were required for welfare recipients.\n\nAnthropologist Oscar Lewis studied the behavioral effects of poverty on indigent Mexicans. He introduced the concept of the \"culture of poverty\" and 70 personality traits that he saw in the mentality of the impoverished, including helplessness, disdain for the government, lack of confidence, hopelessness, and a sense of futility that accompanies the search for employment.\n\n\n"}
