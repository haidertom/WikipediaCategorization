In 1966 it was stolen from Kom's royal compound. Seven years later it was recognized in a U.S. art gallery, and after some dispute, it was returned to the Kom people.\n\nThe Afo-A-Kom, which means \"the Kom thing\" (also \"Mbang\" in the Kom language) is a 62.5 inch wooden stylized carving of a standing man, crowned and holding a scepter, behind a stool supported on three carved buffalo heads. The core is iroko wood. His face is sheathed in copper and much of the body is covered with reddish and blue beads. (See the Arthemis link below for a photo online.) The Foyn/Fon (chief) cares for the statue, and it symbolizes \"royal authority and the promise of continued succession.\" The carver of this statue is unknown but it is speculated that Afo-A-Kom was carved by the second traditional leader (Foyn) of the Kom people in the 1920s.\n\nIn 1966, the Afo-A-Kom was stolen from its sacred grove at Laikom (the seat of the Kom people, where the Foyn resides) by one of the princes, then sold to a middle man who later sold it to an art dealer who took it to the United States of America. The Kom people believe that the Afo-A-Kom possesses mystical powers and that shortly after it arrived in the US it began disturbing its new owners by destroying everything around it. Its new owner took it and threw it into the sea but only to get back home and see the Afo-A-Kom. He took it to a New York art gallery where he sold it for circa 15 million CFA. While there it was recognized, and American art collector Warren M. Robbins raised an alarm. He raised funds together with other Americans and some Kom elite in the US to purchase the stolen statue back from the Manhattan art gallery for under $30,000. Returning the figure, Robbins was welcomed by the Fon of the Kom people Nsom Ngwe, and the President of Cameroon Ahmadou Ahidjo, among other dignitaries.\n\nDuring the reception of the statue in Yaounde, Ahidjo suggested to Fon Nsom Ngwe that Mbang be kept in the National Museum in Yaounde, but the Fon replied that if the President can provide enough space in Yaounde for him to go and bring the Kom people to stay with it there, then he would accept the president's proposal. Seeing that Kom and the Afo-A-Kom were inseparable, the president made it possible for the statue to be taken back to its habitual residence at Laikom. However, it was briefly put on display at the Tourism Office in Yaounde and later on transported by air to Bamenda. It was then ferried by a delegation of the dignitaries of the region back to Fundong where it was handed back to the Kom people.\n\nIt is now in the Laikom palace where it is put on display annually for the Kom people.\n\n"}

The Alliance was founded in 1993 following the merger of the International Exchange Association and the Liaison Group for International Educational Exchange. Following this merger, the Alliance became the sole collective voice of the 76 non-governmental organization exchange programs for the purpose of developing a unified public policy voice.\n\nThe Alliance's stated mission is \"to formulate and promote public policies that support the growth and well being of international exchange links between the people of the United States and other nations\". The Alliance operates under five guiding principles:\n\nThe Alliance produces specific recommendations for public policy makers concerning the exchange organizations that it represents. Further, it provides an opportunity for the leaders of the various exchange organizations to come together and exchange ideas or concerns. One of the core organizational activities of the Alliance is the spreading of public awareness of the role of exchange programs in meeting real demands.\n\nThe Alliance has four stated views on the role that exchange programs play in international relations. First, the Alliance believes that participants who engage in exchange programs and those who encounter exchange program participants experience a change in understanding of other cultures. Secondly, these types of exchanges allow for participants and others to grow and to develop new or refined skills. The third role is economic as people brought to the United States necessarily expend money and benefit local economies. The final role that the Alliance states is integral to exchange programs is in leadership training. The Alliance believes that exchange programs advance leadership skills that may be used in the future in finding solutions to the critical problems facing the United States, domestically and internationally.\n\n"}

The tradition is thought to have originated either in the Netherlands or in the British Isles and later became common in colonial United States, especially in Pennsylvania Dutch Country. Some Nebraska Amish may still practice it. When used for courtship, the aim is to allow intimacy without sexual intercourse.\n\nIt is possible the precedent for bundling came from the biblical story of Ruth and Boaz, in which Ruth, a young widow, and Boaz, an older wealthy landowner, spend a night together in a grain storage room while not touching; the pair later get married.\n\nTraditionally, participants were adolescents, with a boy staying at the residence of the girl. They were given separate blankets by the girl's parents and expected to talk to one another through the night. Occasionally a \"bundling board\" or bundling sack was placed between the boy and girl to discourage sexual conduct.\n\nIn Colonial United States, Jonathan Edwards and other preachers condemned bundling; yet the practice continued into the period of the early Republic, when if beds were scarce, travelers occasionally were permitted to bundle with locals. This seemingly strange practice allowed extra money to be made by renting out half a bed. Some hotels rented rooms for the night, shared by many occupants, and sharing a bed entailed an additional fee.\n\nIt is possible that, as late as the mid-19th century, bundling was still practiced in New York state and perhaps in New England, though its popularity was waning. The court case of \"Graham v. Smith\", 1 Edm.Sel.Cas. 267 (N.Y. 1846), for example, initially argued before Judge Edmunds in the Orange Circuit Court of New York, concerned the seduction of a 19-year-old woman; testimony in the case established that bundling was a common practice in certain rural social circles at the time. By the 20th century, bundling seems to have disappeared almost everywhere, except for the more conservative Old Order Amish affiliations, where it is still in use in the 21st century, regardless of location.\n\nThe writer Washington Irving, in chapter 7 of \"Knickerbocker's History of New York\" as well as other of his works, refers to bundling as a Yankee practice.\nThis amazing increase may, indeed, be partly ascribed to a singular custom prevalent among them, commonly known by the name of bundling—a superstitious rite observed by the young people of both sexes, with which they usually terminated their festivities, and which was kept up with religious strictness by the more bigoted part of the community.\nGabriel Edward Martin, Heath Ledger's character in the 2000 film \"The Patriot\", is bundled when he spends an overnight visit at the home of Anne Patricia Howard (Lisa Brenner), the girl that he is courting.\n\nAnna Gunn's character in the HBO series \"Deadwood\" mentions removing a bundling board from their bed in Season 2, Episode 2.\n\nIn the TV series \"Salem\" during Season 1, Episode 7, \"Our Own Private America\", adolescent teens are seen bundling. The girl breaks the sack.\n\nIn the TV serie A Discovery of Witches during Season 1, episode 5, Matthew de Clairmont and Diana Bishop discuss the \"bundling\" custom.\n\n\n\n"}

This generation resonates with Generation X and Millennials in the Western world. They were born at a time when the middle class had the majority, higher education was extremely valued and hard work would promise a bright future.\n\nThe Burnt Generation shaped their future dreams based on their parents' values and lifestyle. These values described success, convenience and social acceptance as simply achievable goals through hard work and right education. Their parents, a Baby Boomer-like generation, had rebuilt the country after World War II, established public education and women’s rights, nationalized the oil industry, and enhanced the public health system. Although there was a growing dissatisfaction with the government and Shah’s approach to a variety of political and social issues, the public's assumption was that those issues would be resolved through a democratic system.\n\nAfter the Shah's exile in the 1979 revolution, the clash between various political groups and new government created a suspicious environment that deeply affected the beliefs and values of the Burnt Generation. They are marked by lack of optimism for the future, nihilism, cynicism, skepticism, political apathy, alienation and distrust in traditional values and institutions which describe the similarities between Gen X and the Burnt Generation.\n\nAnother important event that influenced this generation was the Cultural Revolution and the shutting down colleges and universities for several years. After reopening, every applicant had to pass an interview with the government-approved committees and women were only allowed to apply for certain limited majors. At that time, many of Burnt Generation, ranged between 13 and 25 years old, were fighting in the Iran–Iraq War, which lasted from 1980 to 1988 with a million casualties on both sides.\n\nAs a result of growing up in that environment, they either have strong religious beliefs or are completely distrustful of religion and God. Some believe in God but disconnect themselves from any religious beliefs or groups. Their most common values include loyalty to family and friends, compassion, and high work ethics. The uncertainties of their future, either for those who lived in Iran or elsewhere, leave a deep sense of insecurity in the Burnt Generation.\n"}

In some states, notably those Commonwealth of Nations states that follow the Westminster system and whose political systems derive from British constitutional law, most government functions are guided by constitutional convention rather than by a formal written constitution.\nIn these states, actual distribution of power may be markedly different from those the formal constitutional documents describe. In particular, the formal constitution often confers wide discretionary powers on the head of state that, in practice, are used only on the advice of the head of government.\n\nSome constitutional conventions operate separate from or alongside written constitutions, such as in Canada since the country was formed with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1867. Others, notably the United Kingdom which lack a single overarching constitutional document, unwritten conventions are still of vital importance in understanding how the state functions. In most states, however, many old conventions have been replaced or superseded by laws (called codification).\n\nThe term was first used by British legal scholar A. V. Dicey in his 1883 book, \"Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution\". Dicey wrote that in Britain, the actions of political actors and institutions are governed by two parallel and complementary sets of rules:\n\nA century later, Canadian scholar Peter Hogg wrote,\n\nConstitutional conventions arise when the exercise of a certain type of power, which is not prohibited by law, arouses such opposition that it becomes impossible, on future occasions, to engage in further exercises of this power. For example, the constitutional convention that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom cannot remain in office without the support of a majority of votes the House of Commons is derived from an unsuccessful attempt by the ministry of Robert Peel to govern without the support of a majority in the House, in 1834–1835.\n\nConstitutional conventions are not, and cannot be, enforced by courts of law. The primary reason for this, according to the Supreme Court of Canada in its 1981 Patriation Reference, is that, \"They are generally in conflict with the legal rules which they postulate and the courts may be bound to enforce the legal rules.\" More precisely, the conventions make certain acts, which would be permissible under a straightforward reading of the law, impermissible in practice. The court ruled that this conflict between convention and law means that no convention, no matter how well-established or universally accepted, can \"crystallize\" into law, unless the relevant parliament or legislature enacts a law or constitutional amendment codifying for a convention at which must specify request and consensus' for enactment. This principle is regarded as authoritative in a number of other jurisdictions, including the UK.\n\nSome conventions evolve or change over time. For example, before 1918 the British Cabinet requested a parliamentary dissolution from the monarch, with the Prime Minister conveying the request. Since 1918, Prime Ministers request dissolutions on their own initiative, and need not consult members of the Cabinet (although, at the very least, it would be unusual for the Cabinet not to be aware of the Prime Minister's intention).\n\nHowever, conventions are rarely ever broken. Unless there is general agreement on the breach, the person who breaches a convention is often heavily criticised, on occasions leading to a loss of respect or popular support. It is often said that \"conventions are not worth the paper they are written on\", i.e., they are unenforceable in law because they are not written down.\n\n\nNo convention is absolute; all but one (the second) of the above conventions were disregarded in the leadup to or during the constitutional crisis of 1975.\n\nIgnoring constitutional conventions does not always result in a crisis. After the Tasmanian state election, 2010, the Governor of Tasmania rejected the advice of his Premier to appoint the leader of the opposition as Premier because he felt the advice was tendered in bad faith. The Premier went on to form a new government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a convention that the Prime Minister of New Zealand should not ask for an early election unless he or she is unable to maintain confidence and supply. By the 1950s, it had also become a convention that elections should be held on the last Saturday of November, or the closest date to this range as possible. There are several times when these conventions have been broken and an election has been held several months earlier:\n\nBecause of the 1814 written constitution's pivotal role in providing independence and establishing democracy in the 19th century, the Norwegian parliament has been very reluctant to change it. Few of the developments in the political system that have been taking place since then have been codified as amendments. This reluctance has been labelled constitutional conservatism. The two most important examples of constitutional conventions in the Norwegian political system are parliamentarism and the declining power of the King.\n\nMuch of Spain's political framework is codified in the Spanish Constitution of 1978, which formalizes the relationship between an independent constitutional monarchy, the government, and the legislature. However, the constitution invests the monarch as the \"arbitrator and moderator of the institutions\" of government.\n\n\nThe following constitutional conventions are part of the political culture of Switzerland. They hold true at the federal level and mostly so at the cantonal and communal level. Mostly, they aim to reconcile the democratic principle of majority rule with the need to achieve consensus in a nation that is much more heterogeneous in many respects than other nation-states.\n\nWhile the United Kingdom does not have a written constitution that is a single document, the collection of legal instruments that have developed into a body of law known as constitutional law has existed for hundreds of years.\n\nAs part of this uncodified British constitution, constitutional conventions play a key role. They are rules that are observed by the various constituted parts though they are not written in any document having legal authority; there are often underlying enforcing principles that are themselves not formal and codified. Nonetheless it is very unlikely that there would be a departure of such conventions without good reason, even if an underlying enforcing principle has been overtaken by history, as these conventions also acquire the force of custom. Examples include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

For example, in the first four lines of William Shakespeare's \"Sonnet 130\", Shakespeare contrasts a mistress to the sun, coral, snow, and wire.\n\nContrast is the antonym of simile. In poetic compositions, it is common for poets to set out an elaborate contrast or elaborate simile as the argument. For example, John Donne and the metaphysical poets developed the conceit as a literary device, where an elaborate, implausible, and surprising analogy was demonstrated. In Renaissance poetry, and particularly in sonnets, the contrast was similarly used as a poetic argument. In such verse, the entire poem argues that two seemingly alike or identical items are, in fact, quite separate and paradoxically different. These may take the form of \"my love is unlike all other women\" or \"I am unlike her other loves\".\n\nIn the early 18th century, a theory of wit developed by English writers (particularly John Locke) held that judgement sees the differences in like things, or imagination or fancy sees the likeness in different things, and wit operates properly by employing judgement and fancy to form sound propositions. In lyric poetry, the author is often attempting to show how what seems to be solely an exercise of judgement or fancy is, in fact, wit.\n"}
{"id": "49333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49333", "title": "Cultural bias", "text": "Cultural bias\n\nCultural bias is the phenomenon of interpreting and judging phenomena by standards inherent to one's own culture. The phenomenon is sometimes considered a problem central to social and human sciences, such as economics, psychology, anthropology, and sociology. Some practitioners of the aforementioned fields have attempted to develop methods and theories to compensate for or eliminate cultural bias.\n\nCultural bias occurs when people of a culture make assumptions about conventions, including conventions of language, notation, proof and evidence. They are then accused of mistaking these assumptions for laws of logic or nature. Numerous such biases exist, concerning cultural norms for color, mate selection, concepts of justice, linguistic and logical validity, the acceptability of evidence, and taboos.\n\nCultural bias has no a priori definition. Instead, its presence is inferred from differential performance of socioracial (e.g., Blacks, Whites), ethnic (e.g., Latinos/Latinas, Anglos), or national groups (e.g., U.S. Americans, Japanese) on measures of psychological constructs such as cognitive abilities, knowledge or skills (CAKS), or symptoms of psychopathology (e.g., depression). Historically, the term grew out of efforts to explain between‐group score differences on CAKS tests primarily of African American and Latino/Latina American test takers relative to their White American counterparts and concerns that test scores should not be interpreted in the same manner across these groups. Although the concept of cultural bias in testing and assessment also pertains to score differences and potential misdiagnoses with respect to a broader range of psychological concepts, particularly in applied psychology and other social and behavioral sciences, this aspect of cultural bias has received less attention in the relevant literature.\n\nCultural bias in psychological testing refers to the standardized psychological tests that are conducted to determine the level of intelligence among the test-takers. Limitations of such verbal or non-verbal intelligence tests have been observed since their introduction. However, the limitations they put forth, due to their particular culture-friendliness, has been realized much later. Many tests have been objected to, as they produced poor results for the ethnic or racial minorities (students), as compared to the racial majorities. The problem lies not with the test-taker, but with the test itself. As discussed above, the learning environment, the questions posed or situations given in the test may be familiar and strange at the same time to students from different backgrounds.\n\nCultural bias in economic exchange is often overlooked. A study done at the Northwestern University suggests that the cultural perception that two countries have of each other plays a large factor in the economic activity between them. This study suggests that low bilaterial trust between two countries will result in less trade, less portfolio investment, and less direct investment. This effect is amplified for goods, as they are more trust intensive.\n\nThe concept of culture theory in anthropology explains that cultural bias is a critical piece of human group formation.\n\nIt is thought that societies with conflicting beliefs will more likely have cultural bias as it is dependent on the group's standing in society, where the social constructions affect how a problem is produced. One example of cultural bias within the context of sociology can be seen in a study done at the University of California by Jane R. Mercer of how test \"validity\", \"bias\", and \"fairness\" in different cultural belief systems affect one's future in a pluralistic society. A definition of the cultural bias was given as \"the extent that the test contains cultural content that is generally peculiar to the members of one group but not to the members of another group\", which leads to a belief that \"the internal structure of the test will differ for different cultural groups\". In addition, the different types of errors made on culture-biased tests are dependent on different cultural groups. This idea progressed to the conclusion that a non-cultural-test will represent the ability of a population as intended and will not reflect the abilities of a group that is not represented.\n\nCultural bias may also arise in historical scholarship, when the standards, assumptions and conventions of the historian's own era are anachronistically used to report and assess events of the past. This tendency is sometimes known as presentism, and is regarded by many historians as a fault to be avoided. Arthur Marwick has argued that \"a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know\" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that \"anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history\".\n\n"}

The process of identification is subjective, and \"icons\" are judged by the extent to which they can be seen as an authentic proxy of that culture. When individuals perceive a cultural icon, they relate it to their general perceptions of the cultural identity represented. Cultural icons can also be identified as an authentic representation of the practices of one culture by another.\n\nIn the media, many items and persons of popular culture have been called \"iconic\" despite their lack of durability; and the term \"pop icon\" is often now used. Some commentators believe that the word is overused or misused.\n\nA web-based survey was set up in 2006 allowing the public to nominate their ideas for national icons of England and the results reflect the range of different types of icon associated with an English view of English culture. Some examples are:\n\n\nMatryoshka dolls are seen internationally as cultural icons of Russia. In the former Soviet Union, the hammer and sickle symbol and statues of Vladimir Lenin instead represented the country's most prominent cultural icons.\n\nThe values, norms and ideals represented by a cultural icon vary both among people who subscribe to it, and more widely among other people who may interpret cultural icons as symbolising quite different values. Thus an apple pie is a cultural icon of the United States, but its significance varies among Americans.\n\nNational icons can become targets for those opposing or criticising a regime, for example, crowds destroying statues of Lenin in Eastern Europe after the fall of communism or burning the American flag to protest US actions abroad.\n\nReligious icons can also become cultural icons in societies where religion and culture are deeply entwined, such as representations of the Madonna in societies with a strong Catholic tradition.\n\nDescribing something as \"iconic\" or as an \"icon\" has become very common in the popular media. This has drawn criticism from some: a writer in \"Liverpool Daily Post\" calls \"iconic\" \"a word that makes my flesh creep\", a word \"pressed into service to describe almost anything.\" The \"Christian Examiner\" nominates \"iconic\" in its list of overused words, finding over 18,000 \"iconic\" references in news stories alone, with another 30,000 for \"icon\", including its use for \"SpongeBob SquarePants\".\n\n\n\n"}

Written somewhere between 197-202, the work looks at the moral legitimacy and consequences of Christians attending the circus, theatre, or amphitheatre.\n\nTertullian argues that human enjoyment can be an offence to God. His view of these public entertainments is that they are a misuse of God's creation and a perversion of the gifts God has given to man. He supports his claim by reminding the reader that these shows and spectacles derived from pagan ritual rites (the Liberalia, the Consualia, the Equiria, the Bacchanalia, etc.). This means that the events derive from idolatry. Of key concern was that the \"show always leads to spiritual agitation\". By attending and partaking in the event, man is subject to strong excitements, which are aroused due to natural lapses, which create passionate desire. Additionally, Tertullian writes that that which is not permissible to say or do should not be permissible to see or hear.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, in \"On the Genealogy of Morality\" (Essay 1, Section 15), uses Tertullian's words to highlight the resemblance of Christian worship to circus-going: \"In place of athletes, we have our martyrs; if we crave blood, we have the blood of Christ...\" To those addicted to the pleasure of pagan spectacles Tertullian tried to show that Christianity offers far superior spectacles. For this reason he spoke of the Second Coming, the resurrection of the saints, New Jerusalem, and of “what no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart conceived” (), but the spectacle on which he enlarged most was the Last Judgement and the ensuing punishment of the enemies of Christ:\n\nSuch an expression of joy over the ruin of the damned finds no match in the other works of early Christians. However, it must be taken into account that in an earlier chapter of the treatise Tertullian wrote that “the innocent can find no pleasure in another’s sufferings: he rather mourns that a brother has sinned so heinously as to need a punishment so dreadful.” This passage is hard--if not impossible--to reconcile with the one quoted before and it is therefore debatable what Tertullian's real sentiments regarding the damned were.\n\n"}

Thirdly, these adaptations feedback into innovation processes in industry, shaping the next generation of technologies and services.\nThe theory was initially developed to help understand the adoption and use of new media technologies by households (Silverstone et al. 1992), but has since been expanded in the innovation literature as a tool to understand technologies and innovations entering any consuming unit (workplace, country etc. e.g. Lie et al., Habib, Punie, Sørensen) that can be analysed economically, culturally and sociologically. The domestication approach considers both the practical and the symbolic aspects of the adoption and use of technologies, showing how these two elements- the meanings of things, and their materiality, are equally important understanding how technologies become part of everyday life. It is a foremost a social theory as it highlights the negotiations, challenges to power and control, rule-making and breaking that accompany the introduction of technologies into any social setting.\n\nOne variant of domestication theory identified three stages of technology being adapted by users. According to Nancy K. Baym, these three stages are (1) initially marvelous and strange, (2) then become capable of creating greatness and horror and (3) and are then so ordinary as to be invisible (Baym, 2015). This can also be thought of as (1) euphoria, (2) moral panic, and (3) domestication. An example of this is the introduction of video games into society. Initially, there was a euphoric response to video games as it had the potential to improve hand, eye, and brain coordination. Then, moral panic set in and there was a fear of violence, addiction, and obesity. Lastly, there was a domestication of video games with acceptance of the technology as an ordinary part of society. \n\nThe Domestication approach has roots in cultural studies of media use, but is informed by Science and technology studies, gender studies of household technology, sociology of everyday life, consumption studies and innovation studies, and has been most widely used in studying the mass adoption of computers, the internet and mobile phones.\n\nAs a strand of the Social shaping of technology approach to understanding how technology is created, Domestication theory highlights the role of users in innovation - the work done by individuals and communities in order to make a technology from the outside do practical work, and make sense within that community. This strand of work links to the role of end users, lead users etc. in long term innovation processes (Williams et al. 2004).\n\nDomestication studies are generally done using qualitative methods, such as long interviews and ethnography to explore the emerging meanings of technologies, and the changing routines, and conflicts that would not normally be accessible to quantitative methods.\n\nThe Domestication approach uses a number of different concepts to distinguish various aspects of the process. For example: Appropriation is the process of bringing a technology into a household, or another local cultural context; Conversion is the remaking of the meanings, or values and norms associated with the technology and the transfer of these back to the 'outside' world.\n\nThe principal criticism of the domestication approach is its reliance on detailed case studies, and its rather descriptive approach which is difficult to turn into prescriptive lessons of the type required by business and policy makers. However, this rich-descriptive approach is also its strength: it enables processes and the complex interplay of artifacts and cultural values to be explored in much more depth than individualistic, quantitative methods.\n\nThe Domestication approach, describing the integration of technologies into social relationships and structures using evidence obtained using qualitative methods, stands in sharp contrast to individualistic and quantitative approaches (such as Technology acceptance model) of North-American marketing and IS research, that draw on primarily psychological models.\n\n\n"}

Europalia was established in Brussels in 1969, and from the beginning Europalia was designed to be a multidisciplinary cultural festival.\n\nIts name is a combination of two words: “Europe” and “Opalia,” an ancient Roman harvest festival held in mid-December in honour of Ops, earth-goddess and fertility deity. Her name lies at the root of the Latin word “Opus”, that denotes a work of art.\n\nThe main Europalia events traditionally take place in the Belgian capital but many other cities across the country also host exhibitions and performances. For several years other European cities (in the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg and Germany) have been associated with Europalia and also offer activities on the festival programme.\n\nFrom the beginning of October to January, the culture of the invited country is illustrated in a prestigious series of exhibitions – ancient, modern and contemporary art, photography, crafts, mode and design – and also a variety of events : orchestras, musical ensembles and soloists, theatre, dance, literary and scientific colloquia, conferences, cinema retrospectives, folkloric and popular traditional performances, gastronomy combine with exhibitions to offer the most complete view possible of a country’s arts and culture. This is the highly original formula of Europalia.\n\nEach festival develops a partnership, not only with the chosen country but also with prominent museums, cultural centres and performance halls in Belgium and neighbouring countries. The festival expenses are shared between Belgium and the invited country. Europalia is financially supported by Belgium’s national, regional and community governments and numerous private companies.\n\nEuropalia calls on the collaboration of the most renowned international specialists to help conceive the festival as well as to participate in colloquia and conferences. Europalia events are extensively covered by television, radio and print media, and attract a large European audience, eager to discover a country’s cultural treasures assembled exceptionally for more than three months in this important festival.\n\n\nIndonesia will attend the 26th Europalia International Arts Festival as guest country in 2017.\n\n\n"}

The expression \"gentleman scientist\" arose in post-Renaissance Europe, but became less common in the 20th century as government and private funding increased.\n\nMost independent scientists have at some point in their career been affiliated with some academic institution, such as Charles Darwin, who was affiliated with the Geological Society of London. \n\nSelf-funded scientists practiced more commonly from the Renaissance until the late 19th century, including the Victorian era, especially in England, before large-scale government and corporate funding was available. Many early fellows of the Royal Society in London were independent scientists.\n\nSelf-funding has the disadvantage that funds may be more restricted; however, it has the advantage of eliminating a number of inconveniences such as teaching obligations, administrative duties, and writing grant requests to funding bodies. It also permits the scientist to have greater control over research directions, as funding bodies direct grants towards interests that may not coincide with that of the scientist. Furthermore, intellectual property of the inventions belongs to the inventor and not the employer.\n\nModern science requires competence and may require access to scientific equipment. However, independent scientists may have past careers as funded scientists, cooperate with funded colleagues, obtain partial equipment-only grants or choose directions where the most expensive resource required is the researcher's time. If the research succeeds, independent scientists may publish results in the same peer-reviewed journals as funded scientists do.\n\nScientists may choose to work on unusual projects with high risk of failure also when the grant system does not fund them. A scientist could be attributed the status of independent scientist if they work on such projects during a gap between two academic positions, for example.\n\nModern-day independent scientists who fund their own research on an independent basis include, for example, Stephen Wolfram who funds his research through the sale of Mathematica software, Julian Barbour, Aubrey de Grey, Barrington Moore, Susan Blackmore, James Lovelock, and John Wilkinson who funds his research on \"molecular synergism in nature\" by running a regulatory scientific consultancy in natural products.\n\nPeter Rich said of Peter D. Mitchell: \"I think he would have found it difficult to have gotten funding because his ideas were rather radical.\" Mitchell went on to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1978. Chemist Luis Leloir funded the research institute he headed, the Institute for Biochemical Research, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1970.\n\nThere are today several virtual research institutes for independent scientists.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33596709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33596709", "title": "Individualistic culture", "text": "Individualistic culture\n\nIndividualistic culture is a society which is characterized by individualism, which is the prioritization or emphasis, of the individual over the entire group. Individualistic cultures are oriented around the self, being independent instead of identifying with a group mentality. They see each other as only loosely linked, and value personal goals over group interests. Individualistic cultures tend to have a more diverse population and are characterized with emphasis on personal achievements, and a rational assessment of both the beneficial and detrimental aspects of relationships with others. Individualistic cultures have such unique aspects of communication as being a low power-distance culture and having a low-context communication style. Highly individualistic cultures include the U.S., Australia, Great Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.\n\nPower distance is defined to be the degree to which unequal distribution of power is accepted in a culture. Low power distance cultures challenge authority, encourage a reduction of power differences between management and employees, and encourage the use of power legitimately. Low power distance is more likely to occur in an individualistic culture, because in a collectivist culture, people protect the well being of the group and established order so they would be less likely to challenge authority or people in power. Even though individualistic cultures are more likely to be low power distance, these cultures don't expect to completely eliminate power difference. People within this low power distance culture, however, are more likely to respond to such imbalances in power with more negative emotional responses than in the alternative, high power distance cultures. Low power distance cultures include Austria, Israel, Denmark, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, and Sweden. The U.S. ranks 38th on the scale.\n\nIndividualistic cultures are also more likely to have a low-context communication style. This means that communication is precise, direct, and specific. Unlike in high-context communication, reading between the lines is not necessary in low-context communication. This explicit communication is used in order to prevent any form of misunderstanding between cultures. The ability to articulate the thoughts and opinions one holds as well as to express them eloquently are encouraged, as is persuasive speaking. Low-context communication is all content and no relationship dimension.\n\nIndividualistic cultures tend to prioritize the individual person over the group, and this can be seen in how the display rules vary from a collectivist culture compared to an individualistic culture. Display rules are the rules that exist in different cultures that determine how emotion should be displayed publicly. In an individualistic culture, self-expression is highly valued, making the display rules less strict and allowing people to display intense emotion such as: happiness, anger, love, etc. While in a collectivist culture, moderation and self-control is highly valued for the well being of the group, and collectivist cultures therefore tend to restrain from showing emotion in public.\n\nConflict strategies are methods used to resolve different problems. There are different approaches to resolving conflict, and depending the culture a person is brought up in, the more likely it is for them to use a certain approach. Since individualistic culture sets greater value to personal achievement, contrary to collectivist cultures who value harmony, it is more likely for a person from an individualistic culture to use competition as their method of resolving conflict. When using competition as an approach to resolving conflict, a person is more confrontational and seeks to achieve his or her own goals with no regard of the goals of others. Using this approach a person seeks domination, which means to get others to do what the person wants instead of what they initially wanted. On the contrary, a collectivist culture would more likely use a less confrontational approach such as accommodation to end the conflict with compromise so that each party is benefited.\n\n"}

{"id": "72331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72331", "title": "Karōshi", "text": "Karōshi\n\n, which can be translated literally as \"overwork death\" in Japanese, is occupational sudden mortality. The major medical causes of \"karōshi\" deaths are heart attack and stroke due to stress and a starvation diet. This phenomenon is also widespread in other parts of Asia as well.\n\nThe first case of \"karōshi\" was reported in 1969 with the stroke-related death of a 29-year-old male worker in the shipping department of Japan's largest newspaper company. The term was invented in 1978 to refer to an increasing number of people suffering from fatal strokes and heart attacks attributed to overwork. A book on the issue in 1982 brought the term into public usage.\n\nIt was not until the mid to late 1980s, during the Bubble Economy, when several high-ranking business executives who were still in their prime years suddenly died without any previous sign of illness, that the term emerged into Japanese public life. This new phenomenon was immediately seen as a new and serious menace for people in the work force. In 1987, as public concern increased, the Japanese Ministry of Labour began to publish statistics on \"karōshi\".\n\nIn 1988, the Labor Force Survey reported that almost one fourth of the male working employees worked over 60 hours per week, which is 50% longer than a typical 40-hour weekly working schedule. Realizing the seriousness and widespread nature of this emerging problem, a group of lawyers and doctors set up “karoshi hotlines” that are nationally available, dedicating to help those who seek consultation on karoshi related issues.\n\nJapan's rise from the devastation of World War II to economic prominence and the huge war reparations they have paid in the post-war decades have been regarded as the trigger for what has been called a new epidemic. It was recognized that employees cannot work for 12 or more hours a day, 6–7 days a week, year after year, without suffering physically as well as mentally. It is common for the overtime to go unpaid.\n\nIn an International Labour Organization article about \"karōshi\", the following four typical cases of \"karōshi\" were mentioned:\nAs well as physical pressure, mental stress from the workplace can cause \"karōshi\". People who commit suicide due to mental stress are called \"\"karōjisatsu\" (過労自殺).\" The ILO also lists some causes of overwork or occupational stress that include the following:\n\nIn a 1988 report published by the Karoshi Hotline Network, the majority of the clients who consulted were not workers, but the wives of the workers who had either passed away because of karoshi or were at high risk of doing so. This indicated that those who were stressed out by work either did not realize the cause was overworking or were under social pressure to not express it explicitly by seeking help.\n\nThe Karoshi Hotline received the highest number of calls when it was first established in 1988. From 1988 to 1990, there were a total number of 1806 calls received. From 1990 to 2007, the number of calls received per year decreased, but still maintained an average of 400 calls per year. Its availability is nationwide, ranging from Hokkaido(北海道) to Kanto(関東).\n\nSuicide can be induced by overwork-related stresses or when businessmen are laid off from their jobs. The deceased person's relatives demand compensation payments when such deaths occur. Life insurance companies started putting one-year exemption clauses in their contracts. They did this so that the person must wait one year to commit suicide in order to receive the money.\n\nThere is a new movement of Japanese workers, formed as a result of \"karōshi\". Young Japanese are choosing part-time work, contrary to their elder counterparts who work overtime. This is a new style of career choice for the young Japanese people who want to try out different jobs in order to figure out their own potential. These individuals work for \"hourly wages rather than regular salaries,\" and are called \"freeters.\" The number of freeters has increased throughout the years, from 200,000 in the 1980s to about 400,000 in 1997.\n\nFreeters undergo a special kind of employment, defined by Atsuko Kanai as those who are currently employed and referred to as \"part-time workers or arbeit (temporary workers), who are currently employed but wish to be employed as part time workers, or who are currently not in the labor force and neither doing housework nor attending school but wish to be employed as part-time workers.\" Freeters are not in school, are aged 15–34, and if they are women, are unmarried. The movement of the freeters has its problems, however. Most freeters fail to launch successful careers, based on a few factors.\n\nDue to their part-time work, their annual income is around 1 million yen, or around $8,500 USD. Also, economic growth in Japan is slow, making it difficult for freeters to switch to regular employment. Another problem is that freeters are given menial tasks, which makes it almost impossible to gain any real experience, which is necessary when converting to full-time employment. (Kanai, 2003) It may seem as if being a freeter is the answer to the overworked, near-\"karōshi\" individual suffering from long work hours. Those who are being non-regular employees or freeters who are supposedly wanting to only work part-time are finding themselves working 60 hours a week or more. Since non-regular employees' wages are so low, it is necessary for them to work longer hours, negating the desire to be a freeter. Freeters are now facing the risk of \"karōshi\", just as regular workers have, due to their long hours.\n\nThere are other undesirable results, other than \"karōshi\", that arise from working long hours. A psychological trait known as workaholism has been shown to lead one to work long hours. (Spence & Robbins, 1992) There are three defining factors of workaholism: high work involvement, being driven to or compelled to work by inner pressures, and low enjoyment of work. (Kanai, 1996). The last of these factors suggests a contradiction. However, Kanai argued that workaholism is not a psychological trait, but rather results from adaptation to that work demand overload. Individuals that overload on work are not doing so because they are workaholics, but that the demand of the workload brings out psychologically and behavioral characteristics similar to those with workaholism. Management welcomes hard work and rewards with promotions. Morioka (2005), suggests that in order to eliminate the harmful effects of workaholism, the workplace should be responsible for managing workload issues.\n\nOverworking also has a negative effect on the family. Men who become too busy with their jobs think less about their family. High levels of family depression exist as a result. As the men focus on their jobs, they tend to develop negative feelings towards family. They take on less of a role in family life as they continue to overwork. The men see the family as something that is taking away from their work, which creates a resentment toward the family. As a result, avoidance of family time increases, even though it is their family that inspires them to work hard in the first place (Kanai, 2002). Kanai's findings suggest that excessive working hours are harmful to family life, not only in that are they spending less time with their families, but that they also develop hostility towards the family.\n\nHowever, it could also be said that the men had taken on these jobs for the sake of providing for their family, but ultimately become less effective as a resource due to their exhaustion and complete focus on earning money. It is likely salarymen go into that lifestyle simply for the money, because the jobs pay well; if they work long hours, they can earn large sums of money and send it to their families to help provide for them, since in traditional Japanese families, the father is usually the main worker in the household. In an interview, a man had said that \"the best thing about being born male was, 'having a family, and being able to support that family.' Conversely the worst thing was 'being unable to quit your job even if you want to' due to the same responsibility.\" The responsibility men have to provide for the family correlates with their masculinity, so if a man gets laid off he may think that \"their own ability is really poor, and would get quite depressed.\" These pressures are ones that society puts on them, since it is expected that the men work and provide for the family.\n\nThe Cabinet Office analyzes the Household Survey on the Quality of Life to examine how large of an impact overwork has on health issues, including karoshi. The study finds that a long weekly working schedule, which is defined as over 60 hours for men and over 45 hours for women, significantly increased the anxiety of employees who believe they will be suffering from health issues. In other words, regardless of whether employees had health issues, merely working for longer hours created anxiety towards perceived health issues. The 15-hour gap between men and women does not mean that women are less capable of dealing with stress, but is because of the traditional Japanese value that puts the burden of taking care of children and other mundane household tasks on women. Women thus have much larger range of responsibilities to be concerned with, in addition to their everyday jobs.\n\nThe suicide prevention hotline in Japan is often so busy, callers occasionally have to try between 30 and 40 times until they can get an answer. Each year, roughly 30,000 people in Japan commit suicide. A potential reason why the number is so high could be the kind of camaraderie involved in the process of committing suicide, where people will spend time searching online to find other suicidal individuals and then \"make plans to die together.\"\n\nTo provide a strategic plan on how to decreases the rate of karoshi, the National Institute of Health proposed the establishment of a comprehensive industrial health service program to reduce karoshi and other disease caused by work-related stress in its 2005 annual report. The program requires communal efforts from three different groups, the government, the labour unions and employers, and the employees. The government, as the policy maker, should promote shorter working hours, make health services readily accessible, encourage voluntary health examination and enhance the effectiveness of medical care. As the group that is more closely involved with the everyday health of employees, labour unions and employers should strive to implement and comply with government policies that focus on reducing work overtime and create a better work environment. The employees themselves should recognize their needs to take rests promptly and take preventative measures as needed.\n\nAs a formal response to this proposal, the Industry Safety and Health Act was revised in 2006. The Act established various terms that focus on work-related health issues, including mandatory health checks and consultations with professional medical personnel for employees who work long hours and have a higher possibility of having work related illness. It might seem to be an odd decision, speaking from an economic standpoint, to use government policy to force companies to reduce work hours. It seems to be counterproductive of the profit maximizing nature of market economy. This counterintuitive intervention, according to Yoshio Higuchi, is attributed to the several factors unique to the Japanese society. Traditionally, Japanese workers are very loyal employees.\n\nIt is very common for someone to work for the same company from a freshly out of school graduate to a nearly retired man. The society also views those who constantly change jobs with skeptical eyes. Such discouragement directly caused the difficulty in moving into new jobs. Thus, companies usually have a much higher bargaining power when it comes to “exploiting” their employees. In order to cut costs, companies would usually demand their employees work for longer hours instead of hiring someone to take over part of the workload. Therefore, if the government does not intervene and mandate companies to reduce working time, no orders would be taken seriously.\n\nThe current Labor Standards Act is not effective if the majority of the representative employees agree with working over 40 hours per week, despite clauses in the Act prohibits such overtime. A study by the Cabinet Office of the Economic and Social Research Institute of Japan (the Cabinet Office) pointed out that refusing to consent with the ILO's treaty on work time regulations could be a large contributing factor to the current state of the labor market.\n\nA Japanese businessman, also known as a salaryman (サラリーマン, \"sararīman\"), is often a victim of \"karōshi\" due to the strenuous work hours their job requires, in addition to the mandatory after-hours socializing and drinking that their jobs require. Often these salarymen are invited to nomikai, or \"drinking parties,\" to build better connections between coworkers in the company. According to an article on Gaijinpot, \"A common saying in Japan is, 'if you want to work your way up the corporate ladder you have to drink.' This was how many older generation workers established relationships and considered this the normal way of doing business.\"\n\nAccording to these values, a key to business success was a willingness to go out and participate in this mandatory socializing with coworkers. Since not everyone can keep up with the pace and immersion of salaryman life, stress-induced death became fairly common. Due to this high-stress nature of a salaryman's job, death by cardivascular diseases or mental disorders were some of the two biggest factors.\n\nSince Japanese businessmen are under a lot of work-related pressures, \"karōshi\" suicides have increased, especially due to economic crises. Even those that were able to keep their jobs, after their company laid off multiple employees, experienced a large increase in work. \"In 2000, 28% of regular Japanese employees worked 50 hours or more per week, compared to 16% to 21% in New Zealand, USA, Australia and the UK and less than 6% in 13 other industrialized nations.\"\n\nBusinessmen in Japan have been overworked, but physicians specifically have been feeling great pressures of being overworked, while still facing a moral obligation to continue. Physicians work an average of 65 hours a week or more. \"They are reaching the limit in terms of the number of service hours they can provide without risking their own health.” The government used to have restrictions on the number of physicians that could attend medical school, but now they have increased medical school enrollment. It takes years for physicians to become qualified, so it is critical that alternative measures come into play before \"karōshi\" takes a toll on physicians in Japan.\n\nA number of companies have been making an effort to find a better work-life balance for their employees. Toyota, for example, now generally limits overtime to 360 hours a year (an average of 30 hours monthly), and, at some offices, issues public address announcements every hour after 7 p.m. pointing out the importance of rest and urging workers to go home. Nissan offers telecommuting for office workers to make it easier to care for children or elderly parents. Dozens of large corporations have also implemented \"no overtime days\", which require employees to leave the office promptly at 5:30 p.m. However, since their workload is too high, few workers can actually take advantage of this, and opt to stay in the office with the lights off or to simply take their work home, \"cloaked overtime\" called \"furoshiki\" (風呂敷) after the Japanese traditional wrapping cloth.\n\nIn 2007, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking, a division of Japan's largest banking group, started to allow employees to go home up to 3 hours early to care for children or elderly relatives. As of January 5, 2009, just 34 of the company's 7,000 employees had signed up for the plan.\n\nIn February 2017, Japanese Government launched a campaign called \"Premium Friday\" asking companies to allow their workers to leave at 3pm on the last Friday of the month. The initiative is part of an attempt to address the punishingly long hours many Japanese are expected to work, prompted by the suicide of a 24-year-old employee at the advertising firm Dentsu who was doing more than 100 hours' overtime in the months before her death. While some major companies, such as Honda, the drinks maker Suntory and the confectioner Morinaga, have adopted the optional scheme, others are less enthusiastic about the prospect of a mid-afternoon staff exodus. A survey of 155 big companies by the Nikkei business newspaper showed that 45% had no immediate plans to implement the scheme, with 37% saying they had either decided to enter into the spirit of Premium Friday or had plans to do so.\n\nThe problem with unpaid overtime in companies is that the overtime is simply not recorded in many cases. The amount of overtime is regulated by labor regulations, so, in order to not contradict labor regulations, workers are told not to record the overtime, since it would be considered an illegal action from the side of the company. The workers themselves often rationalize this by attributing the overwork to lacking skills from their side, describing a lack of familiarity with the work, \"not being trained enough\" as the cause for not being able to finish in a more timely manner. In general, overtime is something that is accepted as part of work, and protest against it is rare, due to concern for the reaction of colleagues, superiors and even family and friends.\n\n\"Seken\" (世間), or the \"public gaze\" (others' opinions about one's behavior) is a strong cultural factor in this. It is safe to assume that most statistics of overtime in Japanese companies are not accurate, since overtime is not recorded in many occasions. It is not uncommon for many Japanese employees to work late hours until 2-3am, and being expected to be in the office again at 9am. In some cases (especially in subsidiaries of big listed companies that have to cope with the pressure of parent companies, who generate margins through exploitation of daughter companies) employees have been reported to have worked 300 hours of overtime in a single month. These statistics are in almost all cases not official, and most employees would always refrain from making such statements to authorities or the press, nor would they agree to be named.\n\nIn China, the analogous \"death by overwork\" concept is guolaosi (Traditional:過勞死 Simplified:过劳死), which in 2014 was reported to be a problem in the country.\nIn Eastern Asian countries, like China, many businessmen work long hours and then feel the pressures of expanding and pleasing their networks. Making these connections is called building guanxi. Connections are a big part of the Chinese business world, and throughout different parts of China, businessmen would meet up in teahouses to take their job outside of the work atmosphere. It was important for businessmen to broaden their guanxi relationships, especially with powerful officials or bosses.\n\nThere is a lot of pressure to go to these nightclubs almost every night to drink heavily to move up in the business world. It has been shown that this kind of work could lead to health related problems down the line. For example, a businessman named Mr. Pan discussed with John Osburg, an anthropologist who wrote “Anxious Wealth: Money and Morality Among China's New Rich,” about his health and the need to continue working. Mr. Pan, the 'biggest boss in Chengdu,' was in the hospital for 'excessive drinking.' This has happened to him before. Mr. Pan said, “I can't stop or slow down. I have many people whose livelihoods depend on me (literally 'depend on me to eat.'). I've got about fifty employees and even more brothers. Their livelihoods depend on my success. I have to keep going.”\n\nIn South Korea, the term gwarosa (과로사) is also used to refer to death by overworking. South Korea has some of the longest working hours in the world, even more so than Japan with the average being 68. This has caused many workers to feel the pressure of their jobs which has taken a toll on both their physical and mental health. Many have died from being overworked and the issue has only begun to gain more national attention due to many government workers having died from gwarosa. In order to reduce many problems caused from overworking, the government enacted a law cutting the working hours from 68 to 52.\n\nThe French-German TV channel Arte showed a documentary called \"Alt in Japan\" (Old in Japan) on 6 November 2006 dealing with older workers in Japan. In 2008, \"karōshi\" again made headlines: a death back in 2006 of a key Toyota engineer who averaged over 80 hours overtime each month was ruled the result of overwork. His family was awarded benefits after his case was reviewed.\n\nTaiwanese media have reported a case of \"karōshi\". An engineer had worked for Nanya Technology for 3 years from 2006 to 2009. It was found that he died in front of his computer which was surrounded by company documents. The prosecution found that the engineer had died of cardiogenic shock. The engineer's parents said that he had usually worked for 16–19 hours a day. CNN shows another reported case of \"karōshi\" in Taiwan. This short clip called \"The Dangers of Overwork\" shows a man who suffered a stroke and was left for three hours until taken to the hospital. It was made known that physicians are starting to make people more aware of these health deficits due to overworking. More people have been visiting their doctor, recognizing these signs and symptoms.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n"}

A \"mythological\" figure does not always mean a \"fictional\" one, but rather, someone of whom stories have been told that have entered the cultural heritage of a people. Some women warriors are documented in the written record and as such form part of history (e.g. the Ancient Briton queen Boudica, who led the Iceni into battle against the Romans). However, to be considered a warrior, the woman in question must have belonged to some sort of military, be it recognized, like an organized army, or unrecognized, like revolutionaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonhelema was a Shawnee chieftess and sister of Cornstalk. She was known by white settlers as the Grenadier or Grenadier Squaw because of her height. She promoted an alliance with the Americans on the frontier in Ohio.\n\nWoman Chief (c. 1806 – 1858) was a Crow chief and war leader in the mid-19th century. Born to the Gros Ventre people, she was adopted into the Crow. She gained renown in battles and raids, and assumed leadership of her lodge when her father died, becoming a leading chief. She married four wives and later participated in peace negotiations after the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie.\n\nFallen Leaf (often called Woman Chief by the Americans): She was born to the Gros Ventre nation and taken captive by the Crow when she was 12. After she had counted coup four times in the prescribed Crow tradition, she was considered a warrior and chief and sat in the council of chiefs.\n\nRunning Eagle: she became a Blackfoot (Piegan) warrior after her husband was killed by the Crow.\n\nColestah: In the 1858 battle of Spokane Plains in Washington, Yakama leader Kamiakin's wife Colestah was known as a medicine woman, psychic, and warrior. Armed with a stone war club, Colestah fought at her husband's side. When Kamiakin was wounded, she rescued him, and then used her healing skills to cure him.\n\nBuffalo Calf Road Woman: In the 1876 battle of the Rosebud in Montana, Buffalo Calf Road (aka Calf Trail Woman), the sister of Comes in Sight, rode into the middle of the warriors and saved the life of her brother. Buffalo Calf Road had ridden into battle that day next to her husband Black Coyote. This was considered to be one of the greatest acts of valor in the battle.\n\nMoving Robe Woman: One of the best-known battles in the annals of Indian-American warfare is the 1876 Battle of the Greasy Grass in Montana where Lt.

For the movie, see \"The Legend of Suriyothai\".\n\nThao Thep Kasattri () and Thao Sri Sunthon () were styles awarded to Than Phuying Chan (), wife of the then recently deceased governor, and her sister, Khun Muk (), who defended Phuket Province in the late 18th century. According to popular belief, they repelled a five-week invasion by Burmaese in 1785, by dressing up as male soldiers and rallying Siamese troops. Chan and Muk were later honored by King Rama I with the Thai honorific \"Thao\", as Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Sri Sunthon, respectively. The \"Heroine's Monument\" honouring them is situated on the main highway (402) between the Phuket International Airport and Phuket town.\n\n\nThree historical women:\n\nTwo legendary women:\n\nThis Amazon is famous in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; some of the inhabitants dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in the centre of the floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go off the side of the wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix’d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.\n\nSimilar stories of a female warrior who hunted the now submerged land between the Outer Hebrides and St Kilda are reported from Harris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"From sunrise to the sundown no paragon had she.\n\n\n\n\nKhawlah bint al-Azwar was the daughter of one of the chiefs of Bani Assad tribe, and her family embraced Islam in its first days. The recorded history of that era mentions repeatedly the feats of Khawla in battles that took place in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Moslem army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her. She was a brunette, tall, slim and of great beauty, and she was also a distinguished poet.\n\nNusaybah bint Ka’ab, also known as Umm Ammarah (Ammarah's mother), a Hebrew woman by origin from the Banu Najjar tribe, was an early convert to Islam. Nusaybah was attending the Battle of Uhud like other women, and her intention was to bring water to the soldiers, and attend the wounded while her husband and son fought on the side of the Moslems. But after the Moslem archers disobeyed their orders and began deserting their high ground believing victory was at hand, the tide of the battle changed, and it appeared that defeat was imminent. When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism. During the battle her son was wounded and she cut off the leg of the aggressor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "618928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=618928", "title": "Monoculturalism", "text": "Monoculturalism\n\nMonoculturalism is the policy or process of supporting, advocating, or allowing the expression of the culture of a single social or ethnic group. It generally stems from beliefs within the dominant group that their cultural practices are superior to those of minority groups. In this context, it may also involve the process of assimilation whereby other ethnic groups are expected to adopt the culture and practices of the dominant ethnic group. Monoculturalism, in the context of cultural diversity, is the opposite of multiculturalism.\nRather than the suppression of different ethnic groups within a given society, sometimes monoculturalism manifests as the active preservation of a country's national culture via the exclusion of external influences. Japan, China, South Korea, and North Korea are examples of this form of monoculturalism. However it may also be the result of less intentional factors such as geographic isolation, historical racial homogeneity, or political isolation. For instance, some European countries such as Finland are still effectively monocultural because of the people's shared culture and ethnicity.\n\nThe idea of monoculturalism can be expanded to that of ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism being the idea that one's ethnic background is superior to that of others. A feeling of superiority is one that can project mono-cultural ideals in an attempt to justify intrinsic ways of thinking. In nations with a majority of the population being native, ethnocentrism is blindly put upon those of other cultural backings. The idea of ethnocentrism being combined with monoculturalism yields many examples from history. Most obvious is the Holocaust, but further from that is any instance of genocide or simple racism. In defining genocide you can find the correlation it has with monoculturalism, and how it can be a resultant of mono-cultural, as well as, ethnocentric thinking.\n\nIn many of the genocides practiced throughout history, some of them were based on ethnic supremacy. Ethnic supremacy is assumed by one group within a culture, following some distinct action by an external group or from one of the ethnic groups. With European intervention in places like Rwanda, social institutions worked to socially construct an ethnic inferiority, distinguishing the Hutu's and Tutsi's from one another and causing what would be one of the most horrific demonstrations of genocide in modern history.\n\nA similar example to that of the Rwandan Genocide was the ongoing civil war in Burma. The civil war spanned from a constitution that granted Burma their independence from England, in which a group of leaders created conditions that didn't involve many of Burma's Ethnic Minorities, and instigated a fight from them. Many of these ethnic minorities in Burma, including the Karen, have been significantly displaced by the military junta and placed into refugee camps in bordering nations. The remaining ethnic minorities have been living in poor conditions, and have been met by a variety of human rights abuses.\n\nGlobalization involves the free movement of goods, capital, services, people, technology and information throughout the world. It also involves the international integration of potentially very different countries through the adoption of the same or similar world views, ideologies, and other aspects of culture. Marsella argues that this is monoculturalism on a grand scale. Potentially it could lead to the suppression and loss of different ethnic cultures on a global scale.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5175110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5175110", "title": "Narrative history", "text": "Narrative history\n\nNarrative history is the practice of writing history in a story-based form. It tends to entail history-writing based on reconstructing series of short-term events, and since the influential work of Leopold von Ranke on professionalising history-writing in the nineteenth century has been associated with empiricism. The term \"narrative history\" thus overlaps with the term \"histoire événementielle\" ('event-history') coined by Fernand Braudel in the early twentieth century, as he promoted forms of history-writing analysing much longer-term trends (what he called the \"longue durée\").\n\nThough history is considered a social science, the story-based nature of history allows for the inclusion of a greater or lesser degree of narration in addition to an analytical or interpretative exposition of historical knowledge. It can be divided into two subgenres: the traditional narrative and the modern narrative.\n\nTraditional narrative focuses on the chronological order of history. It is event driven and tends to center upon individuals, action, and intention. For example, in regard to the French Revolution, a historian who works with the traditional narrative might be more interested in the revolution as a single entity (one revolution), centre it in Paris, and rely heavily upon major figures such as Maximilien Robespierre.\n\nConversely, modern narrative typically focuses on structures and general trends. A modern narrative would break from rigid chronology if the historian felt it explained the concept better. In terms of the French Revolution, a historian working with the modern narrative might show general traits that were shared by revolutionaries across France but would also illustrate regional variations from those general trends (many confluent revolutions). Also this type of historian might use different sociological factors to show why different types of people supported the general revolution.\n\nHistorians who use the modern narrative might say that the traditional narrative focuses too much on what happened and not enough on why and causation. Also, that this form of narrative reduces history into neat boxes and thereby does an injustice to history. J H Hexter characterized such historians as \"lumpers\". In an essay on Christopher Hill, he remarked that \"lumpers do not like accidents: they would prefer them vanish...The lumping historian wants to put all of the past into boxes..and then to tie all the boxes together into one nice shapely bundle.\"\n\nHistorians who use traditional narrative might say that the modern narrative overburdens the reader with trivial data that had no significant effect on the progression of history. They believe that the historian needs to stress what is consequential in history, as otherwise the reader might believe that minor trivial events were more important than they were.\n"}

Founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1924, the college offers more than 60 undergraduate majors and 24 graduate programs. Alumni and locals commonly refer to the school as \"Naz\" for short. \n\nAt the request of Bishop Thomas Francis Hickey of Rochester, five Sisters of St. Joseph founded Nazareth College of Rochester in 1924. The first class was composed of 25 young women who began their studies in a large mansion on Lake Avenue in Rochester, New York. The original mansion that housed the college was known as \"the Glass House.\" At that time, the college offered Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, each with a liberal arts core. In response to increasing enrollment, the college moved to a larger facility in 1928 at 402 Augustine Street.\n\nIn January 1942, the college moved to its present campus on East Avenue in the suburb of Pittsford. In the 1950s, the college responded to the need for graduate study by adding majors and by the 1970s offered programs in teacher education and social work. Study abroad programs and intercollegiate sports were also added in the 1970s. During this time, the college became co-educational and independent of the Roman Catholic Church. \n\nNazareth competed in men’s intercollegiate athletics for the first time in 1977. The official nickname of the sports teams became the Golden Flyers — golden for the Nazareth color, and flyers for the bird-like symbol that is part of the old Nazareth logo. Today, Nazareth supports 25 varsity teams. The most recent sport, added in 2018, is women's ice hockey.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the college purchased adjacent land from the Sisters of St. Joseph, including the former Motherhouse and Infirmary. This acquisition doubled the campus size to its current 150 acres. As a result of support from college benefactors (including Tom Golisano, the founder of Paychex), the Motherhouse became the Golisano Academic Center. The Infirmary became George Hall, a residence hall that also houses a coffeehouse and late night study area. The decade of the 2000s also saw the construction of additional student housing, including Portka Hall, Clock Tower Commons, and the Lyons and Breen apartment buildings.\n\nIn 2003, 30 years after becoming religiously independent, Nazareth College was removed from \"The Official Catholic Directory,\" having been declared no longer a Catholic institution by Rochester Bishop Matthew H. Clark. It was the second time since Pope John Paul II issued Ex Corde Ecclesiae, the apostolic constitution on Catholic universities in 1990, a bishop declared a historically Catholic college or university to be not Catholic.\n\nIn 2012, Nazareth added Peckham Hall, the Integrated Center for Math and Science. Named after lead donors Nancy and Larry Peckham, the $30 million facility supports majors in math and science fields, as well as education programs. It also provides important learning facilities for students in health and human services programs. \nIn 2015, the York Wellness and Rehabilitation Institute opened after an extensive renovation/expansion of Carroll Hall consolidated and doubled the size of the clinics associated with the college's School of Health and Human Services and added collaboration space.\n\nNazareth College is organized into four core schools:\n\nNazareth offers more than 60 four-year undergraduate programs, 20 master's degree programs, a Doctorate of Physical Therapy, and three post-baccalaureate certificate programs. \n\nUndergraduate Majors and Programs\n\nAccounting,\nActing,\nAmerican Studies,\nAnthropology,\nArt Education,\nArt History,\nArt (Studio Art), \nArt (Visual Communication Design),\nBiochemistry,\nBiology,\nBiomedical Sciences,\nBusiness Management,\nChemistry,\nChinese,\nClinical Laboratory Sciences,\nCommunication and Media,\nCommunication Sciences and Disorders (Speech Therapy),\nCommunity Youth Development,\nDance Studies,\nEconomics,\nEducation (Adolescence Education, Early Childhood and Elementary),\nEducation (Special Education),\nEnglish,\nEnvironmental Science and Sustainability,\nFinance,\nFrench,\nGuided Exploration of Majors (for undeclared majors)\nHistory,\nInternational and Global Studies,\nItalian,\nLaw (3+3 with Syracuse U.),\nLegal Studies,\nMarketing,\nMathematics,\nModern Foreign Languages,\nMuseums, Archives, and Public History,\nMusic,\nMusic/Business,\nMusic Composition,\nMusic Education,\nMusic Performance,\nMusic Therapy,\nMusical Theatre,\nNursing,\nNursing Accelerated Weekend R.N. to B.S.,\nOccupational Therapy,\nPeace and Justice,\nPhilosophy,\nPhysical Therapy,\nPolitical Science,\nPsychology,\nPublic Health,\nReligious Studies,\nSocial Science,\nSocial Work,\nSociology,\nSpanish,\nTechnical Production,\nTheatre Arts,\nToxicology,\nUndeclared program,\nWomen and Gender Studies.\n\nGraduate Programs\nAmerican Studies, \nArt Education, \nArt Therapy,\nBusiness Organization and Management, \nEducational Technology Specialist, \nESOL (post-master's certification program),\nHigher Education Student Affairs Administration, \nHuman Resource Development, \nHuman Resource Management, \nInclusive Adolescence Education (to teach grades 7-12), \nInclusive Childhood Education (to teach grades 1-6), \nInclusive Early Childhood Education (to teach birth-grade 2), \nIntegrated Marketing Communications, \nLeadership and Change Management, \nLiteracy Specialist, \nMusic Education, \nMusic Therapy, \nPerformance and Pedagogy, \nPhysical Therapy, \nSocial Work, \nSpeech-Language Pathology, \nTESOL (with and without N.Y. state teaching certification)\n\nCore curriculum\n\nIn 2013, Nazareth College revised its liberal arts core, required for all undergraduates.\n\nFulbright Program at Nazareth\n\nHonors Program\n\nClinton Global Initiative University\n\nIn fall 2013, Nazareth College joined the Clinton Global Initiative University Network (CGI U), a consortium of colleges and universities that support, mentor, and provide seed funding to student leaders who are developing solutions to the world's most pressing challenges. From 2014 to 2017, CGI U selected a total of 26 students from Nazareth College to attend its three-day international conference, based on the strength of the projects they proposed in health, education, youth empowerment, and the environment.\n\n\n\nRenovated in 2009, the Nazareth College Arts Center is a campus venue with spaces including:\n\nThe Nazareth College Arts Center is the home of Bach Children’s Chorus as well as the performance home of Rochester City Ballet and Garth Fagan Dance. The Arts Center houses the Nazareth College departments of Art, Music, and Theatre & Dance.\n\nThe Center for Interfaith Studies and Dialogue (CISD) at Nazareth College was founded in 2005. In 2011, International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) of Herndon, Virginia offered Nazareth a major gift, provided it was matched by local donors. Brian and Jean Hickey matched this gift, resulting in renaming the center the Hickey Center for Interfaith Studies and Dialogue at Nazareth College. The endowed chair of the Center was left to the IIIT, and they selected Dr. Muhammad Shafiq, who was imam of the Islamic Center of Rochester, the Rochester metropolitan area's largest mosque. The Center is part of Nazareth’s College of Arts and Sciences and located in the Golisano Academic Center. Dr. Muhammad Shafiq is the executive director of the Hickey Center for Interfaith Studies and Dialogue and a professor of Islamic and religious studies at the college.\n\nThe Casa Italiana (Italian House) is a center of Italian language, literature, and culture. It serves as a cultural center for the college and the Rochester metropolitan area. Built with the help of the Italian-American community of greater Rochester in 1978, the Casa promotes traditional and contemporary Italian culture, explores the Italian-American experience, and seeks to enhance exchanges between the United States and Italy. The reading room at the Casa provides the college and the community with language and culture resources, and the classroom provides an environment in which students and community members can study the Italian language. Cultural events organized by the Casa include lectures, cooking and language classes, film nights, conferences, concerts, seminars, symposia, bocce tournaments, art shows, and trips to Italy.\nLa Maison Française (French House) is a home converted into a cultural center and residence hall for 13 selected foreign language majors. The French House offers a living environment and resource center for students who wish to immerse themselves in French culture and practice speaking French. La Maison Française also offers a line-up of cultural events throughout the year. Such gatherings, which include French film nights, cultural and historical lectures, reader’s theater showcases, Francophone regional dinners and campus diversity dinners, occur on Thursday evenings and are prepared by the French department and the house residents.\n\nAt the heart of the Spanish program is the Casa Hispana, a lively place where students and community members enjoy films, conversation, art exhibitions, and a variety of events relating to the culture of Spain and the Latin American countries. The Casa also houses the offices of the Spanish program faculty, a library, and classrooms.\n\n\nNazareth's men's and women's athletic teams are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division III. The Golden Flyers are a member of the Empire 8 Athletic Conference (Empire 8). For men's volleyball, Nazareth is a member of the single-sport United Volleyball Conference and for men's ice hockey, a member of the United Collegiate Hockey Conference. Athletic facilities at Nazareth include the Robert A. Kidera Gymnasium (1,200) and Golden Flyer Stadium (2,200).\n\nMen's sports include basketball, cross country, equestrian, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, and volleyball; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, equestrian, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, volleyball, and dance. The College announced plans to add women's hockey in 2018.\n\nThe Nazareth men's lacrosse team is a three-time NCAA Division III National Champion (1992, 1996, and 1997). The team has also appeared in the NCAA postseason tournament nineteen times. In 2011, the Nazareth men's indoor volleyball team achieved a #1 national ranking and won the Molten Division III National Championship, while in 2013 they finished runner-up in the NCAA Division III championship to Springfield.\n\nNazareth College's traditional rival is St. John Fisher College, just a mile to the north. The annual men's basketball game between the schools is known as \"The Battle of the Beaks.\"\n\nMore than 95 percent of students are involved in community service through academic service-learning, student organizations, athletics, and residence life. Nazareth has an on-campus Center for Civic Engagement to serve as a resource for students, staff and faculty who want to learn and serve in the context of the local, regional, national and global communities. The Center is also a point of contact for community members seeking College involvement with local organizations, programs and projects.

{"id": "2711130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2711130", "title": "Nonlinear narrative", "text": "Nonlinear narrative\n\nNonlinear narrative, disjointed narrative or disrupted narrative is a narrative technique, sometimes used in literature, film, hypertext websites and other narratives, where events are portrayed, for example, out of chronological order or in other ways where the narrative does not follow the direct causality pattern of the events featured, such as parallel distinctive plot lines, dream immersions or narrating another story inside the main plot-line. It is often used to mimic the structure and recall of human memory, but has been applied for other reasons as well.\n\nBeginning a narrative \"in medias res\" (Latin: \"into the middle of things\") began in ancient times and was established as a convention of epic poetry with Homer's \"Iliad\" in the 8th century BC. The technique of narrating most of the story in flashback also dates back to the Indian epic, the \"Mahabharata\", around the 5th century BC. Several medieval \"Arabian Nights\" tales such as \"Sinbad the Sailor\", \"The City of Brass\" and \"The Three Apples\" also had nonlinear narratives employing the \"in medias res\" and flashback techniques, inspired by Indian tales like Panchatantra.\n\nFrom the late 19th century and early 20th century, modernist novelists Joseph Conrad, Virginia Woolf, Ford Madox Ford, Marcel Proust, and William Faulkner experimented with narrative chronology and abandoning linear order. \nExamples of nonlinear novels are:\n\nSeveral of Michael Moorcock's novels, particularly those in the Jerry Cornelius series, in particular \"\" (1972) and \"The Condition of Muzak\" (1977) are notable for extending the nonlinear narrative form in order to explore the complex nature of identity within a multiversal universe.\n\nScott McCloud argues in \"Understanding Comics\" that the narration of comics is nonlinear because it relies on the reader's choices and interactions.\n\nDefining nonlinear structure in film is, at times, difficult. Films may use extensive flashbacks or flashforwards within a linear storyline, while nonlinear films often contain linear sequences. Orson Welles' \"Citizen Kane\" (1941)—influenced structurally by \"The Power and the Glory\" (1933)—and Akira Kurosawa's \"Rashomon\" (1950) use a non-chronological flashback narrative that is often labeled nonlinear.\n\nExperimentation with nonlinear structure in film dates back to the silent film era, including D. W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" (1916) and Abel Gance's \"Napoléon\" (1927). Nonlinear film emerged from the French avant-garde[5] in 1924 with René Clair’s \"Entr'acte\", Dadaïst film and then in 1929 with Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí's \"Un Chien Andalou\" (English: \"An Andalusian Dog\"). The surrealist film jumps into fantasy and juxtaposes images, granting the filmmakers an ability to create statements about the Church, art, and society that are left open to interpretation. Buñuel and Dalí's \"L'Âge d'Or\" (1930) (English: \"The Golden Age\") also uses nonlinear concepts. The revolutionary Russian filmmakers Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Alexander Dovzhenko also experimented with the possibilities of nonlinearity. Eisenstein's \"Strike\" (1925) and Dovzhenko's \"Earth\" (1930) hint at a nonlinear experience. English director Humphrey Jennings used a nonlinear approach in his World War II documentary \"Listen to Britain\" (1942).\n\nJean-Luc Godard's works since 1959 were also important in the evolution of nonlinear film. Godard famously stated, \"I agree that a film should have a beginning, a middle and an end but not necessarily in that order\". Godard's \"Week End\" (French: \"Le weekend\") (1968), as well as Andy Warhol's \"Chelsea Girls\" (1966), defy linear structure in exchange for a chronology of events that is seemingly random. Alain Resnais experimented with narrative and time in his films \"Hiroshima mon amour\" (1959), \"L'Année dernière à Marienbad\" (1961), and \"Muriel\" (1963). Federico Fellini defined his own nonlinear cinema with the films \"La Strada\" (1954), \"La Dolce Vita\" (1960), \"8½\" (1963), \"Fellini Satyricon\" (1969), and \"Roma\" (1972), as did Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky with his modernist films \"The Mirror\" (1975) and \"Nostalghia\" (1983). Nicolas Roeg's films, including \"Performance\" (1968), \"Walkabout\" (1971), \"Don't Look Now\" (1973), \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\" (1976), and \"Bad Timing\" (1980) are characterized by a nonlinear approach. Other experimental nonlinear filmmakers include Michelangelo Antonioni, Peter Greenaway, Chris Marker, Agnès Varda, Raúl Ruiz, Carlos Saura, Alain Robbe-Grillet ...\n\nIn the United States, Robert Altman carried the nonlinear motif in his films, including \"McCabe & Mrs. Miller\" (1971), \"Nashville\" (1975), \"The Player\" (1992), \"Short Cuts\" (1993), and \"Gosford Park\" (2001). Woody Allen embraced the experimental nature of nonlinear narrative in \"Annie Hall\" (1977), \"Interiors\" (1978), and \"Stardust Memories\" (1980).\n\nIn the 1990s, Quentin Tarantino influenced a tremendous increase in the popularity of nonlinear films with \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992) and \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994). Other important nonlinear films include Atom Egoyan's \"Exotica\" (1994), Terrence Malick's \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998), Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Magnolia\" (1999), and Karen and Jill Sprecher's \"Thirteen Conversations About One Thing\" (2001). David Lynch experimented with nonlinear narrative and surrealism in \"Lost Highway\" (1997), \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), and \"Inland Empire\" (2006).\n\nIn the years leading into and the beginning of the 21st century, some filmmakers have returned to the use of nonlinear narrative repeatedly, including Steven Soderbergh in \"Schizopolis\" (1996), \"Out of Sight\" (1998), \"The Limey\" (1999), \"Full Frontal\" (2002), \"Solaris\" (2002), and \"Che\" (2008); and Christopher Nolan in \"Following\" (1998), \"Memento\" (2000), \"Batman Begins\" (2005), \"The Prestige\" (2006), \"Inception\" (2010), \"The Dark Knight Rises\" (2012), and \"Dunkirk\" (2017). \"Memento\", with its fragmentation and reverse chronology, has been described as characteristic of moving towards postmodernism in contemporary cinema. Another example would be Terrence Malick's acclaimed \"The Tree of Life\" (2011). The element of reverse chronology was explored further in Gaspar Noé's 2002 film \"Irréversible\". Noé's 2009 film Enter the Void also used an uncommon narrative structure as a man recalls his life through flashbacks at the time of his death, induced by the use of psychedelic drugs. Richard Linklater used nonlinear narrative in \"Slacker\" (1991), \"Waking Life\" (2001), and \"A Scanner Darkly\" (2006); Gus Van Sant in \"Elephant\" (2003), \"Last Days\" (2005), and \"Paranoid Park\" (2007). Alejandro González Iñárritu's film \"Babel\" is an example of fragmented narrative structure. Hong Kong auteur Wong Kar-wai explored nonlinear storylines in the films \"Days of Being Wild\" (1991), \"Ashes of Time\" (1994), \"Chungking Express\" (1994), \"In the Mood for Love\" (2000), and \"2046\" (2004). Fernando Meirelles in \"City of God\" and \"The Constant Gardener\". All of Alejandro González Iñárritu's films to date (aside from \"Birdman\") feature nonlinear narratives. Charlie Kaufman is also known for his fondness of nonlinear story-telling as applied in \"Adaptation.\" and \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\". Takashi Shimizu's Japanese horror series, \"Ju-on\", brought to America as \"The Grudge\", is also nonlinear in its storytelling (the only exception being \"The Grudge 3\"). Director Martin Koolhoven has made more movies with a nonlinear narrative, but the most notorious one is probably his controversial western \"Brimstone\", which premiered in the 2016 Venice Film Festival.\n\nIn American television, there are several examples of series that make use of nonlinear narrative in different forms and for different purposes. Some notable examples are \"Lost\", \"Breaking Bad\", \"The Walking Dead\", \"Once Upon a Time\", \"Arrow\", \"Orange Is the New Black\", and \"True Detective\". Even though it is often found in drama, some comedy shows use nonlinear narrative too, such as \"Arrested Development\" and \"How I Met Your Mother\". This kind of narrative is used in several ways. Some series only have certain nonlinear episodes, such as \"Penny Dreadful\" and \"The Leftovers\". Others use nonlinear storylines throughout the whole series, such as \"Lost\" and \"Arrow\". Other series use nonlinear narrative in the beginning of a season and then explore the past until they meet, such as \"Damages\" and \"Bloodline\".\n\nSome television series use nonlinear narrative in certain episodes to fully explore an important part of the main characters' past. An example is Showtime's horror drama \"Penny Dreadful\", which features one episode per season that is entirely devoted to exploring key moments in Vanessa Ives' (Eva Green) past. Another example is HBO's drama \"The Leftovers\", whose ninth episode is set in the past and explores the lives of the main characters before the critical event that drives the story took place. Fox's sci-fi series \"Fringe\", the Amazon original comedy-drama \"Transparent\" and the Netflix original comedy \"Grace and Frankie\" use this technique only in certain episodes too.\n\nThere are certain television series that use nonlinear narrative to explore the past - or future - of one or various characters throughout its whole run. The ABC television series \"Lost\" made extensive use of nonlinear story telling, with each episode typically featuring a primary storyline on the island as well as a secondary storyline from another point in a character's life, either past or future. So does The CW's series \"Arrow\" which, in every episode, features a storyline following the life of Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) stranded in an island and a main storyline five years later in which he goes back home and decides to become a vigilante. Using a similar storytelling technique, Netflix's original series \"Orange Is the New Black\" explores the lives of the main characters in prison and also some important part of their past before they became inmates. Another example is FX's horror-drama series \"The Strain\".\n\nSome television series use nonlinear narrative in the beginning of a season as a narrative hook, showing an intense or shocking event, and then extensively explore the past and the reasons that lead that event to happen. A notable example is the AMC drama series \"Breaking Bad\", which in the beginning of its final season showed a neglected and lonesome Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and then explored what had happened to him. This technique was also used in \"Breaking Bad\"'s Pilot and in its second season. Using the same formula, FX's Emmy Award winning legal drama \"Damages\" starring Glenn Close, begins each season with an intensely melodramatic event taking place and then traveling back six months earlier. Throughout the season, each episode shows events both in the past, present, and future that lead up to and follow said event. Netflix's original series \"Bloodline\" and ABC's crime drama \"How to Get Away with Murder\" use a similar storytelling technique.\n\nAnother reason why a television series uses nonlinear narrative is to better portray the way human memory recalls events. In its first season, the HBO anthology series \"True Detective\" used nonlinear narrative depicting the events that the main characters described and in the way they remembered them. Showtime's Golden Globe winning drama \"The Affair\" uses this narrative technique in the same way. However, by using unreliable narrators, this show emphasizes how differently two people recall the same events.\n\nIn its fourth and fifth season, AMC's post-apocalypctic drama \"The Walking Dead\" used nonlinear narrative extensively.\n\nEven though it is not common, some comedy also shows use nonlinear narrative. An example is the sitcom \"Arrested Development\" which, in its fourth season, made heavy use of nonlinear narrative, devoting each episode to explore the story of each of its characters separately.\n\nOther examples of nonlinear narrative in American television are: \"12 Monkeys\", \"A to Z\", \"Alcatraz\", \"American Horror Story\", \"Better Call Saul\", \"BoJack Horseman\", \"Daredevil\", \"Fargo\", \"The Flash\", \"FlashForward\", \"Forever\", \"Gotham\", \"Grounded for Life\", \"Hannibal\", \"Heroes\", \"House of Cards\", \"Once Upon a Time in Wonderland\", \"Person of Interest\", \"Pretty Little Liars\", \"The Returned\", \"Revolution\", \"Sense8\", \"The Vampire Diaries\" and \"Wayward Pines\".\n\nJapanese anime series sometimes present their plot in nonlinear order. In \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\", for example, the episodes were deliberately aired in non-chronological order. A more nonlinear example is \"Baccano!\", where every scene is displayed in non-chronological order, with most scenes taking place at various times during the early 1930s and some scenes taking place before (extending back to the 18th century) and after (extending forward to the 21st century). Other examples include \"Durarara!!\", \"Monogatari Series\", \"Yami to Bōshi to Hon no Tabibito\", \"Touka Gettan\", \"Rental Magica\", \"Ergo Proxy\", \"Fullmetal Alchemist,\" \"Axis Powers Hetalia\", \"Hidamari Sketch\", \"Mekakucity Actors\" and (partly) \"Boogiepop Phantom\".\n\nSome video games mimic film non-linearity by presenting a single plot in a chronologically distorted way instead of letting the player determine the story flow themselves. The first-person shooter \"\" is an example of this; another is Sega's \"Sonic Adventure\".\n\nA nonlinear plot structure may or may not be combined with branching:\n\nSome games tell their nonlinear story without the player being able to change any (or very little) of the plot structure. For example, \"Uncharted 2\" begins \"in medias res\", with the lead character in the aftermath of an accident that the player only reaches several hours of gameplay later.\n\nIndie game \"Fragments of Him\" also begins \"in medias res\" but, in addition to the nonlinear beginning, it later jumps between characters to build the story and character relationships in a nonlinear fashion, and a subtle branch means that players may see the stories in a different order if they walk into a different room at the beginning.\n\nIndie developers Dennaton Games use non-linear passages of time in their game Hotline Miami 2 in the same way Pulp Fiction is written. For example, some segments of the game take place before the events of the Prequel. It is used for dramatic effect in most cases, some characters have already had onscreen deaths but the player will not realise it until a later chapter of the character walking blindly to their already shown death.\n\nOften game developers use the idea of character amnesia in games. It helps give the game a beginning because the audience only has the understanding that there is a history before the events of the game take place. Furthermore, by creating a nonlinear storyline the complexity of game play is greatly expanded. Nonlinear game play allows for greater replay value, allowing the player to put together different pieces of a potentially puzzling storyline. A fitting example of character amnesia is the 2005 video game \"Façade\". In \"Façade\" the player is put into a situation that lasts approximately 10 to 15 minutes in real time, yet the events recalled seem to have a basis in years of dramatic history.\n\nIn contemporary society webpages or to be more correct, hypertext, have become affluent forms of narratives. Hypertexts have great potential to create non-linear forms of narratives. They allow for individuals to navigate within the story through links, images, audio and video. An established hypertext narrative is Public Secret. Public Secret illustrates the reality of being incarcerated in California's Criminal Justice System. It brings to light the way inmates are treated. This functions as a non-linear narrative because it allows for its audience to witness through text and audio the reality of being a female inmate. However, there is no exact beginning or end as there are in comic books or video games. This website consists of multiple subtopics that do not force the audience to make their next selection based on what their previous experiences are.\n\n"}

The platform is a gift economy; hosts are not allowed to charge for lodging.\n\nFree lodging via Pasporta Servo is one of the benefits of learning Esperanto.

{"id": "42649463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42649463", "title": "Passive fluency", "text": "Passive fluency\n\nPassive fluency is where a person can fluently read and audibly understand a language whilst not having the ability to fluently speak or write the language. Passive fluency is often brought about by being raised in one language (which becomes the person's passive language) and being schooled in another language (which becomes the person's native language).\n\nPeople who are passively fluent in a language are often latent speakers who were raised in an environment where the language was spoken but did not become native speakers.\n\nA more common term for this phenomenon is 'passive bilingualism'. Grosjean argues that there has been a monolingual bias regarding who is considered a 'bilingual', where people who do not have equal competence in all their languages are judges not speaking properly. 'Balanced bilinguals' are, in fact, very rare, and the fluency of a bilingual in his/ her languages is domain- specific: it depends on what they need the languages for. This means that speakers may not admit to their fluency in their passive language, despite the fact that there are social (extralinguistic) factors underlying their different competencies.\n\nKarlos Cid Abasolo discusses that passive bilingualism would be a minimum requirement for the co- official status of Basque and Spanish to become a working reality. As there are currently many monolingual Spanish speakers, and no monolingual Basque speakers, there is not yet a situation where an individual fluent in Basque could speak in his/ her mother tongue, regardless of the domain, circumstance or interlocutor.\n"}

It is based on multiple-identity, wherein people have multiple identities who belong to multiple groups with different degrees of identification. The term pluricultural competence is a consequence of the idea of plurilingualism. There is a distinction between pluriculturalism and multiculturalism.\n\nSpain has been referred to as a pluricultural country, due to its nationalisms and regionalisms.\n\n"}
{"id": "188949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188949", "title": "Quest", "text": "Quest\n\nA quest is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. The word serves as a plot device in mythology and fiction: a difficult journey towards a goal, often symbolic or allegorical. Tales of quests figure prominently in the folklore of every nation and ethnic culture. In literature, the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the hero, who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel. The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character). The object of a quest may also have supernatural properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The moral of a quest tale often centers on the changed character of the hero.\n\nThe hero normally aims to obtain something or someone by the quest, and with this object to return home. The object can be something new, that fulfills a lack in his life, or something that was stolen away from him or someone with authority to dispatch him.\n\nSometimes the hero has no desire to return; Sir Galahad's quest for the Holy Grail is to find it, not return with it. A return may, indeed, be impossible: Aeneas quests for a homeland, having lost Troy at the beginning of Virgil's \"Aeneid,\" and he does not return to Troy to re-found it but settles in Italy (to become an ancestor of the Romans).\n\nIf the hero does return after the culmination of the quest, he may face false heroes who attempt to pass themselves off as him, or his initial response may be a rejection of that return, as Joseph Campbell describes in his critical analysis of quest literature, \"The Hero With a Thousand Faces\".\n\nIf someone dispatches the hero on a quest, the overt reason may be false, with the dispatcher actually sending him on the difficult quest in hopes of his death in the attempt, or in order to remove him from the scene for a time, just as if the claim were sincere, except that the tale usually ends with the dispatcher being unmasked and punished. Stories with such false quest-objects include the legends of Jason and Perseus, the fairy tales \"The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird\", \"Go I Know Not Whither and Fetch I Know Not What\", and the story of Beren and Lúthien in J. R. R. Tolkien's \"Silmarillion\".\n\nThe quest object may, indeed, function only as a convenient reason for the hero's journey. Such objects are termed MacGuffins. When a hero is on a quest for several objects that are only a convenient reason for his journey, they are termed plot coupons.\n\nThe quest, in the form of the Hero's Journey, plays a central role in the Monomyth described by Joseph Campbell; the hero sets forth from the world of common day into a land of adventures, tests, and magical rewards. Most times in a quest, the knight in shining armor wins the heart of a beautiful maiden/ princess.\n\nAn early quest story tells the tale of Gilgamesh, who seeks a secret to eternal life after the death of Enkidu, including the search for an emerald.\n\nAnother ancient quest tale, Homer's \"Odyssey\", tells of Odysseus, whom the gods have cursed to wander and suffer for many years before Athena persuades the Olympians to allow him to return home. Recovering the Golden Fleece is the object of the travels of Jason and the Argonauts in the \"Argonautica\". Psyche, having lost Cupid, hunted through the world for him, and was set tasks by Venus, including a descent into the underworld.\n\nMany fairy tales depict the hero or heroine setting out on a quest, such as:\n\n\nOther characters may set out with no more definite aim than to \"seek their fortune\", or even be cast out instead of voluntarily leaving, but learn of something that could aid them along the way and so have their journey transformed from aimless wandering into a quest. Other characters can also set forth on quests — the hero's older brothers commonly do — but the hero is distinguished by his success.\n\nMany medieval romances sent knights out on quests. The term \"Knight-errant\" sprang from this, as \"errant\" meant \"roving\" or \"wandering\". Sir Thomas Malory included many in \"Le Morte d'Arthur\". The most famous—perhaps in all of western literature—centers on the Holy Grail in Arthurian legend. This story cycle recounts multiple quests, in multiple variants, telling stories both of the heroes who succeed, like Percival (in Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival) or Sir Galahad (in the Queste del Saint Graal), and also the heroes who fail, like Sir Lancelot. This often sent them into a bewildering forest. Despite many references to its pathlessness, the forest repeatedly confronts knights with forks and crossroads, of a labyrinthine complexity. The significance of their encounters is often explained to the knights—particularly those searching for the Holy Grail—by hermits acting as wise old men -- or women. Still, despite their perils and chances of error, such forests, being the location where the knight can obtain the end of his quest, are places where the knights may become worthy; one romance has a maiden urging Sir Lancelot on his quest for the Holy Grail, \"which quickens with life and greenness like the forest.\"\n\nSo consistently did knights quest that Miguel de Cervantes set his Don Quixote on mock quests in a parody of chivalric tales. Nevertheless, while Don Quixote was a fool, he was and remains a hero of chivalry.\n\nQuests continued in modern literature. Analysis can interpret many (perhaps most) stories as a quest in which the main character is seeking something that he desires, but the literal structure of a journey seeking something is, itself, still common. Quests often appear in fantasy literature, as in Rasselas by Samuel Johnson, or \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", where Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion go on a quest for the way back to Kansas, brains, a heart, and courage respectively. Quests, also, play a major role in Rick Riordan's fantasy books, among them \"Percy Jackson & the Olympians\", \"The Heroes of Olympus\", and \"The Kane Chronicles\".\n\nA familiar modern literary quest is Frodo Baggins's quest to destroy the One Ring in \"The Lord of the Rings\". The One Ring, its baleful power, the difficult method which is the only way to destroy it, and the spiritual and psychological torture it wreaks on its Bearer; J. R. R. Tolkien uses all these elements to tell a meaningful tale of friendship and the inner struggle with temptation, against a background of epic and supernatural warfare.\n\n\"The Catcher in the Rye\" is often thought of as a quest plot, detailing Holden's search not for a tangible object but for a sense of purpose or reason.\n\nSome writers, however, may devise arbitrary quests for items without any importance beyond being the object of the quest. These items are known as MacGuffins, which is sometimes merely used to compare quests and is not always a derogatory term. Writers may also motivate characters to pursue these objects by meanings of a prophecy that decrees it, rather than have them discover that it could assist them, for reasons that are given.\n\n"}
{"id": "16657200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16657200", "title": "Raptio", "text": "Raptio\n\nRaptio (in archaic or literary English rendered as rape) is a Latin term for the large-scale abduction of women, i.e. kidnapping for marriage or enslavement (particularly sexual slavery). The equivalent term Frauenraub, originally from German, is used in English in the field of art history.\n\nBride kidnapping is distinguished from \"raptio\" in that the former is the abduction of one woman by one man (and his friends and relatives), whereas the latter is the abduction of women by groups of men, possibly in a time of war.\n\nThe English word \"rape\" retains the Latin meaning in literary language, but the meaning is obscured by the more current meaning of \"sexual violation\". The word is akin to \"rapine\", \"rapture\", \"raptor\", \"rapacious\" and \"ravish\", and referred to the more general violations, such as looting, destruction, and capture of citizens, that are inflicted upon a town or country during war, e.g. the Rape of Nanking. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" gives the definition \"the act of carrying away a person, especially a woman, by force\" besides the more general \"the act of taking anything by force\" (marked as \"obsolete\") and the more specific \"violation or ravishing of a woman\".\n\nEnglish \"rape\" was in use since the 14th century in the general sense of \"seize prey, take by force\", from \"raper\", an Old French legal term for \"to seize\", in turn from Latin \"rapere\" \"seize, carry off by force, abduct\". The Latin term was also used for sexual violation, but not always. It is contested that the legendary event known as \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\", while ultimately motivated sexually, did not entail sexual violation of the Sabine women on the spot, who were instead abducted, and then implored by the Romans to marry them (as opposed to striking a deal with their fathers or brothers first, as would have been required by law).\n\nThough the sexual connotation is today dominant, the word \"rape\" can be used in a non-sexual context in literary English. In Alexander Pope's \"The Rape of the Lock\", the title means \"the theft of a lock [of hair]\", exaggerating a trivial violation against a person. In the twentieth century, the classically trained J. R. R. Tolkien used the word with its old meaning of \"seizing and taking away\" in his \"The Silmarillion\". The musical comedy \"The Fantasticks\" has a controversial song (\"It Depends on What You Pay\") about \"an old-fashioned rape\". Compare also the adjective \"rapacious\" which retains the generic meaning of greedy and grasping.\n\nIn Roman Catholic canon law, \"raptio\" refers to the legal prohibition of matrimony if the bride was abducted forcibly (Canon 1089 CIC).\n\nThe practice is surmised to have been common since anthropological antiquity. In Neolithic Europe, excavation of the Linear Pottery culture site at Asparn-Schletz, Austria, the remains of numerous slain victims were found. Among them, young adult females and children were clearly under-represented, suggesting that attackers had killed the men but abducted the nubile females.\n\nAbduction of women is a common practice in warfare among tribal societies, along with cattle raiding. In historical human migrations, the tendency of mobile groups of invading males to abduct indigenous females is reflected in the greater stability of Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups compared to Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups. \n\nThe Rape of the Sabine Women is an important part of the foundation legends of Rome (8th century BC). Romulus had established the settlement on the Palatine Hill with mostly male followers. Seeking wives, the Romans negotiated with the neighboring tribe of the Sabines, without success. Faced with the extinction of their community, the Romans planned to abduct Sabine women. Romulus invited Sabine families to a festival of Neptune Equester. At the meeting he gave a signal, at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men. The indignant abductees were implored by Romulus to accept Roman husbands. Livy claims that no sexual assault took place. He asserted that Romulus offered them free choice and promised civil and property rights to women. According to Livy he spoke to them each in person, \"and pointed out to them that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbours. They would live in honourable wedlock, and share all their property and civil rights, and—dearest of all to human nature—would be the mothers of free men.\" The women married Roman men, but the Sabines went to war with the Romans. The conflict was eventually resolved when the women, who now had children by their Roman husbands, intervened in a battle to reconcile the warring parties. The tale is parodied by English short-story writer Saki in \"The Schartz-Metterklume Method\". It also serves as the main plot of the movie \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\".\n\nIn Sanskrit literature, the practice is known as \"Rakshasa Vivaha\" (\"devil marriage\"), mentioned e.g. by Kautilya. It is one of the eight forms of Hindu marriage, the violent seizure or rape of a girl after the defeat or destruction of her relatives (Manu Smrti 3.33).\n\nIn the 3rd century, Gothic Christianity appears to have been initiated under the influence of Christian women captured by the Goths in Moesia and Thrace: in 251 AD, the Gothic army raided the Roman provinces of Moesia and Thrace, defeated and killed the Roman emperor Decius, and took a number of (predominantly female) captives, many of whom were Christian. This is assumed to represent the first lasting contact of the Goths with Christianity.\n\nIn the Qur'an, marriage to female prisoners of war who embraced Islam is recommended for those who cannot afford to marry other Muslim women according to Islamic law (Sura 4:25).\n\nMutual abduction of women between Christian and Muslim communities was common in the Balkans under Ottoman rule, and is a frequent theme in the Hajduk songs of the period.\n\n"}

Rituals have a prescribed form, source, and sequence that include sacred objects, places, times and seasons, music, dance, texts, songs and words, and mediators (such as monks, spirit mediums, religious leaders, and traditional healers). Ritualcide is not necessarily linked to genocide, but \"genocidal priming\" may gain a handhold when regimes tamper with collective tradition and leave inhabitants vulnerable and/or susceptible to spirit-based harm and angst. Herein ancestral pathways for intimate connection are often disrupted.\n\nThe term \"ritualcide\" was coined by Peg LeVine in \"Love and Dread in Cambodia: Weddings, Births and Ritual Harm Under the Khmer Rouge,\" which emerged from an eight-year ethnographic study into \"Khmer Rouge weddings\" and Cambodian ritual history before, during and after Democratic Kampuchea. The definition was expanded in 2015 when LeVine continued research at the Shoah Foundation, Center for Advanced Genocide Research. In October, 2016, ritualcide was introduced at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) in conjunction with Khmer Rouge activity between 1975 and 1979; when LeVine gave expert witness, she suggested it was a \"crime against culture\". She has shown how ritual loss complicates the aftermath of trauma for the living and the dead, and ruptures the cosmological order that binds ancestors. Also, without access to reliable, traditional ritual sources, collective fear and vulnerability increase for survivors. In genocide and Holocaust studies, ritual restoration holds relevance for recovery by survivors and ancestors, and their collective sense of protection and cultural continuity.\n"}
{"id": "1490408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1490408", "title": "Scrupulosity", "text": "Scrupulosity\n\nScrupulosity is characterized by pathological guilt about moral or religious issues. It is personally distressing, objectively dysfunctional, and often accompanied by significant impairment in social functioning. It is typically conceptualized as a moral or religious form of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), although this categorization is empirically disputable.\n\nThe term is derived from the Latin \"scrupulum\", a sharp stone, implying a stabbing pain on the conscience. Scrupulosity was formerly called \"scruples\" in religious contexts, but the word \"scruples\" now commonly refers to a troubling of the conscience rather than to the disorder.\n\nAs a personality trait, scrupulosity is a recognized diagnostic criterion for obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. It is sometimes called \"scrupulousness\", but that word properly applies to the positive trait of having scruples.\n\nScrupulosity is a modern-day psychological problem that echoes a traditional use of the term \"scruples\" in a religious context, e.g. by Roman Catholics, to mean obsessive concern with one's own sins and compulsive performance of religious devotion. This use of the term dates to the 12th century. Several historical and religious figures suffered from doubts of sin, and expressed their pains. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, wrote \"After I have trodden upon a cross formed by two straws ... there comes to me from without a thought that I have sinned ... this is probably a scruple and temptation suggested by the enemy.\" Alphonsus Liguori, the Redemptorists' founder, wrote of it as \"groundless fear of sinning that arises from 'erroneous ideas'\". Although the condition was lifelong for Loyola and Liguori, Thérèse of Lisieux stated that she recovered from her condition after 18 months, writing \"One would have to pass through this martyrdom to understand it well, and for me to express what I experienced for a year and a half would be impossible.\" Martin Luther also suffered from obsessive doubts; in his mind, his omitting the word \"enim\" (\"for\") during the Eucharist was as horrible as laziness, divorce, or murdering one's parent.\n\nAlthough historical religious figures such as Loyola, Luther and John Bunyan are commonly cited as examples of scrupulosity in modern self-help books, some of these retrospective diagnoses may be deeply ahistorical: these figures' obsession with salvation may have been excessive by modern standards, but that does not mean that it was pathological.\n\nScrupulosity's first known public description as a disorder was in 1691, by John Moore, who called it \"religious melancholy\" and said it made people \"fear, that what they do, is so defective and unfit to be presented unto God, that he will not accept it\". Loyola, Liguori, the French confessor R.P. Duguet, and other religious authorities and figures attempted to develop solutions and coping mechanisms; the monthly newsletter \"Scrupulous Anonymous\", published by the followers of Liguori, has been used as an adjunct to therapy. In the 19th century, Christian spiritual advisors in the U.S. and Britain became worried that scrupulosity was not only a sin in itself, but also led to sin, by attacking the virtues of faith, hope, and charity. Studies in the mid-20th century reported that scrupulosity was a major problem among American Catholics, with up to 25 per cent of high school students affected; commentators at the time asserted that this was an increase over previous levels.\n\nStarting in the 20th century, individuals with scrupulosity in the U.S. and Britain increasingly began looking to psychiatrists, rather than to religious advisors, for help with the condition.\n\nIn scrupulosity, a person's obsessions focus on moral or religious fears, such as the fear of being an evil person or the fear of divine retribution for sin. Although it can affect nonreligious people, it is usually related to religious beliefs. In the strict sense, not all obsessive–compulsive behaviors related to religion are instances of scrupulosity: strictly speaking, for example, scrupulosity is not present in people who repeat religious requirements merely to be sure that they were done properly.\n\nTreatment is similar to that for other forms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Exposure and response prevention (ERP), a form of behavior therapy, is widely used for OCD in general and may be promising for scrupulosity in particular. ERP is based on the idea that deliberate repeated exposure to obsessional stimuli lessens anxiety, and that avoiding rituals lowers the urge to behave compulsively. For example, with ERP a person obsessed by blasphemous thoughts while reading the Bible would practice reading the Bible. However, ERP is considerably harder to implement than with other disorders, because scrupulosity often involves spiritual issues that are not specific situations and objects. For example, ERP is not appropriate for a man obsessed by feelings that God has rejected and is punishing him. Cognitive therapy may be appropriate when ERP is not feasible. Other therapy strategies include noting contradictions between the compulsive behaviors and moral or religious teachings, and informing individuals that for centuries religious figures have suggested strategies similar to ERP. Religious counseling may be an additional way to readjust beliefs associated with the disorder, though it may also stimulate greater anxiety.\n\nLittle evidence is available on the use of medications to treat scrupulosity. Although serotonergic medications are often used to treat OCD, studies of pharmacologic treatment of scrupulosity in particular have produced so few results that even tentative recommendations cannot be made.\n\nTreatment of scrupulosity in children has not been investigated to the extent it has been studied in adults, and one of the factors that makes the treatment difficult is the fine line the therapist must walk between engaging and offending the client.\n\nThe prevalence of scrupulosity is speculative. Available data do not permit reliable estimates, and available analyses mostly disregard associations with age or with gender, and have not reliably addressed associations with geography or ethnicity. Available data suggest that the prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder does not differ by culture, except where prevalence rates differ for all psychiatric disorders. No association between OCD and depth of religious beliefs has been demonstrated, although data are scarce. There are large regional differences in the percentage of OCD patients who have religious obsessions or compulsions, ranging from 0–7% in countries like the U.K. and Singapore, to 40–60% in traditional Muslim and orthodox Jewish populations.\n\n"}

He originally referred to it as the \"7 Deadly Social Evils\". It's a common misconception that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was the origin of this list as he published the same list in his weekly newspaper \"Young India\" on October 22, 1925. Later he gave this same list to his grandson, Arun Gandhi, written on a piece of paper on their final day together shortly before his assassination. The Seven Sins are:\n\n\nBefore Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi published the list in his weekly newspaper \"Young India\" on October 22, 1925, an almost identical list had been published six months earlier in England in a sermon at Westminster Abbey by Fredrick Lewis Donaldson.\nGandhi wrote that a correspondent whom he called a \"fair friend\" had sent the list: \"The... fair friend wants readers of \"Young India\" to know, if they do not already, the following seven social sins,\" (the list was then provided). After the list, Gandhi wrote that \"Naturally, the friend does not want the readers to know these things merely through the intellect but to know them through the heart so as to avoid them.\" This was the entirety of Gandhi's commentary on the list when he first published it.\n\nIn the decades since its first publication, the list has been widely cited and discussed.\n\nSome books have focused on the seven sins or been structured around them:\n\n\nMany books have discussed the sins more briefly:\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have also been anthologized:\n\n\nRegarding \"politics without principle\", Gandhi said having politics without truth(s) to justly dictate the action creates chaos, which ultimately leads to violence. Gandhi called these missteps \"passive violence,\" ‘which fuels the active violence of crime, rebellion, and war.’ He said, \"We could work 'til doomsday to achieve peace and would get nowhere as long as we ignore passive violence in our world.\"\n\nPolitics is literally defined as, \"The struggle in any group for power that will give one or more persons the ability to make decisions for the larger group.\"\n\nMohandas Gandhi defined principle as, \"the expression of perfection, and as imperfect beings like us cannot practice perfection, we devise every moment limits of its compromise in practice.\" \n\nThere are many different types of regimes in the world whose politics differ. Based on Gandhi’s Blunder Politics without Principle, a regime type might be more of a root of violence than another because one regime has more principle than the other. Regimes have different types of fighting and aggression tactics, each desiring different outcomes.\n\nThis difference affects the actions taken by political heads in countries across the globe. Gandhi wrote, \"An unjust law is itself a species of violence.\" The aggression of one country on another may be rooted in the government's creation of an unjust law. For example, a war of irredentism fought for one state to reclaim territory that was lost due to a law promoting ethnic cleansing.\n\nPrinciple in one country could easily be a crime in another. This difference leads one to believe that the root of violence is inevitably present somewhere in the world. “Politics without Principle” will inevitably take place throughout time.\n\nThis list grew from Gandhi's search for the roots of violence. He called these \"acts of passive violence\". Preventing these is the best way to prevent oneself or one's society from reaching a point of violence, according to Gandhi.\n\nTo this list, Arun Gandhi added an eighth blunder, \"rights without responsibilities\". According to Arun Gandhi, the idea behind the first blunder originates from the feudal practice of Zamindari. He also suggests that the first and the second blunders are interrelated.\n\nMore recently Mohandas Gandhi's list of negative qualities has also been described by his grandson as \"Seven Blunders of the World\". Examples of description under this heading include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37235", "title": "Society", "text": "Society\n\nA society is a group of individuals involved in persistent social interaction, or a large social group sharing the same geographical or social territory, typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations. Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive culture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent of members. In the social sciences, a larger society often exhibits stratification or dominance patterns in subgroups.\n\nInsofar as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would not otherwise be possible on an individual basis; both individual and social (common) benefits can thus be distinguished, or in many cases found to overlap. A society can also consist of like-minded people governed by their own norms and values within a dominant, larger society. This is sometimes referred to as a subculture, a term used extensively within criminology.\n\nMore broadly, and especially within structuralist thought, a society may be illustrated as an economic, social, industrial or cultural infrastructure, made up of, yet distinct from, a varied collection of individuals. In this regard society can mean the objective relationships people have with the material world and with other people, rather than \"other people\" beyond the individual and their familiar social environment.\n\nThe term \"society\" came from the Latin word \"\", which in turn was derived from the noun \"socius\" (\"comrade, friend, ally\"; adjectival form \"socialis\") used to describe a bond or interaction between parties that are friendly, or at least civil. Without an article, the term can refer to the entirety of humanity (also: \"society in general\", \"society at large\", etc.), although those who are unfriendly or uncivil to the remainder of society in this sense may be deemed to be \"antisocial\". However, the Scottish economist, Adam Smith taught instead that a society \"may subsist among different men, as among different merchants, from a sense of its utility without any mutual love or affection, if only they refrain from doing injury to each other.\"\n\nUsed in the sense of an association, a society is a body of individuals outlined by the bounds of functional interdependence, possibly comprising characteristics such as national or cultural identity, social solidarity, language, or hierarchical structure.\n\nSociety, in general, addresses the fact that an individual has rather limited means as an autonomous unit. The great apes have always been more (\"Bonobo\", \"Homo\", \"Pan\") or less (\"Gorilla\", \"Pongo\") social animals, so Robinson Crusoe-like situations are either fictions or unusual corner cases to the ubiquity of social context for humans, who fall between presocial and eusocial in the spectrum of animal ethology.\n\nCultural relativism as a widespread approach or ethic has largely replaced notions of \"primitive\", better/worse, or \"progress\" in relation to cultures (including their material culture/technology and social organization).\n\nAccording to anthropologist Maurice Godelier, one critical novelty in society, in contrast to humanity's closest biological relatives (chimpanzees and bonobos), is the parental role assumed by the males, which supposedly would be absent in our nearest relatives for whom paternity is not generally determinable.\n\nSocieties may also be structured politically. In order of increasing size and complexity, there are bands, tribes, chiefdoms, and state societies. These structures may have varying degrees of political power, depending on the cultural, geographical, and historical environments that these societies must contend with. Thus, a more isolated society with the same level of technology and culture as other societies is more likely to survive than one in closer proximity to others that may encroach on their resources. A society that is unable to offer an effective response to other societies it competes with will usually be subsumed into the culture of the competing society.\n\nSociologist Peter L. Berger defines society as \"...a human product, and nothing but a human product, that yet continuously acts upon its producers.\" According to him, society was created by humans but this creation turns back and creates or molds humans every day. \n\nSociologist Gerhard Lenski differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication, and economy: (1) hunters and gatherers, (2) simple agricultural, (3) advanced agricultural, (4) industrial, and (5) special (e.g. fishing societies or maritime societies). This is similar to the system earlier developed by anthropologists Morton H. Fried, a conflict theorist, and Elman Service, an integration theorist, who have produced a system of classification for societies in all human cultures based on the evolution of social inequality and the role of the state. This system of classification contains four categories:\n\nIn addition to this there are:\n\nOver time, some cultures have progressed toward more complex forms of organization and control. This cultural evolution has a profound effect on patterns of community. Hunter-gatherer tribes settled around seasonal food stocks to become agrarian villages. Villages grew to become towns and cities. Cities turned into city-states and nation-states.\n\nMany societies distribute largess at the behest of some individual or some larger group of people. This type of generosity can be seen in all known cultures; typically, prestige accrues to the generous individual or group. Conversely, members of a society may also shun or scapegoat members of the society who violate its norms. Mechanisms such as gift-giving, joking relationships and scapegoating, which may be seen in various types of human groupings, tend to be institutionalized within a society. Social evolution as a phenomenon carries with it certain elements that could be detrimental to the population it serves.\n\nSome societies bestow status on an individual or group of people when that individual or group performs an admired or desired action. This type of recognition is bestowed in the form of a name, title, manner of dress, or monetary reward. In many societies, adult male or female status is subject to a ritual or process of this type. Altruistic action in the interests of the larger group is seen in virtually all societies. The phenomena of community action, shunning, scapegoating, generosity, shared risk, and reward are common to many forms of society.\n\nSocieties are social groups that differ according to subsistence strategies, the ways that humans use technology to provide needs for themselves. Although humans have established many types of societies throughout history, anthropologists tend to classify different societies according to the degree to which different groups within a society have unequal access to advantages such as resources, prestige, or power. Virtually all societies have developed some degree of inequality among their people through the process of social stratification, the division of members of a society into levels with unequal wealth, prestige, or power. Sociologists place societies in three broad categories: pre-industrial, industrial, and postindustrial.\n\nIn a pre-industrial society, food production, which is carried out through the use of human and animal labor, is the main economic activity. These societies can be subdivided according to their level of technology and their method of producing food. These subdivisions are hunting and gathering, pastoral, horticultural, agricultural, and feudal.\n\nThe main form of food production in such societies is the daily collection of wild plants and the hunting of wild animals. Hunter-gatherers move around constantly in search of food. As a result, they do not build permanent villages or create a wide variety of artifacts, and usually only form small groups such as bands and tribes. However, some hunting and gathering societies in areas with abundant resources (such as people of tlingit) lived in larger groups and formed complex hierarchical social structures such as chiefdom. The need for mobility also limits the size of these societies. They generally consist of fewer than 60 people and rarely exceed 100. Statuses within the tribe are relatively equal, and decisions are reached through general agreement. The ties that bind the tribe are more complex than those of the bands. Leadership is personal—charismatic—and used for special purposes only in tribal society. There are no political offices containing real power, and a chief is merely a person of influence, a sort of adviser; therefore, tribal consolidations for collective action are not governmental. The family forms the main social unit, with most members being related by birth or marriage. This type of organization requires the family to carry out most social functions, including production and education.\n\nPastoralism is a slightly more efficient form of subsistence. Rather than searching for food on a daily basis, members of a pastoral society rely on domesticated herd animals to meet their food needs. Pastoralists live a nomadic life, moving their herds from one pasture to another. Because their food supply is far more reliable, pastoral societies can support larger populations. Since there are food surpluses, fewer people are needed to produce food. As a result, the division of labor (the specialization by individuals or groups in the performance of specific economic activities) becomes more complex. For example, some people become craftworkers, producing tools, weapons, and jewelry. The production of goods encourages trade. This trade helps to create inequality, as some families acquire more goods than others do. These families often gain power through their increased wealth. The passing on of property from one generation to another helps to centralize wealth and power. Over time emerge hereditary chieftainships, the typical form of government in pastoral societies.\n\nFruits and vegetables grown in garden plots that have been cleared from the jungle or forest provide the main source of food in a horticultural society. These societies have a level of technology and complexity similar to pastoral societies. Some horticultural groups use the slash-and-burn method to raise crops. The wild vegetation is cut and burned, and ashes are used as fertilizers. Horticulturists use human labor and simple tools to cultivate the land for one or more seasons. When the land becomes barren, horticulturists clear a new plot and leave the old plot to revert to its natural state. They may return to the original land several years later and begin the process again. By rotating their garden plots, horticulturists can stay in one area for a fairly long period of time. This allows them to build semipermanent or permanent villages. The size of a village's population depends on the amount of land available for farming; thus villages can range from as few as 30 people to as many as 2000.\n\nAs with pastoral societies, surplus food leads to a more complex division of labor. Specialized roles in horticultural societies include craftspeople, shamans (religious leaders), and traders. This role specialization allows people to create a wide variety of artifacts. As in pastoral societies, surplus food can lead to inequalities in wealth and power within horticultural political systems, developed because of the settled nature of horticultural life.\n\nAgrarian societies use agricultural technological advances to cultivate crops over a large area. Sociologists use the phrase agricultural revolution to refer to the technological changes that occurred as long as 8,500 years ago that led to cultivating crops and raising farm animals. Increases in food supplies then led to larger populations than in earlier communities. This meant a greater surplus, which resulted in towns that became centers of trade supporting various rulers, educators, craftspeople, merchants, and religious leaders who did not have to worry about locating nourishment.\n\nGreater degrees of social stratification appeared in agrarian societies. For example, women previously had higher social status because they shared labor more equally with men. In hunting and gathering societies, women even gathered more food than men. However, as food stores improved and women took on lesser roles in providing food for the family, they increasingly became subordinate to men. As villages and towns expanded into neighboring areas, conflicts with other communities inevitably occurred. Farmers provided warriors with food in exchange for protection against invasion by enemies. A system of rulers with high social status also appeared. This nobility organized warriors to protect the society from invasion. In this way, the nobility managed to extract goods from “lesser” members of society.\n\nFeudalism was a form of society based on ownership of land. Unlike today's farmers, vassals under feudalism were bound to cultivating their lord's land. In exchange for military protection, the lords exploited the peasants into providing food, crops, crafts, homage, and other services to the landowner. The estates of the realm system of feudalism was often multigenerational; the families of peasants may have cultivated their lord's land for generations.\n\nBetween the 15th and 16th centuries, a new economic system emerged that began to replace feudalism. Capitalism is marked by open competition in a free market, in which the means of production are privately owned. Europe's exploration of the Americas served as one impetus for the development of capitalism. The introduction of foreign metals, silks, and spices stimulated great commercial activity in European societies.\n\nIndustrial societies rely heavily on machines powered by fuels for the production of goods. This produced further dramatic increases in efficiency. The increased efficiency of production of the industrial revolution produced an even greater surplus than before. Now the surplus was not just agricultural goods, but also manufactured goods. This larger surplus caused all of the changes discussed earlier in the domestication revolution to become even more pronounced.\n\nOnce again, the population boomed. Increased productivity made more goods available to everyone. However, inequality became even greater than before. The breakup of agricultural-based feudal societies caused many people to leave the land and seek employment in cities. This created a great surplus of labor and gave capitalists plenty of laborers who could be hired for extremely low wages.\n\nPost-industrial societies are societies dominated by information, services, and high technology more than the production of goods. Advanced industrial societies are now seeing a shift toward an increase in service sectors over manufacturing and production. The United States is the first country to have over half of its work force employed in service industries. Service industries include government, research, education, health, sales, law, and banking.\n\nThe term \"society\" is currently used to cover both a number of political and scientific connotations as well as a variety of associations.\n\nThe development of the Western world has brought with it the emerging concepts of Western culture, politics, and ideas, often referred to simply as \"Western society\". Geographically, it covers at the very least the countries of Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. It sometimes also includes Eastern Europe, South America, and Israel.\n\nThe cultures and lifestyles of all of these stem from Western Europe. They all enjoy relatively strong economies and stable governments, allow freedom of religion, have chosen democracy as a form of governance, favor capitalism and international trade, are heavily influenced by Judeo-Christian values, and have some form of political and military alliance or cooperation.\n\nAlthough the concept of information society has been under discussion since the 1930s, in the modern world it is almost always applied to the manner in which information technologies have impacted society and culture. It therefore covers the effects of computers and telecommunications on the home, the workplace, schools, government, and various communities and organizations, as well as the emergence of new social forms in cyberspace.\n\nOne of the European Union's areas of interest is the information society. Here policies are directed towards promoting an open and competitive digital economy, research into information and communication technologies, as well as their application to improve social inclusion, public services, and quality of life.\n\nThe International Telecommunications Union's World Summit on the Information Society in Geneva and Tunis (2003 and 2005) has led to a number of policy and application areas where action is envisaged.\n\nAs access to electronic information resources increased at the beginning of the 21st century, special attention was extended from the information society to the knowledge society. An analysis by the Irish government stated, \"The capacity to manipulate, store and transmit large quantities of information cheaply has increased at a staggering rate over recent years. The digitisation of information and the associated pervasiveness of the Internet are facilitating a new intensity in the application of knowledge to economic activity, to the extent that it has become the predominant factor in the creation of wealth. As much as 70 to 80 percent of economic growth is now said to be due to new and better knowledge.\"\n\nThe Second World Summit on the Knowledge Society, held in Chania, Crete, in September 2009, gave special attention to the following topics:\n\nPeople of many nations united by common political and cultural traditions, beliefs, or values are sometimes also said to form a society (such as Judeo-Christian, Eastern, and Western). When used in this context, the term is employed as a means of contrasting two or more \"societies\" whose members represent alternative conflicting and competing worldviews.\n\nSome academic, professional, and scientific associations describe themselves as \"societies\" (for example, the American Mathematical Society, the American Society of Civil Engineers, or the Royal Society).\n\nIn some countries, e.g. the United States, France, and Latin America, the term \"society' is used in commerce to denote a partnership between investors or the start of a business. In the United Kingdom, partnerships are not called societies, but co-operatives or mutuals are often known as societies (such as friendly societies and building societies).\n\n\n"}

Demos is an art historian and cultural critic who writes on contemporary art and visual culture, particularly in relation to globalization, politics, migration and ecology. Currently a Professor in the Department of History of Art and Visual Culture (HAVC) at UC Santa Cruz, and the founding director of the Center for Creative Ecologies, he is the author of several books, including \"Decolonizing Nature: Contemporary Art and the Politics of Ecology\" (Sternberg Press, 2016),\n\"The Migrant Image: The Art and Politics of Documentary during Global Crisis\" (Duke University Press, 2013), and \"Return to the Postcolony: Spectres of Colonialism in Contemporary Art\" (Sternberg Press, 2013). Previous to his current appointment, Demos taught at University College London between 2005-2015. \n\nDemos has also curated a number of art exhibitions, including \"Rights of Nature: Art and Ecology in the Americas\" in 2010 and \"Uneven Geographies: Art and Globalisation\" in 2015, both at Nottingham Contemporary (both co-curated with Alex Farqharson); \"Specters: A Cinema of Haunting\" at the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid in 2014; and \"Zones of Conflict\", at Pratt Manhattan Gallery in New York in 2008.\n\nDemos received his PhD in 2000 from Columbia University. His first book, which emerged from his doctoral thesis, was \"The Exiles of Marcel Duchamp\" (MIT Press, 2007). It situates Duchamp’s mixed-media projects, such as \"La Boîte-en-valise\", and his installations, including the 1938 Surrealist exhibition in Paris, in the context of the early twentieth century’s world wars and nationalist formations. The text argues that Duchamp’s practice brought about an aesthetic negotiation of the experiences of geopolitical dislocation.\n\nDemos’ work focuses on the intersection of contemporary art and politics (particularly in the areas of photography and moving-image art), and considers the ways that art is capable of inventing creative and critical approaches that analyze, defy, and provide alternatives to reigning political, social, and economic forms of neoliberal globalization. His recent writing investigates contemporary art’s relation to environmental crisis, and he recently guest-edited a special issue of the journal \"Third Text\" on \"Contemporary Art and the Politics of Ecology\" (no. 120, January 2013), and has written several essays on the subject, such as “The Post-Natural Condition” in \"Artforum\"\n\nThis book looks at contemporary artists who have turned to documentary practice in order to investigate the mobile lives of migrants, refugees, stateless persons, and the politically dispossessed. His analysis considers the work of artists from Europe, the United States, the Middle East, and North Africa, which portrays the frequently negative conditions of neoliberal globalization, and which connects viewers to the lived experiences of economic and political crisis. The text includes close readings of works by Steve McQueen, The Otolith Group, Emily Jacir, Hito Steyerl Ahlam Shibli, Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige, Ursula Biemann, Lamia Joreige, Rabih Mroué, Walid Raad, Yto Barrada, Ayreen Anastas and Rene Gabri, Goldin+Senneby. It argues that these artists propose innovative ways to approach a politics of social justice and equality, and historical consciousness, even while operating in an aesthetic domain that is post-representational and deterritorialized.\n\nThis text examines the video and photographic projects by Sven Augustijnen, Vincent Meessen, Zarina Bhimji, Renzo Martens, and Pieter Hugo. The book traces the work of these artists who have each travelled to former European colonies in Sub-Saharan Africa in recent years in order to investigate past and present traumas and injustices, resulting in projects that were also made around the time of the 50th anniversary of the independence of numerous African countries. Addressing the larger context of failed states, increasing socio-political and economic inequality, and the continuing US-led military campaigns for security, resources, and economic supremacy worldwide, the book contends that artists today are critically investigating the aesthetics and image systems of neoliberalism and global crisis. Arguing that the past colonial experience continues to haunt those living in the present, but lies repressed, the book considers these artists’ voyages as constituting a “reverse migration,” a return to the African postcolony, “which drives an ethico-political as well as an aesthetic set of imperatives: to learn to live with ghosts, but to do so more justly.” (back cover).\n\nDemos reads Birnbaum's video art in relation to media theory, postmodernist appropriation aesthetics, and the politics of feminism, and considers the pioneering attempts of the artist to develop the transformative capabilities of the medium of video.\n\nDemos' text analyses the artist’s installations and conceptual mixed-media pieces – such as his La Boîte-en-valise, which Duchamp called his “portable museum.” The book places these project in relation to the aesthetic and geopolitical dislocations of early twentieth-century nationalisms and world war.\n\nIn 2014, Demos was awarded the prestigious Frank Jewett Mather Award for art criticism from the College Art Association.\n\n\n"}

The term is related to \"tribe\", which traditionally refers to people closely associated in both geography and genealogy. Nowadays, it looks more like a virtual community or a personal network and it is often called global digital tribe. Most anthropologists agree that a tribe is a (small) society that practices its own customs and culture, and that these define the tribe. The tribes are divided into clans, with their own customs and cultural values that differentiate them from activities that occur in 'real life' contexts. People feel more inclined to share and defend their ideas on social networks than they would dare to say to someone face to face. For example, it would be ridiculous to 'poke' someone in real life.\n\nThe term \"tribe\" originated around the time of the Greek city-states and the early formation of the Roman Empire. The Latin term \"tribus\" has since been transformed to mean \"\"A group of persons forming a community and claiming descent from a common ancestor\" (Oxford English Dictionary, IX, 1933, p. 339, as cited in Fried, 1975, p. 7). As years passed by, the range of meanings have grown greater, for example, \"Any of various systems of social organization comprising several local villages, bands, districts, lineages, or other groups and sharing a common ancestry, language, culture, and name\" (Morris, 1980, p. 1369). Morris (1980) also notes that a tribe is a \"group of persons with a common occupation, interest, or habit,\" and \"a large family.\"\" Vestiges of ancient tribe communities were preserved in both large gatherings (like football matches) and in small ones (like church communities). Even though nowadays the range of groups referred to as tribal is truly enormous, it wasn't until the industrial society eroded the tribal gatherings of more primitive societies and redefined community. However, the existence of social media as we know it today is due to the post-industrial society that has seen the rapid growth of personal computers, mobile phones and the Internet. People now can collaborate, communicate, celebrate, commemorate, give their advice and share their ideas around these virtual clans that have once again redefined the social behaviour.\n\nThe first attempt of such social communities dates back to at least 2003, when tribe.net was launched.\n\nTribe Networks is the driving force behind tribe.net, which is a website similar to other social networking sites. Users can create their own profiles and join networks, called 'tribes', based on common interests. Moreover, members can post job offers and event recommendations. Tribe serves 50 metropolitan markets, its largest being the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York City. The firm was found in July 2003 by Mark Pincus, Paul Martino and Valerie Syme, with the goal of connecting local people for what Pincus described as \"an online cocktail party where people are getting leads through their friends. So people are there to have fun and connect and meet new people.\" Soon the site caught the attention of Knight Ridder, The Washington Post Company and blue chip venture firm Mayfield, which both totally invested around $6.3 million in venture capital. After three months of activity, Tribe brought together 48,000 registered users and 6,900 distinct tribes, earning revenue from job postings and class fields.\n\nNot only do Twitter tribes have mutual interests, but they also share potentially subconscious language features as found in the 2013 study by researchers from Royal Holloway University of London and Princeton. Dr. John Bryden from the School of Biological Sciences at Royal Holloway states that it is possible to anticipate which community somebody is likely to belong to, with up to 80 percent accuracy. This research shows that people try to join societies based on the same interests and hobbies. In order to achieve this, publicly available messages were sent via Twitter to record conversations between two or more participants. As a result, each community can be characterised by their most used words. This approach can enrich new communities detection based on word analysis in order to automatically classify people inside social networks. The methods of identification of tribes relied heavily on algorithms and techniques from statistical physics, computational biology and network science.\n\nA different approach is taken by Tribefinder. The system is able to identify tribal affiliations of Twitter users using deep learning and machine learning. The system establishes to which tribes individuals belong through the analysis of their tweets and the comparison of their vocabulary. These tribal vocabularies are previously generated based on the vocabulary of tribal influencers and leaders using keywords expressing concepts, ideas and beliefs. \n\nThe final step to make the system learn on how to associate random individuals with specific tribes consists of the analysis of the language these influential tribal leaders use through deep learning. In so doing, classifiers are created using embedding and LSTM (long short-term memory) models. Specifically, these classifiers work by collecting the Twitter feeds of all the users from the tribes that Tribefinder is training on. On these, embedding is applied to map words into vectors, which are then used as input for the following LSTM models. Tribefinder analyzes the individual’s word usage in their tweets and then assigns the corresponding alternative realities, lifestyle, and recreation tribal affiliation based on the similarities with the specific tribal vocabularies. \n\nThe research had four main stages on which it focused: background, results, conclusions and methods.\n\nThe language is a system of communication consisting of sounds, words, and grammar, or the system of communication used by people in a particular country or type of work. Language is perhaps the most important characteristic that distinguishes human beings from other animals. In addition, it has a wide range of social implications that can be associated with social or cultural groups. People usually group in communities with the same interests. This will result in a variation of the words they use because of the differentiation of terms from each domain. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study would be that this variation should closely match the community structure of the network. To test this theory, around 250,000 users from the social networking and microblogging site Twitter were monitored in order to analyse whether the groups identified had the same language features or not. As Twitter uses unstructured data and users can send messages to any other users, the study had to be based on complex algorithms. These algorithms had to determine the word frequency inside messages between people and make a link to the groups they usually visited.\n\nThe problem of detecting the community features is one of the main issues in the study of networking systems. Social networks naturally tend to divide themselves into communities or modules. However, some world networks are too big so they must be simplified before information can be extracted. As a result, an effective way of dealing with this drawback for smaller communities is by using \"modularity\" algorithms in order to partition users into even smaller groups. For larger ones, a more efficient algorithm called 'map equation' decomposes a network into modules by optimally compressing a description of information flows on the network. Each community was therefore characterised according to the words they used the most, based on a ranking algorithm. To determine the significance of word usage differences, word endings and word lengths were also measured and showed that the pattern found was the correct one. Moreover, these studies also helped in predicting community membership of users, by comparing their own word frequencies with community word usage. This helped in forecasting which community a certain user is going to access based on the words that they are using.\n\nThe aim of this research was to study the bond between community structure in a social network environment and language use within the community . The striking pattern that was found suggests that people from different clans tend to use different words based on their own interests and hobbies. This study can show how people make friends based on the same vocabulary range that they use. Even though this approach didn't manage to cover all people inside Twitter, it has several advantages over ordinary surveys that cover a smaller scale of groups: it is systematic, it is non-intrusive and it easily produces large volumes of rich data. Moreover, other cultural characteristics can be found out when extending this study. For example, whether individuals that belong to multiple communities use different word sets in each of them.\n\nA process called snowball-sampling helped forming the sample network. Each user's tweets and messages were recorded and any new users referenced were added to a list from where they were picked to be sampled. Messages that were copies have been ignored. In order to find out the words that characterise each clan, the fraction of people that use a certain word was compared with the fraction of people that use that word globally. The difference between communities has also been measured by comparing the relative word usage frequency. Last but not least, individual word usage was compared with each community word usage to pick the best matching clan for individual users.\n\nWords, and the way we spell them are in a continuous change, as we find new ways to communicate. Despite the fact that traditional dictionaries don't take into account the changes, online ones have adopted many of them. An interesting fact outlined in the research above is that communities tend to use their own misspelt words. According to Professor Vincent Jansen from Royal Holloway communities would misspell words in different ways, just as people have different regional accents. For example, Justin Bieber fans tend to end words in \"ee\" as in \"pleasee\", while school teachers tend to use long words. Moreover, the largest group found in the study was composed of African Americans who were using the words \"nigga\", \"poppin\", and \"chillin\". Members of this community also had the common habit of shortening the ends of the words, replacing \"ing\" with \"in\" and \"er\" with \"a\".\n\nEach tribe has an online-platform (such as Flickr or Tumblr), called campfire around which they gather. These campfires tend to enable one or more of the following three tribal activities:\nHowever, some brands are building their own tribes around platforms outside of these.\n\nCooperation is the action of working together to the same end. Cooperation developed naturally over time, as it helped companies to streamline their research costs and to better answer to users' requirements. As a result, nowadays organisations are looking for flexible structures that can easily adapt to this rapidly changing environment. Groupware systems perfectly cater to these needs of companies. Informal communication predominates and specialists in certain domains exchange their experience with other people within the groupware environment. Collaboration and cooperation are available through instant messages; people can discuss, chat and swap ideas. Moreover, people can work together while they are located remotely from each other. Groupware can be split into three categories: communication, collaboration and coordination, depending on the level of cooperation and technology involved in the process. One of the biggest and well-known cooperation software is Wikipedia.\nWikipedia is a collaborative software because anyone can edit it. You can edit articles, view past revisions and discuss through a forum the current state of each article. Due to the fact that anyone can change it and find information very quickly, it has become one of the 10 most accessed sites on the Internet.\n\nWikipedia has many advantages over other encyclopedias:\n\nHowever, there are also some drawbacks:\n\nCommunication is the act or an instance of communicating; the imparting or exchange of information, ideas, or feelings. Communication has drastically changed over time and social networks have changed the way people communicate. Even though people]can interact with each other 24/7, there is a new wave of barriers and threats. In the workplace environment, electronic Communication has overtaken face-to-face and voice-to-voice Communication by far. This major shift has been done in advantage of Generation Y, who prefer instant messaging than talking directly to someone. It is often said that it could become an ironic twist, but social media has the real potential of making us less social. However, there are studies that confirm that people are becoming more social, but the style in which they interact with each other has changed a lot. One of the major drawbacks of social networks is privacy, as people tend to trust others more rapidly and send more open messages about themselves. As a result, personal information can be easily exposed to other persons. Twitter and Facebook are two of the biggest social networks in the world.\n\nFacebook is currently the largest social network in the world with more than 1 billion people using this website. This actually means that one in seven people on Earth use Facebook. Facebook users share their stories, images and videos in order to celebrate and commemorate events together. They can also play social games and like other Facebook pages. Moreover, there is also a section called \"News Feed\" where users can see social information from their friends or from the pages that they liked or shared. Each user has their own profile page that is called 'wall', where they can post all the above-mentioned materials (their friends can do this as well). The biggest advantage of Facebook is that you can make new friends, as well as find old acquaintances and restart socialising with them. One of the most useful feature of Facebook is the existence of groups. Users with the same interests can create a new group or take part in already existing ones to debate information and exchange their ideas. However, there are also groups that are created to declare an affiliation, such as an obsession for different subjects.\n\nTwitter is another social network that allows users to send and read short messages called 'tweets'. Even though messages can contain only 140 characters, this is the perfect length for sending status updates to followers. The main advantage of Twitter is that people can gain followers quickly and share ideas and links very fast. There are networks of influential people who can be connected via Twitter. On Twitter, tribes manifest themselves as followers of either a person, a company or an institution. As a result, it can be used as a marketing tool to make someone's product visible, on condition that a big tribe of followers is created. In order to do this, the right community must be built, as finding the right people can be a challenge. There are some steps that users could take into account in order to make connections and therefore make people follow them: search using Twitter search, follow the followers of other users, look at Twitter Lists, use #Hashtags and find third-party programs.\n\nCognition is the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience and senses. People like to share their ideas and gather together via blogs. A blog is an online journal where people express themselves and want to get their voice heard. People tend to frequent blog communities due to the fact that they offer specific information in which the reader is interested. There are also business blogs that can be used to share information within a company. These can be used as a flexible medium, where employees can be informed about topics that can range from the use of new technology to the company policies. On blogs, people tend to gather in tribes or clans if they find information that can satisfy their interests. In order to accomplish this goal, bloggers title their postings in such way that they can catch people's attention. The biggest advantage of blogs is that bloggers tend to help each other when someone feels at a loss due to the fact that some bonds might have been created inside the community.\n\nAs Seth Godin states, \"The Internet eliminated geography\". People join tribes or clans because they find and share the same ideas and interests with other people. The main disadvantage of old tribes is that they couldn't influence group behaviour. On the other hand, new tribes are self-sustaining and can survive without a leader, they are not necessarily dialogue based and they are long lasting. As it has been demonstrated within this article, tribes have influenced the way languages, organisations and cultures work. They have redefined old concepts with the help of social media and have changed the way people will interact in the future.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "286347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286347", "title": "Turkology", "text": "Turkology\n\nTurkology (or Turcology) is a complex of humanities sciences studying languages, history, literature, folklore, culture, and ethnology of people speaking Turkic languages and Turkic peoples in chronological and comparative context. This includes ethnic groups from the Sakha in East Siberia to the Balkan Turks and Gagauz in Moldova.\n\nEthnological information on Turkic tribes for the first time was systemized by the 11th-century Turkic philologist Mahmud al-Kashgari in the \"Dīwān ul-Lughat it-Turk\" (Dictionary of Turkic language). Multi-lingual dictionaries were compiled from the late 13th century for the practical application of participants in international trade and political life: Kipchak (Cuman)-Persian-Latin-German \"Codex Cumanicus\", \"Armenian-Kipchak\", and \"Russian-Kipchak\" dictionaries. By the Middle Ages the Turkology was centred around Byzantine/Greek historians, ambassadors and travelers, and geographers. In the 15th-17th centuries the main subject of Turkology was the study of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish language, and the Turkic languages of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. In 1533 a first hand-written primer appeared, and by 1612 a printed grammar by Jerome Megizer was published, followed by F. Mesgnien-Meninski's 4-volume \"Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalium\" published in 1680.\n\nP. S. Pallas initiated a more scientific approach to Turkology with his \"Comparative dictionaries of all languages and dialects\" (1787) which included lexical materials from Tatar, Mishar, Nogai, Bashkir, and other Türkic languages. In the 19th century, Turkology was further developed by M. A. Kazembek's \"Grammar of the Turkish-Tatar language\" (1839), O. N. Betlingk \"Grammar of the Yakut language\" (1851). A major achievement was the deciphering at the end of the 19th century of the Early Middle Age Orkhon inscriptions by V. Thomsen and W. W. Radloff (1895). By the end of the 19th century, Turkology developed into a complex discipline that included linguistics, history, ethnology, archeology, arts and literature. In the 20th century the Turkology complex included physical anthropology, numismatics, genetics, ancient Turkic alphabetic scripts, typology, genesis, and etymology, onomastics and toponymy. The appearance of \"Türkische Bibliothek\" (1905–27) inaugurated specialised periodicals, followed by \"Mitteilungen zur Osmanischen Geschichte\" (1921–26). Scientific developments allowed calibrated dating, dendrochronology, metallurgy, chemistry, textile, and other specialized disciplines which contributed to the development of the Turkological studies. Deeper study of the ancient sources allowed better understanding of economical, social, mythological and cultural forces of the sedentary and nomadic societies. Linguistic studies uncovered pre-literate symbioses and mutual influences between different peoples.\n\nOn 9 August 1944 the Central Committee VKP(b), the ruling party of the USSR, published an edict prohibiting \"ancientization\" of Turkic history. The edict was followed by a consecutive wave of mass arrests, imprisoning and killing of the intelligentsia, massive creation of replacement \"scientists\", and re-writing of history pages on an industrial scale. Combined with the concurrent wholesale deportation of indigenous populations to remote areas in Middle Asia and Siberia, the wipe-out of the science was nearly complete, and the impact of the action subsided only partially in the newly independent countries after the collapse of the USSR. In the two decades after the Bolshevik's assuming power, the tradition of Turkological studies in Russia and dependent countries was practically wiped out.\n\nOn the other hand, this edict brought unintended benefits to Turkology. One was the nearly immediate linguistic development of an alternate lexicon which replaced the nouns and adjectives containing the word \"Türk\" by a wealth of euphemisms: \"nomads, Siberians, Paleosiberians, Middle Asians, Scythians, Altaians, Tuvians\", etc. that filled scientific publications. The other was \"writing into a drawer\", when results of the years of fruitful work were written down for future publication. When the bonds relaxed, the publications exploded. Another was a flight of scientists from European Russia into remote areas, which brought first class scientists to many intellectually starved outlying areas of Middle Asia. Another one was connected with the statewide efforts to re-invent the history, when a wealth of Turkological facts were found in the process of search for \"correct\" history. And another one was a built-up of the public interest for the forbidden subjects, that resulted that no print size could satisfy the demand. L.N.Gumilev and O.Suleimenov inflamed a surge in the new generation of Turkology scholars.\n\nWith the physical culling of the scholars from the society, concurrently was also organized a total extermination of all their published and unpublished works, their books were removed from the libraries and destroyed from private collections by intimidated population, articles and publications were culled, published photographs were retouched, private photographs were destroyed, published scientific references were erased, or publications with undesired references were destroyed. Very few of the early 20th century expedition diaries, ethnographical notes, reports and drafts for publications were ever recovered.\n\n\n\nA selection of English-language periodicals studying Turkology\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4444344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4444344", "title": "Vignette (literature)", "text": "Vignette (literature)\n\nIn a novel, theatrical script, screenplay, sketch stories, and poetry, a vignette (, ) is a short impressionistic scene that focuses on one moment or character and gives a trenchant impression about that character, an idea, setting, and/or object. It is a short, descriptive passage, more about evoking meaning through imagery than about plot.\n\nA blog or web series can also provide a form of vignette or be presented as a series of vignettes. An example of this is the critically acclaimed web series \"High Maintenance\", which presents a different set of characters in each episode, focusing intensely on their specific traits, ideas, and worlds.\n\nVignettes are more commonly used and have been particularly influential in the development of the contemporary notions of a scene as shown in postmodern theater, film and television, where less emphasis is placed on adhering to the conventions of traditional structure and story development. It is also a part of something bigger than itself: for example, a vignette about a house belonging to a collection of vignettes or a whole story, such as \"The House On Mango Street\", by Sandra Cisneros.\n\nThe word \"vignette\" means \"little vine\" in French, and the name of the literary form comes from the drawings of little vines that nineteenth-century printers used to decorate the title pages and beginnings of chapters.\n\n"}
{"id": "25456170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25456170", "title": "Vortextuality", "text": "Vortextuality\n\nVortextuality is a concept developed in the work of Garry Whannel, an academic thinker working in the area of the cultural analysis of media sport. Whannel uses this concept in his work to analyse and account for the ways in which some news stories acquire a rapid momentum, briefly dominating the mediascape and the blogosphere.\n\nIn his book, \"Media Sport Stars, Masculinities and Moralities\", he explained this term, noting:\"The growth in the range of media outlets, and the vastly increased speed of circulation of information have combined to create the phenomenon of a \"vortex\" effect\".\n\nThe vortextual effect produces a compression of the media agenda, in which other news items disappear from the agenda or have to be connected in some way to the dominant event. Developing this idea, Whannel observed that:\n\"Various media constantly feed off each other and, in an era of electronic and digital information exchange, the speed at which this happens has become very rapid. Certain super-major events come to dominate the headlines to such an extent that it becomes temporarily difficult for columnists and commentators to discuss anything else. They are drawn in, as if by a vortex.\"\nWhannel gives the example of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales as an example of Vortextuality as this story dominated the media for days, to the extent that it removed most other items from the news agenda. Likewise, during global sporting events, such as the World Cup or the Olympic Games, journalists and columnists with no expertise or pre-existing interest in sport comment on the event as Marshal et al. (2010) point out. Recent examples, of media vortextuality include the election of Barack Obama and the death of Michael Jackson.\n\n"}
{"id": "53265623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53265623", "title": "White savior", "text": "White savior\n\nThe term white savior, sometimes combined with savior complex to write white savior complex, refers to a white person who acts to help non-white people, with the help in some contexts perceived to be self-serving. The role is considered a modern-day version of what is expressed in the poem \"The White Man's Burden\" (1899) by Rudyard Kipling. The term has been associated with Africa, and certain characters in film and television have been critiqued as white savior figures. Writer Teju Cole combined the term and \"industrial complex\" (derived from military-industrial complex and similarly applied elsewhere) to coin \"White Savior Industrial Complex\".\n\nAfrica has a history of slavery and of colonization. Damian Zane of BBC News said due to the history, Africans find the \"white savior\" attitude to help them \"deeply patronising and offensive\". Zane said, \"Some argue that aid can be counter-productive, as it means African countries will continue to rely on outside help.\" Bhakti Shringarpure, writing for \"The Guardian\", said, \"Westerners trying to help poor, suffering countries have often been accused of having a 'white saviour complex': a term tied up in colonial history where Europeans descended to 'civilise' the African continent.\" \"The Washington Post\"s Karen Attiah said the white savior framework in Africa \"follows the venerable tradition\" of the novella \"Heart of Darkness\" (1899) by Joseph Conrad and that the tradition included the film \"Machine Gun Preacher\" (2011), the public relations campaign related to the documentary \"Kony 2012\" (2012), and the writings of journalist Nicholas Kristof.\n\nActor and producer Louise Linton wrote a memoir about her gap year in Zambia, \"In Congo's Shadow\", and wrote an article for \"The Telegraph\", \"How my dream gap year in Africa turned into a nightmare\", to promote the book. Michael Schaub of \"Los Angeles Times\" said, \"The reaction to Linton's article was swift and negative, accusing her of using clichés and misrepresentations... Several people have described Linton's memoir as a 'white savior' fantasy.\" Zambians and other Africans negatively criticized the article on social media. Attiah said the popular Instagram account \"BarbieSavior\" was inspired by the backlash to Linton's words. Special Broadcasting Service's Amal Awad said the Instagram account was parodied \"a reckless trend\" of voluntourism (volunteering and touring) in which \"'white saviours' use the less fortunate like props in their social media profiles\". Awad said the interest in volunteering encouraged a business model that leverages a country's existing social issues and charges tourists for volunteering to be a \"saviour\".\n\nBaaz, Gondola, Marijnen, and Verweijen, writing in \"Foreign Affairs\", were critical of the \"white savior complex\" in the 2014 documentary \"Virunga\", which features the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Virunga National Park and the conservation work of its park rangers. They said, \"The movie features endless footage of a park guard hugging and playing with the gorillas, evoking the notion of the 'noble savage' who is close to nature, honest and naive, and dependent on the white man for his salvation. Rarely do we see the Congolese exercising political agency, even though there are numerous civil society activists in the region, often working at great personal risk.\"\n\nIn film, the white savior is a cinematic trope in which a white character rescues people of color from their plight. The white savior is portrayed as messianic and often learns something about themselves in the process of rescuing. The trope reflects how media represents race relations by racializing concepts like morality as identifiable with white people over nonwhite people. White saviors are often male and are sometimes out of place in their own society until they lead minorities or foreigners. \"Screen Saviors: Hollywood Fictions of Whiteness\" labels the stories as fantasies that \"are essentially grandiose, exhibitionistic, and narcissistic\". Types of stories include white travels to \"exotic\" Asian locations, white defense against racism in the American South, or white protagonists having \"racially diverse\" helpers.\n\nStephanie Greco Larson, writing in \"Media & Minorities: The Politics of Race in News and Entertainment\", said \"Diff'rent Strokes\" (1978–1986) and \"Webster\" (1983–1987) were \"shows in which white families adopt black children\" and represented versions of \"the white man's burden theme on television\". Robin R. Means Coleman said, \"In these comedies, Black children are rescued from their dysfunctional families or communities by Whites.\" In particular, \"Diff'rent Strokes\" featured the white millionaire character Philip Drummond. Film historian Donald Bogle said, \"The millionaire Drummond becomes a \"great white father figure\", able to provide the material comforts (as well as the subliminal emotional ones) and the cultural milieu that the Black community supposedly could never hope to match.\" Dustin Tahmahkera writes that Coleman labeled Drummond a \"white savior\" type who uses \"his representational power to save the day by determining a conflict resolution that appeases all parties\" including the indigenous representative Longwalker in the episode \"Burial Ground\". Tahmahkera also said a 1985 episode of \"Punky Brewster\" featured the girl protagonist telling a ghost story about her alter-ego Princess Moon helping \"ancient Indians [who] suddenly appear... as cave dwellers who need a white savior... to defeat an evil spirit and help keep their \"Last of the Dogmen\"-like secret existence intact.\"\n\nLarson said, \"Inner-city schools have been the site of white man's burden dramas on television for decades\" with TV series featuring white savior teachers. Larson identified the following series with such teachers: \"Room 222\" (1969–1974), \"Welcome Back, Kotter\" (1975–1979), \"The White Shadow\" (1978–1981), and \"Boston Public\" (2000–2004). Larson said while \"Room 222\" and \"Boston Public\" also had black teachers that \"challenge the assumption that blacks are inherently inferior... these shows continue to avoid laying blame on social institutions for the status of blacks by showing the success of the individual black teachers.\"\n\nThe TV series \"Iron Fist\" (2017–) features Finn Jones as the superhero Iron Fist. Both the originating comic book character and the TV series actor are white. Prior to the series airing \"The New York Times\" reported that the casting had received criticism for not changing the character to be Asian-American. The newspaper quoted arguments put forward by Keith Chow, editor-in-chief of \"The Nerds of Color\" pop culture blog, \"If you’re going to have all these trappings of Orientalism on top of a white savior trope, why not upend both of those things by casting an Asian-American to play the role?\" Jones denied that Iron Fist would be a white savior figure and said that the series would address critics' concerns.\n\nWriter Teju Cole coined the term \"White Savior Industrial Complex\" following the release of the documentary \"Kony 2012\" in March 2012, extrapolating the term in a seven-part response on Twitter. He later wrote an article for \"The Atlantic\" about the term.\n\nCole's response became a viral phenomenon, and \"The Guardian\"s Bhakti Shringarpure reflected on the supportive Internet response to the \"Kony 2012\" political campaign, \"With the prevalence of campaigns, apps and games calling on us to help without really putting ourselves out, it seems that the white saviour idea is still alive and well – but now, the mode is digital.\" Heather Laine Talley, writing in \"Saving Face: Disfigurement and the Politics of Appearance\", said of the response to Cole coining the term, \"The very idea of the white savior industrial complex was met with both celebration and rage. Cole was alternately described as a truth teller and as a racist.\" Talley summarized Cole's response to his critics, \"Ultimately, Cole implores Western (white) do-gooders to rethink doing good in two ways. First, own up to the motives that drive philanthropic interventions, so that personal catharsis does not subsume the real need of others. Second, consider the structural underpinnings and historical legacies that together sustain the very infrastructure of the problems that captivate our activist hearts.\"\n\nTim Engles, writing in \"Rhetorics of Whiteness: Postracial Hauntings in Popular Culture, Social Media, and Education\", concurred with Cole's assessment, \"The lack of real-world efficacy of their efforts, and the apparent unwillingness of most to go any further than such limited and self-aggrandizing steps, suggests that mere validation of white racial privilege was indeed the most significant outcome.\"\n\nThe removal of Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan and her medical treatment in the West has been described as an example of the \"white savior complex\". The arguments behind this were the Western media and politicians quick reaction to the incident, portraying it as their rescue of a woman from her own savage culture and people. This also allegedly was the West's justification for invading and bombing the region to save savage people from their own kind, while killing more innocent people like Malala than the Taliban has.\n\n\n"}

He was working at the Old Vic at the time. The Assembly Rooms on George Street had previously been home to the Festival Club, but they had vacated the building after finding it unprofitable to operate. This left it available for Burdett-Coutts, and gave him space to host other shows.\n\nBurdett-Coutts fought for the Assembly Rooms to remain a venue only building, against Edinburgh Council's plan to turn the ground floor space into shops and a restaurant.\n\n"}

The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty, and because it was the number of the five planets known anciently, plus the sun and moon.\nMany similar lists have been made.\n\nThe historian Herodotus (484 – ca. 425 BC) and the scholar Callimachus of Cyrene (ca. 305–240 BC), at the Museum of Alexandria, made early lists of seven wonders. Their writings have not survived, except as references.\n\nThe classic seven wonders were:\n\n\nThe only ancient world wonder that still exists is the Great Pyramid of Giza.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, some writers wrote their own lists with names such as Wonders of the Middle Ages, Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages, Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind, and Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages. However, it is unlikely that these lists originated in the Middle Ages, because the word \"medieval\" was not invented until the Enlightenment-era, and the concept of a Middle Age did not become popular until the 16th century. \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" refers to them as \"later list[s]\", suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages.\n\nMany of the structures on these lists were built much earlier than the Medieval Ages but were well known.\n\nTypically representative are:\n\nOther sites sometimes included on such lists:\n\nFollowing in the tradition of the classical list, modern people and organisations have made their own lists of wonderful things ancient and modern. Some of the most notable lists are presented below.\n\nIn 1994, the American Society of Civil Engineers compiled a list of Seven Wonders of the Modern World, paying tribute to the \"greatest civil engineering achievements of the 20th century\".\n\nIn November 2006 the American national newspaper \"USA Today\" and the American television show \"Good Morning America\" revealed a list of \"New Seven Wonders\" as chosen by six judges. An eighth wonder was chosen on November 24, 2006, from viewer feedback.\n\nSimilar to the other lists of wonders, there is no consensus on a list of seven natural wonders of the world, and there has been debate over how large the list should be. One of the many existing lists was compiled by CNN:\n\n\nIn 2001 an initiative was started by the Swiss corporation New7Wonders Foundation to choose the New7Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing monuments. Twenty-one finalists were announced January 1, 2006. Egyptians were not happy that the only surviving original wonder, the Great Pyramid of Giza, would have to compete with the likes of the Statue of Liberty, the Sydney Opera House, and other landmarks, calling the project absurd. In response, Giza was named an honorary Candidate. The results were announced on July 7, 2007, in Lisbon, Portugal:\n\nNew7Wonders of Nature (2007–11), a contemporary effort to create a list of seven natural wonders chosen through a global poll, was organized by the same group as the New7Wonders of the World campaign.\n\nNew7Wonders Cities is the third global vote organized by New7Wonders.\n\n\nThe Seven Underwater Wonders of the World was a list drawn up by CEDAM International, an American-based non-profit group for divers, dedicated to ocean preservation and research.\n\nIn 1989 CEDAM brought together a panel of marine scientists, including Dr. Eugenie Clark, to pick underwater areas which they considered to be worthy of protection. The results were announced at The National Aquarium in Washington DC by actor Lloyd Bridges, star of TV's \"Sea Hunt\":\n\n\nBritish author Deborah Cadbury wrote \"Seven Wonders of the Industrial World\", a book telling the stories of seven great feats of engineering of the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 2003, the BBC aired a seven-part docudrama exploring the same feats, with Cadbury as a producer. Each episode dramatised the construction of one of the following industrial wonders:\n\"Seven Wonders of the World is a 1956 film in which Lowell Thomas searches the world for natural and man made wonders and invites the audience to try to update the ancient Greek Wonders of the World list.\n\nIn a 1999 article, \"Astronomy\" magazine listed the \"Seven Wonders of the Solar System\". This article was later made into a video.\n\n\nNumerous other authors and organisations have composed lists of the wonders of the world. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
