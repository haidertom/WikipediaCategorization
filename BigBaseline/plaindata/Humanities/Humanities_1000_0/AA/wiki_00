This is typically done with hands held shoulder-width apart and at the eye level of the speaker, with the index and middle fingers on each hand flexing at the beginning and end of the phrase being quoted. The air-quoted phrase is—in the most common usage—very short, at most a few words. Air quotes are often used to express satire, sarcasm, irony or euphemism, among others, and are analogous to scare quotes in print.\n\nUse of similar gestures has been recorded as early as 1927, and Glenda Farrell used air quotes in a 1937 screwball comedy, \"Breakfast for Two.\" (Much earlier, in 1889, Lewis Carroll described similar usages -- air brackets and an air question mark -- in his last novel, ). The term \"air quotes\" first appeared in a 1989 \"Spy\" magazine article by Paul Rudnick and Kurt Andersen, who state it became a common gesture around 1980.\n\nThe gesture was used routinely in the TV show \"Celebrity Charades\" (1979) as the standard signal for a quote or phrase.\nIn the episode \"Nurse's Wild\" of TV show \"Emergency!\" (1972), the character Roy DeSoto uses air quotes at Rampart Hospital base station.\n\nThe trend became very popular in the 1990s, attributed by many to comedian Steve Martin, who often used them with exaggerated emphasis in his stand-up shows. Another popularization of air quotes was the character Bennett Brauer, played on the sketch comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\" by Chris Farley, an aggressive but socially awkward commentator who used air quotes to mock societal expectations of him. Additionally, in the blockbuster \"Austin Powers\" film series, Dr. Evil makes exaggerated use of air quotes when explaining matters to his henchmen, particularly while using real phrases he erroneously believes himself to have coined such as \"laser\" and \"Death Star\".\n\nIn the HBO special \"Back in Town\" from 1996, the stand-up comedian George Carlin satirized the use of air quotes in the skit \"Quote Marks in the Air\" from the segment \"Free-Floating Hostility\".\n"}
{"id": "33148906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33148906", "title": "Anthropology of development", "text": "Anthropology of development\n\nThe anthropology of development is a term applied to a body of anthropological work which views development from a \"critical\" perspective. The kind of issues addressed, and implications for the approach typically adopted can be gleaned from a list questions posed by Gow (1996). These questions involve anthropologists asking why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short why does so much planned development fail? \n\nThis \"anthropology of development\" has been distinguished from \"development anthropology\". Development anthropology refers to the application of anthropological perspectives to the multidisciplinary branch of development studies. It takes international development and international aid as primary objects. In this branch of anthropology, the term development refers to the social action made by different agents (institutions, business, enterprise, states, independent volunteers) who are trying to modify the economic, technical, political or/and social life of a given place in the world, especially in impoverished, formerly colonized regions.\n\nDevelopment anthropologists share a commitment to simultaneously critique and contribute to projects and institutions that create and administer Western projects that seek to improve the economic well-being of the most marginalized, and to eliminate poverty. While some theorists distinguish between the 'anthropology of development' (in which development is the object of study) and development anthropology (as an applied practice), this distinction is increasingly thought of as obsolete.\n\nSome describe the anthropological critique of development as one that pits modernization and an eradication of the indigenous culture, but this is too reductive and not the case with the majority of scholarly work. In fact, most anthropologists who work in impoverished areas desire the same economic relief for the people they study as policymakers, however they are wary about the assumptions and models on which development interventions are based. Anthropologists and others who critique development projects instead view Western development itself as a product of Western culture that must be refined in order to better help those it claims to aid. The problem therefore is not that of markets driving out culture, but of the fundamental blind-spots of Western developmental culture itself. Criticism often focuses therefore on the cultural bias and blind-spots of Western development institutions, or modernization models that: systematically represent non-Western societies as more deficient than the West; erroneously assume that Western modes of production and historical processes are repeatable in all contexts; or that do not take into account hundreds of years of colonial exploitation by the West that has tended to destroy the resources of former colonial society. Most critically, anthropologists argue that sustainable development requires at the very least more inclusion of the people who the project aims to target to be involved in the creation, management and decision making process in the project creation in order to improve development.\n\nThe British government established the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute in 1937 to conduct social science research in British Central Africa. It was part of the colonial establishment, although its head, anthropologist Max Gluckman, was a critic of colonial rule. Gluckman refused to describe colonialism as a simple case of \"culture contact\" since it was not a case of cultures mutually influencing each other, but of the forced incorporation of Africans into a foreign social, political and economic system. The anthropologists of the Institute were core members of what came to be known as the \"Manchester school\" of anthropology noted for looking at issues of social justice such as apartheid and class conflict.\n\nThe term \"subculture of poverty\" (later shortened to \"culture of poverty\") made its first prominent appearance in the ethnography \"Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty\" (1959) by anthropologist Oscar Lewis. Lewis struggled to render \"the poor\" as legitimate subjects whose lives were transformed by poverty. He argued that although the burdens of poverty were systemic and therefore imposed upon these members of society, they led to the formation of an autonomous subculture as children were socialized into behaviors and attitudes that perpetuated their inability to escape the underclass. In sociology and anthropology, the concept created a backlash, pushing scholars to abandon cultural justifications and negative descriptions of poverty, fearing such analysis may be read as \"blaming-the-victim.\"\n\nThe most influential modernization theorist in development was Walt Rostow, whose \"The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto\" (1960) concentrates on the economic side of the modernization, and especially the factors needed for a country to reach \"take-off\" to self-sustaining growth. He argued that today's underdeveloped areas are in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that therefore the task in helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Rostow's unilineal evolutionist model hypothesized all societies would progress through the same stages to a modernity defined by the West. The model postulates that economic growth occurs in five basic stages, of varying length:\n\n\nAs should be clear from the subtitle of his book, Rostow sought to provide a capitalist rebuttal to the unilinear Marxist growth models being pursued in the newly independent communist regimes in the second and third world; an effort that would lead to the \"Green revolution\" to combat the \"Red revolution\".\n\nGeorge Dalton applied the substantivist economic ideas of Karl Polanyi to economic anthropology, and to development issues. The substantivist approach demonstrated the ways in which economic activities in non-market societies were embedded in other, non-economic social institutions such as kinship, religion and political relations. He therefore critiqued the formalist economic modelling of Rostow. He was the author of \"Growth without development: An economic survey of Liberia\" (1966, with Robert W. Clower) and \"Economic Anthropology and Development: Essays on Tribal and Peasant Economies\" (1971).\n\nDependency theory arose as a theory in Latin America in reaction to modernization theory. It argues that resources flow from a \"periphery\" of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the \"World-system\" and hence poor countries will not follow Rostow's predicted path of modernization. Dependency theory rejected Rostow's view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and structures of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy and hence unable to change the system. \n\nImmanuel Wallerstein's \"world-systems theory\" was the version of Dependency theory that most North American anthropologists engaged with. His theories are similar to Dependency theory, although he placed more emphasis on the system as system, and focused on the developments of the core rather than periphery. Wallerstein also provided an historical account of the development of capitalism which had been missing from Dependency theory.\n\nWomen in development (WID) is an approach to development projects that emerged in the 1970s, calling for treatment of women's issues in development projects. Later, the Gender and development (GAD) approach proposed more emphasis on gender relations rather than seeing women's issues in isolation. The WID school grew out of the pioneering work of Esther Boserup. Boserup's most notable book is \"The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure\". This book presents a \"dynamic analysis embracing all types of primitive agriculture.\" Drawing on Boserup, the WID theorists pointed out that the division of labour in agriculture is frequently gendered, and that in societies practicing shifting cultivation, it is women who conduct most of the agricultural work. Development projects, however, were skewed towards men on the assumption they were \"heads of households.\"\n\nA major critique of development from anthropologists came from Arturo Escobar's seminal book \"Encountering Development\", which argued that Western development largely exploited non-Western peoples. Arturo Escobar views international development as a means for the Occident to keep control over the resources of its former colonies. Escobar shows that between 1945 and 1960, while the former colonies were going through decolonization, development plans helped to maintain the third world's dependency on the old metropole. Development projects themselves flourished in the wake of WWII, and during the cold war, when they were developed to \n\n1. stop the spread of Communism with the spread of capitalist markets; and \n\n2. create more prosperity for the West and its products by creating a global consumer demand for finished Western products abroad. \n\nSome scholars blame the different agents for having only considered a small aspect of the local people's lives without analyzing broader consequences, while others like dependency theory or Escobar argue that development projects are doomed to failure for the fundamental ways they privilege Western industry and corporations. Escobar's argument echos the earlier work of dependency theory and follows a larger critique more recently posed by Foucault an other poststructuralists.\n\nAt a critical juncture in the early nineteenth century the state began to connect itself to a series of groups “that in different ways had long tried to shape and administer the lives of individuals in pursuit of various goals” rather than simply extend the absolutist state’s repressive machinery of social control. Michel Foucault’s work on the prison, the clinic, and the asylum – on the development of “bio-power” – analyzed the plurality of governing agencies and authorities who developed programs, strategies, and technologies that were deployed to optimize the health, welfare and life of populations. He referred to this process with the neologism, “governmentality” (governmental rationality). One of the last of these new applied sciences was the \"development apparatus\", the post-world war extension of colonial rule after the independence of third world states.\nJames Ferguson utilized the governmentality framework in \"The Anti-Politics Machine: \"Development,\" Depoliticization and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho\" (1990), the first in many similar explorations. Ferguson sought to explore how \"development discourse\" works. That is, how do the language and practices used by development specialists influence the ways in which development is delivered, and what unintended consequences does it foster. He found that development projects which failed in their own terms could be redefined as \"successes\" on which new projects were to be modelled. The net effect of development, he found, was to \"de-politicize\" questions of resource allocation, and to strengthen bureaucratic power. In his analysis of a development project in Lesotho (South Africa) between 1978 and 1982, he examined the following discursive maneuvers. \n\nFerguson points out that a critical part of the development process is the way in which the object of development is defined. In defining this object, it is severed from its historical and geographic context, and isolated as a \"Less-Developed Country.\" In the case of Lesotho, its history as a grain exporting region was ignored, as was its current role as a labour reserve for the South African mines. Not wanting to deal with the apartheid South African regime, development agencies isolated the \"independent\" Lesotho from the regional economy in which it was entrapped in their project rationales and reports. Artificially taken out of this larger capitalist context, Lesotho's economy was described as \"isolated,\" \"non-market\" and \"traditional\" and thus a proper target for aid intervention.\n\nFerguson underscores that these discourses are produced within institutional settings where they must provide a charter for governmental intervention. Any analysis which suggests the roots of poverty lie in areas outside the scope of government are quickly dismissed and discarded since they cannot provide a rationale for state action. And since the capitalist economy is one such area which has been ideologically set outside the scope of governmental action, the discursive creation of a deformed ‘native economy’ creates the required opening for that intervention.\n\nFerguson writes that it is not enough to note development's failures; even the project managers initially recognized it as a failure. If that was all Ferguson had done, his book would not have had the influence it did. Asking if development is a failure is asking the wrong question; it ignores the “instrument effects” of what the projects DO do. In other words, we should ask what NON-economic functions does development serve? His answer:\n\nEcogovernmentality, (or Eco-governmentality), is the application of Foucault’s concepts of biopower and governmentality to the analysis of the regulation of social interactions with the natural world. The concept of Ecogovernmentality expands on Foucault’s genealogical examination of the state to include ecological rationalities and technologies of government. Following Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how government agencies, in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct “The Environment.” This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government’s larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.\n\nWork done by Arun Agrawal on local forest governance in India, is an example of this method of analysis. He illustrates how the production of specific types of expert knowledge (the economic productivity of forests) coupled with specific technologies of government (local Forest Stewardship Councils) can bring individual interest in line with those of the state. This, not through the imposition of specific outcomes, but by creating frameworks that rationalizes behavior in particular ways and involve individuals in the process of problem definition and intervention.\n\nThe term \"Green Revolution\" was first used in 1968 by former United States Agency for International Development (USAID) director William Gaud, who noted the spread of the new technologies:\n\"These and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the makings of a new revolution. It is not a violent Red Revolution like that of the Soviets, nor is it a White Revolution like that of the Shah of Iran. I call it the Green Revolution.\"\n\n\n"}

It is related to methodologies of archaeology. Martinón-Torres and Killick distinguish ‘scientific archaeology’ (as an epistemology) from ‘archaeological science’ (the application of specific techniques to archaeological materials). Martinón-Torres and Killick claim that ‘archaeological science’ has promoted the development of high-level theory in archaeology. However, Smith rejects both concepts of archaeological science because neither emphasize falsification or a search for causality.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Natural and Environmental Research Council provides funding for archaeometry separate from the funding provided for archaeology. However, in almost all cases of archeometric research, scientists from the natural sciences assist in the scientific analysis of archeological artifacts. Universities that offer courses in archeometry offer these courses frequently as free choice for archeology students and these courses contain mainly a nonscientific overview over the possibilities that different scientific analyses offer to them.\n\nArchaeological science can be divided into the following areas:\n\nTechniques such as lithic analysis, archaeometallurgy, paleoethnobotany, palynology and zooarchaeology also form sub-disciplines of archaeological science.\n\nArchaeological science has particular value when it can provide absolute dates for archaeological strata and artifacts. Some of the most important dating techniques include:\n\nAnother important subdiscipline of archaeometry is the study of artifacts. Archaeometrists have used a variety of methods to analyze artifacts, either to determine more about their composition, or to determine their provenance. These techniques include:\n\nLead, strontium and oxygen isotope analysis can also test human remains to estimate the diets and even the birthplaces of a study's subjects.\n\nProvenance analysis has the potential to determine the original source of the materials used, for example, to make a particular artifact. This can show how far the artifact has traveled and can indicate the existence of systems of exchange.\n\nArchaeometry has greatly influenced modern archaeology. Archaeologists can obtain significant additional data and information using these techniques, and archaeometry has the potential to revise the understanding of the past. For example, the \"second radiocarbon revolution\" significantly re-dated European prehistory in the 1960s, compared to the \"first radiocarbon revolution\" from 1949.\n\nArchaeometry is an important tool in finding potential dig sites. The use of remote sensing has enabled archaeologists to identify many more archaeological sites than they could have otherwise. The use of aerial photography (including satellite imagery and Lidar) remains the most widespread remote-sensing technique. Ground-based geophysical surveys often help to identify and map archaeological features within identified sites.\n\n"}

It is a one-piece leather-hide shoe, the oldest piece of leather footwear in the world known to contemporary researchers. The discovery was made by an international team led by Boris Gasparyan, an archaeologist from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia (co-directors of the project are Ron Pinhasi from University College Cork in Ireland, and Gregory Areshian from UCLA).\n\nAn Armenian post-graduate student, Diana Zardaryan, discovered the leather shoe in the course of excavations by a team of archeologists from Armenia’s Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, Ireland and the United States. The shoe was found upside down at the base of a shallow, rounded, and plastered pit that was deep and wide, beneath an overturned broken Chalcolithic ceramic bowl. A broken pot and goat horns also were found nearby. Excavations in the same area also found the world's oldest wine-making site.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Geographic Society, the Chitjian Foundation, the Gfoeller Foundation, the Steinmetz Family Foundation, the Boochever Foundation and the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at UCLA. The team's findings were published on June 9, 2010, in the journal \"PLOS One\".\n\nThe shoe was found in near-perfect condition due to the cool and dry conditions in the cave and a thick layer of sheep dung which acted as a solid seal. Large storage containers were found in the same cave, many of which held well-preserved wheat, barley, and apricots, as well as other edible plants. The shoe contained grass and the archaeologists were uncertain as to whether this was because the grass was used as insulation to keep the foot warm, or used to preserve the shape of the shoe while not being worn. Lead archaeologist Ron Pinhasi could not determine whether the shoe belonged to a man or a woman. While small, approximately a woman's U.S. and Canada size 7, European size 37, or UK size 6, he stated that \"the shoe could well have fitted a man from that era\". The shoe laces were preserved as well.\n\nMajor similarities exist between the manufacturing technique and style of one-piece leather-hide shoes discovered across Europe and the one reported from Areni-1 Cave, suggesting that shoes of this type were worn for millennia across a large and environmentally diverse geographic region. According to Pinhasi, the Areni-1 shoe is similar to the Irish \"pampooties\", a shoe style worn in the Aran Islands up to the 1950s. The shoes are very similar to the traditional shoes of the Balkans, still seen today in festivals, known as Opanci (\"Opanke\").\n\nWhen the material was dated by the two radiocarbon laboratories in Oxford and California, it was established that the shoe dates back to 3,500 B.C. This date is a few hundred years older than the date given for the leather shoe found on Ötzi the Iceman, 400 years older than those found at Stonehenge, and 1,000 years older than those found at the Great Pyramid of Giza.\n\nAfter having been treated for preservation, the Areni-1 shoe is on display at the History Museum of Armenia, Yerevan.\n\n"}

The excavations were carried out by Boris Gasparyan of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia and Ron Pinhasi from University College Cork (Ireland), and were sponsored by the Gfoeller Foundation (USA) and University College Cork. In 2008 the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) also joined the project with Gregory Areshian as co-director of the Areni Project. Since then the excavations have been sponsored by UCLA and the National Geographic Society as well. The excavations of the winery were completed in 2010.\n\nThe winery consists of fermentation vats, a wine press, storage jars, pottery sherds, and is believed to be at least a thousand years older than the winery unearthed in Judea and Samaria in 1963, which is the second oldest currently known.\n\nThe Areni-1 shoe was found in the same cave in 2008.\n\nExcavations at the Areni-1 site began in 2007 and continued until September 2010. Armenian, American and Irish archaeologists fully unearthed a large, well-preserved 2-foot (60 centimeter) deep vat, along with a 3.5-foot (one meter) long basin made of clay and covered with malvidin. In addition to these discoveries grape seeds, remains of pressed grapes, prunes, walnuts, and desiccated vines were found. A number of drinking cups, found next to a set of ancient graves, were also excavated, suggesting that the site was used for funeral ceremonies and ritualistic practices. The cave was abandoned after its roof caved in, and the organic material was preserved thanks to sheep dung, which prevented fungi from destroying the remains.\n\nThe team's full findings will be published in future.\n\nThe results of the biochemical analysis of the residues from the bottom of the wine-press and the storage jars carried out by Hans Barnard and his colleagues at UCLA were published in the \"Journal of Archaeological Science\" in January 2011.\n\nBotanical analysis and radiocarbon tests carried out by researchers at the University of California, Irvine and Oxford University have revealed the date of the Areni-1 winery to around 4100 BC and 4000 BC or the Late Chalcolithic Period. According to Areshian, the vintners used their feet to press the wine in the clay basin, the juice of which would then drain into the vat, where it would remain to ferment until being stored in jars. The capacity of the vat has been estimated to be about 14–15 gallons (US or imperial??) .\n\nAccording to Areshian, the discovery of the winery has provided greater insight to the study of horticulture. Patrick E. McGovern, a biomolecular archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania Museum, has likewise emphasized the importance of the discovery, describing it as \"important and unique, because it indicates large-scale wine production, which would imply, I think, that the grape had already been domesticated.\"\n\nThe exact identity of the people who lived in the region at the time is not known, although some researchers have postulated that they may have belonged to the Kura-Araxes people and added that they may have been very involved in trade.\n\n\n\n"}

Art movements were especially important in modern art, when each consecutive movement was considered as a new avant-garde.\n\nAccording to theories associated with modernism and the concept of postmodernism, art movements are especially important during the period of time corresponding to modern art. The period of time called \"modern art\" is posited to have changed approximately halfway through the 20th century and art made afterward is generally called contemporary art. Postmodernism in visual art begins and functions as a parallel to late modernism and refers to that period after the \"modern\" period called contemporary art. The postmodern period began during late modernism (which is a contemporary continuation of modernism), and according to some theorists postmodernism ended in the 21st century. During the period of time corresponding to \"modern art\" each consecutive movement was often considered a new avant-garde.\n\nAlso during the period of time referred to as \"modern art\" each movement was seen corresponding to a somewhat grandiose rethinking of all that came before it, concerning the visual arts. Generally there was a commonality of visual style linking the works and artists included in an art movement. Verbal expression and explanation of movements has come from the artists themselves, sometimes in the form of an art manifesto, and sometimes from art critics and others who may explain their understanding of the meaning of the new art then being produced.\n\nIn the visual arts, many artists, theorists, art critics, art collectors, art dealers and others mindful of the unbroken continuation of modernism and the continuation of modern art even into the contemporary era, ascribe to and welcome new philosophies of art as they appear. Postmodernist theorists posit that the idea of art movements are no longer as applicable, or no longer as discernible, as the notion of art movements had been before the postmodern era. There are many theorists however who doubt as to whether or not such an era was actually a fact; or just a passing fad.\n\nThe term refers to tendencies in visual art, novel ideas and architecture, and sometimes literature. In music it is more common to speak about genres and styles instead. See also cultural movement, a term with a broader connotation.\n\nAs the names of many art movements use the -ism suffix (for example cubism and futurism), they are sometimes referred to as \"isms\".\n\n\n"}

Examples of articulatory gestures are the hand movements necessary to enunciate sign language and the mouth movements of speech. In semiotic terms, they are the physical embodiment (signifiers) of speech signs, which are gestural by nature (see below).\n\nThe definition of \"gesture\" varies greatly, but here it will be taken in its widest sense, namely, any meaningful action. An intentional action is meaningful if it is not strictly utilitarian: for example, sending flowers to a friend is a gesture, because this action is performed not only for the purpose of moving flowers from one place to another, but also to express some sentiment or even a conventional message in the language of flowers. Use of the broadest definition of gesture (not restricted to hand movements) allows Hockett’s “rapid fading” design feature of human language to be accommodated as a type of sign in semiotic theory.\n\nBut if an articulatory gesture is to be considered a true gesture in the above sense, it must be meaningful. Therefore, an articulatory gesture must be at least as large as the smallest meaningful unit of language, the morpheme. A morpheme corresponds roughly to a spoken word or a sign language gesture. \n\nThis definition differs from the practice, common among linguists, of referring to phonemes (meaningless mouth movements) as articulatory gestures (see articulatory phonology). In semiotics, meaningless components of spoken gestures (written as individual letters), or meaningless components of sign language gestures (such as location of hand contact) are known as figurae, the constituents of signs. \n\nIt also differs from the tradition of considering speech sounds to be the signifiers of speech signs. But this practice confuses signals with symbols. Sound and light are analogue signals, whereas mouth and hand gestures are discrete symbolic entities. A sound or light signal is subject to random noise, whereas the image of the gesture is subject to regular distortion, as when a signer’s hand is viewed from different angles. In speech, the sound of the contact of the tongue in the letter T can be distorted by surrounding mouth movements, as in the phrase “perfect memory”. When pronounced at conversational speed, the sound of the tongue contact is completely obscured by surrounding consonants even though this T movement is fully carried out.\n\nArticulatory gestures, when seen as the physical embodiment of speech and sign language symbols, provide a link between these two language types, and show how speech resembles sign language more closely than is generally presumed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18400732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18400732", "title": "Authoritarian literature", "text": "Authoritarian literature\n\nAuthoritarian literature is a term used by John Gardner to designate the body of literature written by persons living under an authoritarian governmental regime. Literary works produced in these regimes share common characteristics that make the designation useful. Authoritarian regimes revere their leaders, who historically were typically referred to as kings, along with advisors to the king. These leaders were considered innately better than ordinary people. The authoritarian leader, and his approved circle, if not directly writing about a subject themselves, were the only ones who could designate, approve, and sanction writers as acceptable authorities. Government authorities also financially supported writers under a patronage system. The writers in such a system therefore must necessarily be careful to ensure the composition of their work met (or would meet) the approval of authorities. Failure to comply risked official warnings, loss of governmental sanction, and sometimes even imprisonment or loss of life.\n\nFiction produced under authoritarian regimes tends to be didactic. Subject matter can vary in terms of plot, but the didactic point of the work is almost always to illustrate what authorities would consider the proper comportment of individuals within the authoritarian society. This didactic point is conveyed to readers in order to idealize the existing social structure and thus, hopefully, perpetuate it. Authoritarian fiction is considered to be demonstrative in purpose rather than explorative. The author's narrative voice is also usually authoritarian in order to impart something known by the author that is presumably not known by the reader. Since most people don't enjoy and resist being spoken to as an inferior, the more successful (or popular) authors of such literature are the ones who best disguise, or sugarcoat, their didactic purpose. One common way to achieve such indirectness is through the use of the form allegory.\n\nGood examples of authoritarian literature include \"Beowulf\", \"Pilgrim's Progress\", and in English literature we see vestiges as late as Charles Dickens. While didacticism forms a significant component of Shaw's, Orwell's and C. S. Lewis' fiction as well, their works can not strictly be considered as authoritarian literature because they were not writing at the whim of political leaders. Dickens was not writing for the British government either, but he used the same forms of his predecessors, who did write for the court, particularly in his earlier novels, such as \"A Tale of Two Cities\" and \"David Copperfield\", where we most easily observe a certain preachiness. Dickens constructed his plots for the sake of demonstration rather than the purpose of exploration. However, Charles Dickens is a transitional figure, and in his later novels, such as \"Great Expectations\", we can \"feel the two impulses warring in the writer's mind\".\n\nAuthoritarian literature is, of course, not a purely historical phenomenon. It persists as the dominant form of everyday literature of Middle Eastern countries (Turkey, Israel, Lebanon, and arguably Palestine and Iran's literature excepted), and, until recently, Chinese literature. To understand the nature of authoritarian literature's purpose is to better understand the reason for the forms in which we see literature currently being produced in these countries.\n\nThe antithesis to Authoritarian literature is Anti-Authoritarian literature. Practitioners of this genre in the aforementioned countries are routinely subjected to harsh sanctions, and many choose to go into exile in order to write freely.

{"id": "211997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=211997", "title": "Baguazhang", "text": "Baguazhang\n\nBaguazhang () is one of the three main Chinese martial arts of the Wudang school, the other two being Taijiquan and Xing Yi Quan. It is more broadly grouped as an internal practice (or neijia quan). \"Bāguà zhǎng\" literally means \"eight trigram palm,\" referring to the trigrams of the \"I Ching\" (\"Yijing\"), one of the canons of Taoism.\n\nThe creation of Baguazhang, as a formalised martial art, is attributed to Dong Haichuan (董海川), who is said to have learned from Taoist and Buddhist masters in the mountains of rural China during the early 19th century. Many Chinese authorities do not accept the Buddhist origin, instead maintaining that those teachers were purely Taoist in origin, the evidence lying in Baguazhang's frequent reference to core concepts central to Taoism, such as Yin and Yang theory, I Ching and Taoism's most distinctive paradigm, the Bagua diagram. The attribution to Buddhist teachers came from the 2nd generation teachers, i.e. Dong Haichuan's students, some of whom were Buddhist. There is evidence to suggest a synthesis of several pre-existing martial arts taught and practised in the region in which Dong Haichuan lived, combined with Taoist circle walking. Through his work as a servant in the Imperial Palace he impressed the emperor with his graceful movements and fighting skill, and became an instructor and a bodyguard to the court. Dong Haichuan taught for many years in Beijing, eventually earning patronage by the Imperial court.\n\nFamous disciples of Dong Haichuan to become teachers were Yin Fu (尹福), Cheng Tinghua (程廷華), Ma Gui (马贵), Song Changrong (宋長榮), Liu Fengchun (劉鳳春), Ma Weiqi (馬維棋), Liu Baozhen (劉寶珍), Liang Zhenpu (梁振蒲) and Liu Dekuan (劉德寛). Although they were all students of the same teacher, their methods of training and expressions of palm techniques differed. The Cheng and Liu styles are said to specialize in \"pushing\" the palms, Yin style is known for \"threading\" the palms, Song's followers practice \"Plum Flower\" (梅花 \"Mei Hua\") palm technique and Ma style palms are known as \"hammers.\" Some of Dong Haichuan's students, including Cheng Tinghua, participated in the Boxer Rebellion. In general, most bagua exponents today practice either the Yin (尹), Cheng (程), or Liang (梁) styles, although Fan (樊), Shi (史), Liu (劉), Fu (傅), and other styles also exist. (The Liu style is a special case, in that it is rarely practiced alone, but as a complement to other styles). In addition, there are sub-styles of the above methods as well, such as the Sun (孫), Gao (高), and Jiang (姜) styles, which are sub-styles of Cheng method.\n\n\nThe practice of circle walking, or \"turning the circle\", as it is sometimes called, is Baguazhang's characteristic method of stance and movement training. All forms of Baguazhang utilize circle walking as an integral part of training. Practitioners walk around the edge of the circle in various low stances, facing the center, and periodically change direction as they execute forms. For a beginner, the circle is six to twelve feet in diameter. Students first learn flexibility and proper body alignment through the basic exercises, then move on to more complex forms and internal power mechanics. Although the internal aspects of Baguazhang are similar to those of Xingyiquan and Taijiquan, they are distinct in nature.\nMany distinctive styles of weapons are contained within Baguazhang; some use concealment, like the \"scholar's pen\" or a pair of knives (the most elaborate, which are unique to the style, are the crescent-shaped deer horn knives (Chinese: 鹿角刀; pinyin: Lùjiǎodāo). Baguazhang is also known for practicing with extremely large weapons, such as the \"bāguà jian\" (八卦劍), or bagua sword, and the \"bāguà dāo\" (八卦刀), or bagua broadsword. Other, more conventional weapons are also used, such as the staff (\"gun\"), spear (\"qiang\"), cane (\"guai\"), hook sword (\"gou\") and the straight, double-edged sword (jian). Baguazhang practitioners are also known for being able to use anything as a weapon using the principles of their art.\n\nBaguazhang contains an extremely wide variety of techniques as well as weapons, including various strikes (with palm, fist, elbow, fingers, etc.), kicks, joint locks, throws, and distinctively evasive circular footwork. As such, Baguazhang is considered neither a purely striking nor a purely grappling martial art. Baguazhang practitioners are known for their ability to \"flow\" in and out of the way of objects. This is the source of the theory of being able to fight multiple attackers. Baguazhang's evasive nature is also shown by the practice of moving behind an attacker, so that the opponent cannot harm the practitioner.\n\nAlthough the many branches of Baguazhang are often quite different from each other (some, like Cheng style, specialize in close-in wrestling and joint locks, while others, like some of the Yin styles, specialize in quick, long-range striking), all have circle walking, spiraling movement, and certain methods and techniques (piercing palms, crashing palms, etc.) in common.\n\nBaguazhang's movements employ the whole body with smooth coiling and uncoiling actions, utilizing hand techniques, dynamic footwork, and throws. Rapid-fire movements draw energy from the center of the abdomen. The circular stepping pattern also builds up centripetal force, allowing the practitioner to maneuver quickly around an opponent.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Instead of balls, other spherical objects can be used, such as balloons. It is typically employed as a recreation and exercise for children.\nBall pits are often found at nurseries, carnivals, amusement parks, fun centers, fast-food restaurants, and large video arcades. Chuck E. Cheese's and (now defunct) Discovery Zone formerly had ball pits and they were frequently incorporated into larger play structures, such as mazes, slides, and jungle gyms.\n\nBall pits may be rented for parties, and smaller versions are sold for use in the home. While ball pits are traditionally intended for children, some are large enough to accommodate adults.\n\nBall pits may be used together with a trampoline, or combining the two by filling a closed trampoline with the balls.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, a number of urban legends arose about children being severely injured or even killed due to ball-pit encounters with venomous snakes or hypodermic needles. Although there is no truth to these stories, workers have reported finding dirty diapers, half-eaten food and syringes in ball pits.\n\nIn the \"Rugrats\" episode, \"Piggy's Pizza Palace\", the Rugrats jump on a costumed pig named Piggy as an act of revenge to get Angelica's tickets back. Thus, it caused the ball pit structure to split right open and all of the balls fall out all over the restaurant. \n\nIn season 3 episode 14, (\"The Einstein Approximation\") of the TV series \"The Big Bang Theory\", Sheldon seeks inspiration in a ball pit at a mall, and then hides from Leonard, who becomes frustrated as he spends a good amount of time and effort trying to retrieve Sheldon from the ball pit, but Sheldon keeps saying \"Bazinga\".\n\nIn 2014, a YouTube vlogger under the name \"Roman Atwood\" made a video of transforming the living room of his home into a massive ball pit, intended as a prank for his girlfriend who has returned from a trip. He later collaborates with another vlogger, Freddie Wong, to create a comedy video involving giant ball pit and \"ball monster\" prank.\n\nIn 2016, a pop-up \"ball pit bar\" opened in San Francisco.\n\n"}

The troupe consists of one main performer and two co-performers. It is a narrative entertainment that consists of prayers, solo drama, dance, songs, poems and jokes. The topic will be either a Hindu mythological story (Jangam Katha) or a contemporary social issue.\n\nBurra - Katha was developed in Guntur district around 1942 with the aim of propagating political ideas among illiterate masses in villages. The communists with the help of Andhra Praja Natya Mandali founded by Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy in Bezawada spread the message to the masses in the Naizam region during the rebellion against Nizam in the 1940s.\n\n\"Burra\" is referred to tambura, a musical string instrument with a hollow shell. \"Katha\" means story.\nBurra means a skull in Telugu. The shell resembles a human skull. It is made of baked clay or dried pumpkin, or of brass and copper. The instrument looks very similar to veena and the performer can pull and press strings to get music.\n\nBurrakatha refers to the art throughout Andhra Pradesh, and there are local names in each region.\n\nBurrakatha started as devotional songs of nomadic people and became a popular art form. It is played on radio and TV regularly in Andhra Pradesh. It is a 20th-century name for the theater show known as Jangam Katha. The jangams lingayats were wandering minstrels who worshiped and sang of Lord Siva. Two performers participated in these plays: the storyteller and his wife. With societal and cultural changes, the secular aspect was incorporated into this form. The modern form has three performers of any gender.\n\nPopular Hindu artists were Pendyala Venkateswarrao, Sunkara Sri Krishna Madhava Rao, Paruchuri Ramakotayya, Sirivisetti Subbarao, Kosuri Punnayya, Govardhana, Kakumanu Subbarao, Davuluru, Chintalal Suryanarayana, Budagajangala mote papaiah, Budagajangala mote kullayappa, Budagajangala mote ramalingam, etc. Women also formed groups, e.g., Moturi Udayam, Chintala Koteswaramma, Mahankali Lakshmi, Sridevi sisters, etc. Popular non-Hindu artists are Abraham Bhagavatar, Manohara Kavi, Khader Khan Sahib, Shaik Nazar etc.\n\nThe main storyteller (kathakudu) narrates the story. He plays tambura and dances to music. He also wears a metal ring called an andelu on his right thumb, holds another ring in his other hand and adds more music by colliding them frequently. The co-performers plays gummeta (also called dakki or budike), earthen drums with two heads. All three or only the kathakadu wear anklets (also called as gajjelu), which add even more music when they dance.\n\nThe right side performer (hasyaka, meaning joker) acts as a joker and cracks satires and jokes. The left side performer (rajakiya, meaning politician) acts as someone who knows worldly ways and talks about politics and social issues. The main performer and co-performers constantly was address each other. The co-performers interrupt the kathakudu with doubts, and they sometimes add emphasis to the main events in the story with short words similar to \"Wow!\" \"Aha!\" and \"That is it.\"\n\nWhenever the main performer sings a song, he or she starts with \"vinara veera kumara veera gadha vinara\" followed by the co-performers singing \"tandhana tane tandhana na.\" It is also called 'tandana katha.'\n\nBurra katha was a pastime event in villages. It is seen even now during Dussehra or Sankranti festival seasons to describe events in epics like Ramayan and Mahabharat and also some of best and moral stories of kings like kambojaraju katha, chinnamma katha, muggurumoratila katha, etc.\n\nIt played an effective role in conveying message to people and awakening them during Indian Independence Movement. Burrakatha was banned in Madras by the British government and in Hyderabad kingdom by Nizam government, because it was the medium to enlighten the people of the political situation in political meetings.\n\nBurrakatha tellers are called as budagajangalu. Internet and movies play a major role in modern life.\nThat's why the burrakathas are not being seen and no one is there to develop this and improve the art.\nIn past these burrakatha tellers were important in the villages; now there is no response for their art.\n\nSo these burrakatha tellers left their traditional art and have become beggars or day labourers. Even in these modern times, there are no educated people in this tribe. They don't have caste certificates for developing their tribe.\n\nDaroji Eramma was a performer of Burra katha from Karnataka.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16663203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16663203", "title": "Comedy (drama)", "text": "Comedy (drama)\n\nA comedy is entertainment consisting of jokes intended to make an audience laugh. For ancient Greeks and Romans a comedy was a stage-play with a happy ending. In the Middle Ages, the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings and a lighter tone. In this sense Dante used the term in the title of his poem, the \"Divine Comedy\" (Italian: \"Divina Commedia\").\n\nThe phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it has been carefully investigated by psychologists and agreed upon the predominating characteristics are incongruity or contrast in the object, and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus Thomas Hobbes speaks of laughter as a \"sudden glory.\" Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the \"play instinct\" and its emotional expression.\n\nMuch comedy contains variations on the elements of surprise, incongruity, conflict, repetitiveness, and the effect of opposite expectations, but there are many recognized genres of comedy. Satire and political satire use ironic comedy used to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor.\n\nParody borrows the form of some popular genre, artwork, or text but uses certain ironic changes to critique that form from within (though not necessarily in a condemning way). Screwball comedy derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. Black comedy is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or evil elements in human nature. Similarly scatological humor, sexual humor, and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comedic ways.\n\nA comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. Romantic comedy is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms, and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.\n\nThe word \"comedy\" is derived from the Classical Greek κωμῳδία, which is a compound either of \"κῶμος\" (revel) or \"κώμη\" (village) and \"ᾠδή\" (singing): it is possible that \"κῶμος\" itself is derived from \"κώμη\", and originally meant a village revel. The adjective \"comic\" (Greek κωμικός), which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of \"laughter-provoking\". The word came into modern usage through the Latin \"comoedia \"and Italian \"commedia\" and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.\n\nIn ancient Greece, comedy seems to have originated in songs or recitations apropos of fertility festivals or gatherings, or also in making fun at other people or stereotypes. In the \"Poetics\", Aristotle states that comedy originated in phallic rituals and festivals of mirth. It is basically an imitation of 'the ridiculous, which is a species of the ugly.' However, Aristotle taught that comedy is a good thing. It brings forth happiness, which for Aristotle is the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. He does believe that we humans feel pleasure oftentimes by doing the wrong thing, but he does not necessarily believe that comedy and humor is the wrong thing. It is also not true for Aristotle that a comedy must involve sexual humor to qualify as a comedy. A comedy is about the fortunate arise of a sympathetic character. A happy ending is all that is required in his opinion. \n\nOn the contrary, the Greek Philosopher Plato taught that comedy is a destruction to the self. He believed it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In The Republic (Plato), he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid laughter, \"for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction.\" Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.\n\nNorthrop Frye described the comic genre as a drama that pits two societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. He depicted these two opposing sides as a \"Society of Youth\" and a \"Society of the Old\", \"The Anatomy of Criticism\". 1957, but this dichotomy is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation. A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes; in this sense, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse to ruses which engender very dramatic.\n\n\nfrom what has been discussed\n\n"}
{"id": "7378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7378", "title": "Comparative law", "text": "Comparative law\n\nComparative law is the study of differences and similarities between the law (legal systems) of different countries. More specifically, it involves the study of the different legal \"systems\" (or \"families\") in existence in the world, including the common law, the civil law, socialist law, Canon law, Jewish Law, Islamic law, Hindu law, and Chinese law. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken. The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, economic globalization, and democratization.\n\nThe origins of modern Comparative Law can be traced back to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1667 in his Latin-language book Nova Methodus Discendae Docendaeque Iurisprudentiae (New Methods of Studying and Teaching Jurisprudence). Chapter 7 (Presentation of Law as the Project for all Nations, Lands and Times) introduces the idea of classifying Legal Systems into several families. Notably, a few years earlier, Leibnitz introduced an idea of Language families.\n\nAlthough every Legal System is unique, Comparative Law through studies of their similarities and differences allows for classification of Legal Systems, wherein Law Families is the basic level of the classification. The main differences between Law Families are found in the source(s) of Law, the role of court precedents, the origin and development of the Legal System. Montesquieu is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, \"De l'esprit des lois\" (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):\n\nAlso, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that \"to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety.\" Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:\n\nThe modern founding figure of comparative and anthropological jurisprudence was Sir Henry Maine, a British jurist and legal historian. In his 1861 work \"Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas\", he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of Eastern and Western legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in its historical context and was widely read and influential.\n\nThe first university course on the subject was established at the University of Oxford in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.\n\nComparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, Rudolf Schlesinger. Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at Cornell Law School helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.\n\nComparative law is an academic discipline that involves the study of legal systems, including their constitutive elements and how they differ, and how their elements combine into a system.\n\nSeveral disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative constitutional law, comparative administrative law, comparative civil law (in the sense of the law of torts, delicts, contracts and obligations), comparative commercial law (in the sense of business organisations and trade), and comparative criminal law. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. The purposes of comparative law are:\n\nComparative law is different from the fields of general jurisprudence (legal theory), international law, including both public international law and private international law (also known as conflict of laws).\n\nDespite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the United Nations System, in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of legal transplants, i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of legal transplants was coined by Alan Watson, one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.\n\nAlso, the usefulness of comparative law for sociology of law and law and economics (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law and law & economics may help comparative law answer questions, such as: \n\nArminjon, Nolde, and Wolff believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems \"per se\" get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the\n\n\nRené David proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:\nEspecially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas common law countries are those where law was created from the judges. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are\n\nKonrad Zweigert and Hein Kötz propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:\n\nUp to the second German edition of their introduction to comparative law, Zweigert and Kötz also used to mention Soviet or socialist law as another family of laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a relatively new area, with the first dedicated conference organized in 1996.\n\nThe first \"computer model of a sense of humor\" was suggested by\nSuslov as early as 1992. Investigation of the general scheme of information processing shows the possibility of a specific malfunction, conditioned by the necessity of a quick deletion from consciousness of a false version. This specific malfunction can be identified with a humorous effect on psychological grounds: it exactly corresponds to incongruity-resolution theory. However, an essentially new ingredient, the role of timing, is added to the well-known role of ambiguity. In biological systems, a sense of humor inevitably develops in the course of evolution, because its biological function consists of quickening the transmission of the processed information into consciousness and in a more effective use of brain resources. A realization of this algorithm in neural networks justifies naturally Spencer's hypothesis on the mechanism of laughter: deletion of a false version corresponds to zeroing of some part of the neural network and excessive energy of neurons is thrown out to the motor cortex, arousing muscular contractions.\n\nA practical realization of this algorithm needs extensive databases, whose creation in the automatic regime was suggested recently. As a result, this magistral direction was not developed properly and subsequent investigations accepted somewhat specialized colouring.\n\nAn approach to analysis of humor is classification of jokes. A further step is an attempt to generate jokes basing on the rules that underlie classification.\n\nSimple prototypes for computer pun generation were reported in the early 1990s, based on a natural language generator program, VINCI. Graeme Ritchie and Kim Binsted in their 1994 research paper described a computer program, JAPE, designed to generate question-answer-type puns from a general, i.e., non-humorous, lexicon. (The program name is an acronym for \"Joke Analysis and Production Engine\".) Some examples produced by JAPE are:\n\nSince then the approach has been improved, and the latest report, dated 2007, describes the STANDUP joke generator, implemented in the Java programming language. The STANDUP generator was tested on children within the framework of analyzing its usability for language skills development for children with communication disabilities, e.g., because of cerebral palsy. (The project name is an acronym for \"System To Augment Non-speakers' Dialog Using Puns\" and an allusion to standup comedy.) Children responded to this \"language playground\" with enthusiasm, and showed marked improvement on certain types of language tests.\nThe two young people, who used the system over a ten-week period, regaled their peers, staff, family and neighbors with jokes such as: \"What do you call a spicy missile? A hot shot!\" Their joy and enthusiasm at entertaining others was inspirational.\nStock and Strapparava described a program to generate funny acronyms.\n\n\"AskTheBrain\" (2002) used clustering and bayesian analysis to associate concepts in a comical way.\n\nA statistical machine learning algorithm to detect whether a sentence contained a \"That's what she said\" double entendre was developed by Kiddon and Brun (2011). There is an open-source Python implementation of Kiddon & Brun's TWSS system.\n\nA program to recognize knock-knock jokes was reported by Taylor and Mazlack. This kind of research is important in analysis of human-computer interaction.\n\nAn application of machine learning techniques for the distinguishing of joke texts from non-jokes was described by Mihalcea and Strapparava (2006).\n\nTakizawa \"et al.\" (1996) reported on a heuristic program for detecting puns in the Japanese language.\n\nA possible application for the assistance in language acquisition is described in the section \"Pun generation\". Another envisioned use of joke generators is in cases of steady supply of jokes where quantity is more important than quality. Another obvious, yet remote, direction is automated joke appreciation.\n\nIt is known that humans interact with computers in ways similar to interacting with other humans that may be described in terms of personality, politeness, flattery, and in-group favoritism. Therefore, the role of humor in human-computer interaction is being investigated. In particular, humor generation in user interface to ease communications with computers was suggested.\n\nCraig McDonough implemented the Mnemonic Sentence Generator, which converts passwords into humorous sentences. Basing on the incongruity theory of humor, it is suggested that the resulting meaningless but funny sentences are easier to remember. For example, the password AjQA3Jtv is converted into \"Arafat joined Quayle's Ant, while TARAR Jeopardized thurmond's vase\".\n\nJohn Allen Paulos is known for his interest in mathematical foundations of humor. His book \"Mathematics and Humor: A Study of the Logic of Humor\" demonstrates structures common to humor and formal sciences (mathematics, linguistics) and develops a mathematical model of jokes based on catastrophe theory.\n\n\n"}

Counter-\"Maniera\" or Counter-Mannerism reacted against the artificiality of the second generation of Mannerist painters in the second half of the 16th century. It was in part due to artists wishing to follow the vague prescriptions for clarity and simplicity in art issued by the Council of Trent in its final session in 1563, and represented a rejection of the distortions and artificiality of high Mannerist style, and a partial return to the classicism and balance of High Renaissance art, with \"clarity in formal order and legibility in content\". \n\nThe term was devised by the art historian Sydney Joseph Freedberg (1914–1997), and has gained a good degree of acceptance, although it is by no means universally adopted by other art historians. Counter-Maniera was one of the four phases of 16th-century Italian painting defined by Freedberg in his \"Painting in Italy, 1500–1600\", first published in 1971 and long the standard textbook on the period, as: \"First \"Maniera\", High \"Maniera\", Counter-\"Maniera\" and Late \"Maniera\"\". The styles did not neatly succeed each other but existed side by side for much of the time, with High \"Maniera\" remaining the dominant style during the main period of Counter-\"Maniera\" in the third quarter of the 16th century. In many cases Counter-Mannerism was a development of an artist's style in mid or late career, or a style used for some works, especially religious commissions, while other works by the same artist continued to use a high \"maniera\" style. \n\nFreedberg's contemporary Federico Zeri had in 1957 introduced or revived his own term \"arte sacra\" (\"sacred art\") for pre-Baroque Counter-Reformation style in Roman painting, overlapping to a large degree with Freedberg's Counter-Maniera, though rather wider in both the dates and styles included. The use of the term Counter-\"Maniera\" may be in decline, as impatience with such \"style labels\" grows among art historians. In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of the period and mentee of Freedberg, was criticised by a reviewer of her \"After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century\" for her \"fundamental flaw\" in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic \"Note on style labels\" at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum.\n\nThe definition of Mannerism itself is notoriously complex, and that of Counter-Mannerism, which to a considerable extent is defined negatively or reductively against it, is no less so. Many parts of Italy, led by Venice and other northern centres, were on the periphery of both the High Renaissance and the Mannerist reaction, and reached what might be called a Counter-Mannerist style merely by continuing to develop regional Renaissance styles, and accepting moderate doses of \"maniera\" influence. The term is most often applied to painters in Florence and Rome who reacted against the prevailing style in these centres of full-blooded \"maniera\", without a fundamental rejection of its underlying principles. In proposing the term Freedberg compares it with terms such as \"counterpart\" and \"counterpoint\", explaining that he intends \"implying parallelism and relation between two terms at the same time as their opposition\". \n\nCharacteristics of the \"maniera\" often retained in counter-\"maniera\" works, though in moderation, are an idealized and abstracted treatment of the content, absence of naturalism, an avoidance of the expression of emotion, and many of the formal characteristics noted by Friedländer, such as the arrangement of figures on the same plane at the front of the picture space, which they nearly fill. Elements of the \"maniera\" that are removed include the impulse to push to the extreme, the willingness to sacrifice everything for a graceful effect, playfulness and wit, and the readiness to let the details and ambience of a painting crowd out or submerge the supposed main figures, that must be hunted out by the learned viewer. The style restores a decorum suitable for religious works, and removes distractions from the central religious figures. In its latest phase, from about 1585, the need for popular appeal appears to have been recognized by artists and commissioners in the church, leading to some relaxation of the austerity of earlier periods, and sometimes to sentimentality. \n\nThe term counter-\"maniera\" is not usually applied to the more radical Bolognese reaction of the Carraccis from the 1580s, although this represented a more effective rejection of Mannerist artificiality. For Freedberg this was \"a new and un-Maniera attitude to art\"; elsewhere he cautions against confusing Counter-\"Maniera\" with \"anti-Maniera\", apparently reflecting \"Anti-Mannerism\", the term used by Walter Friedländer for the \"palpable break in the stylistic development of Italian painting\" that occurred \"sometime around 1590\". The use of the term has not been extended to Northern Mannerism.\n\nDeciding what characterizes a work in Counter-Mannerist style may not be straightforward; in the single brief passage mentioning the term in John Shearman's \"Mannerism\" (1967), he picks Santi di Tito's \"Vision of St Thomas Aquinas\" (1593, illustrated here, as in both books) as an example of it, but Freedberg excludes Santo's classicising naturalism from the style, though noting his similarities to it. Shearman's other main example of Counter-Mannerism is Federigo Barocci, who Freedberg also excludes from his definition.\n\nMany painters looked to revive the styles of Raphael, Andrea del Sarto and other High Renaissance masters, or drew inspiration from the Venetian masters of the High Renaissance. The example of Michelangelo's late work was important for many artists. The Florentine biographer and critic Raffaello Borghini, author of \"Il Riposo della Pitura e della Scultura\" published in 1584, has been proposed as a theorist, rather late into the course of the trend, but his work is little known. The artists of Counter-Mannerism remain relatively unknown, and often hard to see outside Italy, as much of their work was religious and remains in the churches for which it was commissioned, or Italian museums. It was mostly ignored in the hunt by picture dealers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Freedberg says frankly: \"Boredom is a requisite of the Roman Counter-Maniera style, invading even the art of the few painters whose inspiration may be too considerable and too authentic to be sealed off wholly\".\n\nFreedberg cautions against treating the style as simply a reflection of the decrees of Trent, which were a last minute and little-discussed addition, based on a French draft, to the final session in 1563, well after the style had begun to show itself. He describes the decrees as \"a codifying and official sanction of a temper that had come to be conspicuous in Roman culture\".\n\nIt should also be noted that Freedberg, like the majority of art historians dealing with the period—even today—tended to view mid-to-late sixteenth-century and early seventeenth-century Italian art history through the singular pro-Roman Bolognese lens of Gian Pietro Bellori's \"Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects\" - meaning Freedburg may have had little time for any alternative historical narrative that did not support a \"pro-Bolognese\" artistic account of Counter-\"Maniera\" reform.\n\n\n\n"}

This subgenre contrasts with classical and Neoclassical tragedy, in which the protagonists are of kingly or aristocratic rank and their downfall is an affair of state as well as a personal matter. \n\nThe Ancient Greek theorist Aristotle had argued that tragedy should concern only great individuals with great minds and souls, because their catastrophic downfall would be more emotionally powerful to the audience; only comedy should depict middle-class people. Domestic tragedy breaks with Aristotle's precepts, taking as its subjects merchants or citizens whose lives have less consequence in the wider world. \n\nIn Britain, the first domestic tragedies were written in the English Renaissance; one of the first was \"Arden of Faversham\" (1592), depicting the murder of a bourgeois man by his adulterous wife. Other famous examples are \"A Woman Killed with Kindness\" (1607), \"A Yorkshire Tragedy\" (1608), and \"The Witch of Edmonton\" (1621). \"Othello\" can be classified as a domestic tragedy.\n\nDomestic tragedy disappeared during the era of Restoration drama, when Neoclassicism dominated the stage, but it emerged again with the work of George Lillo and Sir Richard Steele in the eighteenth century.\n\n"}

{"id": "6475070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6475070", "title": "Feminist anthropology", "text": "Feminist anthropology\n\nFeminist anthropology is a four-field approach to anthropology (archeological, biological, cultural, linguistic) that seeks to transform research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge, using insights from feminist theory. Simultaneously, feminist anthropology challenges essentialist feminist theories developed in Europe and America. While feminists practiced cultural anthropology since its inception (see Margaret Mead and Hortense Powdermaker), it was not until the 1970s that feminist anthropology was formally recognized as a subdiscipline of anthropology. Since then, it has developed its own subsection of the American Anthropological Association – the Association for Feminist Anthropology – and its own publication, \"Voices\".\n\nFeminist anthropology has unfolded through three historical phases beginning in the 1970s: the anthropology of women, the anthropology of gender, and finally feminist anthropology.\n\nPrior to these historical phases, feminist anthropologists trace their genealogy to the late 19th century. Erminnie Platt Smith, Alice Cunningham Fletcher, Matilda Coxe Stevenson, Frances Densmore—many of these women were self-taught anthropologists and their accomplishments faded and heritage erased by the professionalization of the discipline at the turn of the 20th century. Prominent among early women anthropologists were the wives of 'professional' men anthropologists, some of whom facilitated their husbands research as translators and transcriptionists. Margery Wolf, for example, wrote her classic ethnography \"The House of Lim\" from experiences she encountered following her husband to northern Taiwan during his own fieldwork.\n\nWhile anthropologists like Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict are representatives of the history of feminist anthropology, female anthropologists of color and varying ethnicities also play a role in the theoretical concepts of the field. Hortense Powdermaker, for example, a contemporary of Mead's who studied with British anthropological pioneer Bronislaw Malinowski conducted political research projects in a number of then a-typical settings: reproduction and women in Melanesia (Powdermaker 1933), race in the American South (Powdermaker 1939), gender and production in Hollywood (1950), and class-gender-race intersectionality in the African Copper Belt (Powdermaker 1962). Similarly, Zora Neale Hurston, a student of Franz Boas, the father of American anthropology, experimented with narrative forms beyond the objective ethnography that characterized the proto/pseudo- scientific writings of the time. Other African American women made similar moves at the junctions of ethnography and creativity, namely Katherine Dunham and Pearl Primus, both of whom studied dance in the 1940s. Also important to the later spread of Feminist anthropology within other subfields beyond cultural anthropology was physical anthropologist Caroline Bond Day and archeologist Mary Leakey.\n\nThe anthropology of women, introduced through Peggy Golde's \"Women in the Field\" and Michelle Rosaldo and Louise Lamphere's edited volume \"Woman, Culture, and Society\", attempted to recuperate women as distinct cultural actors otherwise erased by male anthropologists' focus on men's lives as the universal character of a society. Male anthropologists, Golde argued specifically, rarely have access to women in tribes and societies because of the sexual threat they pose to these women. As such, they receive the stories of men about women in instances when women are present at all. The male anthropologists' ignorance and the indigenous men's domination congeal to create instances where, according to Rosaldo and Lamphere, the asymmetry between women and men becomes universal. A second anthropology of women would arise out of American engagements with Friedrich Engels' The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, arguing that this universal asymmetry was not timeless, but a product of capitalist relations that came to dominate the global mode of production through colonialism. As both approaches grew more vocal in their critique of male ethnographers' descriptions as one-sided, an 'add women and mix' approach to ethnography became popular, whereby women were not necessarily described at detail, but mentioned as part of the wider culture.\n\nIn the wake of Gayle Rubin and her critique of \"the sex/gender system,\" the anthropology of women transformed into an anthropology of gender. Gender was a set of meanings and relationships related to but not isomorphic with biological sex. Women was not a universal community or category that was self-evident. Following the rise of women of color feminism, the anthropology of gender critiqued the early goals of first-wave feminists and anthropologists as overly concerned with bourgeois social ambitions. It did so through a move from documenting the experience of women as a universal population to interpreting the place of gender in broader patterns of meaning, interaction, and power. This includes the work of women anthropologists Henrietta Moore and Ethel Albert. Moore contended that anthropology, even when carried out by women, tended to \"[order] the world into a male idiom [. . .] because researchers are either men or women trained in a male oriented discipline\". Anthropology's theoretical architecture and practical methods, Moore argued, were so overwhelmingly influenced by sexist ideology (anthropology was commonly termed the \"study of man\" for much of the twentieth century) that without serious self-examination and a conscious effort to counter this bias, anthropology could not meaningfully represent female experience.\n\nToday, feminist anthropology has grown out of the anthropology of gender to encompass the study of the female body as it intersects with or is acted upon by cultural, medical, economic, and other forces. This includes the expansion of feminist politics beyond cultural anthropology to physical anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and archeology, as well as feminist anthropology becoming a site for connecting cultural studies, history, literature, and ethnic studies.\n\nFeminist archaeology initially emerged in the late 1970s and early 80s, along with other objections to the epistemology espoused by the processual school of archaeological thought, such as symbolic and hermeneutic archaeologies. Margaret Conkey and Janet Spector’s 1984 paper Archaeology and the Study of Gender summed up the feminist critique of the discipline at that time: that archaeologists were unproblematically overlaying modern-day, Western gender norms onto past societies, for example in the sexual division of labor; that contexts and artifacts attributed to the activities of men, such as projectile point production and butchering at kill sites, were prioritized in research time and funding; and that the very character of the discipline was constructed around masculine values and norms. For example, women were generally encouraged to pursue laboratory studies instead of fieldwork (although there were exceptions throughout the history of the discipline) and the image of the archaeologist was centered around the rugged, masculine, “cowboy of science”.\n\nRecently, feminists in archeology have started to confront the issue of sexual assault during \"field work\" through scholarly research on the social life of archeologists. The Biological Anthropology Field Experiences Web Survey, open to bioarcheologists, primatologists, and other subfields, revealed that 19% of women are sexually assaulted during fieldwork, with 59% of anthropologists—male and female—experiencing sexual harassment.\n\nFeminist cultural anthropology deals with the concept of feminism through the lens of cultural anthropology. When combining these two fields of study, cultural anthropology can be approached in a non-binary way. New information pertaining to research and knowledge from a scholarly perspective also has no restrictions. This field of study may impact feminism and women and gender studies as well because it provides feminist analyses of culture from an anthropological perspective.\n\nIn the 1970s, women started attending undergraduate and graduate universities where the social sciences, which were at one time largely dominated by men, were now being practiced by men and women alike.  With more women in the social science disciplines, they started having an impact on how some issues were being dealt with in the social science fields, such as the emphasis on gender studies and the integration of women’s rights issues into these studies.  Women entering the social science fields had such a large impact on the feminist anthropology movement because before the 1980s, female anthropologists mostly focused on aspects such as family, marriage, and kinship.  Many female anthropologists reacted to this stereotype placed on them, as they wanted to focus on broader aspects of culture in the scholarly community. \n\nWhen feminist anthropology first developed, it was intended to be the subdiscipline of the anthropology of women.  However, feminist cultural anthropology arose as a subfield itself when anthropologists started to realize that women's and gender studies weren’t published as frequently as other topics in anthropology. As feminist anthropology began being practiced by more people and cultural aspects such as race, values, and customs started being considered, focuses on personal identity and differences between people in varying cultures became the main idea surrounding feminist cultural anthropology.  With this advance, female anthropologists started focusing on all aspects of gender and sex and how they vary culturally.  With a focus on feminism through an anthropological lens, women’s role in society and their contributions to the social sciences formed itself a new subfield known as feminist cultural anthropology.\n\nThe relationships of feminist anthropology with other strands of academic feminism are uneasy. By concerning themselves with the different ways in which different cultures constitute gender, feminist anthropology can contend that the oppression of women is not universal. Henrietta Moore argued that the concept of \"woman\" is insufficiently universal to stand as an analytical category in anthropological enquiry: that the idea of 'woman' was specific to certain cultures, and not a human universal. For some feminists, anthropologist Michelle Rosaldo wrote, this argument contradicted a core principle of their understanding of relations between men and women. Contemporary feminist anthropologist Marilyn Strathern argues that anthropology, which must deal with difference rather than seeking to erase it, is not necessarily harmed by this disagreement, but notes nonetheless that feminist anthropology faces resistance.\n\nAnthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the western world. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theory. On the other hand, anthropologists' claims to include and engage with such other perspectives have in turn been criticised - local people are seen as the producers of local knowledge, which only the western anthropologist can convert into social science theory. Because feminist theorists come predominantly from the west, and do not emerge from the cultures they study (some of which have their own distinct traditions of feminism, like the grassroots feminism of Latin America), their ideas about feminism may contain western-specific assumptions that do not apply simply to the cultures they investigate. Rosaldo criticizes the tendency of feminists to treat other contemporary cultures as anachronistic, to see other parts of the world as representing other periods in western history - to say, for example, that gender relations in one country are somehow stuck at a past historical stage of those in another. Western feminists had, Rosaldo said, viewed women elsewhere as “ourselves undressed and the historical specificity of their lives and of our own becomes obscured”. Anthropology, Moore argued, by speaking \"about\" and not \"for\" women, could overcome this bias.\n\nMarilyn Strathern characterised the sometimes antagonistic relationship between feminism and anthropology as self-sustaining, since “each so nearly achieves what the other aims for as an ideal relation with the world.\". Feminism constantly poses a challenge to the androcentric orthodoxy from which anthropology emerges; anthropology undermines the ethnocentricism of feminism.\n\nFeminist anthropology, Rayna Rapp argues, is subject to a 'double difference' from mainstream academia. It is a feminist tradition – part of a branch of scholarship, sometimes marginalized as an offshoot of postmodernism and deconstructionism and concerned with the experiences of women – who are marginalized by an androcentric orthodoxy. At the same time it addresses non-Western experience and concepts, areas of knowledge deemed peripheral to the knowledge created in the west. It is thus doubly marginalized.\n\nMoore argues that some of this marginalization is self-perpetuating. By insisting on adhering exclusively to the 'female point of view', feminist anthropology constantly defines itself as 'not male' and therefore as inevitably distinct from, and marginal to, mainstream anthropology. Feminist anthropology, Moore says, effectively ghettoizes itself. Strathern argues that feminist anthropology, as a tradition posing a challenge to the mainstream, can never fully integrate with that mainstream: it exists to critique, to deconstruct, and to challenge.\n\n\n"}

The topic covers a variety of concerns from education to equal opportunity in terms of employment and wages.\n\nIn response to the concerns, the government has implemented various legislation, especially concerning gender discrimination, both institutional and personal, in the workplace; the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 protects individuals from being discriminated against in employment, vocational training, education, the provision and sale of goods, facilities and services, premises and the exercise of public functions due to their sex/gender; this was amended by the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002. The Equal Pay Act of 1970 mandates equal pay for equal work regardless of an individual's sex/gender, and the Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999 also protect the rights of individuals who intend to undergo, are undergoing, or have undergone sex reassignment. These Regulations pertain to pay and treatment in employment, self-employment and vocational training.\n\nThe Equality Acts of 2006 and 2010 served to codify and combine all equality enactments within Great Britain, and provide comparable protections across all equality strands.\n\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is a non-departmental public body which has responsibility for the promotion and enforcement of equality and non-discrimination laws in England, Scotland and Wales, while the Government Equalities Office is a government department charged with promoting and improving gender equality within the UK government itself, responsible for leading the Discrimination Law Review, and providing advice on all other forms of equality to other UK government departments. The GEO was formerly known as the Women and Equality Unit.\n\nIt has increasingly been observed that a pervasive 'lad culture' has developed in the U.K., described as an ironic, self-conscious method for young males to adopt \"an anti-intellectual position, scorning sensitivity and caring in favour of drinking, violence, and a pre-feminist and racist attitude to women as both sex objects and creatures from another species\". In April 2014, the UN special rapporteur on violence against women similarly concluded that Britain has a \"boys' club sexist culture\".\n\nThe culture has attracted wide criticism from feminist circles; Germaine Greer critiques it in her 2000 book \"The Whole Woman\", while Kira Cochrane asserts that \"it's a dark world that \"Loaded\" and the lad culture has bequeathed us\".\n\nCommentators believe that lad culture has affected politics and decreased the ability of women to participate, and studies of industries such as the architecture profession found that lad culture had a negative impact on women completing their professional education.\n\nIn April 2012, British feminist writer Laura Bates founded the Everyday Sexism Project, a website and social media presence whose aim is to document everyday examples of sexism as reported by contributors; the submissions are then collated by a small group of volunteers led by Emer O'Toole, a researcher at Royal Holloway, University of London. By April 2013 the site had collected 25,000 entries from 15 countries.\n\nVarious U.K. media institutions have been labelled problematic with regards to sexism and gender discrimination - most notably being the Page 3 feature found in the British tabloid newspaper \"The Sun\", which consists of a large photograph of a topless female glamour model usually published on the newspaper's third page. In August 2012, the No More Page 3 campaign emerged, sparking widespread discussion and receiving heavy support from Green MP Caroline Lucas and cross-party support from over 140 other MPs.\n\nA YouGov survey in October 2012 found differences in attitude toward Page 3 among readers of different newspapers; 61% of \"Sun\" readers wished to retain the feature, while 24 percent said that the newspaper should stop showing Page 3 women. However, only 4% of \"Guardian\" readers said \"The Sun\" should keep Page 3, while 86% said it should be abolished. The poll also found wide differences by gender, with 48% of men overall saying that Page 3 should be retained, but just 17% of women taking that position.\n\nThe U.K. has a persistent gender pay gap, the most significant factors associated with which are part-time work, education, the size of the firm a person is employed in, and occupational segregation (women are under-represented in managerial and high-paying professional occupations.) When comparing full-time roles, men in the U.K. tend to work slightly longer hours than women in full-time employment. Depending on the age bracket and percentile of hours worked men in full-time employment work between 1.35% and 17.94% more hours than women in full-time employment. Even when taking the differences in hours worked into account, a pay gap still exists in the U.K., and typically increases with age and earnings percentile.\n\nInequality in the context of education has greater implications in terms of future employment. Elements of the school curriculum still advocate certain gender-specific practices.\n\nBoys lag behind girls at important educational milestones. At Key Stage 2 girls outperform boys. The proportion of students achieving level 4 and above in reading, writing and maths, in 2015, in England, was 77% boys compared to 83% girls. The gap is wider for students who receive a free school meal. \n\nGirls outperform boys in headline GCSE results. In state-funded schools, the gap in those achieving 5+ grades a*-C including English and maths is around 10 percentage points.\n\nYoung women are more likely to enrol at university. In 2016 the gender gap in favour of women was the highest on record. \"In England, young women are 36% more likely to apply to university and when both sexes are from disadvantaged backgrounds young women are 58% more likely to apply.\"\n\nCurrently, sex education is not compulsory in the U.K., and in England and Wales, the optional curriculum focuses mainly on biological areas such as the reproductive system, foetal development, and the physical changes of adolescence, while information about contraception and safe sex is discretionary and discussion about relationships and gender roles is often neglected.\n\nIn April 2014, Bates remarked that \"better sex and relationships education in schools is desperately needed\" to teach areas around \"healthy relationships, consent, respect and sexual abuse\" in response to tackling everyday sexism earlier in life.\n"}

{"id": "533017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=533017", "title": "Horror vacui", "text": "Horror vacui\n\nIn visual art, horror vacui (; from Latin \"fear of empty space\"), also kenophobia (from Greek \"fear of the empty\"), is the filling of the entire surface of a space or an artwork with detail.\n\nThe term is associated with the Italian art critic and scholar Mario Praz, who used it to describe the suffocating atmosphere and clutter of interior design in the Victorian age. Older, and more artistically esteemed examples can be seen on Migration period art objects like the carpet pages of Insular illuminated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells. This feeling of meticulously filling empty spaces also permeates Arabesque Islamic art from ancient times to the present. Another example comes from ancient Greece during the Geometric Age (1100 - 900 BCE), when horror vacui was considered a stylistic element of all art. The mature work of the French Renaissance engraver Jean Duvet consistently exhibits horror vacui.\n\nSome examples of horror vacui in art come from, or are influenced by, the mentally unstable and inmates of psychiatric hospitals, such as Richard Dadd in the 19th century, and many modern examples fall under the category of Outsider Art. Horror vacui may have also had an impact, consciously or unconsciously, on graphic design by artists like David Carson or Vaughan Oliver, and in the underground comix movement in the work of S. Clay Wilson, Robert Crumb, Robert Williams, and on later comic artists such as Mark Beyer. The paintings of Williams, Faris Badwan, Emerson Barrett, Joe Coleman and Todd Schorr are further examples of horror vacui in the modern Lowbrow art movement.\n\nThe entheogen-inspired visionary art of certain indigenous peoples, such as the Huichol yarn paintings and the ayahuasca-inspired art of Pablo Amaringo, often exhibits this style, as does the psychedelic art movement of the 1960s counterculture. Sometimes the patterned art in clothing of indigenous peoples of Middle and South America exhibits horror vacui. For example, the geometric molas of Kuna people and the traditional clothing on Shipibo-Conibo people.\n\nThe artwork in the Where's Wally? series of children's books is a commonly known example of horror vacui, as are many of the small books written or illustrated by the macabre imagination of Edward Gorey.\n\nThe Tingatinga painting style of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania is a contemporary example of horror vacui. Other African artists such as Malangatana of Mozambique (Malangatana Ngwenya) also fill the canvas in this way.\n\nThe arrangement of Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs suggests an abhorrence of empty space. Signs are repeated or phonetic complements added to prevent gaps.\n\nHorror vacui also strikes mapmakers. In the times of the Discoveries, for instance, it was common for cartographers to fill in the \"Terra incognita\" or the poorly known oceans with monsters or simply with the scale of the map, rather than to leave them blank.\n\nThere is an inverse relationship between \"horror vacui\" and value perception, and commercial designers favour minimalism in shop window displays and advertising to appeal to affluent and well-educated consumers, on the premise that understatement and restraint appeals more to affluent and well-educated audiences.\n\nThe term is also used as an analogy to the Aristotelian idea that a physical vacuum is impossible, and therefore the idea must be rejected. This was widely believed up to the time of Rene Descartes.\n\n"}

In nominative form, \"indignationem\" is \"indignatio\". \"Indignation\" is a noun of action from the past participle stem of \"indignari\", meaning unworthy, to be angry at, or to be displeased with.\n\nAccording to Cicero’s \"De Inventione\", Book I, “indignation is a kind of speech by which the effect produced is, that great hatred is excited against a man, or dislike of some proceeding is originated.” The goal is for the speaker to create anger projected towards the opponent or the accused such that the speaker is seen more positively than the opponent. One of the features of \"indignatio\" is that it cannot function without a target of displeasure. To successfully employ the technique, the speaker must have a target, an audience with which the speaker identifies, and a desired reaction. If a speaker achieves a reaction from the audience in which they are displeased with his opponent, then the speaker has successfully employed \"indignation\".\n\nAristotle wrote in his Book II, Chapter 9, “indignation is the emotion most directly opposed to pity.” Aristotle also writes “Indignation is pain caused by the sight of undeserved good fortune.” The terms indignation and indignatio are closely related in part by their common negative emotionality and anger. A speaker may successfully employ indignatio and the audience will feel indignation towards the opponent.\n"}

It differs from other interdisciplinary educational initiatives in that its curriculum is purpose designed rather than simply an amalgamation of existing disciplines.\n\nKyoto University in Japan has offered a formal course in Integrated Human Studies since 1992 when it reorganized its College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and renamed it the Faculty of Integrated Human Studies. This was subsequently (in 2003) integrated with the Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies to create the new Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies.\n\nThe University of Western Australia established the Center for Integrated Human Studies in early 2008.

It is a decision-making process that blends management needs and resource considerations with visitor needs and desires to determine the most effective way to communicate a message to a targeted audience.\n\nInterpretation at informal learning institutions builds on Freeman Tilden’s principles of interpretation, focusing especially on \"relating\" content in a meaningful way to a visitor’s own experience, \"provoking\" emotion, thought or further inquiry into a subject. \nThe communication goals of interpretation at mission-based institutions are based on achieving previously specified outcomes. Most interpretive plans are based on a thematic approach to interpretation, and therefore, place emphasis on which themes are important to communicate to various audiences. Interpretive planning may also guide how audiences will react to and interact with a particular site or exhibit. \n\nAn interpretive plan establishes these specific goals for an institution’s market(s) and builds a structured vision of how to achieve them by communicating to an audience through appropriate and meaningful experiences. It combines developing, organizing and analyzing content into relevant and engaging messages, with creating exciting ways for visitors to experience this content. An interpretive plan establishes the communication process, through which meanings and relationships of the cultural and natural world, past and present, are revealed to a visitor through experiences with objects, artifacts, landscapes, sites, exhibits and people.\n\nTo effectively engage a visitor and achieve these objectives, as well as any other institutional objectives and requirements (financial, operational, environmental, etc.), an interpretive plan is built through addressing the following issues: \n\nThe resulting product provides a vision for the future of interpretation, education, and visitor experience opportunities.

{"id": "16224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16224", "title": "Jonah", "text": "Jonah\n\nJonah or Jonas is the name given in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh/Old Testament) to a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel in about the 8th century BCE. He is the eponymous central figure of the Book of Jonah, in which he is called upon by God to travel to Nineveh and warn its residents to repent of their sins or face divine wrath. Instead, Jonah boards a ship to Tarshish. Caught in a storm, he orders the ship's crew to cast him overboard, whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish. Three days later, after Jonah agrees to go to Nineveh, the fish vomits him out onto the shore. Jonah successfully convinces the entire city of Nineveh to repent, but waits outside the city in expectation of its destruction. God shields Jonah from the sun with a plant, but later sends a worm to cause it to wither. When Jonah complains of the bitter heat, God rebukes him.\n\nIn Judaism, the story of Jonah represents the teaching of \"teshuva\", which is the ability to repent and be forgiven by God. In the New Testament, Jesus calls himself \"greater than Jonah\" and promises the Pharisees \"the sign of Jonah\", which is his resurrection. Early Christian interpreters viewed Jonah as a type for Jesus. Later, during the Reformation, Jonah came to be seen instead as an archetype for the \"envious Jew\". Jonah is regarded as a prophet in Islam and the biblical narrative of Jonah is repeated, with a few notable differences, in the Quran. Mainstream Bible scholars generally regard the Book of Jonah as fictional and often at least partially satirical, but the character of Jonah may have been based on the historical prophet of the same name mentioned in .\n\nAlthough the word \"whale\" is often used in English versions of the Jonah story, the Hebrew text actually uses the phrase \"dag gadol\", which means \"giant fish\". In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the species of the fish that swallowed Jonah was the subject of speculation for naturalists, who interpreted the story as an account of a historical incident. Some modern scholars of folklore have noted similarities between Jonah and other legendary figures, such as Gilgamesh and the Greek hero Jason.\n\nJonah is the central character in the Book of Jonah, in which God commands him to go to the city of Nineveh to prophesy against it \"for their great wickedness is come up before me,\" but Jonah instead attempts to flee from \"the presence of the Lord\" by going to Jaffa (sometimes transliterated as \"Joppa\" or \"Joppe\"), and sailing to Tarshish. A huge storm arises and the sailors, realizing that it is no ordinary storm, cast lots and discover that Jonah is to blame. Jonah admits this and states that if he is thrown overboard, the storm will cease. The sailors refuse to do this and continue rowing, but all their efforts fail and they are eventually forced to throw Jonah overboard. As a result, the storm calms and the sailors then offer sacrifices to God. Jonah is miraculously saved by being swallowed by a large fish, in whose belly he spends three days and three nights. While in the great fish, Jonah prays to God in his affliction and commits to thanksgiving and to paying what he has vowed. God then commands the fish to vomit Jonah out.\n\nGod again commands Jonah to travel to Nineveh and prophesy to its inhabitants. This time he goes and enters the city, crying, \"In forty days Nineveh shall be overthrown.\" After Jonah has walked across Nineveh, the people of Nineveh begin to believe his word and proclaim a fast. The king of Nineveh puts on sackcloth and sits in ashes, making a proclamation which decrees fasting, the wearing of sackcloth, prayer, and repentance. God sees their repentant hearts and spares the city at that time. The entire city is humbled and broken with the people (and even the animals) in sackcloth and ashes.\n\nDispleased by this, Jonah refers to his earlier flight to Tarshish while asserting that, since God is merciful, it was inevitable that God would turn from the threatened calamities. He then leaves the city and makes himself a shelter, waiting to see whether or not the city will be destroyed. God causes a plant (in Hebrew a \"kikayon\") to grow over Jonah's shelter to give him some shade from the sun. Later, God causes a worm to bite the plant's root and it withers. Jonah, now being exposed to the full force of the sun, becomes faint and pleads for God to kill him.\n\nThe Book of Jonah (Yonah יונה) is one of the twelve minor prophets included in the Tanakh. According to one tradition, Jonah was the boy brought back to life by Elijah the prophet in . Another tradition holds that he was the son of the woman of Shunem brought back to life by Elisha in and that he is called the \"son of Amittai\" (\"Truth\") due to his mother's recognition of Elisha's identity as a prophet in . The Book of Jonah is read every year, in its original Hebrew and in its entirety, on Yom Kippur – the Day of Atonement, as the Haftarah at the afternoon mincha prayer. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the fish that swallowed Jonah was created in the primordial era and the inside of its mouth was like a synagogue; the fish's eyes were like windows and a pearl inside its mouth provided further illumination.\n\nAccording to the Midrash, while Jonah was inside the fish, it told him that its life was nearly over because soon the Leviathan would eat them both. Jonah promised the fish that he would save them. Following Jonah's directions, the fish swam up alongside the Leviathan and Jonah threatened to leash the Leviathan by its tongue and let the other fish eat it. The Leviathan heard Jonah's threats, saw that he was circumcized, and realized that he was protected by the Lord, so it fled in terror, leaving Jonah and the fish alive. The medieval Jewish scholar and rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra (1092 – 1167) argued against any literal interpretation of the Book of Jonah, stating that the \"experiences of all the prophets except Moses were visions, not actualities.\" The later scholar Isaac Abarbanel (1437 – 1509), however, argued that Jonah could have easily survived in the belly of the fish for three days, because \"after all, fetuses live nine months without access to fresh air.\"\n\nTeshuva – the ability to repent and be forgiven by God – is a prominent idea in Jewish thought. This concept is developed in the Book of Jonah: Jonah, the son of truth (the name of his father \"Amitai\" in Hebrew means truth), refuses to ask the people of Nineveh to repent. He seeks the truth only, and not forgiveness. When forced to go, his call is heard loud and clear. The people of Nineveh repent ecstatically, \"fasting, including the sheep,\" and the Jewish scripts are critical of this. The Book of Jonah also highlights the sometimes unstable relationship between two religious needs: comfort and truth.\n\nJonah is mentioned twice in the fourteenth chapter of the deuterocanonical Book of Tobit, the conclusion of which finds Tobit's son, Tobias, at the extreme age of 127 years, rejoicing at the news of Nineveh's destruction by Nebuchadnezzar and Ahasuerus in apparent fulfillment of Jonah's prophecy against the Assyrian capital.\n\nIn the New Testament, Jonah is mentioned in and and in . In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus makes a reference to Jonah when he is asked for a sign by some of the scribes and the Pharisees. Jesus says that the sign will be the sign of Jonah: Jonah's restoration after three days inside the great fish prefigures His own resurrection.\n\nJonah is regarded as a saint by a number of Christian denominations. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is on 21 September, according to the \"Martyrologium Romanum\". On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, Jonah's feast day is on 22 September (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian calendar; 22 September currently falls in October on the modern Gregorian calendar). In the Armenian Apostolic Church, moveable feasts are held in commemoration of Jonah as a single prophet and as one of the Twelve Minor Prophets. Jonah's mission to the Ninevites is commemorated by the Fast of Nineveh in Syriac and Oriental Orthodox Churches. Jonah is commemorated as a prophet in the Calendar of Saints of the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church on 22 September.\n\nChristian theologians have traditionally interpreted Jonah as a type for Jesus Christ. Jonah being in swallowed by the giant fish was regarded as a foreshadowing of Jesus's crucifixion and the fish vomiting Jonah out onto the beach was seen as a parallel for Jesus's resurrection. Saint Jerome equates Jonah with Jesus's more nationalistic side, and justifies Jonah's actions by arguing that \"Jonah acts thus as a patriot, not so much that he hates the Ninevites, as that he does not want to destroy his own people.\"\n\nOther Christian interpreters, including Saint Augustine and Martin Luther, have taken a directly opposite approach, regarding Jonah as the epitome of envy and jealousness, which they regarded as inherent characteristics of the Jewish people. Luther likewise concludes that the \"kikayon\" represents Judaism, and that the worm which devours it represents Christ. Luther also questioned the idea that the Book of Jonah was ever intended as literal history, commenting that he found it hard to believe that anyone would have interpreted it as such if it had never been included in the Bible. Luther's antisemitic interpretation of Jonah remained the prevailing interpretation among German Protestants throughout early modern history. J. D. Michaelis comments that \"the meaning of the fable hits you right between the eyes\", and concludes that the Book of Jonah is a polemic against \"the Israelite people's hate and envy towards all the other nations of the earth.\" Albert Eichhorn was a strong supporter of Michaelis's interpretation.\n\nJohn Calvin and John Hooper regarded the Book of Jonah as a warning to all those who might attempt to flee from the wrath of God. While Luther had been careful to maintain that the Book of Jonah was not written by Jonah, Calvin declared that the Book of Jonah was Jonah's personal confession of guilt. Calvin sees Jonah's time inside the fish's belly as equivalent to the fires of Hell, intended to correct Jonah and set him on the path of righteousness. Also unlike Luther, Calvin finds fault with all the characters in the story, describing the sailors on the boat as \"hard and iron-hearted, like Cyclops\", the penitence of the Ninevites as \"untrained\", and the king of Nineveh as a \"novice\". Hooper, on the other hand, sees Jonah as the archetypal dissident and the ship he is cast out from as a symbol of the state. Hooper deplores such dissidents, decrying: \"Can you live quietly with so many Jonasses? Nay then, throw them into the sea!\" In the eighteenth century, German professors were forbidden from teaching that the Book of Jonah was anything other than a literal, historical account.\n\nJonah (Arabic: يُونُس Yūnus) is the title of the tenth chapter of the Quran. He is traditionally viewed as highly important in Islam as a prophet who was faithful to Allah and delivered His messages. Jonah is mentioned four times in the Quran and is the only one of the Twelve Minor Prophets to be mentioned by name. In Surah 68:48, Jonah is called Dhul-Nun (Arabic: ذو النون; meaning \"The One of the Fish\"). In 4:163 and 6:86, he is referred to as \"an apostle of Allah\". Surah 37:139-148 retells the full story of Jonah:\n\nThe Quran never mentions Jonah's father, but Muslim tradition teaches that Jonah was from the tribe of Benjamin and that his father was Amittai.\n\nJonah is also mentioned in a few incidents during the lifetime of Muhammad. In some instances, Jonah's name is spoken of with praise and reverence by Muhammad. According to historical narrations about Muhammad's life, after ten years of receiving revelations, Muhammad went to the city of Ta’if to see if its leaders would allow him to preach his message from there rather than Mecca, but he was cast from the city by the people. He took shelter in the garden of Utbah and Shaybah, two members of the Quraysh tribe. They sent their servant, Addas, to serve him grapes for sustenance. Muhammad asked Addas where he was from and the servant replied Nineveh. \"The town of Jonah the just, son of Amittai!\" Muhammad exclaimed. Addas was shocked because he knew that the pagan Arabs had no knowledge of the prophet Jonah. He then asked how Muhammad knew of this man. \"We are brothers\" Muhammad replied. \"Jonah was a Prophet of God and I, too, am a Prophet of God.\" Addas immediately accepted Islam and kissed the hands and feet of Muhammad.\n\nOne of the sayings of Muhammad, in the collection of Imam Bukhari, says that Muhammad said \"One should not say that I am better than Jonah\". A similar statement occurs in a hadith written by Yunus bin Yazid, the second caliph of the Umayyad Dynasty. Umayya ibn Abi al-Salt, an older contemporary of Muhammad, taught that, had Jonah not prayed to Allah, he would have remained trapped inside the fish until Judgement Day, but, because of his prayer, Jonah \"stayed only a few days within the belly of the fish\".\n\nThe ninth-century Persian historian Al-Tabari records that, while Jonah was inside the fish, \"none of his bones or members were injured\". Al-Tabari also writes that Allah made the body of the fish transparent, allowing Jonah to see the \"wonders of the deep\" and that Jonah heard all the fish singing praises to Allah. Kisai Marvazi, a tenth-century poet, records that Jonah's father was seventy years old when Jonah was born and that he died soon afterwards, leaving Jonah's mother with nothing but a wooden spoon, which turned out to be a cornucopia.\n\nNineveh's current location is marked by excavations of five gates, parts of walls on four sides, and two large mounds: the hill of Kuyunjik and hill of Nabi Yunus (see map link in footnote). A mosque atop Nabi Yunus was dedicated to the prophet Jonah and contained a shrine, which was revered by both Muslims and Christians as the site of Jonah's tomb. The tomb was a popular pilgrimage site and a symbol of unity to Jews, Christians, and Muslims across the Middle East. On July 24, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) destroyed the mosque containing the tomb as part of a campaign to destroy religious sanctuaries it deemed to be idolatrous. After Mosul was taken back from ISIL in January 2017, an ancient Assyrian palace dating to around 600 BCE was discovered beneath the ruined mosque. ISIL had plundered the palace of items to sell on the black market, but some of the artifacts that were more difficult to transport still remained in place.\n\nOther reputed locations of Jonah's tomb include the Arab village of Mashhad, located on the ancient site of Gath-hepher, the Palestinian West Bank town of Halhul, north of Hebron, and a sanctuary near the city of Sarafand (Sarepta) in Lebanon.\n\nThe consensus of mainstream Biblical scholars holds that the contents of the Book of Jonah are entirely ahistorical. Although the prophet Jonah allegedly lived in the eighth century BCE, the Book of Jonah was written centuries later during the time of the Achaemenid Empire. The Hebrew used in the Book of Jonah shows strong influences from Aramaic and the cultural practices described in it match those of the Achaemenid Persians. Many scholars regard the Book of Jonah as an intentional work of parody or satire. If this is the case, then it was probably admitted into the canon of the Hebrew Bible by sages who misunderstood its satirical nature and mistakenly interpreted it as a serious prophetic work.\n\nWhile the Book of Jonah itself is considered fiction, Jonah himself may have been a historical prophet; he is briefly mentioned in the Second Book of Kings:\n\nMost scholars believe that the anonymous author of the Book of Jonah may have seized upon this obscure prophet from 2 Kings and used him as the basis for the fictional character of Jonah, but some have contended that the figure of Jonah himself is entirely legendary.\n\nThe views expressed by Jonah in the Book of Jonah are a parody of views held by members of Jewish society at the time when it was written. The primary target of the satire may have been a faction whom Morton Smith calls \"Separationists\", who believed that God would destroy those who disobeyed him, that sinful cities would be obliterated, and that God's mercy did not extend to those outside the Abrahamic covenant. McKenzie and Graham remark that \"Jonah is in some ways the most 'orthodox' of Israelite theologians – to make a theological point.\" Jonah's statements throughout the book are characterized by their militancy, but his name ironically means \"dove\", a bird which the ancient Israelites associated with peace.\n\nJonah's rejection of God's commands is a parody of the obedience of the prophets described in other Old Testament writings. The king of Nineveh's instant repentance parodies the rulers throughout the other writings of the Old Testament who disregard prophetic warnings, such as Ahab and Zedekiah. The readiness to worship God displayed by the sailors on the ship and the people of Nineveh contrasts ironically with Jonah's own reluctance, as does Jonah's greater love for \"kikayon\" providing him shade than for all the people in Nineveh.\n\nThe Book of Jonah also employs elements of literary absurdism; it exaggerates the size of the city of Nineveh to an implausible degree and incorrectly refers to the administrator of the city as a \"king\". According to scholars, no human being could realistically survive for three days inside a fish, and the description of the livestock in Nineveh fasting alongside their owners is \"silly\". The motif of a protagonist being swallowed by a giant fish or whale became a stock trope of later satirical writings. Similar incidents are recounted in Lucian of Samosata's \"A True Story\", which was written in the second century CE, and in the novel \"Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia\", published by Rudolf Erich Raspe in 1785. The story of a man surviving after being swallowed by a whale or giant fish is classified as ATU 1889G.\n\nThough it is often called a whale today, the Hebrew, as throughout scripture, refers to no species in particular, simply saying \"great fish\" or \"big fish\" (whales are today classified as mammals and not fish, but no such distinction was made in antiquity). While some biblical scholars suggest the size and habits of the great white shark correspond better to the representations given of Jonah's being swallowed, normally an adult human is too large to be swallowed whole. The development of whaling from the 18th century onwards made it clear that most, if not all, species of whale were incapable of swallowing a man, leading to much controversy about the veracity of the biblical story of Jonah.\n\nIn Jonah 2:1 (1:17 in English translations), the Hebrew text reads \"dag gadol\" (דג גדול) or, in the Hebrew Masoretic Text, \"dāḡ gā·ḏō·wl\" (דָּ֣ג גָּד֔וֹל), which means \"great fish.\" The Septuagint translates this phrase into Greek as \"kētei megalōi\" (κήτει μεγάλῳ), meaning \"huge fish\". In Greek mythology, the same word meaning \"fish\" (\"kêtos\") is used to describe the sea monster slain by the hero Perseus that nearly devoured the Princess Andromeda. Jerome later translated this phrase as in his Latin Vulgate. He translated \"kétos\", however, as \"ventre ceti\" in Matthew : this second case occurs only in this verse of the New Testament.\n\nAt some point \"cetus\" became synonymous with \"whale\" (the study of whales is now called \"cetology\"). In his 1534 translation, William Tyndale translated the phrase in Jonah 2:1 as \"greate fyshe\" and the word \"kétos\" (Greek) or \"cetus\" (Latin) in as \"whale\". Tyndale's translation was later incorporated into the Authorized Version of 1611. Since then, the \"great fish\" in Jonah 2 has been most often interpreted as a whale. In English some translations use the word \"whale\" for Matthew 12:40, while others use \"sea creature\" or \"big fish\".\n\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, naturalists, interpreting the Jonah story as a historical account, became obsessed with trying to identify the exact species of the fish that swallowed Jonah. In the mid-nineteenth century, Edward Bouverie Pusey, professor of Hebrew at Oxford University, claimed that the Book of Jonah must have been authored by Jonah himself and argued that the fish story must be historically true, or else it would not have been included in the Bible. Pusey attempted to scientifically catalogue the fish, hoping to \"shame those who speak of the miracle of Jonah's preservation in the fish as a thing less credible than any of God's other miraculous doings\".\n\nThe debate over the fish in the Book of Jonah played a major role during Clarence Darrow's cross-examination of William Jennings Bryan at the Scopes Trial in 1925. Darrow asked Bryan \"When you read that... the whale swallowed Jonah... how do you literally interpret that?\" Bryan replied that \"a God who can make a whale and can make a man and make both of them do what He pleases.\" Bryan ultimately admitted that it was necessary to interpret the Bible, and is generally regarded as having come off looking like a \"buffoon\".\n\nThe largest whales—baleen whales, a group which includes the blue whale—eat plankton and \"it is commonly said that this species would be choked if it attempted to swallow a herring.\" As for the whale shark, Dr. E. W. Gudger, an Honorary Associate in Ichthyology at the American Museum of Natural History, notes that, while the whale shark does have a large mouth, its throat is only four inches wide, with a sharp elbow or bend behind the opening, meaning that not even a human arm would be able to pass through it. He concludes that \"the whale shark is not the fish that swallowed Jonah.\"\n\nIn Turkish, \"Jonah fish\" (in Turkish \"yunus baligi\") is the term used for dolphins. A long-established expression among sailors uses the term, \"a Jonah\", to mean a sailor or a passenger whose presence on board brings bad luck and endangers the ship. Later, this meaning was extended to mean, \"a person who carries a jinx, one who will bring bad luck to any enterprise.\"\n\nDespite its brevity, the Book of Jonah has been adapted numerous times in literature and in popular culture. In Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick\" (1851), Father Mapple delivers a sermon on the Book of Jonah. Mapple asks why Jonah does not show remorse for disobeying God while he is inside of the fish. He comes to the conclusion that Jonah admirably understands that \"his dreadful punishment is just.\" Carlo Collodi's \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" (1883) features the title character and his father Geppetto being swallowed by a whale, an allusion to the story of Jonah. Walt Disney's 1940 film adaptation of the novel retains this allusion. The story of Jonah was adapted into Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki's animated film \"\" (2002). In the film, Jonah is swallowed by a gargantuan whale. The film was Big Idea Entertainment's first full-length theatrical release and, on its first weekend, it earned approximately $6.5 million.\n\nJoseph Campbell suggests that the story of Jonah parallels a scene from the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", in which Gilgamesh obtains a plant from the bottom of the sea. In the Book of Jonah, a worm (in Hebrew \"tola'ath\", \"maggot\") bites the shade-giving plant's root causing it to wither; whereas in the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", Gilgamesh ties stones to his feet and plucks his plant from the floor of the sea. Once he returns to the shore, the rejuvenating plant is eaten by a serpent.\n\nCampbell also noted several similarities between the story of Jonah and that of Jason in Greek mythology. The Greek rendering of the name Jonah is \"Jonas\", which differs from \"Jason\" only in the order of sounds—both \"o\"s are omegas suggesting that Jason may have been confused with Jonah. Gildas Hamel, drawing on the Book of Jonah and Greco-Roman sources—including Greek vases and the accounts of Apollonius of Rhodes, Gaius Valerius Flaccus and Orphic Argonautica—identifies a number of shared motifs, including the names of the heroes, the presence of a dove, the idea of \"fleeing\" like the wind and causing a storm, the attitude of the sailors, the presence of a sea-monster or dragon threatening the hero or swallowing him, and the form and the word used for the \"gourd\" (kikayon). Hamel takes the view that it was the Hebrew author who reacted to and adapted this mythological material to communicate his own, quite different message.\n\n\n\n"}

Clancy\n\nKathryn Bridges Harley Clancy (also known as Kate Clancy) is an American biological anthropologist who specialises in reproductive health. She is Associate Professor at the University of Illinois, in the Department of Anthropology. Her additional research and policy advocacy work focuses on sexual harassment in science and academia.\n\nClancy's fertility research focuses on menstruation and variability in endometrial function. Clancy's early published research demonstrated that, contrary to previous belief, menstruation does not increase risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Instead, Clancy and colleagues show that a thicker endometrium is associated with greater iron reserves amongst healthy women. Clancy's later studies focus on rural Polish populations. Clancy explores potential variation amongst endometrial function, or the functions of the inner mucous membrane layer of the uterus. Her research finds that endometrial thickness is negatively correlated over the latter phase of the menstrual cycle (the luteal phase).\n\nClancy's research contributes to understandings of fertility variation amongst normal, premenopausal Western women. For example, Swedish women appear to show an increase in endometrial thickness in the early part of the luteal phase, while for Canadian and English women, patterns appear largely stable at similar times. Canadian and Swedish women's endometrial thickness drops at other times, and while for Scottish sample, there is an increase. Clancy and colleagues' research suggests that endometrial thickness should be measured daily to better capture and study this variation.\n\nClancy has also made a broader contribution to the study of human evolutionary biology and ecological stress on ovaries and endometrial function. She finds that immune stress and psychosocial stress impacts on the endometrium's ability to carry a fetus through the mechanism of inflammation.\n\nClancy's later research focuses on primate development. She has also dispelled the myth that women's menstrual cycles can become synchronised due to their close social bonds.\n\nClancy is part of a team of anthropologists who led the Survey of Academic Field Experiences study, also known as SAFE13. The study, co-authored with Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and Katie Hinde, analysed experiences of sexual harassment and sexual assault in scientific fieldwork sites. The study found the majority of researchers had been exposed to, or experienced, sexual harassment, especially women and junior scientists.\n\nA follow-up study (known as \"SAFE 2\"), led by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy identified systemic patterns that lead to negative fieldwork experiences and harassment. Field sites that have clear codes of conduct and consequences for behaviour are less likely to lead to sexual harassment. Where problems arise, these sites deal with issues swiftly and consistently, leading to higher levels of perceived safety and equality. In fieldwork sites where clear rules and consequences do not exist or are ambiguous, leaders do not take action against harassment. This leads to ongoing alienation and professional retaliation.\n\nThe SAFE13 study and subsequent research and activities (media interviews, conferences and advocacy) have made significant impact on increasing awareness of institutional responses to sexual harassment, as well as policy reform. On 27 February 2018, Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science. Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science.\n\nIn 2017, Clancy led another study on sexual harassment in collaboration with Katharine M. N. Lee, Erica M. Rodgers and Christina Richey. The research involved an online survey of 474 astronomers and planetary scientists. It is the first study of its kind in the physical sciences, and it is the first large study to examine both gender and racial harassment in academic science.\n\nThe study finds that 88% of participants had heard negative language at work, along with other verbal and physical abuse that made them feel unsafe. Women of colour, however, experienced the greatest level of hostility due to their race and gender. They experienced greater incidents of gendered and racialised harassment and were more attuned to noticing other forms of harassment such as homophobia. Forty percent of women of colour feel unsafe at work due to their gender or sex, and 28% due to their race. Women of colour are also more likely to skip educational and professional opportunities, such as meetings and conferences, in an attempt to minimise exposure to hostility and harassment.\n\nThe study received wide media coverage, as it provided evidence on how harassment limits women's career outcomes, especially for racial minority women. Clancy also noted that the study unearths how survivors are re-traumatised by existing reporting systems that have no intermediary level of support in between staying silent and launching a formal report. The study has been commended for showing how racial discrimination compounds experiences of sexual harassment. The study also shows that the impact of harassment contributes to a higher loss of women of colour in science relative to White women scientists.

{"id": "226126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226126", "title": "Legalism (theology)", "text": "Legalism (theology)\n\nLegalism (or nomism), in Christian theology, is the act of putting the Law of Moses above the gospel, which is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, by establishing requirements for salvation beyond faith (trust) in Jesus Christ, specifically, trust in His finished work - the shedding of His blood for our sins, and reducing the broad, inclusive, and general precepts of the Bible to narrow and rigid moral codes. It is an over-emphasis of discipline of conduct, or legal ideas, usually implying an allegation of misguided rigour, pride, superficiality, the neglect of mercy, and ignorance of the grace of God or emphasizing the letter of law at the expense of the spirit. Legalism is alleged against any view that obedience to law, not faith in God's grace, is the pre-eminent principle of redemption. On the viewpoint that redemption is not earned by works, but that obedient faith is required to enter and remain in the redeemed state, see covenantal nomism.\n\nThe words 'legalism' or 'legalist' do not occur in the Old or New Testaments. Legalism's root word, \"law\" (Greek \"nomos\"), occurs frequently in the New Testament, and sometimes is interpreted as legalism. In 1921, Ernest De Witt Burton stated that in , \"\"nomou\" is here evidently used ... in its legalistic sense, denoting divine law viewed as a purely legalistic system made up of statutes, on the basis of obedience or disobedience to which individuals are approved or condemned as a matter of debt without grace. This is divine law as the legalist defined it.\" The Greek of Paul's day lacked any term corresponding to the distinct position of \"legalism\", \"legalist\", or \"legalistic\", leading C.E.B. Cranfield to commend \"the possibility that Pauline statements which at first sight seem to disparage the law, were really directed not against the law itself but against that misunderstanding and misuse of it for which we now have a convenient terminology\" (legalism). Messianic Jewish Bible translator David H. Stern cited these two scholars to support the translation framework that often \"<nowiki>'</nowiki>\"nomos\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> means 'legalism' and not God's \"Torah\"\", especially in Paul's constructs \"erga nomou\" (literally \"works of law\", rendered by Stern \"legalistic observance of \"Torah\" commands\") and \"upo nomon\" (literally \"under law\", rendered by Stern by 13 words, \"in subjection to the system which results from perverting the \"Torah\" into legalism\").\n\nOne concept of legalism, the belief that salvation can be earned by obedience to laws, is referred to in various New Testament books, including Galatians. In this case, some Jews who had become Christians believed that in order to obtain salvation, both faith in Christ (as Messiah), and obedience to the Mosiac laws were required, such as the cases of the circumcision controversy and the Incident at Antioch. Generally, however, these cases are referred to as the Judaizer controversy, rather than a legalism controversy, but the two are related.\n\nLegalism refers to any doctrine which states salvation comes strictly from adherence to the law. It can be thought of as a works-based religion. Groups in the New Testament said to be falling into this category include the Pharisees, Sadducees, Scribes, Judaizers, and Nicolaitans. They are legalists because they emphasized obeying the Law of Moses, in the case of the Pharisees and Scribes, to the letter without understanding the concept of grace. Jesus condemned their legalism in Matthew 23. The Pharisees love of the praises of men for their strict adherence is said to be a prime example of legalism.\n\nLegalism is sometimes confused with obedience. New Testament books such as Romans, speak of grace and obedience together. An example is found in Romans 1:5 (New American Standard Version) speaking of Christ 'through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles, for His name's sake...' The goal of receiving the grace was to bring about obedience of faith. Here grace, faith and obedience are tied together. Other references are in Acts 5:29, 32; Romans 16:19; 2 Corinthians 7:15; Hebrews 5:9.\n\nLegalism is also confused with discipline, which is often spoken of in a positive light. See 1 Corinthians 9:17; 1 Timothy 4:7; 2 Timothy 1:7 and Hebrews 12:5–11.\n\nA third common misunderstanding of legalism is the word law. Law in many places in the Bible refers to the Law of Moses, see also Biblical law in Christianity. In Galatians the Judaizers were trying to insist that salvation required that a person be circumcised prior to obeying the Law of Christ. Galatians 2:16 says, \"Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified\" (King James Version). The faith here is the Law of Christ and the law here is the Law of Moses. The legalism of the Judaizers was that obedience to the law of Moses was necessary to be saved.\n\nLegalism in the New Testament is believed by some as being revealed by the life of Saul prior to his conversion. Some believe that Saul sought to redeem himself by his works of persecution of the church and its ultimate destruction. Acts 26:9–11 reveals, \"I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities\" (King James Version). Galatians 1:13–14 states, \"For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers\" (King James Version). These two texts emphasize the nature of Saul's religion, works.\n\nHowever, in this passage the obedience is not tied to the obeying of specific Old Testament laws, such as keeping Sabbath or circumcision.\n\nAt the Council of Jerusalem, c. 50, James the Just decreed the \"Apostolic Decree\":\n\nThough the \"Apostolic Decree\" is no longer observed by many Christian denominations today, it is still observed in full by the Greek Orthodox. and it was a very effective philosophy during that time.\n\nIn Roman Catholicism, good works are done in service to God and one's neighbour, by faith working through love. In contrast, a severity in the imposition of, or overly scrupulous conformity to any rule of piety, may be charged with legalism.\n\nIn an attempt to resolve the dispute over legalism, the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification was a document issued in 1999 by Lutheran-Catholic clerical representatives, declaring a common belief in \"Sola gratia\", that grace alone can save the faithful, and that there is a \"progressive infusion\" of grace in the spirit of the believer.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox, for another example, rejects the satisfaction theory of the atonement as \"legalistic\". The satisfaction theory states that mankind's Original Sin violated God's law, resulting in all men being born guilty: an idea prevalent in the writings of Tertullian and Augustine of Hippo of the Western Church. Anselm formally developed the theory that the legal problem of guilt before the Law, required the legal solution of retribution, in order to achieve a just salvation. The solution was for God's son Jesus to willingly die on the Cross in place of humanity, thus allowing the legal penalty to be fully carried out, satisfying the justice of God, and thus clearing the way for mercy to be shown to sinners. The Eastern Orthodox charge that this theory is too dependent upon Roman legal concepts of retribution and justice. [citation needed]\n\nIn Protestant, Evangelical, Christian theology, especially in popular versions of the same, the charge of legalism is an accusation of overzealous adherence to the word of the Bible (as law) in all things said, established or accomplished in a believer's life (cf. bibliolatry). In that context, to apply the criticism of legalism to a theological position or religious attitude implies that the accused has overturned the Gospel of salvation through faith and new life in Jesus Christ and has instead substituted some principle of personal works of strict adherence to the word, through action, thought, or speech for the unearned grace of God.\n\nThroughout the history of Christianity, certain beliefs and practices have tended to draw charges of legalism. These include:\n\n\nSeveral underlying dynamics appear in these controversies. The permitted scope of veneration of material objects versus claims that such veneration is idolatry, affects the perceived sanctity of ritual spaces and objects, and therefore of the rituals and customs themselves. Teachings about the authority of the church, the sources of legitimacy of that authority, and the role of clergy versus the priesthood of all believers, also affect these debates.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "364575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=364575", "title": "Mock-heroic", "text": "Mock-heroic\n\nMock-heroic, mock-epic or heroi-comic works are typically satires or parodies that mock common Classical stereotypes of heroes and heroic literature. Typically, mock-heroic works either put a fool in the role of the hero or exaggerate the heroic qualities to such a point that they become absurd.\n\nHistorically, the mock-heroic style was popular in 17th century Italy, and in the post-Restoration and Augustan periods in Great Britain.\n\nThe earliest example of the form is the \"Batrachomyomachia\" ascribed to Homer by the Romans and parodying his work, but believed by most modern scholars to be the work of an anonymous poet in the time of Alexander the Great .\n\nA longstanding assumption on the origin of the mock-heroic in the 17th century is that epic and the pastoral genres had become used up and exhausted, and so they got parodically reprised. In the 17th century the epic genre was heavily criticized, because it was felt expressing the traditional values of the feudal society.\nAmong the new genres, closer to the modern feelings and proposing new ideals, the satirical literature was particularly effective in criticizing the old habits and values. Beside the Spanish picaresque novels and the French burlesque novel, in Italy flourished the \"poema eroicomico\". <br>\nIn this country those who still wrote epic poems, following the rules set by Torquato Tasso in his work \"Discorsi del poema eroico\" (\"Discussions about the Epic Poems\") and realized in his masterwork, the \"Jerusalem Delivered\", were felt as antiquated.<br>\nThe new mock-heroic poem accepted the same metre, vocabulary, rhetoric of the epics. However, the new genre turned the old epic upside down about the meaning, setting the stories in more familiar situations, to ridiculize the traditional epics. In this context was created the parody of epic genre.\n\n\"Lo scherno degli dèi\" (\"The Mockery of Gods\") by Francesco Bracciolini, printed in 1618 is often regarded as the first Italian \"poema eroicomico\".\nHowever, the best known of the form is \"La secchia rapita\" (\"The rape of the Bucket\") by Alessandro Tassoni (1622). <br>Other Italian mock-heroic poems were \"La Gigantea\" by Girolamo Amelonghi (1566), the \"Viaggio di Colonia\" (\"Travel to Cologne\") by Antonio Abbondanti (1625), \"L'asino\" (\"The donkey\") by Carlo de' Dottori (1652), \"La Troja rapita\" by Loreto Vittori (1662), \"Il malmantile racquistato\" by Lorenzo Lippi (1688), \"La presa di San Miniato\" by Ippolito Neri (1764).\n\nAlso in Italian dialects were written mock-heroic poems. For example, in Neapolitan dialect the best known work of the form was \"La Vaiasseide\" by Giulio Cesare Cortese (1612).<br> While in Romanesco Giovanni Camillo Peresio wrote \"Il maggio romanesco\" (1688), Giuseppe Berneri published \"Meo Patacca\" in 1695, and, finally, Benedetto Micheli printed \"La libbertà romana acquistata e defesa\" in 1765.\n\nAfter the translation of \"Don Quixote\", by Miguel de Cervantes, English authors began to imitate the inflated language of Romance poetry and narrative to describe misguided or common characters. The most likely genesis for the mock-heroic, as distinct from the picaresque, burlesque, and satirical poem is the comic poem \"Hudibras\" (1662–1674), by Samuel Butler. Butler's poem describes a \"trew blew\" Puritan knight during the Interregnum, in language that imitates Romance and epic poetry. After Butler, there was an explosion of poetry that described a despised subject in the elevated language of heroic poetry and plays. \n\n\"Hudibras\" gave rise to a particular verse form, commonly called the \"Hudibrastic.\" The Hudibrastic is poetry in closed rhyming couplets in iambic tetrameter, where the rhymes are often feminine rhymes or unexpected conjunctions. For example, Butler describes the English Civil War as a time which \"Made men fight like mad or drunk/ For dame religion as for punk/ Whose honesty all durst swear for/ Tho' not one knew why or wherefore\" (\"punk\" meaning a prostitute). The strained and unexpected rhymes increase the comic effect and heighten the parody. This formal indication of satire proved to separate one form of mock-heroic from the others. After Butler, Jonathan Swift is the most notable practitioner of the Hudibrastic, as he used that form for almost all of his poetry.\n\nPoet Laureate John Dryden is responsible for some of the dominance among satirical genres of the mock-heroic in the later Restoration era. While Dryden's own plays would themselves furnish later mock-heroics (specifically, \"The Conquest of Granada\" is satirized in the mock-heroic \"The Author's Farce\" and \"Tom Thumb\" by Henry Fielding, as well as \"The Rehearsal\"), Dryden's \"Mac Flecknoe\" is perhaps the \"locus classicus\" of the mock-heroic form as it would be practiced for a century to come. In that poem, Dryden indirectly compares Thomas Shadwell with Aeneas by using the language of \"Aeneid\" to describe the coronation of Shadwell on the throne of Dullness formerly held by King Flecknoe. The parody of Virgil satirizes Shadwell. Dryden's prosody is identical to regular heroic verse: iambic pentameter closed couplets. The parody is not formal, but merely contextual and ironic. (For an excellent overview of the history of the mock-heroic in the 17th and 18th centuries see \"the English Mock-Heroic poem of the 18th Century\" by Grazyna Bystydzienska, published by Polish Scientific Publishers, 1982.) \n\nAfter Dryden, the form continued to flourish, and there are countless minor mock-heroic poems from 1680 to 1780. Additionally, there were a few attempts at a mock-heroic novel. The most significant later mock-heroic poems were by Alexander Pope. Pope’s \"The Rape of the Lock\" is a noted example of the Mock-Heroic style; indeed, Pope never deviates from mimicking epic poetry such as Homer's \"Iliad\" and Virgil's \"Aeneid\" . The overall form of the poem, written in cantos, follows the tradition of epics, along with the precursory “Invocation of the Muse”; in this case, Pope's Muse is literally the person who prodded him to write the poem, John Caryll: “this verse to Caryll, Muse, is due!” (line 3). Epics always include foreshadowing which is usually given by an otherworldly figure, and Pope mocks tradition through Ariel the sprite, who sees some “dread event” (line 109) impending on Belinda. These epic introductory tendencies give way to the main portion of the story, usually involving a battle of some kind (such as in the \"Iliad\") that follows this pattern: dressing for battle (description of Achilles shield, preparation for battle), altar sacrifice/libation to the gods, some battle change (perhaps involving drugs), treachery (Achilles ankle is told to be his weak spot), a journey to the Underworld, and the final battle. All of these elements are followed eloquently by Pope in that specific order: Belinda readies herself for the card game (which includes a description of her hair and beauty), the Baron makes a sacrifice for her hair (the altar built for love and the deal with Clarissa), the “mock” battle of cards changes in the Baron’s favor, Clarissa’s treachery to her supposed friend Belinda by slipping the Baron scissors, and finally the treatment of the card game as a battle and the Baron’s victory. Pope’s mastery of the Mock-Heroic is clear in every instance. Even the typical apotheosis found in the epics is mimicked in \"The Rape of the Lock\", as “the stars inscribe Belinda’s name!” (line 150). He invokes the same Mock-heroic style in \"The Dunciad\" which also employs the language of heroic poetry to describe menial or trivial subjects. In this mock-epic the progress of Dulness over the face of the earth, the coming of stupidity and tastelessness, is treated in the same way as the coming of civilization is in the \"Aeneid\" (see also the metaphor of \"translatio studii\"). John Gay's \"Trivia\" and \"Beggar's Opera\" were mock-heroic (the latter in opera), and Samuel Johnson's \"London\" is a mock-heroic of a sort.\n\nBy the time of Pope, however, the mock-heroic was giving ground to narrative parody, and authors such as Fielding led the mock-heroic novel into a more general novel of parody. The ascension of the novel drew a slow end to the age of the mock-heroic, which had originated in Cervantes's novel. After Romanticism's flourishing, mock-heroics like Byron's \"Don Juan\" were uncommon.\n\nFinally, the mock-heroic genre spread throughout Europe, in France, in Scotland, in Poland, in Bohemia, in Russia. The most noted mock-heroic poems in French were \"Le Vergile Travesti\" (\"The disguised Vergil\") by Paul Scarron (1648–52) and \"The Maid of Orleans\" by Voltaire (1730). In macaronic Latin enriched with Scottish Gaelic expressions William Drummond of Hawthornden wrote \"Polemo-Middinia inter Vitarvam et Nebernam\" in 1684. The main author of mock-heroic poems in Polish was Ignacy Krasicki, who wrote \"Myszeida\" (\"Mouseiad\") in 1775 and \"Monacomachia\" (\"The War of the Monks\") in 1778. In the same language Tomasz Kajetan Węgierski published \"Organy\" in 1775-77. The Bohemian poet Šebestiàn Hnĕvkovský in 1805 printed two mock-heroic poems: \"Dĕvin\" in Czech and \"Der böhmische Mägderkrieg\" in German. In 1791 the Russian poet N. P. Osipov published (). Ivan Kotliarevsky's mock-epic poem Eneyida (Ukrainian: Енеїда), written in 1798, is considered to be the first literary work published wholly in the modern Ukrainian language.\n\n"}
{"id": "3209520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3209520", "title": "Oldest Dryas", "text": "Oldest Dryas\n\nThe Oldest Dryas was a climatic period, which occurred during the coldest stadial after the Weichselian glaciation in north Europe. In the Alps, the Oldest Dryas corresponds to the Gschnitz stadial of the Würm glaciation. The three “Dryas” periods (younger, older, oldest) are named for a marker species, \"Dryas octopetala\", detected in core samples of glacial ice and peat bogs. The Oldest Dryas corresponds to pollen zone Ia.\n\nThe period was between 16,050-13,050 BC, from Roberts, 1998. A date from Kilkeel, Northern Ireland, extends the start of the period to as early as 17,050 BC. A strong sequence of carbon-14 dates derived from layered material in the Hauterive/Rouges-Terres excavations on the northwest shore of Lake Neuchâtel in Switzerland, 1992–1993, places the end of the Oldest Dryas at about 12,700 BC, calibrated. The same date from Antarctica and the south China sea is 14,600 and 14,700, respectively, and a Greenland ice core indicates 14,500. David Miles refers to the Oldest Dryas as the last Heinrich event (H1) and dates it to between 16,500 and 14,500 years ago.\n\nThe ultimate standard to which all these dates are to be compared is the graph of the oxygen isotope ratio cycles, which gives change in isotope concentration on the y-axis, with time on the x-axis. The graph plots many events that are sharply defined, but others are not. The selection of a terminal point is sometimes partially arbitrary.\n\nThe end of the Oldest Dryas is sharply defined. The beginning is a long, gently sloping band, probably no earlier than 17,050 BC, but the date might be set later by approximately 1000 years. Data derived from isotope variation of nitrogen and argon trapped in Greenland ice gives a high-resolution date for the end of the oldest Dryas at the sharp temperature rise of 14.67 ky BP.\nThe complete sequence of late Pleistocene climatic periods, defined for Northern Europe, are the Oldest Dryas (stadial), the Bölling (interstadial), the Older Dryas (stadial), the Allerød (interstadial), and the Younger Dryas (stadial). The Holocene begins immediately afterward. The last three are also Blytt-Sernander periods.\n\nSometimes, the Older Dryas is missing, as in the Jura Mountains of France, or it is negligible in the evidence. In that case, the initial part of the sequence appears to be Oldest Dryas (cold), Bølling-Allerød (warm), Younger Dryas (cold). The Bølling-Allerød corresponds to the Windermere interstadial in Britain.\n\nOften, however, the apparently-missing Older Dryas is a problem of resolution in the evidence. Some scientists have undertaken high-resolution studies, which combine a variety of climatological methods. They, like the ones conducted on Owens and Mono Lakes, in California, usually detect the Older Dryas. Even when it is detected, it appears to be no more than a few centuries of slightly-cooler weather on the oxygen isotope ratio graph.\n\nDuring the Oldest Dryas, Europe was treeless and similar to the Arctic tundra, but much drier and grassier than the modern tundra. It contained shrubs and herbaceous plants such as the following:\nSpecies were mainly Arctic but during the Glacial Maximum, the warmer weather species had withdrawn into refugia and began to repopulate Europe in the Oldest Dryas.\n\nThe brown bear, \"Ursos arctos\", was among the first to arrive in the north. Genetic studies indicate North European brown bears came from a refugium in the Carpathians of Moldavia. Other refugia were in Italy, Spain and Greece.\n\nThe bears would not have returned north except in pursuit of food. The tundra must already have been well populated. It is likely that the species hunted by humans at Lake Neuchâtel in Switzerland by the end of the period were present during it. Here are other animals present:\n\nAves\n\nThe above birds are primarily maritime. They must have fed in the copious glacial waters of the north that were just beginning to be released.\n\nFish\nThe smaller mammals of the food chain inhabited the herbaceous blanket of the tundra:\n\nCricetidae\n\nLeporidae\n\nSciuridae\n\nIn addition to bears and birds were other predators of the following small animals:\n\nCarnivora\nHumans were interested in the large mammals, which included:\n\nAt some point, the larger mammals arrived: hyena, woolly rhinoceros, cave bear and mammoth.\n\nHuman cultures in Europe were Upper Palaeolithic and belonged to Cro-Magnon man. Neanderthals had long since disappeared by replacement or amalgamation with \"Homo sapiens\". The Magdalenian culture of reindeer hunters prevailed in Western Europe. From the Carpathians eastward, the Epigravettian continued the prior Gravettian. In Japan, the Jōmon culture had already become sedentary and was producing some food, and possibly grew rice, but it was not at all urban. It was manufacturing the first known pottery.\n\nOne of the most remarkable discoveries of the period was the domestic wolf, a distinct breed of \"Canis lupus\", with smaller teeth. The domestic dog, \"Canis familiaris\", also has been found. It is thought that the animals helped with the hunting, but they would, by the nature of the hunt, have gradually become adept at herding.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39301", "title": "Orientalism", "text": "Orientalism\n\nOrientalism is a term used by art historians and literary and cultural studies scholars for the imitation or depiction of aspects in West Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian and East Asian cultures. These depictions are usually done by writers, designers, and artists from the West. In particular, Orientalist painting, depicting more specifically \"the Middle East\", was one of the many specialisms of 19th-century academic art, and the literature of Western countries took a similar interest in Oriental themes.\n\nSince the publication of Edward Said's \"Orientalism\" in 1978, much academic discourse has begun to use the term \"Orientalism\" to refer to a general patronizing Western attitude towards Middle Eastern, Asian, and North African societies. In Said's analysis, the West essentializes these societies as static and undeveloped—thereby fabricating a view of Oriental culture that can be studied, depicted, and reproduced. Implicit in this fabrication, writes Said, is the idea that Western society is developed, rational, flexible, and superior.\n\nOrientalism refers to the Orient, in reference and opposition to the Occident; the East and the West, respectively. The word Orient entered the English language as the Middle French \"orient\". The root word \"oriēns\", from the Latin \"Oriēns\", has synonymous denotations: The eastern part of the world; the sky whence comes the sun; the east; the rising sun, etc.; yet the denotation changed as a term of geography. In the \"Monk's Tale\" (1375), Geoffrey Chaucer wrote: \"That they conquered many regnes grete / In the orient, with many a fair citee.\" The term \"orient\" refers to countries east of the Mediterranean Sea and Southern Europe. \"In Place of Fear\" (1952), Aneurin Bevan used an expanded denotation of the Orient that comprehended East Asia: \"the awakening of the Orient under the impact of Western ideas\". Edward Said said that Orientalism \"enables the political, economic, cultural and social domination of the West, not just during colonial times, but also in the present.\"\n\nIn art history, the term Orientalism refers to the works of the Western artists who specialized in Oriental subjects, produced from their travels in Western Asia, during the 19th century. In that time, artists and scholars were described as Orientalists, especially in France, where the dismissive use of the term \"Orientalist\" was made popular by the art critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary. Despite such social disdain for a style of representational art, the French Society of Orientalist Painters was founded in 1893, with Jean-Léon Gérôme as the honorary president; whereas in Britain, the term Orientalist identified \"an artist\".\n\nThe formation of the French Orientalist Painters Society changed the consciousness of practitioners towards the end of the 19th century, since artists could now see themselves as part of a distinct art movement. As an art movement, Orientalist painting is generally treated as one of the many branches of 19th-century academic art; however, many different styles of Orientalist art were in evidence. Art historians tend to identify two broad types of Orientalist artist: the realists who carefully painted what they observed and those who imagined Orientalist scenes without ever leaving the studio. French painters such as Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863) and Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904) are widely regarded as the leading luminaries of the Orientalist movement.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the term Orientalist identified a scholar who specialized in the languages and literatures of the Eastern world. Among such scholars were British officials of the East India Company, who said that the Arab culture, the culture of India, and the Islamic cultures should be studied as equal to the cultures of Europe. Among such scholars is the philologist William Jones, whose studies of Indo-European languages established modern philology. British imperial strategy in India favored Orientalism as a technique for developing good relations with the natives—until the 1820s, when the influence of \"anglicists\" such as Thomas Babington Macaulay and John Stuart Mill led to the promotion of Anglocentric education.\n\nAdditionally, Hebraism and Jewish studies gained popularity among British and German scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries. The academic field of Oriental studies, which comprehended the cultures of the Near East and the Far East, became the fields of Asian studies and Middle Eastern studies.\n\nIn the book \"Orientalism\" (1978), the cultural critic Edward Said redefined the term Orientalism to describe a pervasive Western tradition — academic and artistic — of prejudiced outsider-interpretations of the Eastern world, which was shaped by the cultural attitudes of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries. The thesis of \"Orientalism\" develops Antonio Gramsci's theory of cultural hegemony, and Michel Foucault's theorisation of discourse (the knowledge-and-power relation) to criticise the scholarly tradition of Oriental studies. Said criticised contemporary scholars who perpetuated the tradition of outsider-interpretation of Arabo-Islamic cultures, especially Bernard Lewis and Fouad Ajami.\n\nThe analyses are of Orientalism in European literature, especially French literature, and do not analyse visual art and Orientalist painting. In that vein, the art historian Linda Nochlin applied Said's methods of critical analysis to art, \"with uneven results\". In the academy, the book \"Orientalism\" (1978) became a foundational text of post-colonial cultural studies. Moreover, in relation to the cultural institution of citizenship, Orientalism has rendered the concept of \"citizenship\" as a problem of epistemology, because citizenship originated as a social institution of the Western world; as such, the problem of defining citizenship reconfigures the idea of \"Europe\" in time of crises.\n\nFurthermore, Said said that Orientalism, as an \"idea of representation is a theoretical one: The Orient is a stage on which the whole East is confined\" in order to make the Eastern world \"less fearsome to the West\"; that the developing world, primarily the West, is the cause of colonialism. Moreover, in \"Empire: A Very Short Introduction\" (2000), Stephen Howe agreed with Said that Western nations and their empires were created by the exploitation of underdeveloped countries, by the extraction of wealth and labour from one country to another country.\n\nThe Moresque style of Renaissance ornament is a European adaptation of the Islamic arabesque that began in the late 15th century and was to be used in some types of work, such as bookbinding, until almost the present day. Early architectural use of motifs lifted from the Indian subcontinent is known as Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture. One of the earliest examples is the façade of Guildhall, London (1788–1789). The style gained momentum in the west with the publication of views of India by William Hodges, and William and Thomas Daniell from about 1795. Examples of \"Hindoo\" architecture are Sezincote House (c. 1805) in Gloucestershire, built for a nabob returned from Bengal, and the Royal Pavilion in Brighton.\n\n\"Turquerie\", which began as early as the late 15th century, continued until at least the 18th century, and included both the use of \"Turkish\" styles in the decorative arts, the adoption of Turkish costume at times, and interest in art depicting the Ottoman Empire itself. Venice, the traditional trading partner of the Ottomans, was the earliest centre, with France becoming more prominent in the 18th century.\n\n\"Chinoiserie\" is the catch-all term for the fashion for Chinese themes in decoration in Western Europe, beginning in the late 17th century and peaking in waves, especially Rococo Chinoiserie, \"c.\" 1740–1770. From the Renaissance to the 18th century, Western designers attempted to imitate the technical sophistication of Chinese ceramics with only partial success. Early hints of Chinoiserie appeared in the 17th century in nations with active East India companies: England (the East India Company), Denmark (the Danish East India Company), the Netherlands (the Dutch East India Company) and France (the French East India Company). Tin-glazed pottery made at Delft and other Dutch towns adopted genuine Ming-era blue and white porcelain from the early 17th century. Early ceramic wares made at Meissen and other centers of true porcelain imitated Chinese shapes for dishes, vases and teawares (see Chinese export porcelain).\n\nPleasure pavilions in \"Chinese taste\" appeared in the formal parterres of late Baroque and Rococo German palaces, and in tile panels at Aranjuez near Madrid. Thomas Chippendale's mahogany tea tables and china cabinets, especially, were embellished with fretwork glazing and railings, \"c.\" 1753–70. Sober \"homages\" to early Xing scholars' furnishings were also naturalized, as the \"tang\" evolved into a mid-Georgian side table and squared slat-back armchairs that suited English gentlemen as well as Chinese scholars. Not every adaptation of Chinese design principles falls within mainstream \"chinoiserie\". Chinoiserie media included imitations of lacquer and painted tin (tôle) ware that imitated japanning, early painted wallpapers in sheets, and ceramic figurines and table ornaments. Small pagodas appeared on chimneypieces and full-sized ones in gardens. Kew has a magnificent garden pagoda designed by William Chambers. The Wilhelma (1846) in Stuttgart is an example of Moorish Revival architecture. Leighton House, built for the artist Frederic Leighton, has a conventional facade but elaborate Arab-style interiors, including original Islamic tiles and other elements as well as Victorian Orientalizing work.\n\nAfter 1860, \"Japonism,\" sparked by the importing of ukiyo-e, became an important influence in the western arts. In particular, many modern French artists such as Claude Monet and Edgar Degas were influenced by the Japanese style. Mary Cassatt, an American artist who worked in France, used elements of combined patterns, flat planes and shifting perspective of Japanese prints in her own images. The paintings of James Abbott McNeill Whistler's \"The Peacock Room\" demonstrated how he used aspects of Japanese tradition and are some of the finest works of the genre. California architects Greene and Greene were inspired by Japanese elements in their design of the Gamble House and other buildings.\n\nEgyptian Revival architecture became popular in the early and mid-19th century and continued as a minor style into the early 20th century. Moorish Revival architecture began in the early 19th century in the German states and was particularly popular for building synagogues. Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture was a genre that arose in the late 19th century in the British Raj.\n\nDepictions of Islamic \"Moors\" and \"Turks\" (imprecisely named Muslim groups of southern Europe, North Africa and West Asia) can be found in Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque art. In Biblical scenes in Early Netherlandish painting, secondary figures, especially Romans, were given exotic costumes that distantly reflected the clothes of the Near East. The Three Magi in Nativity scenes were an especial focus for this. In general art with Biblical settings would not be considered as Orientalist except where contemporary or historicist Middle Eastern detail or settings is a feature of works, as with some paintings by Gentile Bellini and others, and a number of 19th century works. Renaissance Venice had a phase of particular interest in depictions of the Ottoman Empire in painting and prints. Gentile Bellini, who travelled to Constantinople and painted the Sultan, and Vittore Carpaccio were the leading painters. By then the depictions were more accurate, with men typically dressed all in white. The depiction of Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting sometimes draws from Orientalist interest, but more often just reflects the prestige these expensive objects had in the period.\n\nJean-Étienne Liotard (1702–1789) visited Istanbul and painted numerous pastels of Turkish domestic scenes; he also continued to wear Turkish attire for much of the time when he was back in Europe. The ambitious Scottish 18th-century artist Gavin Hamilton found a solution to the problem of using modern dress, considered unheroic and inelegant, in history painting by using Middle Eastern settings with Europeans wearing local costume, as travelers were advised to do. His huge \"James Dawkins and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of Palmyra\" (1758, now Edinburgh) elevates tourism to the heroic, with the two travelers wearing what look very like togas. Many travelers had themselves painted in exotic Eastern dress on their return, including Lord Byron, as did many who had never left Europe, including Madame de Pompadour. The growing French interest in exotic Oriental luxury and lack of liberty in the 18th century to some extent reflected a pointed analogy with France's own absolute monarchy. Byron's poetry was highly influential in introducing Europe to the heady cocktail of Romanticism in exotic Oriental settings which was to dominate 19th century Oriental art.\n\nFrench Orientalist painting was transformed by Napoleon's ultimately unsuccessful invasion of Egypt and Syria in 1798–1801, which stimulated great public interest in Egyptology, and was also recorded in subsequent years by Napoleon's court painters, especially Antoine-Jean Gros, although the Middle Eastern campaign was not one on which he accompanied the army. Two of his most successful paintings, \"Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa\" (1804) and \"Battle of Abukir\" (1806) focus on the Emperor, as he was by then, but include many Egyptian figures, as does the less effective \"Napoleon at the Battle of the Pyramids\" (1810). Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson's \"La Révolte du Caire\" (1810) was another large and prominent example. A well-illustrated \"Description de l'Égypte\" was published by the French Government in twenty volumes between 1809 and 1828, concentrating on antiquities.\n\nEugène Delacroix's first great success, \"The Massacre at Chios\" (1824) was painted before he visited Greece or the East, and followed his friend Théodore Géricault's \"The Raft of the Medusa\" in showing a recent incident in distant parts that had aroused public opinion. Greece was still fighting for independence from the Ottomans, and was effectively as exotic as the more Near Eastern parts of the empire. Delacroix followed up with \"Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi\" (1827), commemorating a siege of the previous year, and \"The Death of Sardanapalus\", inspired by Lord Byron, which although set in antiquity has been credited with beginning the mixture of sex, violence, lassitude and exoticism which runs through much French Orientalist painting. In 1832, Delacroix finally visited what is now Algeria, recently conquered by the French, and Morocco, as part of a diplomatic mission to the Sultan of Morocco. He was greatly struck by what he saw, comparing the North African way of life to that of the Ancient Romans, and continued to paint subjects from his trip on his return to France. Like many later Orientalist painters, he was frustrated by the difficulty of sketching women, and many of his scenes featured Jews or warriors on horses. However, he was apparently able to get into the women's' quarters or harem of a house to sketch what became \"Women of Algiers\"; few later harem scenes had this claim to authenticity.\nWhen Ingres, the director of the French \"Académie de peinture\", painted a highly colored vision of a \"Turkish bath\", he made his eroticized Orient publicly acceptable by his diffuse generalizing of the female forms (who might all have been the same model). More open sensuality was seen as acceptable in the exotic Orient. This imagery persisted in art into the early 20th century, as evidenced in Henri Matisse's orientalist semi-nudes from his Nice period, and his use of Oriental costumes and patterns. Ingres' pupil Théodore Chassériau (1819–1856) had already achieved success with his nude \"The Toilette of Esther\" (1841, Louvre) and equestrian portrait of \"Ali-Ben-Hamet, Caliph of Constantine and Chief of the Haractas, Followed by his Escort\" (1846) before he first visited the East, but in later decades the steamship made travel much easier and increasing numbers of artists traveled to the Middle East and beyond, painting a wide range of Oriental scenes.\n\nIn many of these works, they portrayed the Orient as exotic, colorful and sensual, not to say stereotyped. Such works typically concentrated on Arab, Jewish, and other Semitic cultures, as those were the ones visited by artists as France became more engaged in North Africa. French artists such as Eugène Delacroix, Jean-Léon Gérôme and Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres painted many works depicting Islamic culture, often including lounging odalisques. They stressed both lassitude and visual spectacle. Other scenes, especially in genre painting, have been seen as either closely comparable to their equivalents set in modern-day or historical Europe, or as also reflecting an Orientalist mind-set in the Saidian sense of the term. Gérôme was the precursor, and often the master, of a number of French painters in the later part of the century whose works were often frankly salacious, frequently featuring scenes in harems, public baths and slave auctions (the last two also available with classical decor), and responsible, with others, for \"the equation of Orientalism with the nude in pornographic mode\"; (\"Gallery, below\")\n\nThough British political interest in the territories of the unravelling Ottoman Empire was as intense as in France, it was mostly more discreetly exercised. The origins of British Orientalist 19th-century painting owe more to religion than military conquest or the search for plausible locations for naked women. The leading British genre painter, Sir David Wilkie was 55 when he travelled to Istanbul and Jerusalem in 1840, dying off Gibraltar during the return voyage. Though not noted as a religious painter, Wilkie made the trip with a Protestant agenda to reform religious painting, as he believed that: \"a Martin Luther in painting is as much called for as in theology, to sweep away the abuses by which our divine pursuit is encumbered\", by which he meant traditional Christian iconography. He hoped to find more authentic settings and decor for Biblical subjects at their original location, though his death prevented more than studies being made. Other artists including the Pre-Raphaelite William Holman Hunt and David Roberts had similar motivations, giving an emphasis on realism in British Orientalist art from the start. The French artist James Tissot also used contemporary Middle Eastern landscape and decor for Biblical subjects, with little regard for historical costumes or other fittings.\n\nWilliam Holman Hunt produced a number of major paintings of Biblical subjects drawing on his Middle Eastern travels, improvising variants of contemporary Arab costume and furnishings to avoid specifically Islamic styles, and also some landscapes and genre subjects. The biblical subjects included \"The Scapegoat\" (1856), \"The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple\" (1860), and \"The Shadow of Death\" (1871). \"The Miracle of the Holy Fire\" (1899) was intended as a picturesque satire on the local Eastern Christians, of whom, like most English visitors, Hunt took a very dim view. His \"A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker's Courtship\" (1854–61) is a rare contemporary narrative scene, as the young man feels his fiancé's face, which he is not allowed to see, through her veil, as a Westerner in the background beats his way up the street with his stick. This a rare intrusion of a clearly contemporary figure into an Orientalist scene; mostly they claim the picturesqueness of the historical painting so popular at the time, without the trouble of researching authentic costumes and settings.\n\nWhen Gérôme exhibited \"For Sale; Slaves at Cairo\" at the Royal Academy in London in 1871, it was \"widely found offensive\", perhaps partly because the British liked to think they had successfully suppressed the slave trade in Egypt, also for cruelty and \"representing fleshiness for its own sake\". But Rana Kabbani believes that \"French Orientalist painting, as exemplified by the works of Gérôme, may appear more sensual, gaudy, gory and sexually explicit than its British counterpart, but this is a difference of style not substance ... Similar strains of fascination and repulsion convulsed their artists\" Nonetheless, nudity and violence are more evident in British paintings set in the ancient world, and \"the iconography of the \"odalisque\" ... the Oriental sex slave whose image is offered up to the viewer as freely as she herself supposedly was to her master – is almost entirely French in origin\", though taken up with enthusiasm by Italian and other painters.\n\nJohn Frederick Lewis, who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in Cairo, painted highly detailed works showing both realistic genre scenes of Middle Eastern life and more idealized scenes in upper class Egyptian interiors with no traces of Western cultural influence yet apparent. His careful and seemingly affectionate representation of Islamic architecture, furnishings, screens, and costumes set new standards of realism, which influenced other artists, including Gérôme in his later works. He \"never painted a nude\", and his wife modelled for several of his harem scenes, which, with the rare examples by the classicist painter Lord Leighton, imagine \"the harem as a place of almost English domesticity, ... [where]... women's fully clothed respectability suggests a moral healthiness to go with their natural good looks\".\n\nOther artists concentrated on landscape painting, often of desert scenes, including Richard Dadd and Edward Lear. David Roberts (1796–1864) produced architectural and landscape views, many of antiquities, and published very successful books of lithographs from them.\n\nRussian Orientalist art was largely concerned with the areas of Central Asia that Russia was conquering during the century, and also in historical painting with the Mongols who had dominated Russia for much of the Middle Ages, who were rarely shown in a good light. Nationalist historical painting in Central Europe and the Balkans dwelt on Turkish oppression, with battle scenes and maidens about to be raped.\n\nThe Saidian analysis has not prevented a strong revival of interest in, and collecting of, 19th century Orientalist works since the 1970s, the latter was in large part led by Middle Eastern buyers.\n\nAuthors and composers are not commonly referred to as \"Orientalist\" in the way that artists are, and relatively few specialized in Oriental topics or styles, or are even best known for their works including them. But many major figures, from Mozart to Flaubert, have produced significant works with Oriental subjects or treatments. Lord Byron with his four long \"Turkish tales\" in poetry, is one of the most important writers to make exotic fantasy Oriental settings a significant theme in the literature of Romanticism. Verdi's opera \"Aida\" (1871) is set in Egypt as portrayed through the content and the visual spectacle. \"Aida\" depicts a militaristic Egypt's tyranny over Ethiopia.\n\nIrish Orientalism had a particular character, drawing on various beliefs about early historical links between Ireland and the East, few of which are now regarded as historically correct. The mythical Milesians are one example of this. The Irish were also conscious of the views of other nations seeing them as comparably backward to the East, and Europe's \"backyard Orient\".\n\nIn music, Orientalism may be applied to styles occurring in different periods, such as the \"alla Turca\", used by multiple composers including Mozart and Beethoven. The American musicologist Richard Taruskin has identified in 19th-century Russian music a strain of Orientalism: \"the East as a sign or metaphor, as imaginary geography, as historical fiction, as the reduced and totalized other against which we construct our (not less reduced and totalized) sense of ourselves\". Taruskin concedes Russian composers, unlike those in France and Germany, felt an \"ambivalence\" to the theme since \"Russia was a contiguous empire in which Europeans, living side by side with 'orientals', identified (and intermarried) with them far more than in the case of other colonial powers\".\n\nNonetheless, Taruskin characterizes Orientalism in Romantic Russian music as having melodies \"full of close little ornaments and melismas\", chromatic accompanying lines, drone bass—characteristics which were used by Glinka, Balakirev, Borodin, Rimsky-Korsakov, Lyapunov, and Rachmaninov. These musical characteristics evoke \"not just the East, but the seductive East that emasculates, enslaves, renders passive. In a word, it signifies the promise of the experience of \"nega\", a prime attribute of the orient as imagined by the Russians. ... In opera and song, \"nega\" often simply denotes S-E-X a la russe, desired or achieved.\"\n\nOrientalism is also traceable in music that is considered to have effects of exoticism, including the \"japonisme\" in Claude Debussy's piano music all the way to the sitar being used in recordings by the Beatles.\n\nThe Romantic movement in literature began in 1785 and ended around 1830. The term \"Romantic\" references the ideas and culture that writers of the time reflected in their work. During this time, the culture and objects of the East began to have a profound effect on Europe. Extensive traveling by artists and members of the European elite brought travelogues and sensational tales back to the West creating a great interest in all things \"foreign\". Romantic Orientalism incorporates African and Asian geographic locations, well-known colonial and \"native\" personalities, folklore, and philosophies to create a literary environment of colonial exploration from a distinctly European worldview. The current trend in analysis of this movement references a belief in this literature as a mode to justify European colonial endeavors with the expansion of territory.\n\nIn his novel \"Salammbô\", Gustave Flaubert used ancient Carthage in North Africa as a foil to ancient Rome. He portrayed its culture as morally corrupting and suffused with dangerously alluring eroticism. This novel proved hugely influential on later portrayals of ancient Semitic cultures.\n\nSaid argues that the continuity of Orientalism into the present can be found in influential images, particularly through the Cinema of the United States, as the West has now grown to include the United States. Many blockbuster feature film, such as the \"Indiana Jones\" series, \"The Mummy\" films, and Disney's \"Aladdin\" film series demonstrate the imagined geographies of the East. The films usually portray the lead heroic characters as being from the Western world, while the villains often come from the East. The representation of the Orient has continued in film, although this representation does not necessarily have any truth to it.\n\nThe overly sexualized character of Princess Jasmine in \"Aladdin\" is simply a continuation of the paintings from the 19th century, where women were represented as erotic, sexualized male fantasies.\n\nIn \"The Tea House of the August Moon\" (1956), as argued by Pedro Iacobelli, there are tropes of orientalism. He notes, that the film \"tells us more about the Americans and the American's image of Okinawa rather than about the Okinawan people\".The film characterizes the Okinawans as \"merry but backward\" and \"de-politicized\", which ignored the real-life Okinawan political protests over forceful land acquisition by the American military at the time.\n\nKimiko Akita, in \"Orientalism and the Binary of Fact and Fiction in Memoirs of a Geisha\", argues that \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" (2005) contains orientalist tropes and deep \"cultural misrepresentations\". She states that \"Memoirs of a Geish]\" \"reinforces the idea of Japanese culture and geisha as exotic, backward, irrational, dirty, profane, promiscuous, bizarre, and enigmatic\".\n\nDuring the Romantic Period of the 19th century, ballet developed a preoccupation with the exotic. This exoticism ranged from ballets set in Scotland to those based on ethereal creatures. By the later part of the century, ballets were capturing the presumed essence of the mysterious East. These ballets often included sexual themes and tended to be based on assumptions of people rather than on concrete facts. Orientalism is apparent in numerous ballets.\n\nThe Orient motivated several major ballets, which have survived since the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. \"Le Corsaire\" premiered in 1856 at the Paris Opera, with choreography by Joseph Mazilier. Marius Petipa re-choreographed the ballet for the Maryinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1899. Its complex storyline, loosely based on Lord Byron's poem, takes place in Turkey and focuses on a love story between a pirate and a beautiful slave girl. Scenes include a bazaar where women are sold to men as slaves, and the Pasha's Palace, which features his harem of wives. In 1877, Marius Petipa choreographed \"La Bayadere\", the love story of an Indian temple dancer and Indian warrior. This ballet was based on Kalidasa's play \"Sakuntala\". \"La Bayadere\" used vaguely Indian costuming, and incorporated Indian inspired hand gestures into classical ballet. In addition, it included a 'Hindu Dance,' motivated by Kathak, an Indian dance form. Another ballet, \"Sheherazade\", choreographed by Michel Fokine in 1910 to music by Nicholas Rimsky-Korsakov, is a story involving a shah's wife and her illicit relations with a Golden Slave, originally played by Vaslav Nijinsky. The ballet's controversial fixation on sex includes an orgy in an oriental harem. When the shah discovers the actions of his numerous wives and their lovers, he orders the deaths of those involved. \"Sheherazade\" was loosely based on folktales of questionable authenticity.\n\nSeveral lesser-known ballets of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century also reveal Orientalism. For instance, in Petipa's \"Pharaoh's Daughter\" (1862), an Englishman imagines himself, in an opium-induced dream, as an Egyptian boy who wins the love of the Pharaoh's daughter, Aspicia. Aspicia's costume consisted of 'Egyptian' décor on a tutu. Another ballet, Hippolyte Monplaisir's \"Brahma\", which premiered in 1868 in La Scala, Italy, is a story that involves romantic relations between a slave girl and Brahma, the Hindu god, when he visits earth. In addition, in 1909, Serge Diagilev included \"Cleopatra\" in Ballet's Russe's repertory. With its theme of sex, this revision of Fokine's \"Une Nuit d' Egypte\" combined the \"exoticism and grandeur\" that audiences of this time craved.\n\nAs one of the pioneers of modern dance in America, Ruth St Denis also explored Orientalism in her dancing. Her dances were not authentic; she drew inspiration from photographs, books, and later from museums in Europe. Yet, the exoticism of her dances catered to the interests of society women in America. She included \"Radha\" and \"The Cobras\" in her 'Indian' program in 1906. In addition, she found success in Europe with another Indian-themed ballet, \"The Nautch\" in 1908. In 1909, upon her return to America, St Denis created her first 'Egyptian' work, \"Egypta\". Her preference for Orientalism continued, culminating with \"Ishtar of the Seven Gates\" in 1923, about a Babylonian goddess.\n\nWhile Orientalism in dance climaxed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it is still present in modern times. For instance, major ballet companies regularly perform \"Le Corsaire\", \"La Bayadere\", and \"Sheherazade\". Furthermore, Orientalism is also found within newer versions of ballets. In versions of \"The Nutcracker\", such as the 2010 American Ballet Theatre production, the Chinese dance uses an arm position with the arms bent at a ninety-degree angle and the index fingers pointed upwards, while the Arabian dance uses two dimensional bent arm movements. Inspired by ballets of the past, stereotypical 'Oriental' movements and arm positions have developed and remain.\n\nAn exchange of Western and Eastern ideas about spirituality developed as the West traded with and established colonies in Asia. The first Western translation of a Sanskrit text appeared in 1785, marking the growing interest in Indian culture and languages. Translations of the \"Upanishads\", which Arthur Schopenhauer called \"the consolation of my life\", first appeared in 1801 and 1802. Early translations also appeared in other European languages. 19th-century transcendentalism was influenced by Asian spirituality, prompting Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) to pioneer the idea of spirituality as a distinct field.\n\nA major force in the mutual influence of Eastern and Western spirituality and religiosity was the Theosophical Society, a group searching for ancient wisdom from the East and spreading Eastern religious ideas in the West. One of its salient features was the belief in \"Masters of Wisdom\", \"beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others\". The Theosophical Society also spread Western ideas in the East, contributing to its modernisation and a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.\n\nThe Theosophical Society had a major influence on Buddhist modernism and Hindu reform movements. Between 1878 and 1882, the Society and the Arya Samaj were united as the Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj. Helena Blavatsky, along with H. S. Olcott and Anagarika Dharmapala, was instrumental in the Western transmission and revival of Theravada Buddhism.\n\nAnother major influence was Vivekananda, who popularised his modernised interpretation of Advaita Vedanta during the later 19th and early 20th century in both India and the West, emphasising \"anubhava\" (\"personal experience\") over scriptural authority.\n\nThe term \"re-orientalism\" was used by Lisa Lau and Ana Cristina Mendes to refer to how Eastern self-representation is based on western referential points:\n\n\"Re-Orientalism differs from Orientalism in its manner of and reasons for referencing the West: while challenging the metanarratives of Orientalism, re-Orientalism sets up alternative metanarratives of its own in order to articulate eastern identities, simultaneously deconstructing and reinforcing Orientalism.\"\n\nThe term \"Occidentalism\" is often used to refer to negative views of the Western world found in Eastern societies and is founded on the sense of nationalism that spread in reaction to colonialism.\n\nThe action of \"othering\" cultures occurs when groups are labeled as different due to characteristics that distinguish them from the perceived norm. Edward Said, the author of the book \"Orientalism\", argued that western powers and influential individuals such as social scientists and artists othered \"the Orient\". The evolution of ideologies is often initially embedded in the language, and continues to ripple through the fabric of society by taking over the culture, economy and political sphere.\n\nMuch of Said's criticism of Western Orientalism is based on what he describes as articularizing trends. These ideologies are present in Asian works by Indian, Chinese, and Japanese writers and artists, in their views of Western culture and tradition.\n\nA particularly significant development is the manner in which Orientalism has taken shape in non-Western cinema, as for instance in Hindi cinema.\n\nSaid has been accused of Occidentalizing the west in his critique Orientalism, \"i.e.\" of being guilty of falsely characterizing the West in the same way that he accuses Western scholars of falsely characterizing the East. Said essentialized the west by creating a homogeneous image of the area. Currently, the west consists not only of Europe, but also the United States, which has become more influential and dominant over the years.\n\n\n\n"}

Paremiography, on the other hand, is the collection of proverbs. The proverb scholar Wolfgang Mieder defines the term \"proverb\" as follows:\n\nAs well as actual proverbs, the following may be considered proverbial phrases:\n\nTypical stylistic features of proverbs (as Shirley Arora points out in her article, \"The Perception of Proverbiality\" (1984)) are:\n\n\nIn some languages, assonance, the repetition of a vowel, is also exploited in forming artistic proverbs, such as the following extreme example from Oromo, of Ethiopia.\nSimilarly, from Tajik:\nNotice that in all of these cases of complete assonance, the vowel is , the most common vowel in human languages.\n\nAlso in Amharic, complete assonance is not infrequent when verbs are in the 3rd person masculine singular, past tense. The vowel <ä> is the most frequent vowel in the language.\n\nInternal features that can be found quite frequently include:\n\nTo make the respective statement more general most proverbs are based on a metaphor. Further typical features of the proverb are its shortness and the fact that its author is generally unknown.\nIn the article \"Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding\", Joseph Raymond comments on what common Russian proverbs from the 18th and 19th centuries portray: Potent antiauthoritarian proverbs reflected tensions between the Russian people and the Czar. The rollickingly malicious undertone of these folk verbalizations constitutes what might be labeled a \"paremiological revolt\". To avoid openly criticizing a given authority or cultural pattern, folk take recourse to proverbial expressions which voice personal tensions in a tone of generalized consent. Proverbs that speak to the political disgruntlement include: \"When the Czar spits into the soup dish, it fairly bursts with pride\"; \"If the Czar be a rhymester, woe be to the poets\"; and \"The hen of the Czarina herself does not lay swan's eggs\". While none of these proverbs state directly, \"I hate the Czar and detest my situation\" (which would have been incredibly dangerous), they do get their points across.\n\nProverbs are found in many parts of the world, but some areas seem to have richer stores of proverbs than others (such as West Africa), while others have hardly any (North and South America) (Mieder 2004b:108,109).\n\nProverbs are used by speakers for a variety of purposes. Sometimes they are used as a way of saying something gently, in a veiled way (Obeng 1996). Other times, they are used to carry more weight in a discussion, a weak person is able to enlist the tradition of the ancestors to support his position, or even to argue a legal case. Proverbs can also be used to simply make a conversation/discussion more lively. In many parts of the world, the use of proverbs is a mark of being a good orator.\n\nThe study of proverbs has application in a number of fields. Clearly, those who study folklore and literature are interested in them, but scholars from a variety of fields have found ways to profitably incorporate the study proverbs. For example, they have been used to study abstract reasoning of children, acculturation of immigrants, intelligence, the differing mental processes in mental illness, cultural themes, etc. Proverbs have also been incorporated into the strategies of social workers, teachers, preachers, and even politicians. (For the deliberate use of proverbs as a propaganda tool by Nazis, see Mieder 1982.)\n\nThere are collections of sayings that offer instructions on how to play certain games, such as dominoes (Borajo \"et al.\" 1990) and the Oriental board game go (Mitchell 2001). However, these are not prototypical proverbs in that their application is limited to one domain.\n\nOne of the most important developments in the study of proverbs (as in folklore scholarship more generally) was the shift to more ethnographic approaches in the 1960s. This approach attempted to explain proverb use in relation to the context of a speech event, rather than only in terms of the content and meaning of the proverb.\n\nAnother important development in scholarship on proverbs has been applying methods from cognitive science to understand the uses and effects of proverbs and proverbial metaphors in social relations.\n\n"}

{"id": "5669042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5669042", "title": "Pleorama", "text": "Pleorama\n\nThe best-known pleorama was a 19th-century moving panorama entertainment where the viewers sat in a rocking boat while panoramic views on painted canvas rolled past. The word has sometimes been used for other entertainments or innovations.\n\nArchitect Carl Ferdinand Langhans introduced a pleorama in Breslau in 1831 with scenes of the Bay of Naples on both sides of 24 \"voyagers\" sitting in a wooden boat floating in a pool of water. The illusion was enhanced by light and sound effects: the boatman singing, Vesuvius erupting. Writer/artist August Kopisch was involved in designing the hour-long show.\n\nCarl Wilhelm Gropius, who had a diorama exhibit in Berlin, took over management of this pleorama in 1832, and there was also a pleorama of a journey along the river Rhine. \n\nThe Swiss writer Bernard Comment, among others, has pointed out the similarities between Langhans' pleorama and the ambitious mareorama at the 1900 Paris Exhibition.\n\nA similar idea was used for a London \"padorama\" in 1834. Spectators were seated in railway carriages to watch a moving panorama of scenes visible from the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.\n\nIn 1850s Finland the name \"pleorama\" was given to shows which presented historic scenes and panoramic views using glass, but posters for these do not mention anything resembling Langhans' boat concept.\n\nThe name \"pleorama\" was coined from Greek elements. Like other 19th century novelties ending in \"-orama\" - diorama and cyclorama, for instance - the second half of the word has the sense of 'something seen'. The \"pleo-\" part here is understood to come from a Greek word meaning 'float' which applies to Langhans' boat in water idea. \"Pleorama\" is also the 21st century name of an innovative \"floating house\". \n\n\n"}

For the purposes of the act, political offices were divided into three classes:\n\nFor service in these offices there may be awarded pensions for life in the following scale: \n\nThe service need not be continuous, and the act makes provision for counting service in lower classes as a qualification for pension in a higher class. These pensions are limited in number to twelve, but a holder must not receive any other pension out of the public revenue, if so, he must inform the treasury and surrender it if it exceeds his political pension, or if under he must deduct the amount. He may, however, hold office while a pensioner, but the pension is not payable during the time he holds office. To obtain a political pension, the applicant must file a declaration stating the grounds upon which he claims it and that his income from other sources is not sufficient to maintain his station in life.\n\nThese pensions were not awarded on grounds of justice, contract or socio-economic merits, but as a political decision, in order to take a politically significant person and/or his dynasty (often deemed a potential political danger) out of the picture by paying him or her off, regardless of seniority. \n\nIn the history of the British Empire, the term applies to the following overseas native former ruling houses of princely states who saw their feudal territories annexed by the East India Company before it transferred power in British India to the Crown in 1858.\n\nAlthough politically important members could be relocated or exiled, they retained throughout India and until the end of the Raj a hereditary right to their former princely rank and titles (in several cases including a gun salute) as well as a monetary \"political pension\" in the form of a privy purse. Only a few years after India's independence in 1947, the nationalist government of the Indian Union 'persuaded' most of these princely heirs to relinquish their annual pensions on so-called patriotic grounds. For those who continued to receive the payments, the sums were reduced to a pittance through not compensating for inflation.\n\nMuslim pensioners :\n\nSeven Hindu thrones, at least three held by the Rajput Bhonsle family :\n\nOnly one Sikh pensioner : \n\nSimilar 'golden cage' arrangements were often made later by other (not only British) governments. An extreme case was the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, for whom the Italian island of Elba was turned into an operetta 'empire' until his escape, Cent Jours revolt and miserable banishment to St. Helena.\n\n"}
{"id": "181885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181885", "title": "Ribaldry", "text": "Ribaldry\n\nRibaldry, or blue comedy, is humorous entertainment that ranges from bordering on indelicacy to gross indecency. It is also referred to as \"bawdiness\", \"gaminess\" or \"bawdy\".\n\nSex is presented in ribald material more for the purpose of poking fun at the foibles and weaknesses that manifest themselves in human sexuality, rather than to present sexual stimulation either excitingly or artistically. Also, ribaldry may use sex as a metaphor to illustrate some non-sexual concern, in which case ribaldry may verge on the territory of satire.\n\nLike any humour, ribaldry may be read as conventional or subversive. Ribaldry typically depends on a shared background of sexual conventions and values, and its comedy generally depends on seeing those conventions broken.\n\nThe ritual taboo-breaking that is a usual counterpart of ribaldry underlies its controversial nature and explains why ribaldry is sometimes a subject of censorship. Ribaldry, whose usual aim is \"not\" \"merely\" to be sexually stimulating, often does address larger concerns than mere sexual appetite. However, being presented in the form of comedy, these larger concerns may be overlooked by censors.\n\nRibaldry differs from black comedy (or gallows humor) in that black comedy deals with topics which would normally considered painful or frightening whereas ribaldry deals with topics that would only be considered offensive.\n\nRibaldry is present to some degree in every culture and has likely been around for all of human history. Works like \"Lysistrata\" by Aristophanes, \"Menaechmi\" by Plautus, \"Cena Trimalchionis\" by Petronius, and \"The Golden Ass\" of Apuleius are ribald classics from ancient Greece and Rome. Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Miller's Tale\" from his \"Canterbury Tales\" and \"The Crabfish\", one of the oldest English traditional ballads, are classic examples. The Frenchman François Rabelais showed himself to be a master of ribaldry (technically called grotesque body) in his \"Gargantua\" and other works. \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\" by Laurence Sterne and \"The Lady's Dressing Room\" by Jonathan Swift are also in this genre; as is Mark Twain's long-suppressed \"1601\".\n\nAnother example of ribaldry is \"De Brevitate Vitae\", a song which in many European-influenced universities is both a student beer-drinking song and an anthem sung by official university choirs at public graduation ceremonies. The private and public versions of the song contain vastly different words. More recent works like \"Candy\", \"Barbarella\", \"L'Infermiera\", the comedic works of Russ Meyer, \"Little Annie Fanny\" and John Barth's \"The Sot-Weed Factor\" are probably better classified as ribaldry than as either pornography or erotica.\n\nA bawdy song is a humorous song that emphasises sexual themes and is often rich with innuendo. Historically these songs tend to be confined to groups of young males, either as students or in an environment where alcohol is flowing freely. An early collection was \"Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy\", edited by Thomas D'Urfey and published between 1698 and 1720. Selected songs from \"Wit and Mirth\" have been recorded by the City Waites and other singers. Sailor's songs tend to be quite frank about the exploitative nature of the relationship between men and women. There are many examples of folk songs in which a man encounters a woman in the countryside. This is followed by a short conversation, and then sexual intercourse, e.g. \"The Game of All Fours\". Neither side demonstrates any shame or regret. If the woman becomes pregnant, the man will not be there anyway. Rugby songs are often bawdy. Examples of bawdy folk songs are: \"Seventeen Come Sunday\" and \"The Ballad of Eskimo Nell\". Robert Burns compiled \"The Merry Muses of Caledonia\" (the title is not Burns's), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century. In modern times Hash House Harriers have taken on the role of tradition-bearers for this kind of song. \"The Unexpurgated Folk Songs of Men\" (Arhoolie 4006) is a gramophone record containing a collection of American bawdy songs recorded in 1959.\n\nBlue comedy is comedy that is off-color, risqué, indecent or profane, largely about sex. It often contains profanity or sexual imagery that may shock and offend some audience members.\n\n\"Working blue\" refers to the act of using curse words and discussing things that people do not discuss in \"polite society\". A \"blue comedian\" or \"blue comic\" is a comedian who usually performs risqué routines layered with curse words. \n\nThere is a common belief that comedian Max Miller (1894–1963) coined the phrase, after his stage act which involved telling jokes from either a white book or a blue book, chosen by audience preference (the blue book contained ribald jokes). This is not so, as the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" contains earlier references to the use of blue to mean ribald: 1890 \"Sporting Times\" 25 Jan. 1/1 \"\"Shifter wondered whether the damsel knew any novel blue stories.\" and 1900 \"Bulletin\" (Sydney) 20 Oct. 12/4 \"Let someone propose to celebrate Chaucer by publicly reading some of his bluest productions unexpurgated. The reader would probably be locked up.\"\"\n\nPrivate events at show business clubs such as the Bob Saget Club and The Masquers often showed this blue side of otherwise cleancut Bob Saget; a recording survives of one Masquers roast from the 1950s with Jack Benny, George Jessel, George Burns, and Art Linkletter all using highly risqué material and obscenities. Many comedians who are normally family-friendly might choose to work blue when off-camera or in an adult-oriented environment; Bob Saget exemplifies this dichotomy. Bill Cosby's 1969 record album records both his family-friendly evening standup comedy show, and his blue midnight show, which included a joke about impregnating his wife \"right through the old midnight trampoline\" (her diaphragm) and other sexual references.\n\nSome comedians build their careers on blue comedy. Among the best known of these are Redd Foxx, Lawanda Page, and the team of Leroy and Skillet, all of whom later performed on the family-friendly television show Sanford and Son. Page, Leroy, and Skillet specialized in a particular African American form of blue spoken word recitation called signifying or toasting. Dave Attell has also been described by his peers as one of the greatest modern-day blue comics. \n\nOn talk radio in the United States, many commentators use blue comedy in their political programs. Examples include Neal Boortz, Eric Von Haessler, Phil Hendrie and Steve Morrison.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58875000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58875000", "title": "Scandinavian law", "text": "Scandinavian law\n\nScandinavian law, alternatively known as Nordic Law is the law of the five Nordic countries, namely Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. It is generally regarded as a subgroup of civil law or as an individual legal body in itself. Prior to the 19th century, the European countries were independent in their administering and legality. However, in 1872, the Nordic countries organised legislative cooperation. Especially in areas of contracts and commerce, as well as those concerned with family, nationality and extradition, the five states have obtained uniform legislation.\n\nPrior to the establishment of Scandinavian states in the 9th century, the numerous regions were independent in their administration and legal matters. Initially, the legal system had no written laws; rather, it consisted of customary law that was developed and reformed by the citizens themselves at meetings known as “things”. Customary laws were recorded in writing between the 11th and 13th centuries. These include, the Gulathing’s law (11th century, Norwegian); the law of Jutland (1241, Danish); and the laws of Uppland (1296, Swedish) and Götaland (13th century, Swedish).\n\nThe early laws were not formatted as they are in modern-day legal systems, rather they used codes. These included private law, namely criminal law, family law, succession, property law, contract law, constitutional and administrative law. Laws relating to the Church were usually treated separate to laws of the states and people. The codes represented customary laws and usually, foreign influences were neglected. Mutual with Germanic laws, the provincial laws abided by externalities and thus, were more advanced. King Magnus’ Swedish code (1350) abolished the concepts of vengeance, stating that the king’s officials should be the necessary authorities in administering criminal proceedings and hold punishment for those who went against the law. Further, presumably by influence of the Christian religion, the legal system was introduced for the benefit of peasants and the helpless class.\n\nAlthough in 1380 Norway and Denmark were ruled by a common king – Olav IV, the two states maintained laws separate to one another. Before the acquisition by Frederick III in 1660, supplementary laws were introduced. During the rule of Christain V, a thorough process of codification took place, with the earlier laws being replaced by Christain V’s Danish Law (1683) and Norwegian Law (1687). These new laws were predominantly based on the existing laws of the two counties with influences of Germanic and Roman laws being fairly minor. Similar to the earlier laws, these new laws consisted of both public and private law. At the time of their drafting, these codes read well and reflected individual human rights and the ideologies of equality. Further, in comparison to the laws of other European countries, the criminal law provisions were fair, humane and reflected individual rights. \n\nIn Sweden, the laws issued by King Christopher in 1442 were affirmed by Charles IX in 1608. However, following the Danish-Norwegian reforms, a royal commission was assembled to draft a modern new code. The result being, “the Law of 1734”, declared by Frederick I. Held by Sweden in the 13th century, Finland followed the Swedish law of 1734, which was translated in Finnish as “Law of the Realm of Finland”.\n\nIn most of the five Nordic States, the old codes have developed by parliamentary statutes. However, in Sweden, the law of 1734 is still regarded as a formal framework. In the other countries, codes are no longer of importance, rather, comprehensive codification of public and private law holds importance. \n\nWhile the historic codes still hold significance in Scandinavia today, the developments in modern Scandinavia has led to growth in Scandinavian civil law by way of statutes. Although the five Nordic countries follow similar legal theories, they have developed their own legal standards. Nonetheless, the countries follow an agreement to cooperate on legislative matters. \n\nSince 1872 when the agreement was entered into, the organised legislative cooperation in Scandinavian law has progressively increased in significance. As such, the Nordic states have achieved uniform legislation, in fields of contracts, commerce, family, nation and extradition. \n\nScandinavian legal systems adopted their civil law conceptions through the influence of law schools and commercial and corporations law are similar to European laws. Further, modern social welfare and human rights legislation has strong connections with the international laws. Scandinavian law, with a foundation of its customary laws, is pliable and less authoritarian than other European legal systems as it is relatively less restrictive. The laws focus greatly on rules, principles and precedents that have developed in practice, especially in courts. Further, most laws are judge-made, and as the principle of stare decisis does not apply, the courts are open to reflect the ever-changing social conditions.\n\nAlthough each Nordic state follows either a common or civil law system, it is proclaimed that these Scandinavian countries have adopted jurisprudence that falls neither in the civil law system nor the common law system.\n\nAll five of the Nordic states have their own respective Constitutions upon which their legislative framework is based upon. Whilst these Constitutions are all separate in nature, due to the legal cooperation between the Scandinavian states, the Constitutions are similar in their aims and contribute to the laws holistically.\n\nNorway’s legal system is a civil law system. Therefore, legislation is the predominant source of law, however not the sole one. According to legal scholar and author Torstein Eckhoff, there are seven sources of Norwegian law, including:\n\n1. Legislation;\n2. Legislative history;\n3. Case law;\n4. Administrative practice;\n5. Customary law;\n6. Legal literature; and\n7. Equity\n\nDue to the Nordic legal cooperation, this list is not exhaustive. Laws are informed and correspond to the other Scandinavian states. The three distinctive sections of Norwegian law are the Constitution, then ordinary statutes and followed by the regulations derived from statutes \nNorway adopted its Constitution in 1814 and holds the position of the second oldest hand-written Constitution in the world which is still in use. The Constitution consists of a set of Norwegian laws based upon the legal principles of sovereignty, the separation and division of powers and universal human rights. \n\nThe Constitution forms three distinctive branches of government, including:\n\n1. Legislative power vested in the Storting;\n2. Executive power vested in the King in Council, Regjeringen; and\n3. Judicial power vested in the Supreme Court, the subsidiary courts and in the Court of Impeachment.\n\nArticle 49 and 75 of the Constitution highlight the principles of sovereignty whereby it states that the people of Norway issue laws, make decisions regarding the states’ funds, impose taxes and supervise authorities, including the Government, by way of the Storting.\n\nStated within Article 3 of the Constitution, the executive power is held by the King, or the Queen. However, according to Article 27, Royal laws are adopted by the King in Council. Such laws are validated by the Prime Minister, the political leadership upon which the constitutional and senatorial responsibility is bestowed. \n\nPublished by the Faculty of Law in Oslo and Fagbokforlaget, Norges Lover Norway’s most comprehensive code of law. It consists of one volume published annually and used by law students, legal professional and officers of the court. The code contains the Constitution, legislation in force, adopted legislation yet to take effect and also pre-1814 legislation which is still valid and in force. \n\nAs the Storting only passes entirely new Acts and abolishes the old Acts, amendments to legislation are integrated in the existing statutes. The Norges Lover follows a chronological order by date of enactment, excluding the Constitution, which is placed at the front of the code.\n\nSwedish law is a civil law system manifested on statutory laws. \n\nSweden’s Constitution consists of the four “fundamental laws”, consisting of:\n\n1. The Instrument of Government (1974);\n2. The Act of Succession (1810);\n3. The Freedom of the Press Act (1949); and\n4. The Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (1991)\n\nFurther to the above, there is also the Riksdag Act which translates to the Parliament Act (1974), however this is not classified as a law fundamental to the state. \n\nThe fundamental laws take precedence over all other laws. The written Constitution regulates the Riksdag – the Swedish Parliament, the appointing of Government officials and it sets out the key ways in which Sweden’s authorities shall function. \n\nThe Swedish Code of Statutes is Sweden’s official compilation of all laws enacted by the Riksdag and regulations issued by the Government. \n\nThis Code is enacted into statutory law, however it forms its own unified legal code containing all of the laws passed by the Government, including civil and criminal law, procedure, regulations, legal information and all other legal articles pertinent to Sweden. Although Sweden follows a civil law system, this Code of Statutes combines both statutory and civil law. The Code is amended frequently and amendments are integrated to the existing statutes. Similar to Norway, Sweden’s Constitution is placed at the front of its Code of Statutes.\n\nFinnish laws and legal traditions are influenced by Swedish law and holistically also the Scandinavian and German legal families. Based on civil law tradition, the law of Finland consists mostly of statutory law enacted by the Parliament of Finland. Finland’s Constitution takes supreme authority and sets out the procedures and guidelines for the application of legislation. Similar to other civil law systems, judicial decisions are generally not authoritative in nature and there is often not many judge-made laws. Further, Supreme Court decisions may be cited, however they are not actually binding. \n\nBeing a member of the European Union, Finland enacts many European Union laws and implements the European Union directives in its national laws. \nFinland’s Constitution came into force in 2000 and aims to regulate legislation and the manner in which government power is exercised. It specifies the primary rules, values and principles of the Finnish government and democracy. Furthermore, it details the significance of the relationship between the citizen and the government. In relation to the government, the Constitution governs the use of government power, the government organisation and the authorities and organs of the government.\n\nThe Danish legal system is a combination of public and civil law. This mix of law suggests that Danish law focuses on societal interests and also that the states organs are vested with greater authority than the courts in applying legal frameworks. \n\nThe legal system primarily consists of statutory regulation, principles and laws. Similar to the other Nordic states, although the courts have authority to create laws, the statutory law is supplemented by customary law and case law. Alike all other Scandinavian countries, the Constitution of Denmark is at the top of the legal hierarchy.\n\nAdopted in 1953, the principle aim of Denmark’s Constitution was to abolish monarchy by limiting the King’s power and introduce a system of democracy. It establishes the framework for governance by way of structure, procedure, power and the duties bestowed on the Danish Parliament. \n\nThe Danish Parliament known is not permitted to make laws which may invalidate or contradict the Constitutional Act. Although Denmark does not have a court to try constitutional matters, laws can be declared unconstitutional and void by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Denmark. \n\nIceland has a civil law system and therefore its main sources of law include the Constitution, statutory legislation and regulatory statutes. Complementing sources include precedent and customary laws followed by Scandinavia. \n\nThe most recent Constitution of Iceland is of 1999. It is regarded as the supreme law of Iceland and highlights the leadership structures of the country and preserves the human rights of its citizens.\n\nApart from the Constitution from which it is influenced and regulated, legislation in Iceland takes primacy as a source of law. The increasing propensity of social, economic and political trends has resulted in a greater significance of laws by way of new general acts targeting niche sectors such as customs, respect of children, banking, communication and corporations’ laws. \n\nThe Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law (SISL) proclaims that as all of the Nordic states follow the civil law system, Scandinavian law as a whole should be classified as civil law as opposed to common law. Due to the fact that common law has taken little precedence in the development of law in the Nordic countries and additionally that all legal concepts presently adopted in Scandinavian law have been derived from the civil Germanic law, the SISL views Scandinavian law as a civil law system.\n"}

This type of violence is due to gender norms and stereotypes. It can include verbal abuse, bullying, sexual abuse, harassment and other types of violence. SRGBV is widely spread around the world and is common in many societies. Millions of children and families suffer from this type of violence. Incidents related to SRGBV has been reported in all countries and regions of the world.\n\nMany governments and organizations around the world are working towards getting reliable information regarding SRGBV, as it has been proved to be an urgent matter that should be solved. Based on all the data related to SRGBV around the world collected, it is important to try to find solutions in order to tackle this problematic.\n\nFor instance, UNICEF's report \"Hidden in Plain Sight\" included the largest collection of data relating to violence against children. As aforementioned, this report proofs how physical and sexual abuse takes place at schools. The most common types of abuse include:\n\nSocial beliefs influence gender relations in all countries of the world. In this sense, the root of violence against children depends on social construction and how the populations behave vis-a-vis gender-related issues. Some of the root issues include:\n\nBeing exposed or having experienced SRGBV can have critical impacts on children's development. Especially in terms of mental and physical well-being, including children's health (HIV and early pregnancy). It has been demonstrated that victims of violence are more likely to accept aggressive types of behaviors or be violent themselves after suffering from violence. This creates a vicious circle in which violence becomes wrongly acceptable. SRGBV can have negative and long-term consequences for the future of young people, as it forges their adult personalities.\n\n\n\n\nAddressing SRGBV raises important challenges and is very complex. The concept is not understood by many and is considered sensitive for many. Actors from the education sector, governments and policy-makers and individuals attending schools face several challenges regarding SRGBV. These include:\n\nReporting on SRGBV situations around the world has become especially difficult since social and cultural norms do not promote this practice. Moreover, implicitly they discourage it. Many actors from society including teachers; school directors and policy-makers still avoid talking to children openly about gender; violence and sex. They fear promoting sensitive materials to children because of the taboo present in society. Work, time and patience are required to overcome set-ideas promoted by parents within their communities. It is necessary to start real and honest dialogues with children in order to create guaranty real and long-lasting results.\n\nGender inequalities refer to the devaluation and discrimination of women an girls in a society. This results on giving more power to men and boys, while demeaning women and girls. For instance, a study in Ethiopia highlighted that even though 93 per cent of male students recognized violence against girls to be illegal, about 33 per cent thought it is acceptable for male students to have what they want, and appeal to their charm or force to get. 21 per cent recognized behaving this way.\n\nCapacity constraints in education systems, are also responsible for slowing down the progress related to preventing SRGBV. One of the most important challenges is the training of teachers with the tools and sensitivity to teach curriculum against violence and promote gender equality. In order for real change to happen, it is necessary to introduce these new tools slowly, analyzing who is the best to communicate these elements and what skills and knowledge are needed. What's more, having enough resources will be very important to implement change.\n\nAnother factor that limits the progress related to stopping SRGBV is weak coordination and unreliable monitoring mechanisms. These render difficult the collaboration between ministries of education, police, social services, child protection and more. This is important because if this collaboration is not fluent, it will be difficult to stop SRGBV. A renewal in the organization's cultural landscape will be needed to overcome challenges, including bureaucracy that disrupts the flow of knowledge sharing.\n\nLimited access to quality services, including child protection an social services among others (often absent) are due to the quality of services. This particularly concerns fragile communities.\n\nIn the majority of countries, there is currently no legislation that protects children from violence at school, meaning not much can be done when it happens. However, it is the case that some countries have recently introduced legislations specifically for schools. This said, legislation related aspects have become a real challenge. As to stop SRGBV, perpetrators must be punished.\n\nEmerging, but limited, evidence base on what works, although this is an area that is receiving increasing attention. The few evaluations of SRGBV interventions that currently exist vary greatly in methodology, rigour, scale and scope. This makes it difficult to identify best practice and draw conclusions about effective strategies that can be transferred to other settings. There is also a growing body of promising practices and existing knowledge that has not yet been fully documented.\n\nAs previously mentioned, many challenges slow down the reporting and impact on the quality of providing reliable data regarding certain types of violence. This implies data is incomplete in contexts such as sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and disability among others. This is important as all of these contexts are important to fight against SRGBV. According to a recent study by USAID, to tackle SRGBV it is necessary to rely on large-scale studies which include findings that can be compared across countries; studies showing different forms of SRGBV, connections between behavior change and a discrepancy between research and practice. It is necessary to invest in strong data management system tools which divide data and will make it easier for people to analyze it.\n\nGovernments should demonstrate leadership at the national level by:\n\nIn order to render schools safer, it is important to adopt whole-school approaches that will create better environments for children. Also different types of stakeholders at the school level should become engaged at local communities and government. There are three specific strategies:\n\nAt the education sector level, students should be taught in a certain way and certain topics. In order to prevent SRGBV, it is important to: \n\n\nSRGBV being a very complex issue, it is necessary to involve many and several types of stakeholders. Thus it is about creating partnerships in order to tackle SRGBV:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "162707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162707", "title": "Singing", "text": "Singing\n\nSinging is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist (in jazz and popular music). Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, Indian music and religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues, gazal and popular music styles such as pop, rock, electronic dance music and filmi (film songs).\n\nSinging can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort or ritual, as part of music education or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction and regular practice. If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong. Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). They typically take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers.\n\nIn its physical aspect, singing has a well-defined technique that depends on the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply or bellows; on the larynx, which acts as a reed or vibrator; on the chest, head cavities and skeleton, which have the function of an amplifier, as the tube in a wind instrument; and on the tongue, which together with the palate, teeth, and lips articulate and impose consonants and vowels on the amplified sound. Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a vocal technique and are made to interact upon one another. During passive breathing, air is inhaled with the diaphragm while exhalation occurs without any effort. Exhalation may be aided by the abdominal, internal intercostal and lower pelvis/pelvic muscles. Inhalation is aided by use of external intercostals, scalenes, and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The pitch is altered with the vocal cords. With the lips closed, this is called humming.\n\nThe sound of each individual's singing voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's vocal cords but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body. Humans have vocal folds which can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of the chest and neck, the position of the tongue, and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in pitch, volume (loudness), timbre, or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body and an individual's size and bone structure can affect the sound produced by an individual.\n\nSingers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as vocal resonation. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of vocal registers. The primary method for singers to accomplish this is through the use of the Singer's Formant; which has been shown to match particularly well to the most sensitive part of the ear's frequency range.\n\nIt has also been shown that a more powerful voice may be achieved with a fatter and fluid-like vocal fold mucosa. The more pliable the mucosa, the more efficient the transfer of energy from the airflow to the vocal folds.\n\n\"Vocal registration\" refers to the system of vocal registers within the voice. A register in the voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in laryngeal function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns. Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular range of pitches and produces certain characteristic sounds. The occurrence of registers has also been attributed to effects of the acoustic interaction between the vocal fold oscillation and the vocal tract. The term \"register\" can be somewhat confusing as it encompasses several aspects of the voice. The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:\n\nIn linguistics, a register language is a language which combines tone and vowel phonation into a single phonological system. Within speech pathology, the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the vocal fry register, the modal register, the falsetto register, and the whistle register. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogues.\n\nVocal resonation is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound. There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the chest, the tracheal tree, the larynx itself, the pharynx, the oral cavity, the nasal cavity, and the sinuses.\n\n\"Chest voice\" and \"head voice\" are terms used within vocal music. The use of these terms varies widely within vocal pedagogical circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regards to these terms. Chest voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the vocal range or type of vocal register; a vocal resonance area; or a specific vocal timbre. Head voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the vocal range or type of vocal register or a vocal resonance area. In Men, the head voice is commonly referred to as the falsetto.\n\nThe first recorded mention of the terms chest voice and head voice was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the \"throat voice\" (pectoris, guttoris, capitis—at this time it is likely that head voice referred to the falsetto register) by the writers Johannes de Garlandia and Jerome of Moravia. The terms were later adopted within bel canto, the Italian opera singing method, where chest voice was identified as the lowest and head voice the highest of three vocal registers: the chest, passagio, and head registers. This approach is still taught by some vocal pedagogists today. Another current popular approach that is based on the bel canto model is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are divided into \"chest register\", \"head register\", and \"falsetto register\" and woman's voices into \"chest register\", \"middle register\", and \"head register\". Such pedagogists teach that the head register is a vocal technique used in singing to describe the resonance felt in the singer's head.\n\nHowever, as knowledge of physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at Indiana University and William Vennard at the University of Southern California, have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice. In particular, the use of the terms \"chest register\" and \"head register\" have become controversial since vocal registration is more commonly seen today as a product of laryngeal function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. They argue that the vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to vocal resonance, not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms \"chest voice\" and \"head voice\" over the term register. This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including speech pathology, phonetics, and linguistics. Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view. Also, some vocal pedagogists take ideas from both viewpoints.\n\nThe contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre. In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to the lower part of the modal register or normal voice. Within other forms of singing, chest voice is often applied throughout the modal register. Chest timbre can add a wonderful array of sounds to a singer's vocal interpretive palette.\nHowever, the use of overly strong chest voice in the higher registers in an attempt to hit higher notes in the chest can lead to forcing. Forcing can lead consequently to vocal deterioration.\n\nIn European classical music and opera, voices are treated like musical instruments. Composers who write vocal music must have an understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. Voice classification is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into voice types. These qualities include but are not limited to vocal range, vocal weight, vocal tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal registration. The science behind voice classification developed within European classical music has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including the German \"Fach\" system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.\n\nHowever, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: soprano, mezzo-soprano, and contralto. Men are usually divided into four groups: countertenor, tenor, baritone, and bass. When considering voices of pre-pubescent children an eighth term, treble, can be applied. Within each of these major categories, there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like coloratura facility and vocal weight to differentiate between voices.\n\nWithin choral music, singers' voices are divided solely on the basis of vocal range. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB, or soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). As a result, the typical choral situation gives many opportunities for misclassification to occur. Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers, there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.\n\nWithin contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as contemporary commercial music), singers are classified by the style of music they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music. Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy. The development of voice categorizations were made with the understanding that the singer would be using classical vocal technique within a specified range using unamplified (no microphones) vocal production. Since contemporary musicians use different vocal techniques, microphones, and are not forced to fit into a specific vocal role, applying such terms as soprano, tenor, baritone, etc. can be misleading or even inaccurate.\n\nVocal pedagogy is the study of the teaching of singing. The art and science of vocal pedagogy has a long history that began in Ancient Greece and continues to develop and change today. Professions that practice the art and science of vocal pedagogy include vocal coaches, choral directors, vocal music educators, opera directors, and other teachers of singing.\n\nVocal pedagogy concepts are a part of developing proper vocal technique. Typical areas of study include the following:\n\nSinging when done with proper vocal technique is an integrated and coordinated act that effectively coordinates the physical processes of singing. There are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: respiration, phonation, resonation, and articulation. These processes occur in the following sequence:\nAlthough these four processes are often considered separately when studied, in actual practice, they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.\n\nSince singing is a coordinated act, it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in intensively on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.\n\nOnce the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are:\n\nSinging is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Vocal exercises have several purposes, including warming up the voice; extending the vocal range; \"lining up\" the voice horizontally and vertically; and acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to sing wide intervals comfortably, singing trills, singing melismas and correcting vocal faults.\n\nVocal pedagogists instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.\n\nLearning to sing is an activity that benefits from the involvement of an instructor. A singer does not hear the same sounds inside his head that others hear outside. Therefore, having a wise guide who can tell a student what kinds of sounds he or she is producing guides a singer to understand which of the internal sounds correspond to the desired sounds required by the style of singing the student aims to re-create.\n\nAn important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Vocal pedagogists teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most vocal pedagogists believe in coordinating these processes by (1) establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice, and then (2) slowly expanding the range.\n\nThere are three factors that significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:\n\n\nMcKinney says, \"These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less.\"\n\nThe singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body are put in place. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the posture of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good posture allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good posture also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Vocal pedagogists have also noted that when singers assume good posture it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good posture. Habitual good posture also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.\n\nThere are eight components of the ideal singing posture:\n\n\nNatural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing, there are four stages of breathing: a breathing-in period (inhalation); a setting up controls period (suspension); a controlled exhalation period (phonation); and a recovery period.\n\nThese stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.\n\nVibrato is a technique in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver. Vibrato is the pulse or wave in a sustained tone. Vibrato occurs naturally and is the result of proper breath support and a relaxed vocal apparatus. Some studies have shown that vibrato is the result of a neuromuscular tremor in the vocal folds. In 1922 Max Schoen was the first to make the comparison of vibrato to a tremor due to change in amplitude, lack of automatic control and it being half the rate of normal muscular discharge. Some singers use vibrato as a means of expression. Many successful artists can sing a deep, rich vibrato.\n\nVocal music is music performed by one or more singers, which are typically called songs, and which may be performed with or without instrumental accompaniment, in which singing provides the main focus of the piece. Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music since it does not require any instrument or equipment besides the voice. All musical cultures have some form of vocal music and there are many long-standing singing traditions throughout the world's cultures.Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered as instrumental music. For example, some blues rock songs may have a short, simple call-and-response chorus, but the emphasis in the song is on the instrumental melodies and improvisation. Vocal music typically features sung words called lyrics, although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables or noises, sometimes as musical onomatopoeia. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a song, although, in classical music, terms such as aria are typically used.\n\nVocal music is written in many different forms and styles which are often labeled within a particular genre of music. These genres include Indian classical music, Art music, popular music, traditional music, regional and national music, and fusions of those genres. Within these larger genres are many subgenres. For example, popular music would encompass blues, jazz, country music, easy listening, hip hop, rock music, and several other genres. There may also be a subgenre within a subgenre such as vocalese and scat singing in jazz.\n\nIn many modern pop musical groups, a lead singer performs the primary vocals or melody of a song, as opposed to a backing singer who sings backup vocals or the harmony of a song. Backing vocalists sing some, but usually not all, parts of the song often singing only in a song's refrain or humming in the background. An exception is five-part gospel a cappella music, where the lead is the highest of the five voices and sings a descant and not the melody. Some artists may sing both the lead and backing vocals on audio recordings by overlapping recorded vocal tracks.\n\nPopular music includes a range of vocal styles. Hip-hop uses rapping, the rhythmic delivery of rhymes in a rhythmic speech over a beat or without accompaniment. Some types of rapping consist mostly or entirely of speech and chanting, like the Jamaican \"toasting\". In some types of rapping, the performers may interpolate short sung or half-sung passages. Blues singing is based on the use of the blue notes–notes sung at a slightly lower pitch than that of the major scale for expressive purposes. In heavy metal and hardcore punk subgenres, vocal styles can include techniques such as screams, shouts, and unusual sounds such as the \"death growl\".\n\nOne difference between live performances in the popular and Classical genres is that whereas Classical performers often sing without amplification in small- to mid-size halls, in popular music, a microphone and PA system (amplifier and speakers) are used in almost all performance venues, even a small coffee house. The use of the microphone has had several impacts on popular music. For one, it facilitated the development of intimate, expressive singing styles such as \"crooning\" which would not have enough projection and volume if done without a microphone. As well, pop singers who use microphones can do a range of other vocal styles that would not project without amplification, such as making whispering sounds, humming, and mixing half-sung and sung tones. As well, some performers use the microphone's response patterns to create effects, such as bringing the mic very close to the mouth to get an enhanced bass response, or, in the case of hip-hop beatboxers, doing plosive \"p\" and \"b\" sounds into the mic to create percussive effects. It n the 2000s, controversy arose over the widespread use of electronic Auto-Tune pitch correction devices with recorded and live popular music vocals. Controversy has also arisen due to cases where pop singers have been found to be lip-syncing to a pre-recorded recording of their vocal performance or, in the case of the controversial act Milli Vanilli, lip-syncing to tracks recorded by other uncredited singers.\n\nWhile some bands use backup singers who only sing when they are onstage, it is common for backup singers in popular music to have other roles. In many rock and metal bands, the musicians doing backup vocals also play instruments, such as rhythm guitar, electric bass, or drums. In Latin or Afro-Cuban groups, backup singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and hip-hop groups and in musical theater, the backup singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.\n\nThe salaries and working conditions for vocalists vary a great deal. While jobs in other music fields such as music education tend to be based on full-time, salaried positions, singing jobs tend to be based on contracts for individual shows or performances, or for a sequence of shows\n\nAspiring singers and vocalists must have musical skill, an excellent voice, the ability to work with people, and a sense of showmanship and drama. Additionally, singers need to have the ambition and drive to continually study and improve,\nProfessional singers continue to seek out vocal coaching to hone their skills, extend their range, and learn new styles. As well, aspiring singers need to gain specialized skills in the vocal techniques used to interpret songs, learn about the vocal literature from their chosen style of music, and gain skills in choral music techniques, sight singing and memorizing songs, and vocal exercises.\n\nIn order to become independent and survive the competitive atmosphere and stay for a longer time and have a long career, singers must learn the skill of Music composing, Music producing and Lyrics writing, they should take advantage of social media platforms like YouTube and upload their musical contents. Many musicians gained popularity because of social media and got recognition, example Justin Bieber. After getting recognition and popularity for their \"original\" or \"cover\" songs, they can get offers for doing Live shows from the event organisers, which is a large source of income for musicians across the world, YouTube also pays if the channel of the singer in YouTube is popular and have significant amount of subscribers and viewership. This they can also monetise (earn revenues) from Streaming apps.\nThey must also take steps to market themselves to buyers of vocal talent, by doing auditions in front of an Music Director. Depending on the style of vocal music that a person has trained in, the \"talent buyers\" that they seek out may be Record company, A&R representatives, Music Director, choir directors, nightclub managers, or concert promoters. A CD or DVD with excerpts of vocal performances. Some singers hire an agent or manager to help them to seek out engagements and other performance opportunities; the agent or manager is often paid by receiving a percentage of the fees that the singer gets from performing onstage.\n\nIn recent years, the talent of singing has become competitive. Currently, there are several television shows that showcase these talents. \"American Idol\" was one of the prominent of these shows. Debuted in 2002, it was one of the first singing competition shows.The first singing reality show was Sa Re Ga Ma Pa launched by Zee TV in the 1995. At the American Idol Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they can move on to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. In order to move on to the next round, the contestants fate is determined by public vote. \"The Voice\" is another well-known singing competition program. Similar to \"American Idol\", the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include \"The X Factor\", \"America's Got Talent\", \"Rising Star\" and \"The Sing-Off\".\n\nScientific studies suggest that singing can have positive effects on people's health. A preliminary study based on self-reported data from a survey of students participating in choral singing found perceived benefits including increased lung capacity, improved mood, stress reduction, as well as perceived social and spiritual benefits. However, one much older study of lung capacity compared those with professional vocal training to those without, and failed to back up the claims of increased lung capacity. Singing may positively influence the immune system through the reduction of stress. One study found that both singing and listening to choral music reduces the level of stress hormones and increases immune function.\n\nA multinational collaboration to study the connection between singing and health was established in 2009, called \"Advancing Interdisciplinary Research in Singing\" (AIRS). Singing provides physical, cognitive, and emotional benefits to participants. When they step on stage, many singers forget their worries and focus solely on the song. Singing is becoming a more widely known method of increasing an individual's overall health and wellness, in turn helping them to battle diseases such as cancer more effectively due to decreased stress, releasing of endorphin's, and increased lung capacity.\n\nJohn Daniel Scott, among others, have cited that \"people who sing are more likely to be happy.\" This is because \"singing elevates the levels of neurotransmitters which are associated with pleasure and well being.\" Humans have a long prehistory of music, especially singing; before written language, stories were passed down through song, because song is often more memorable. There is also evidence that music or singing may have evolved in humans before language. Levitin, in his \"This is Your Brain on Music\", argues that \"music may be the activity that prepared our pre-human ancestors for speech communication\" and that \"singing ... might have helped our species to refine motor skills, paving the way for the development of the exquisitely fine muscle control required for vocal ... speech\" (260). On the other hand, he cites Pinker, who \"argued that language is an adaptation and music is its Spandrel ... an evolutionary accident piggybacking on language\" (248).\n\nStudies have found evidence suggesting the mental, as well as physical, benefits of singing. When conducting a study with 21 members of a choir at three different points over one year, three themes suggested three areas of benefits; the social impact (connectedness with others), personal impact (positive emotions, self-perception, etc.), and functional outcomes (health benefits of being in the choir). Findings showed that a sense of wellbeing is associated with singing, by uplifting the mood of the participants and releasing endorphins in the brain. Many singers also reported that the singing helped then regulate stress and relax, allowing them to deal better with their daily lives. From a social perspective, approval from the audience, and interaction with other choir members in a positive manner is also beneficial.\n\nSinging is beneficial for pregnant mothers. By giving them another medium of communication with their newborns, mothers in one study reported feelings of love and affection when singing to their unborn children. They also reported feeling more relaxed than ever before during their stressful pregnancy. A song can have nostalgic significance by reminding a singer of the past, and momentarily transport them, allowing them to focus on singing and embrace the activity as an escape from their daily lives and problems.\n\nA recent study by Tenovus Cancer Care found that singing in a choir for just one hour boosts levels of immune proteins in cancer patients and has a positive overall effect on the health of patients. The study explores the possibility that singing could help put patients in the best mental and physical shape to receive the treatment they need, by reducing stress hormones, and increasing quantities of cytokines- proteins of the immune system that can increase the body's ability to fight disease. \"Singing gives you physical benefits like breath control and muscle movement and enunciation, as well as the learning benefits of processing information\" says a musical director and accompanist in the study. The enunciation and speech benefits tie into the language benefits detailed below.\n\nA recent newspaper article by the \"Toronto Star\" states that everyone to sing, even if they are not musically talented, because of the benefits it has for the health of the individual. Singing lowers blood pressure by releasing pent up emotions, boosting relaxation and reminding them of happy times. It also allows singers to breathe more easily. Patients with lung disease and chronic pulmonary disease experience relief from their symptoms from singing just two times a week. In addition to breathing related illness, singing also has numerous benefits for stroke victims when it comes to relearning the ability to speak and communicate by singing their thoughts. Singing activates the right side of the brain when the left side cannot function (the left side is the area of the brain responsible for speech), so it is easy to see how singing can be an excellent alternative to speech while the victim heals.\n\nEvery natural or non natural language has its own intrinsic musicality which affects singing by means of pitch, phrasing and accent.\n\nMuch research has been done recently on the link between music and language, especially singing. It is becoming increasingly clear that these two processes are very much alike, and yet also different. Levitin describes how, beginning with the eardrum, sound waves are translated into pitch, or a tonotopic map, and then shortly thereafter \"speech and music probably diverge into separate processing circuits\" (130). There is evidence that neural circuits used for music and language may start out in infants undifferentiated. There are several areas of the brain that are used for both language and music. For example, Brodmann Area 47. Levitin recounts how in certain studies, \"listening to music and attending its syntactic features,\" similar to the syntactic processes in language, activated this part of the brain. In addition, \"musical syntax ... has been localized to ... areas adjacent to and overlapping with those regions that process speech syntax, such as Broca's area\" and \"the regions involved in musical semantics .. appear to be [localized] near Wernicke's area.\" Both Broca's area and Wernicke's area are important steps in language processing and production.\n\nSinging has been shown to help stroke victims recover speech. According to neurologist Gottfried Schlaug, there is a corresponding area to that of speech, which resides in the left hemisphere, on the right side of the brain. This is casually known as the \"singing center.\" By teaching stroke victims to sing their words, this can help train this area of the brain for speech. In support of this theory, Levitin asserts that \"regional specificity,\" such as that for speech, \"may be temporary, as the processing centers for important mental functions actually move to other regions after trauma or brain damage.\" Thus in the right hemisphere of the brain, the \"singing center\" may be retrained to help produce speech.\n\nThe speaking dialect or accent of a person may differ greatly from the general singing accent that a person uses while singing. When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that is used in the style of music they are singing in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent of a person than where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.\n\nScholars agree that singing is strongly present in many different species. Wide dispersal of singing behavior among very different animal species, like birds, gibbons, whales, and many others strongly suggests that singing appeared independently in different species. Currently, there are about 5400 species of animals that are known to sing. At least some singing species demonstrate the ability to learn their songs, to improvise and even to compose new melodies. In some animal species singing is a group activity (see, for example, singing in gibbon families).\n\n\n\n\n"}

The name refers to the fact that the participants will attempt to \"spin\" or influence the perception of the debate among the assembled reporters. The benefit for reporters is that they quickly get in-person interviews with debaters or their representatives, complete with audio, video and photos. For a U.S. presidential debate, the number of reporters in the spin room can number into the thousands.\n\nThe earliest known spin room was set up by the campaign of U.S. president Ronald Reagan in 1984. In a hotel banquet room, campaign officials spoke on the record with talking points playing up their own candidate's debate performance and minimizing opponent Walter Mondale's success, despite many observers believing Mondale had just won. This operation was dubbed the \"spin patrol.\"\n\nA spin room may also be active before a debate. A common form of pre-debate spin is for each side to try to raise expectations for the opposing debater and lower expectations for their own team, a pursuit known as playing the expectations game.\n\nSome observers have criticized the overt nature of the media manipulation in spin rooms, and the media's willing participation in it. Defenders have said reporters know it's scripted and aren't persuaded by the spin, but rather, they use the talking points to analyze candidates' strategies. Spin rooms can occasionally include moments of candor, such as when presidential candidate Rick Perry admitted that he had \"stepped in it\" during a debate response that became known as his .\n\nSpin rooms have also been portrayed as outdated in an era of instant online reaction from all quarters before a debate is even over. Focus groups and instant post-debate \"snap polls\" attempt to provide a more scientific method than spin rooms in determining who has won a debate.\n\n"}
{"id": "82167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=82167", "title": "The Rutles", "text": "The Rutles\n\nThe Rutles () are a rock band known for their visual and aural pastiches and parodies of the Beatles. This originally fictional band, created by Eric Idle and Neil Innes for 1970s television programming, became an actual group – whilst remaining a parody of the Beatles – which toured and recorded, releasing many songs and albums that included two UK chart hits.\n\nCreated as a short sketch in Idle's UK television comedy series \"Rutland Weekend Television\", the Rutles gained fame after being the focus of the 1978 mockumentary television film \"All You Need Is Cash\" (also known as \"The Rutles\"). Former Beatle George Harrison appeared in the film and assisted in its creation. Encouraged by the positive public reaction to the sketch, featuring Beatles' music pastiches by Innes, the film was written by Idle, who co-directed it with Gary Weis. It had 20 songs written by Innes, which he performed with three musicians as the Rutles. A soundtrack album in 1978 was followed in 1996 by \"Archaeology\", which spoofed the Beatles' recent \"Anthology\" series.\n\nA second film, \"\" – modelled on the 2000 TV special \"The Beatles Revolution\" – was made in 2002 and released in the US on DVD in 2003.\n\nThe Rutles first appeared in 1975 as a sketch on Eric Idle's BBC television series \"Rutland Weekend Television\". The sketch presented a mini-documentary about the 1960s band the Rutles, and featured Neil Innes (formerly of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, and a frequent Monty Python collaborator) fronting the band singing \"I Must Be In Love\", a pastiche of Lennon and McCartney's 1964 style.\n\nThe sketch was the work of Innes and Idle. Innes conceived parodying the film \"A Hard Day's Night\", after writing \"I Must Be In Love\", which he realised sounded very \"Beatle-y\". Innes was the musician and composer for the series, and routinely created songs and ideas about how those songs could be presented on the show. He passed the idea along of a Beatles spoof to Idle, who had a separate idea about a boring TV documentary maker. They then merged the ideas into one extended film shot for the TV show. The band name was a continuation of the regional premise of the TV show, which was presented as a programme by a fictional TV network in Rutland, the smallest county in England. One running joke was that it would use names derivative of Rutland. The initial idea was a parody of the Rolling Stones called the Rutland Stones but became a parody of the Beatles, and Idle suggested the Rutles. 'The Prefab Four' is a pun on the Beatles' nickname 'the Fab Four' with an additional subtext: a prefab was a cheap postwar form of British housing, intended to be temporary, often poorly constructed, draughty and leaky, and not well-regarded by those who had to live in them. (The epithet had previously been applied to The Monkees.)\n\nThe Rutles had connections with the Beatles aside from the parody. The Beatles were fans of Innes's previous band, the Bonzo Dog Band; they featured them in the 1967 film \"Magical Mystery Tour\", and Paul McCartney (working with Gus Dudgeon under the collective alias Apollo C. Vermouth) had produced the Bonzos' 1968 hit single \"I'm the Urban Spaceman\". George Harrison made a guest appearance on \"Rutland Weekend Television\"s 1975 Boxing Day special, with Idle and Innes, and encouraged them to make a film that parodied the Beatles' career and deflated the myths surrounding the band's legacy.\n\nIn merchandising for the TV series, references were made to a Rutles album called \"Finchley Road\" and a single, \"Ticket To Rut\". In 1976, BBC Records produced \"The Rutland Weekend Songbook\", an album containing 23 tracks including the Rutles songs \"I Must Be In Love\" and \"The Children Of Rock And Roll\" (later reworked as \"Good Times Roll\").\n\nOne year after their initial BBC appearance, on 2 October 1976 Idle appeared on the American NBC show \"Saturday Night\" (later \"Saturday Night Live\"), and showed videotape extracts from \"Rutland Weekend Television\" – including the Rutles clip. That led to a suggestion by \"SNL\" executive producer Lorne Michaels to extend the skit into a one-hour mock documentary. This proposal led to the 1978 mockumentary \"All You Need Is Cash\", directed by \"SNL\" film director Gary Weis, with Idle credited as co-director.\n\nOn 23 April 1977, Idle made another appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\", bringing along Neil Innes as a musical guest. A running theme for this episode is the \"Save Great Britain Telethon\", and at one point there is an appearance by \"the Rutle who lives in New York, Nasty\". Innes appeared as Nasty with a lone white piano, singing a short version of \"Cheese & Onions\". Later in the episode, as Neil Innes, he performed \"Shangri-La\", a song subsequently recorded by the Rutles.\n\nWritten by Idle and Innes, \"All You Need Is Cash\" documents the rise and fall of the Rutles, paralleling much of the history of the Beatles. The project was given extra recognition through Harrison's support. As well as providing ideas, he supplied Idle and Innes with a copy of the Beatles' long-planned documentary, \"The Long and Winding Road\" (eventually re-titled \"The Beatles Anthology\" and released in 1995). Idle drew inspiration from this 1976 version of the documentary, as compiled by Neil Aspinall, and was granted permission to use some of the archival footage to tell the Rutles' story.\n\nInnes wrote, composed, and produced the music. He relied on his memory of Beatles music, and not careful later analysis, to create sound-alike songs. Innes assembled a band (himself, John Halsey, Ollie Halsall, Andy Brown, and Ricky Fataar) and the group played in a London pub to gel. During Rutles performances and studio recordings, Innes took lead on the songs that resembled Lennon's; Halsall sang on most McCartney-esque tunes; Fataar sang the Harrison songs; and Halsey sang a Ringo Starr-type song. Idle mimed to Halsall's singing and Brown's bass playing in the completed film. Halsall appeared in the film as \"Leppo\", the fifth Rutle who in the earliest years \"mainly stood at the back\". Brown did not appear in the film.\n\nThe film is a series of skits and gags that illustrate the Rutles story, following the chronology of the Beatles. The glue of the film is the soundtrack by Innes, who wrote and composed 19 more songs for the film, each a pastiche of a Beatles song or genre. Fourteen songs were on a soundtrack album. The CD version added the six songs omitted from the original vinyl album. The album was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Comedy Recording of the year. The orchestrations and arrangements were by film composer John Altman.\n\n\"All You Need Is Cash\" was not a success on American television on its first showing on 22 March 1978; indeed, it finished at the bottom of all programmes that week. The show fared better on BBC television when it was premiered a week later, on 27 March 1978.\n\nA 66-minute version edited for TV was released on video and DVD, but this has been superseded by the restored 72-minute version.\n\nAdditional actors in the special included Dan Aykroyd as the man who turned down the Rutles; John Belushi as Ron Decline (a parody of Allen Klein); Bill Murray as \"Bill Murray the K\"; Gilda Radner as a reluctant street interviewee; George Harrison as a TV reporter; Mick Jagger and Paul Simon as themselves; Michael Palin as Eric Manchester (a parody of Beatles press agent Derek Taylor); Ron Wood as a biker; Lorne Michaels as a man who wants to merchandise the Rutles; Al Franken and Tom Davis as Ron Decline employees; and many others. It included actual footage of David Frost and Ed Sullivan taken from TV appearances.\n\n\nHarrison said, \"The Rutles sort of liberated me from the Beatles in a way. It was the only thing I saw of those Beatles television shows they made. It was actually the best, funniest and most scathing. But at the same time, it was done with the most love.\"\n\n\nIdle claims on the \"All You Need Is Cash\" DVD commentary track that Harrison and Starr at one point discussed starting a band with Innes and Idle, based on the Beatles' and Rutles's shared and imaginary histories. Harrison and Starr also surprised him and Innes one day by singing a version of the Rutles' \"Ouch!\"\n\nIn 1979, Idle and Fataar issued a single as \"Dirk and Stig\"—\"Ging Gang Goolie\" backed with \"Mr. Sheene\". This was Idle's only appearance on a Rutles-related disc. Throughout the 1980s, the Rutles did not exist.\n\nIn 1982, the Rutles were involved in a record scandal reminiscent of the one surrounding the Beatles' \"Yesterday and Today\" album. Rhino Records, at the time a small Los Angeles label specialising in off-beat releases, released an album that it called \"Beatlesongs\", purportedly a collection of Beatles novelty songs but actually a weird catch-all of assorted Beatles-related tunes. For the collection, Rhino licensed the Rutles' \"Hold My Hand\" from Warner Bros Records. The cover of the album was done by well-known commercial artist William Stout, who had made a name for himself drawing the cover artwork for some of the best-looking Beatles bootleg records in the 1970s. His cover drawing included a representation of Mark David Chapman, the man who had killed John Lennon, which generated an immense backlash. Rhino responded by recalling the album and reissuing it with a new, innocuous cover, which they announced in this press release.\n\nA clip from \"All You Need Is Cash\" appeared on this compilation of comedy videos put out by the now-defunct Vestron Home Video in 1985. The clip is simply the Tragical History Tour part of \"All You Need Is Cash\", with the sound clunkily muted out during the segment's narration in order to leave just the music. This home video release was released on both VHS and Laserdisc.\n\nInnes, with a group called the Moptops backed by the Rutland Symphony Orchestra, performed as \"Ron Nasty and the New Rutles\" at a convention honouring the 25th anniversary of Monty Python in 1994. This led to a Rutles reunion album in 1996, featuring Innes, Fataar and Halsey. Halsall died in 1992, but the reunion album, titled \"Archaeology\" as a play on the Beatles' \"Anthology\" series, featured several tracks recorded in 1978 that included his contributions. The Japanese version included 4 bonus tracks.\n\nIn 2002, Idle made \"\", which remained unreleased for a year. The film features an even bigger number of celebrity interviewees discussing the band's influence. This was met with mixed reactions from fans, particularly because no new footage of the Rutles was filmed. The DVD had yet to be released in the UK as of February 2014.\n\nMcQuickly and Nasty had cameos in the 2004 graphic novel, \"\", co-written by former Monty Python's Flying Circus member John Cleese.\n\nIn 2007, a reissue of \"Archaeology\" included a new Rutles track called \"Rut-a-lot\" (a jab at Idle's stage show \"Spamalot\") which was simply a live medley of songs from the first Rutles album.\n\nOn 17 March 2008, all four movie Rutles (Innes, Idle, Fataar and Halsey) reunited for the first time at a 30th anniversary screening of \"All You Need Is Cash\" at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood. The event included a question and answer session and performance by members of the tribute show \"Rutlemania\" which ran for a week at the Ricardo Montalban Theater in Hollywood before doing a week in NYC at the Blender Gramercy Theater. The \"Rutlemania\" live show was conceived and written by Eric Idle which starred the Beatles tribute group the Fab Four as \"The Pre-Fab Four\" Rutles.\n\nIn February 2009, on his website \"InnesBookOfRecords.Com\", Innes released what he refers to as \"Ron Nasty's Final Song\", titled \"Imitation Song\", a parody of \"Imagine\". This was also Innes's first and only entry in the \"Masters of Song-Fu\" competition run by Quick Stop Entertainment.\n\nOn 9 February 2014, Idle reprised his narrator persona from \"All You Need Is Cash\" as part of \"\", noting how the Rutles had made their American debut 50 years earlier, and it was an amazing coincidence the Beatles were there the same day. He then lent straight narration to biographical sketches of the Beatles's early lives.\n\nThe Rutles members in the original 1975 skit on \"Rutland Weekend Television\", which subsequently aired on \"Saturday Night Live\", were:\n\nIn the original skit \"Stig\" is the George Harrison character and was portrayed by Fataar, with Idle portraying the Paul McCartney character as \"Dirk\". The John Lennon character is named \"Nasty\". The Ringo Starr character was originally named Barry, although in the series spin-off book \"The Rutland Weekend Songbook\", this character is mistakenly identified as \"Kevin\"—the only appearance of this name in the entire Rutles canon. In the original sketch, the characters are given only the singular names Stig, Dirk, Barry and Nasty.\n\nSome actors lip-synching the Rutles music on-screen were not musicians, and did not participate in the recording process. Rutles music for \"Rutland Weekend Television\" and the spin-off album \"The Rutland Weekend Songbook\" was recorded by Neil Innes' own band Fatso, which consisted of:\n\nIn adapting the characters for a full-length TV feature, several changes were made. Idle continued to play \"Dirk\", but Dirk was now modelled after Paul McCartney, not George Harrison. Battley was replaced as Stig by Ricky Fataar, and Stig became the George Harrison-inspired character. Additionally, the characters now all had first and last names.\n\nThe Rutles members in \"All You Need Is Cash\" were:\n\nAlso, in tracing the fictional history of the band, one other member was mentioned:\n\nThe band that recorded the actual music was slightly different from the band that appeared on camera, as Idle did not take part in the recording process. On the soundtrack release of the music from \"All You Need Is Cash\", the Rutles were officially:\n\nWhile the Rutles are often thought of as a four-piece band, the credits of the original LP release of their first album indicate they were a five-piece. Brown, however, did not appear in any role in \"All You Need Is Cash\", and was not part of any Rutles reunion.\n\nAfter an 18-year hiatus, the Rutles (Innes, Halsey and Fataar) reconvened to record the 1996 album \"Archaeology\" (parody of the Beatles \"Anthology\"). Halsall had died in 1992, but appears on several tracks that were outtakes from the original 1978 album, and is credited as a band member. (Similarly, the three surviving Beatles had incorporated recordings by John Lennon in the songs \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\".)\n\nOn record the band was augmented by keyboardist Mickey Simmonds, who would go on to play with the band live. Also appearing on the record was bassist Malcolm Foster (ex-Pretenders), as the Rutles had no bass player. Guitarists Doug Boyle and Bernie Holland were featured.\n\nInnes and Halsey toured as the Rutles in the UK, augmented by other musicians. The touring group performs songs from the Rutles repertoire and from Innes's solo career.\n\nThe touring version:\n\nIn \"All You Need Is Cash\" and \"Can't Buy Me Lunch\", other \"artists\" are mentioned, including:\n\n\n\"The Rutland Weekend Songbook\" / Eric Idle & Neil Innes\nBBC Records (UK) / Passport Records (US)\n\nSaturday: (side 1 )\n\nSunday: (side 2)\n\nRutles Notes:\n\n\nA soundtrack album entitled \"The Rutles\" containing 14 tongue-in-cheek pastiches of Beatles songs was also released. The CD reissue included the 6 other songs featured on the soundtrack that were not included in the vinyl LP.\n\nThe cover art of the album suggested the existence of a number of other Rutles albums including \"Tragical History Tour\" and \"Let It Rot\".\n\nThe album contains send-ups of Beatles numbers such as \"Ouch!\" (\"Help!\"), \"Good Times Roll\" (\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\"), \"Love Life\" (\"All You Need is Love\"), \"Cheese and Onions\" (\"A Day in the Life\"), \"Piggy in the Middle\" (\"I Am the Walrus\"), \"Doubleback Alley\" (\"Penny Lane\") and \"Get Up And Go\" (CD reissue only – \"Get Back\").\n\n\"I Must Be In Love\" + \"Cheese And Onions \" / \"With A Girl Like You\"\n\n\" WEA Records / UK only release / 1978 / K17125\"\n\nSide 1: \"I Must Be In Love\"\n\nSide 2: \"Cheese And Onions\" / \"With A Girl Like You\"\n\n\n\"Let's Be Natural\" b/w \"Piggy In the Middle\"\n\n\" WEA Records / UK only release / 1978 / K17180\"\n\nSide 1: \"Let's Be Natural\"\n\nSide 2: \"Piggy In the Middle\"\n\n\n\"I Must Be In Love\" b/w \"Doubleback Alley\"\n\n\"WEA Records / Japan / 1978 / P-200-W\"\n\n\"Warner Bros.

The fourth 'real' Rutle, Ollie Halsall, died in Spain in 1992. Original Rutles bassist Andy Brown did not participate in the reunion. Eric Idle was invited to participate, but he declined. Accordingly, photos of the three 'surviving' Rutles parodied those of the then three surviving Beatles in the \"Anthology\" series.\n\nLike the \"Anthology\" project that it lampooned, it featured tracks ostensibly from all periods of the Rutles career, sequenced to reflect the fictional band's chronology. Several of the songs were actually old Innes standards that were dusted off and given the 'Rutles' treatment. The reunion was blessed by George Harrison, who encouraged them to proceed. When approached, he told Innes, \"Sure. It's all part of the soup\". Innes related that encounter in interviews he gave in 1996, and again in 2013.\n\n\"Eric Idle Sings Monty Python\" (Live) / Eric Idle\n\nRestless Records / CD only release / 01877-73730-2\n\n\nA 20-track album of Rutles covers released by Shimmy Disc on 8 December 1993.\n\n\n\n\n\nBootlegs include \"Hard Days Rut!\", \"The Last Tea Party Tapes\", \"This is the Savage Young Rutles\", \"Sweet Rutle Tracks\", \"Rutles To Let\", \"Sgt.

Though Innes hired a musicologist to defend the originality of his songs, he settled with ATV out of court for 50% of the royalties on the 14 songs included on the album. As of early 2006, these six songs from the first Rutles CD (which were not on the original LP release, but some of which were included in the television film) are credited solely to Neil Innes: \"Baby Let Me Be\", \"Between Us\", \"Blue Suede Schubert\", \"Get Up And Go\", \"Goose Step Mama\", and \"It's Looking Good\". The other 14 songs from the CD (all songs from the original LP release) have all had John Lennon and Paul McCartney added to the songwriting credits.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10787339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10787339", "title": "Tom show", "text": "Tom show\n\nTom show is a general term for any play or musical based (often only loosely) on the 1852 novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" by Harriet Beecher Stowe. The novel attempts to depict the harsh reality of slavery. Due to the weak copyright laws at the time, a number of unauthorized plays based on the novel were staged for decades, many of them mocking the novel's strong characters and social message, and leading to the pejorative term \"Uncle Tom\".\n\nEven though \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was the best-selling novel of the 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story in a stage play or musical than read the book. Some of these shows were essentially minstrel shows that utilized caricatures and stereotypes of black people, and thus inverting the intent of the novel. \"Tom shows\" were popular in the United States from the 1850s through the early 1900s.\n\nStage plays based on \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"—\"Tom shows\"—began to appear while the story itself was still being serialized. These plays varied tremendously in their politics—some faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery. A number of the productions also featured songs by Stephen Foster, including \"My Old Kentucky Home,\" \"Old Folks at Home,\" and \"Massa's in the Cold Ground.\"\n\nStowe herself never authorized dramatization of her work, because of her puritanical distrust of drama (although she did eventually go to see George Aiken's version, and, according to Francis Underwood, was \"delighted\" by Caroline Howard's portrayal of Topsy). Asa Hutchinson of the Hutchinson Family Singers, whose antislavery politics closely matched those of Stowe tried and failed to get her permission to stage an official version; her refusal left the field clear for any number of adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures.\n\nEric Lott, in his book \"Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class\", estimates that at least three million people saw these plays, as many as the novel's worldwide sales. Some of these shows were basically just blackface minstrel shows only loosely based on the novel, and their grossly exaggerated caricatures of black people further perpetuated, for purposes of mockery, some of the stereotypes that Stowe had used more innocently.\n\nAll \"Tom shows\" appear to have incorporated elements of melodrama and blackface minstrelsy.\n\nThe first serious attempt at anything like a faithful stage adaptation was a one-hour play by C.W. Taylor at Purdy's National Theater (New York City); it ran for about ten performances in August–September 1852 sharing a bill with a blackface burlesque featuring T.D. Rice. Rice, famous in the 1830s for his comic and clearly racist blackface character Jim Crow, later became the most celebrated actor to play the title role of Tom; when Rice opened in H.E. Stevens play of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" in January 1854 at New York's Bowery Theatre, the \"Spirit of the Times<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" reviewer described him as \"decidedly the best personator of negro character who has appeared in any drama.\"\n\nThe best-known \"Tom Shows\" were those of George Aiken and H.J. Conway.\n\nAiken's original \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" focused almost entirely on Little Eva (played by child star Cordelia Howard); a sequel, \"The Death of Uncle Tom, or the Religion of the Lonely\" told Tom's own story. The two were ultimately combined in an unprecedented evening-long six-act play. According to Lott, it is generally faithful to Stowe's novel, although it plays down the trickster characters of Sam and Andy and variously adds or expands the roles of some farcical white characters instead. It also focuses heavily on George Harris; the \"New York Times\" reported that his defiant speech received \"great cheers\" from an audience of Bowery b'hoys and g'hals. Even this most sympathetic of \"Tom shows\" clearly borrowed heavily from minstrelsy: not only were the slave roles all played by white actors in blackface, but Stephen Foster's \"Old Folks at Home\" was played in the scene where Tom is sold down the river. After a long and successful run beginning November 15, 1852 in Troy, New York, the play opened in New York City July 18, 1853, where its success was even greater.\n\nConway's production opened in Boston the same day Aiken's opened in Troy; P.T. Barnum brought it to his American Museum in New York November 7, 1853. Its politics were much more moderate. Sam and Andy become, in Lott's words, \"buffoons\". Criticism of slavery was placed largely in the mouth of a newly introduced Yankee character, a reporter named Penetrate Partyside. St. Clare's role was expanded, and turned into more of a pro-slavery advocate, articulating the politics of a John C. Calhoun. Legree rigs the auction that gets him ownership of Tom (as against Stowe's and Aiken's portrayal of oppression as the \"normal\" mode of slavery, not an abuse of the system by a cheater). Beyond this, Conway gave his play a happy ending, with Tom and various other slaves freed.\n\nShowmen felt that Stowe's novel had a flaw in that there was no clearly defined comic character, so there was no role for a comedian, and consequently little relief from the tragedy. Eventually it was found that the minor character of Marks the Lawyer could be played as a broad caricature for laughs, dressing him in foppish clothes, often equipped with a dainty umbrella. Some productions even had him make an entrance mounted astride a pig.\n\n\"Tom shows\" were so popular that there were even pro-slavery versions. Among the most popular was \"Uncle Tom's Cabin as It Is: The Southern Uncle Tom\", produced in 1852 at the Baltimore Museum. Lott mentions numerous \"offshoots, parodies, thefts, and rebuttals\" including a full-scale play by Christy's Minstrels and a parody by Conway himself called \"Uncle Pat's Cabin\", and records that the story in its many variants \"dominated northern popular culture… for several years\".\n\nAccording to Eric Lott, even those \"Tom shows\" which stayed relatively close to Stowe's novel played down the feminist aspects of the book and Stowe's criticisms of capitalism, and turned her anti-slavery politics into anti-Southern sectionalism. Francis Underwood, a contemporary, wrote that Aiken's play had also lost the \"lightness and gayety\" of Stowe's book. Nonetheless, Lott argues, the plays increased sympathy for the slaves among the Northern white working class (which had been somewhat alienated from the abolitionist movement by its perceived elitist backing).\n\nThe influence of the \"Tom shows\" can be found in a number of plays from the 1850s: most obviously, C.W. Taylor's dramatization of Stowe's \"Dred\", but also J.T. Trowbridge's abolitionist play \"Neighbor Jackwood\", Dion Boucicault's \"The Octoroon\", and a play called \"The Insurrection\", based on John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry.\n\nThe influence of the \"Tom shows\" also carried over into the silent film era (with \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" being the most-filmed story of that time period). This was due to the continuing popularity of both the book and \"Tom shows,\" meaning audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot, making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words.\n\nSeveral of the early film versions of Uncle Tom's Cabin were essentially filmed versions of \"Tom shows.\" These included:\n\n\nAs cinema replaced vaudeville and other types of live variety entertainment, \"Tom shows\" slowly disappeared. J.C. Furnas, in his book \"Goodbye to Uncle Tom\", stated that he had seen a production in the 1920s in Ohio; the last touring group specializing in \"Tomming\" he could locate was apparently operating as late as the 1950s.\n\n"}
{"id": "35424118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35424118", "title": "Women in engineering", "text": "Women in engineering\n\nWomen are often under-represented in the fields of engineering, both in academia and in the profession of engineering, yet many have contributed to the diverse fields of engineering historically and currently. A number of organizations and programs have been created to understand and overcome this tradition of gender disparity. Some have decried this gender gap, saying that it indicates the absence of potential talent. Though the gender gap as a whole is narrowing, there is still a growing gap with minority women compared to their white counterparts.\n\nThe history of women as designers and builders of machines and structures predates the development of engineering as a trade. Prior to the creation of the term \"engineer\" in the 11th century, women had contributed to the technological advancement of societies around the globe, including Hypatia of Alexandria (350 or 370–415 AD), who is credited with the invention of the hydrometer. By the 19th century, women who participated in engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. Ada Lovelace was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning her collaboration with Charles Babbage on his analytical engine that would earn her the designation of the \"first computer programmer.\" In the early years of the 20th century, greater numbers of women began to be admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as anomalies by the men in their departments.\n\nThe first University to award an engineering's bachelor's degree for women was University of California, Berkeley. Elizabeth Bragg was the recipient of a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1876, becoming the first female engineer in the United States. Prior to the 19th century, it was very rare for women to earn bachelor's degree in any field because they did not have the opportunity to enroll in universities due to gender disparities. Some universities started to admit women to their colleges by the early 1800s and by the mid-1800s they started to admit them into all academic programs including engineering.\n\nThe entry of the United States into World War II created a serious shortage of engineering talent in that country as men were drafted into the armed forces. To address the shortage, initiatives like GE on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics and the Curtiss-Wright Engineering Program among others created new opportunities for women in engineering. Curtiss-Wright partnered with Cornell, Penn State, Purdue, the University of Minnesota, the University of Texas, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Iowa State University to create an engineering curriculum that lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.\n\nDuring this time, since the female representation in the engineering field, there were barely public attacks on women. Chiefly, these attacks were kept quiet inside institutions due to the fact that women did not pressure aggressively to shift the gender gap between men and women in the engineering field. Another reason why these “attacks” were kept private is due to how men believed that it was impossible for engineering to stop being a male-dominated field.\n\nWomen's roles in the workforce, specifically in engineering fields changed greatly during the Post–World War II period. As women started to marry at later ages, have fewer children, divorce more frequently and stopped depending on male breadwinners for economic support, they started to become even more active in the engineering labor force despite the fact that their salaries were less than men's.\n\nWomen also played a crucial role in programming the ENIAC from its construction during the World War II period through the next several decades. Originally recruited by the Army in 1943, female ENIAC programmers made considerable advancements in programming techniques, such as the invention of breakpoints, now a standard debugging tool.\n\nIn addition to the wartime shortage of engineers, women also made inroads in engineering fields due to the gradual increase in public universities admitting female students. For example, Georgia Tech began to admit women engineering students in 1952, while the École Polytechnique in Paris, a premier French engineering institution, began to admit female students in 1972.\n\nStereotype threat may contribute to the under-representation of women in engineering. Because engineering is a traditionally male-dominated field, women may be less confident about their abilities, even when performing equally. At a young age, girls do not express the same level of interest in engineering as boys, possibly due in part to gender stereotypes. There is also significant evidence of the remaining presence of implicit bias against female engineers, due to the belief that men are mathematically superior and better suited to engineering jobs. Women who persist are able to overcome these difficulties, enabling them to find fulfilling and rewarding experiences in the engineering profession.\nDue to this gender bias, women's choice in entering an engineering field for college is also highly correlated to the background and exposure they have had with mathematics and other science courses during high school. Most women that do choose to study engineering have significant experience with regarding themselves better at these types of courses and as a result, think they are capable of studying in a male-dominated field.\n\nWomen's self-efficacy is also a contributor to the gender stereotype that plays a role in the underrepresentation of women in engineering. Women's ability to think critically that they can be successful and perform accomplishments is correlated to the choices they have when choosing a college career. Women that show high self-efficacy personalities are more prone to choose to study in the engineering field. Self-efficacy is also correlated to gender roles because men often present higher self-efficacy than women, which can also be a cause to why when choosing a major, most women opt to not choose the engineering major.\n\nOver the past few years 40 percent of women are leaving the engineering field, there are many factors leading to why they don't go into engineering because of women being judged about going into a difficult major such as engineering, working in difficult workplace conditions. According to the Society of Women Engineers one in four female leave the field after a certain age.\n\nWomen are under-represented in engineering education programs as in the workforce (see Statistics). Enrollment and graduation rates of women in post-secondary engineering programs are very important determinants of how many women go on to become engineers. Because undergraduate degrees are acknowledged as the \"latest point of standard entry into scientific fields\", the under-representation of women in undergraduate programs contributes directly to under-representation in scientific fields. Additionally, in the United States, women who hold degrees in science, technology, and engineering fields are less likely than their male counterparts to have jobs in those fields.\n\nThis degree disparity varies across engineering disciplines. Women tend to be more interested in the engineering disciplines that have societal and humane developments, such as agricultural and environmental engineering. They are therefore well-represented in environmental and biomedical engineering degree programs, receiving 40-50% of awarded degrees in the U.S. (2014–15), women are far less likely to receive degrees in fields like mechanical, electrical and computer engineering.\n\nA study made by the Harvard Business Review discussed the reasons why the rates of women representation in the engineering field are still low. The study discovered that rates of female students in engineering programs are continuous because of the collaboration aspects in the field. The results of the study chiefly determined how women are treated differently in group works in which there are more male than female members and how male members “excluded women from the real engineering work”. Aside from this, women in this study also described how professors treated female students differently “just because they were women”.\n\nDespite the fact that fewer women enroll in engineering programs across the nation, the representation of women in STEM-based careers can potentially increase when college and university administrators work on implementing mentoring programs and work-life policies for women. \nResearch shows that these rates have a hard time increasing since women are judged as less competent than men to perform supposedly “masculine jobs”.\n\nAnother possible reason for lower female participation in engineering fields is the prevalence of values \"associated with the male gender role\" in workplace culture. For example, some women in engineering have found it difficult to re-enter the workforce after a period of absence. Because men are less likely to take time off to raise a family, this disproportionately affects women.\n\nMales are also associated with taking leadership roles in the workplace. By holding a position of power over the women, they may create an uncomfortable environment for them. For example, lower pay, more responsibilities, less appreciation as compared to men.\n\nCommunication is also a contributing factor to the divide between men and women in the workplace. A male to male communication is said to be more direct,\nbut when a man explains a task to a woman, they tend to talk down, or “dumb down” terms. This comes from the stereotype that men are more qualified than women for engineering, causing men to treat women as inferiors instead of equals.\n\nPart of the male dominance in the engineering field is explained by their perception towards engineering itself. A study in 1964 found that both women and men believed that engineering was in fact masculine.\n\nThe masculinity dominating engineering majors and fields proves the issues that men themselves believe that they “naturally” excel in fields related to mathematics and sciences while women “naturally” excel in linguistics and liberal arts. In the past few decades, women's representation in the workforce in STEM fields, specifically engineering, has significantly improved. In 1960 women made up around 1% of all the engineers and by the year 2000 women have made up 11% of all engineers.\n\nSeveral colleges and universities nationwide want to decrease the gender gap between men and women in the engineering field by recruiting more women into their programs. The strategies used for recruiting more female undergraduate students are: increasing women's exposure to stem-courses during high school, planting the idea of positivism relating gender from the engineering culture, producing a more female-friendly environment inside and outside the classroom. These strategies have helped institutions encourage more women to enroll in engineering programs as well as other STEM-based majors. \nFor universities to encourage women to enroll in their graduate programs, institutions have to emphasize the importance of recruiting women, emphasize the importance of STEM education in the undergraduate level, offer financial aid, and develop more efficient methods for recruiting women to their programs.\n\nFemales are underrepresented as both graduate students in engineering and working engineers. The number of bachelor's degrees awarded to women dropped from 20.4% in 2003, down to 17.8% in 2009, and back up to 18.9% in 2012. Women's underrepresentation in the engineering workforce varies by field. In the year 2008 women Mechanical Engineers made up 6.7%, Electrical and Electronics made 7.7%, Aerospace and Civil made 10.4%, Chemical made 13.1% and Computer and Software Engineers made up 20.9% of the workforce. These values are even more outnumbered while quantifying the number of women who hold doctorates.\n\nThe percentage of master's degrees awarded to women has not changed much from 2003 (22.3%) to 2012 (23.1%). The percentage of doctoral degrees awarded to women in engineering increased from 11.6% in 1995, to 17.4% in 2004, to 21.1% in 2008, then to 22.2% in 2012.\n\nSince 1997, the percentage of Asian females enrolling in engineering majors has risen from about 30% to 34% but somehow also dropped in 2002. African American females have increased their representation in engineering from 21% to 33% in the same time frame. Mexican American (Chicana) and Puerto Rican females have had an increase in their representation from 25% to 31%. Even if ethnicities are included in these statistics, men from all ethnicities still outnumber the proportion of women who enroll in engineering bachelor programs.\n\nThere is a significant drop-off rate regarding the number of women who earn a bachelor's degree and the women who afterward enroll in graduate school. Over the last 35 years, women have been more likely than men to enroll in graduate school right after receiving their bachelor's degree. Women who do not enroll in a graduate program right after earning their bachelor's degree tend to be caregivers who face work-family conflicts in the context of family women.\nThe workforce remains the area of lowest representation for women. In 2009, women comprised 48% of the total workforce, but only 14% of the engineering workforce.\n\nOnly 14% of engineers in Australia are women. The retention of female engineers is also disproportionally low; in 2006, 62.6% of qualified male engineers were employed in engineering professions, as opposed to 47.1% of qualified female engineers.\n\nThough women tend to make up more than half of the undergraduate population in Canada, the number of women in engineering is disproportionately low. Whereas in 2001, 21 percent of students in engineering programs were female, by 2009, this had fallen to 17 percent. One commentator attributed this drop to a number of factors, such as the failure of higher education programs to explain how engineering can improve others' lives, a lack of awareness of what engineers do, and discomfort of being in a male-dominated environment and the perception that women must adapt to fit in.\n\nIn the 1990s, undergraduate enrollment of women in engineering fluctuated from 17 to 18%, while in 2001, it rose to 20.6%. In 2010, 17.7% of students in undergraduate engineering were women.\n\nFemale undergraduate enrollment was highest in 2010 in environmental, biosystems, and geological engineering.\n\nThe number of women enrolled in undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral engineering programs tends to vary by province, with the highest number in Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia.\n\nOn average, 11% of engineering faculty are women and the percentage of leadership roles held by women is an average of 9%. The University of Toronto has the highest female faculty rate in Canada at 17% and École Polytechnique de Montréal, University of British Columbia, and Dalhousie University all have a female faculty rate of 13%.\n\nIn 2011, the INWES Education and Research Institute (ERI) held a national workshop, Canadian Committee of Women in Engineering (CCWE+20), to determine ways of increasing the number of women in the engineering field in Canada. CCWE+20 identified a goal of increasing women's interest in engineering by 2.6 percent by 2016 to a total of 25 percent through more incentives such as through collaboration and special projects. The workshop identifies early education as one of the main barriers in addition to other factors, such as: \"the popular culture of their generation, the guidance they receive on course selection in high school and the extent to which their parents, teachers, and counselors recognize engineering as an appropriate and legitimate career choice for women.\" The workshop report compares enrollment, teaching, and professional statistics from the goals identified in 1997 compared to the actual data from 2009, outlining areas of improvement (see table, right).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1072404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1072404", "title": "World community", "text": "World community\n\nThe term world community is used primarily in political and humanitarian contexts to describe an international aggregate of nation states of widely varying types. In most connotations, the term is used to convey meanings attached to consensus or inclusion of all people in all lands and their governments.\n\nWorld community often is a semi-personal rhetorical connotation that represents Humanity in a singular context as in \"…for the sake of the World Community\" or \"…with the approval of the World Community\". \n\nThe term sometimes is used to reference the United Nations or its affiliated agencies as bodies of governance. Other times it is a generic term with no explicit ties to states or governments but retaining a political connotation.\n\nIn terms of human needs, humanitarian aid, human rights, and other discourse in the humanities, the world community is akin to the conceptual Global village aimed at the inclusion of non-aligned countries, aboriginal peoples, the Third World into the \"connected\" world via the communications infrastructure or at least representative ties to it.\n\nIn terms of the global economy, the \"world community\" is seen by some economists as an inter-dependent system of goods and services with semi-permeable boundaries and flexible sets of import/export rules. Proponents of Globalization may tend to establish or impose more rigidity to this framework. Controversy has arisen as to whether this paradigm will strengthen or weaken the world as a community. See World Trade Organization\n\nWhen considering Sustainable development and Ecology, the inter-dependence angle generally expands quickly to a Global context. In this paradigm, the planet as a whole represents a single Biome and the World's population represents the Ecological succession in a singular eco-system. This also can be recognized as the World Community.\n\nMany religions have taken on the challenge of establishing a world community through the propagation of their doctrine, faith and practice.\n\nIn the Bahá'í Faith, `Abdu'l-Bahá, successor and son of Bahá'u'lláh, produced a series of documents called the Tablets of the Divine Plan. Now in a book form, after their publication in 1917 and their 'unveiling' in New York in 1919, these tablets contained an outline and a plan for the expansion of the Bahá'í community into Asia, Asia minor, Europe and the Americas, indeed, throughout the planet. \n\nThe formal implementation of this plan, known as 'Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan, began in 1937 in the first of a series of sub-plans, the Seven Year Plan of 1937 to 1944. Shoghi Effendi, the leader of the Baha'i community until 1957 and then the Universal House of Justice from 1963, were instrumental in the organization and design of future sub-plans. This lead to the creation and establishment of a world community, with members of the faith estimated to have reached 5 to 6 million in the early 21st century, while also being the second most geographically widespread religion in the world. \n\nIn Buddhism \"the conventional Sangha of monks has been entrusted by the Buddha with the task of leading all people in creating the ideal world community of noble disciples or truly civilized people.\"\n\nA Benedictine monk, Friar John Main, inspired the World Community for Christian meditation through the practice of meditation centered around the Maranatha mantra, meaning \"Come Lord.\"\n\nThe Lutheran Church in America had issued a social statement - \"World Community: Ethical Imperatives in an Age of Interdependence\" Adopted by the Fifth Biennial Convention, Minneapolis, Minnesota, June 25-July 2, 1970. Since then The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has formed and retained the statement as a 'historical document'.\n\nThe term world community is often used in the context of establishing and maintaining world peace through a peace process or through a resolvable end to local-regional wars and global-world wars. Many social movements and much political theory deals with issues revolving around the institutionalization of the process of propagating the ideal of a world community. A world community is one which has a global vision, is established throughout the world, that is it has a membership that exists in most of the countries on the planet and that involves the participation of its members in a variety of ways.\n\n\nWillard, Charles Arthur.
