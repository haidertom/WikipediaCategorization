Parallelism of expression serves to emphasize opposition of ideas\".\n\nAn antithesis must always contain two ideas within one statement. The ideas may not be structurally opposite, but they serve to be functionally opposite when comparing two ideas for emphasis.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, the use of an antithesis makes the audience better understand the point the speaker is trying to make. Further explained, the comparison of two situations or ideas makes choosing the correct one simpler. Aristotle states that antithesis in rhetoric is similar to syllogism due to the presentation of two conclusions within a statement.\n\nAntitheses are used to strengthen an argument by using either exact opposites or simply contrasting ideas, but can also include both. They typically make a sentence more memorable for the reader or listener through balance and emphasis of the words.\n\nIn rhetoric, antithesis is a figure of speech involving the bringing out of a contrast in the ideas by an obvious contrast in the words, clauses, or sentences, within a parallel grammatical structure. \n\nThe term \"antithesis\" in rhetoric goes back to the 4th century BC, for example Aristotle, \"Rhetoric\", 1410a, in which he gives a series of examples.\n\nAn antithesis can be a simple statement contrasting two things, using a parallel structure:\n\n\nOften there is a double antithesis, as in the following proverb, where \"man\" is opposed to \"God\", and \"proposes\" is contrasted with \"disposes\":\n\n\nAnother type is of the form \"not A, but B\" (negative-positive), in which the point made is emphasised by first being contrasted with its negative:\n\n\nAnother type involves a chiasmus (AB, BA word order), in which the contrasted words switch places:\n\n\nThe negative-positive antithesis and the chiasmus-antithesis can be combined, as in the following sentence:\n\nSome other examples of antithesis are:\n\n\n\"Matthew's Antitheses\" is the traditional name given to a section of the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus takes six well known prescriptions of the Mosaic Law and calls his followers to do more than the Law requires. Protestant scholars since the Reformation have generally believed that Jesus was setting his teaching over against false interpretations of the Law current at the time. \"Antithesis\" was the name given by Marcion of Sinope to a manifesto in which he contrasted the Old Testament with the New Testament and defined what came to be known as Marcionism.\n\nIn dialectics (any formal system of reasoning that arrives at the truth by the exchange of logical arguments) antithesis is the juxtaposition of contrasting ideas, usually in a balanced way. The logical arguments are said to be stated in the order thesis, antithesis, synthesis.\n\nAlthough this style of philosophical discussion (stating a point of view, then its opposite, and finally drawing a conclusion) was commonly used by ancient philosophers, the use of the trio \"thesis, antithesis, synthesis\" itself to describe it goes back only to the 18th century, to a work published in 1794 by the German philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte.\n\nThe phrase is sometimes incorrectly stated to originate from the German philosopher Hegel. However, Hegel never actually used the trio of terms except once in a lecture, in which he reproached Immanuel Kant for having \"everywhere posited thesis, antithesis, synthesis\".\n\n"}
{"id": "680986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=680986", "title": "Aporia", "text": "Aporia\n\nAporia () denotes in philosophy a philosophical puzzle or state of puzzlement and in rhetoric a rhetorically useful expression of doubt.\n\nDefinitions of the term \"aporia\" have varied throughout history. \"The Oxford English Dictionary\" includes two forms of the word: the adjective \"aporetic\", which it defines as \"to be at a loss\", \"impassable\", and \"inclined to doubt, or to raise objections\"; and the noun form \"aporia\", which it defines as the \"state of the aporetic\" and \"a perplexity or difficulty\". The dictionary entry also includes two early textual uses, which both refer to the term's rhetorical (rather than philosophical) usage.\n\nIn George Puttenham's \"The Arte of English Poesie\" (1589), aporia is \"the Doubtful, [so] called...because often we will seem to caste perils, and make doubts of things when by a plaine manner of speech we might affirm or deny [them]\". In a reference from 1657, J. Smith's \"Mystical Rhetoric,\" the term becomes \"a figure whereby the speaker sheweth that he doubteth, either where to begin for the multitude of matters, or what to do or say in some strange or ambiguous thing\" (OED). Herbert Weir Smyth's \"Greek Grammar\" (1956) also focuses on the rhetorical usage by defining aporia as \"an artifice by which a speaker feigns doubts as to where he shall begin or end or what he shall do or say\" (674).\n\nMore modern sources, perhaps because they come after the advent of post-structuralism, have chosen to omit the rhetorical usage of the term. In William Harmon's \"A Handbook to Literature,\" for example, aporia is identified as \"a difficulty, impasse, or point of doubt and indecision\", while also noting that critics such as Jacques Derrida have employed the term to \"indicate a point of undecidability, which locates the site at which the text most obviously undermines its own rhetorical structure, dismantles, or deconstructs itself\" (39). Julian Wolfreys, in his essay \"Trauma, Testimony, and Criticism\", characterizes trauma as aporia, a wound with unending trail. Valiur Rahaman, in his book \"Interpretations: Essays in Literary Theory \" (2011), explained aporia as a creative force in both the artist and their art; it is, for the artist, an edgeless edge of the text or a work of art.\n\nThe separation of aporia into its two morphemes \"a\"- and \"poros\" ('without' and 'passage') reveals the word's rich etymological background as well as its connection to Platonic mythology. Sarah Kofman asserts that these two components are crucial to a fuller understanding of the word, which has been historically translated and understood somewhat reductively: \"translators, who usually escape their perplexity by translating \"poros\" as 'expediency' and \"aporia\" as 'difficulty'...leave the reader in the dark as to all the semantic richness of \"poros\" and \"aporia\" and give no hint as to their links with other words belonging to the same 'family (9). Such links inevitably demonstrate that the terms are part of a \"tradition\" that Plato borrows from, a tradition which \"breaks with a philosophical conception of translation, and with the logic of identity that it implies\" (10). To demonstrate such a break, Kofman reviews multiple instances of the term throughout Plato's work. Her discussion of the myth of Poros, Penia, and Eros in Plato's \"Symposium\" especially reveals the concept's untranslatability. Penia, the \"child of poverty\", decides to forcefully impregnate herself with the inebriated Poros, the personification of plenty, who is always in opposition with aporia and thus defining aporia. The result of this union is Eros, who inherits the disparate characteristics of his parents (25). The perplexing aspect of the myth is revealed as one realizes that Penia is acting out of resourcefulness, a quality normally attributed to Poros, and Poros' inaction reveals his own passivity, a poverty of agency or porous. Such a relationship intensely affects not only the context of aporia but its meaning as well: \n\nUltimately, aporia cannot be separated from this etymological and cultural history. Such history provides insight into aporia's perplexing semantic qualities as well as into the historical context in which the word functions as an indicator of the limits of language in constructing knowledge.\n\nIn philosophy, an aporia is a philosophical puzzle or a seemingly insoluble impasse in an inquiry, often arising as a result of equally plausible yet inconsistent premises (i.e. a paradox). It can also denote the state of being perplexed, or at a loss, at such a puzzle or impasse. The notion of an aporia is principally found in Greek philosophy, but it also plays a role in post-structuralist philosophy, as in the writings of Jacques Derrida and Luce Irigaray, and it has also served as an instrument of investigation in analytic philosophy.\n\nPlato's early dialogues are often called his 'aporetic' (Greek: ἀπορητικός) dialogues because they typically end in aporia. In such a dialogue, Socrates questions his interlocutor about the nature or definition of a concept, for example virtue or courage. Socrates then, through elenctic testing, shows his interlocutor that his answer is unsatisfactory. After a number of such failed attempts, the interlocutor admits he is in aporia about the examined concept, concluding that he does not know what it is. In Plato's \"Meno\" (84a-c), Socrates describes the purgative effect of reducing someone to aporia: it shows someone who merely thought he knew something that he does not in fact know it and instills in him a desire to investigate it.\n\nIn Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\", aporia plays a role in his method of inquiry. In contrast to a rationalist inquiry that begins from \"a priori\" principles, or an empiricist inquiry that begins from a \"tabula rasa\", he begins the \"Metaphysics\" by surveying the various \"aporiai\" that exist, drawing in particular on what puzzled his predecessors: \"with a view to the science we are seeking [i.e., metaphysics], it is necessary that we should first review the things about which we need, from the outset, to be puzzled\" (995a24). Book Beta of the \"Metaphysics\" is a list of the \"aporiai\" that preoccupy the rest of the work.\n\nIn Pyrrhonism aporia is intentionally induced as a means of producing ataraxia.\n\nContemporary academic studies of the term further characterize its usage in philosophical discourses. In \"Aporetics: Rational Deliberation in the Face of Inconsistency\" (2009), Nicholas Rescher is concerned with the methods in which an aporia, or \"apory\", is intellectually processed and resolved. In the Preface, Rescher identifies the work as an attempt to \"synthesize and systematize an aporetic procedure for dealing with information overload (of 'cognitive dissonance', as it is sometimes called)\" (ix). The text is also useful in that it provides a more precise (although specialized) definition of the concept: \"any cognitive situation in which the threat of inconsistency confronts us\" (1). Rescher further introduces his specific study of the apory by qualifying the term as \"a group of individually plausible but collectively incompatible theses\", a designation he illustrates with the following syllogism or \"cluster of contentions\":\n\nThe aporia, or \"apory\" of this syllogism lies in the fact that, while each of these assertions is individually conceivable, together they are inconsistent or impossible (i.e. they constitute a paradox). Rescher's study is indicative of the continuing presence of scholarly examinations of the concept of aporia and, furthermore, of the continuing attempts of scholars to translate the word, to describe its modern meaning.\n\nAporia is also a rhetorical device whereby the speaker expresses a doubt—often feigned—about his position or asks the audience rhetorically how he or she should proceed. One aim of aporia may be to discredit the speaker's opponent. Aporia is also called \"dubitatio\". For example:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "578673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=578673", "title": "Archivist", "text": "Archivist\n\nAn archivist (\"AR-kiv-ist\") is an information professional who assesses, collects, organizes, preserves, maintains control over, and provides access to records and archives determined to have long-term value. The records maintained by an archivist can consist of a variety of forms, including letters, diaries, logs, other personal documents, government documents, sound and/or picture recordings, digital files, or other physical objects.\n\nAs Richard Pearce-Moses wrote:\n\nDetermining what records have enduring value can be challenging. Archivists must also select records valuable enough to justify the costs of storage and preservation, plus the labor-intensive expenses of arrangement, description, and reference service. The theory and scholarly work underpinning archives practices is called archival science.\n\nThe most common related occupations are librarians, museum curators, and records managers. The archivist occupation is distinct from that of librarian. The two occupations have separate courses of training, adhere to separate and distinct principles, and are represented by separate professional organizations. In general, the librarian tends to deal with published media (where the metadata, such as author, title, and date of publication, may be readily apparent and can be presented in standardized form), whereas the archivist deals with unpublished media (which has different challenges such as the metadata not always being immediately apparent, containing complications and variety, and more likely to depend on provenance).\n\nIn addition, because archival records are frequently unique, some archivists may be as much concerned with the preservation and custody of the information carrier (i.e. the physical document) as with its informational content. In this regard, some would argue the archivist may have more in common with the museum curator than with the librarian.\n\nThe occupation of archivist is also frequently distinguished from that of records manager, although in this case the distinction is less absolute: the archivist is predominantly concerned with records deemed worthy of permanent preservation, whereas the records manager is more concerned with records of current administrative importance.\n\nArchivists' duties include acquiring and appraising new collections, arranging and describing records, providing reference service, and preserving materials. In arranging records, archivists apply two important principles: provenance and original order. Provenance refers to the creation of records and keeping different records separate in order to maintain context. Many entities create records, including governments, businesses, universities, and individuals. Original order is applied by keeping records in their order as established and maintained by the creator(s). Both provenance and original order are closely related to the concept of \"respect des fonds\", which states that records from one corporate body should not be mixed with records from another.\n\nThere are two aspects to arrangement: intellectual and physical. Both aspects follow the principle of original order. Archivists process the records physically by placing them in acid-free folders and boxes to ensure their long-term survival. They also process the records intellectually, by determining what the records consist of, how they are organized, and what, if any, finding aids need to be created. Finding aids can be box lists or descriptive inventories, or indexes. Even if the original arrangement is unclear or unhelpful in terms of accessing the collection, it is rarely rearranged to something that makes more sense. This is because preserving the original order shows how the creator of the records functioned, why the records were created, and how they went about arranging them. Moreover, the provenance and authenticity of the records may be lost. However, original order is not always the best way to maintain some collections and archivists must use their own experience and current best practices to determine the correct way to preserve collections of mixed media or those lacking a clear original arrangement.\n\nArchivists' work encompasses a range of ethical decisions that may be thought of as falling into three broad and intertwined areas: legal requirements; professional standards; and accountability to society in selecting and preserving documentary materials that serve as a primary source of knowledge, and influence collective memory and identity. In negotiating the ethical conflicts that arise in their work, archivists are guided by codes of ethics. The Society of American Archivists first adopted a code of ethics in 1980; the International Council on Archives adopted one in 1996.\n\nAlongside their work in arranging and caring for collections, archivists assist users in interpreting materials and answering inquiries. This reference work can be a small part of an archivist's job in a smaller organization, or consist of most of their occupation in a larger archive where specific roles (such as processing archivist and reference archivist) may be delineated.\n\nArchivists work for a variety of organizations, including government agencies, local authorities, museums, hospitals, historical societies, businesses, charities, corporations, colleges and universities, and any institution whose records may potentially be valuable to researchers, exhibitors, genealogists, or others. They can also work on the collections of a large family or even of an individual.\n\nArchivists are often educators as well; it is not unusual for an archivist employed at a university or college to lecture in a subject related to their collection. Archivists employed at cultural institutions or for local government frequently design educational or outreach programs to further the ability of archive users to understand and access information in their collections. This might include such varied activities as exhibitions, promotional events, or even media coverage.\n\nThe advent of Encoded Archival Description, along with increasing demand for materials to be made available online, has required archivists to become more tech-savvy in the past decade. Many archivists are now acquiring basic XML skills in order to make their finding aids available to researchers online.\n\nBecause of the varied nature of the job within different organizations and work environments, archivists need to have a wide range of skills:\n\nThe educational preparation for archivists varies from country to country.\n\nThe Australian Society of Archivists is the professional body for archivists, and is responsible for the accreditation of the various University courses. The first University to offer archival training was the University of New South Wales, starting in 1973. The course closed in 2000.\n\nCourses are now offered at Curtin University in Western Australia, Charles Sturt University in New South Wales, Monash University in Victoria and University of South Australia at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The course at Edith Cowan University is being phased out. Courses are offered in a variety of modes, including online via Open University Australia and through a combination of online and internal units at the various universities.\n\nThe profession has been regulated since 1978. Many universities in Brazil, such as the University of Brasilian (UnB), the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM) and the São Paulo State University (UNESP) offer the degree in archival science.\n\nIn Colombia, the Universidad de La Salle offers the degree of Professional in Information Systems, Library and Archival Sciences. It is a vocational training program, within existing legal standards aimed at providing knowledge, skills and abilities required for the design and management of information systems and documentation of various sorts. Its projection for the future is based on the application of new information technologies and communications for the management of information services economically viable. The program was created in 1971.\n\nOther institutions that offers a degree in Archival Science are:\n\nIn France, the oldest Archivist School is the \"École des chartes\", founded in 1821. This prestigious \"grande école\" (literally, \"grand schools) offers a diploma in \"Archivist-Paleography\" after a three-year curriculum. A part of its alumni pursue a State archivist career after an 18-month formation at the \"Institut national du patrimoine\". Most positions are reserved for European citizens.\n\nSome universities offer master's degree in Archival Science: Angers, Caen, Dijon, Lille III, Lyon III, Mulhouse, Versailles Saint-Quentin,\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the University College Dublin School of History and Archives offers a Masters of Arts degree in Archives and Records Management, recognised by the Society of Archivists.\n\nVictoria University of Wellington is the only tertiary institution in New Zealand provides postgraduate archival courses. Victoria Information Studies qualifications with ARCR endorsement have been recognized by Records and Information Management Professionals Australasia. Open Polytechnic of New Zealand provides undergraduate archival courses.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there are currently five full- or part-time postgraduate courses in archives administration or management which are recognised by the Archives and Records Association (United Kingdom and Ireland). Students are expected to have relevant paid or voluntary work experience before obtaining a place on the UK courses; many undertake a year's traineeship. Also, professional certification (after qualifying) can be pursued via the Registration Scheme offered by the Archives and Records Association.\n\nThe most common types of advanced degrees held by archivists are in archival science, public history, history, library science, or library and information science. It is also possible for archivists to earn a doctorate in library and information science. Archivists with a PhD often work as teaching faculty, deans, or directors of archival programs. In 2002, the Society of American Archivists published Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies; it also promotes and disseminates a code of ethics, which has undergone several revisions since it was first adopted in 1980.\n\nThe Academy of Certified Archivists offers supplemental archival training by means of a certification program. When first established in 1989, some critics of ACA certification objected to its annual membership fees, the theoretical versus practical nature of its tests, and the need for members to re-certify every five years. However, in the decades since, it has been agreed that such requirements are comparable with certification programs in other professions, and that certification strengthens professional standards and individual competencies. While some positions in archives require certification and many employers view certification as preferred, it is not required by all employers in the United States. Approximately 1,200+ archivists were certified by ACA, .\n\nMany archivists belong to a professional organization, such as the Society of American Archivists, the Association of Canadian Archivists, the Archives and Records Association (UK/Ireland), the Colombian College of Archivists - CCA, and the Australian Society of Archivists, as well as any number of local or regional associations. These organizations often provide ongoing educational opportunities to their members and other interested practitioners. In addition to formal degrees and or apprenticeships, many archivists take part in continuing education opportunities as available through professional associations and library school programs. New discoveries in the fields of media preservation and emerging technologies require continuing education as part of an archivist's job in order to stay current in the profession.\n\nThe first predecessors of archival science in the West are Jacob von Rammingen's manuals of 1571. and Baldassare Bonifacio's \"De Archivis libris singularis\" of 1632.\n\nIn 1883 French archivist Gabriel Richou published the first Western text on archival theory, entitled \"Traité théorique et pratique des archives publiques\" (\"Treaty of Theory and Practice of the Public Archives\"), in which he systematized the archival theory of the \"respect des fonds\", first published by Natalis de Wailly in 1841.\n\nIn 1898, three Dutch archivists, Samuel Muller, Johan Feith, and Robert Fruin, published the \"Handleiding voor het ordenen en beschrijven van archieven\" (\"Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives\"). Produced for the Dutch Association of Archivists, it set out one hundred rules for archivists to base their work around. Notably, within these rules, the principle of preserving provenance and original order was first argued for as an essential trait of archival arrangement and description.\n\nThe next major text was the \"Manual of Archive Administration\" published in 1922 by Hilary Jenkinson, then employed at the British Public Record Office: a revised edition appeared in 1937. In this work, Jenkinson states that archives are evidence and that the moral and physical defence of this evidential value is the central tenet of archival work. He further outlines his ideas of what an archive should be and how it should operate.\n\nIn 1956, T. R. Schellenberg, who is known as the \"Father of American Archival Appraisal\", published \"Modern Archives\". Schellenberg's work was intended to be an academic textbook defining archival methodology and giving archivists specific technical instruction on workflow and arrangement. Moving away from Jenkinson's organic and passive approach to archival acquisition, where the administrator decided what was kept and what was destroyed, Schellenberg argued for a more active approach by archivists to appraisal. His primary (administrative) and secondary (research) value model for the management and appraisal of records and archives allowed government archivists greater control over the influx of material that they faced after the Second World War. As a result of the widespread adoption of Schellenberg's methods, especially in the United States of America, modern Records Management as a separate but related discipline was born.\n\nIn 1972, Ernst Posner published \"Archives in the Ancient World\". Posner's work emphasized that archives were not new inventions, but had existed in many different societies throughout recorded history.\n\nIn 1975, essays by Margaret Cross Norton were collected under the title of \"Norton on Archives: The Writings of Margaret Cross Norton on Archival and Records Management\". Norton was one of the founders of the Society of American Archivists, and wrote essays based on her decades of experience working in the Illinois State Archives.\n\nArchivists, like librarians, are taking advantage of Web 2.0 technologies such as blogs, wikis, as well as open access and open source philosophies. While Archives 2.0 may refer to implementing new technologies, it is also a way of engaging with archives in an effort to promote openness and flexibility of archival materials. This can be achieved through community participation in archives, archivists actively engaging with their collections, and promoting archival benefits in the modern world.\n\nKate Theimer writes that in order to understand Archives 2.0, it must be compared against Archives 1.0. She asserts that her representation of Archives 1.0 is by no means exhaustive or fully comprehensive of the breadth of archival experience. The following is a list of contrasts between 1.0 and 2.0.\n\n\nThe technological tools of Archives 2.0 provide the foundational platforms to help the change from 1.0 to 2.0. When working in an archives that is dedicated to upholding 2.0 standards, the focus has shifted onto the user experience at an archives: community use, or research and reference help.\n\n\n"}

In the Greco-Roman world, aretologies represent a religious branch of rhetoric and are a prose development of the hymn as praise poetry. Asclepius, Isis, and Serapis are among the deities with surviving aretologies in the form of inscriptions and papyri. The Greek \"aretologos\" (ἀρετολόγος, \"virtue-speaker\") was a temple official who recounted aretologies and may have also interpreted dreams.\n\nBy extension, an aretology is also a \"catalogue of virtues\" belonging to a person; for example, Cicero's list and description of the virtues of Pompeius Magnus (\"Pompey the Great\") in the speech \"Pro Lege Manilia\". Aretology became part of the Christian rhetorical tradition of hagiography.\n\nIn an even more expanded sense, aretology is moral philosophy which deals with virtue, its nature, and the means of arriving at it.

{"id": "2226891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226891", "title": "Ballad opera", "text": "Ballad opera\n\nThe ballad opera is a genre of English stage entertainment that originated in the early 18th century, and continued to develop over the following century and later. Like the earlier \"comédie en vaudeville\" and the later \"Singspiel\", its distinguishing characteristic is the use of tunes in a popular style (either pre-existing or newly composed) with spoken dialogue. These English plays were 'operas' mainly insofar as they satirized the conventions of the imported \"opera seria\". Music critic Peter Gammond describes the ballad opera as \"an important step in the emancipation of both the musical stage and the popular song.\"\n\nBallad opera has been called an \"eighteenth-century protest against the Italian conquest of the London operatic scene.\" It consists of racy and often satirical spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short (mostly a single short stanza and refrain) to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story, which involves lower class, often criminal, characters, and typically shows a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period.\n\nIt is generally accepted that the first ballad opera, and the one that was to prove the most successful, was \"The Beggar's Opera\" of 1728. It had a libretto by John Gay and music arranged by Johann Christoph Pepusch, both of whom probably experienced vaudeville theatre in Paris, and may have been motivated to reproduce it in an English form. They were also probably influenced by the burlesques and musical plays of Thomas D'Urfey (1653–1723) who had a reputation for fitting new words to existing songs; a popular anthology of these settings was published in 1700 and frequently re-issued. A number of the tunes from this anthology were recycled in \"The Beggar's Opera\".\n\nAfter the success of \"The Beggar's Opera\", many similar pieces were staged. The actor Thomas Walker, who played Macheath in the original production, wrote several ballad operas, and Gay produced further works in this style, including a much less successful sequel, \"Polly\". Henry Fielding, Colley Cibber, Charles Coffey, Thomas Arne, Charles Dibdin, Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity. By the middle of the century, however, the genre was already in decline.\n\nAlthough they featured the lower reaches of society, the audiences for these works were typically the London bourgeois. As a reaction to serious opera (at this time almost invariably sung in Italian), the music, for these audiences, was as satirical in its way as the words of the play. The plays themselves contained references to contemporary politics—in \"The Beggar's Opera\" the character Peachum was a lampoon of Sir Robert Walpole. This satirical element meant that many of them risked censorship and banning—as was the case with Gay's successor to \"The Beggar's Opera\", \"Polly\".\n\nThe tunes of the original ballad operas were almost all pre-existing (somewhat in the manner of a modern \"jukebox musical\"): however they were taken from a wide variety of contemporary sources, including folk melodies, popular airs by classical composers (such as Purcell) and even children's nursery rhymes. A significant source from which the music was drawn was the fund of popular airs to which 18th century London broadside ballads are set. It is from this connection that the term \"ballad opera\" is drawn. This ragbag of \"pre-loved\" music is a good test for distinguishing between the original type of ballad opera and its later forms. Many ballad operas used the same tunes, such as \"Lillibullero\", and by about 1750 it had become clear that there was a need for new tunes to be written. In 1762, Thomas Arne's \"Love in a Village\" presented a new form of ballad opera, with mainly new music and much less reliance on traditional tunes. It was followed in similar style by Charles Dibdin's \"Lionel and Clarissa\" in 1768.\n\n\"The Disappointment\" (1762) represents an early American attempt at such a ballad opera.\n\nIn 1736 the Prussian ambassador in England commissioned an arrangement in German of a popular ballad opera, \"The Devil to Pay\", by Charles Coffey. This was successfully performed in Hamburg, Leipzig and elsewhere in Germany in the 1740s. A new version was produced by C. F. Weisse and Johann Adam Hiller in 1766. The success of this version was the first of many by these collaborators, who have been called (according to Grove) \"the fathers of the German Singspiel\". (The storyline of \"The Devil to Pay\" was also adapted for Gluck for his 1759 French opera \"Le diable à quatre\").\n\nA later development, also often referred to as ballad opera, was a more \"pastoral\" form. In subject matter, especially, these \"ballad operas\" were antithetical to the more satirical variety. In place of the rag-bag of pre-existing music found in (for example) \"The Beggar's Opera\", the scores of these works consisted in the main of original music, although they not infrequently quoted folk melodies, or imitated them. Thomas Arne and Isaac Bickerstaffe's \"Love in a Village\", and William Shield's \"Rosina\" (1781) are typical examples. Many of these works were introduced as after-pieces to performances of Italian operas.\n\nLater in the century broader comedies such as Richard Brinsley Sheridan's \"The Duenna\" and the innumerable works of Charles Dibdin moved the balance back towards the original style, but there was little remaining of the impetus of the satirical ballad opera.\n\nEnglish 19th century opera is very heavily drawn from the \"pastoral\" form of the ballad opera, and traces even of the satiric kind can be found in the work of \"serious\" practitioners such as John Barnett. Much of the satiric spirit (albeit in a greatly refined form) of the original ballad opera can be found in Gilbert's contribution to the Savoy operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, and the more pastoral form of ballad opera is satirised in one of Gilbert and Sullivan's early works, \"The Sorcerer\" (1877). Balfe's opera \"The Bohemian Girl\" (1843) is one of the few British Ballad operas of the 20th century to gain international recognition.\n\n\"The Threepenny Opera\" of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht (1928) is a reworking of \"The Beggar's Opera\", setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite. On the other hand, it uses just one tune from the original—all the other music being specially composed, and thus omits one of the most distinctive features of the original ballad opera.\n\nIn a completely different vein, \"Hugh the Drover\", an opera in two acts by Ralph Vaughan Williams first staged in 1924, is also sometimes referred to as a \"ballad opera\". It is plainly much closer to Shield's \"Rosina\" than to \"The Beggar's Opera\".\n\nIn the twentieth century folk singers have produced musical plays with folk or folk-like songs called \"ballad operas\". Alan Lomax, Pete Seeger, Burl Ives, and others recorded \"The Martins and the Coys\" in 1944, and Peter Bellamy and others recorded \"The Transports\" in 1977. The first of these is in some ways connected to the \"pastoral\" form of the ballad opera, and the latter to the satiric \"Beggar's Opera\" type, but in all they represent yet further reinterpretations of the term.\n\nIronically, it is in the musicals of Kander and Ebb—especially \"Chicago\" and \"Cabaret\"—that the kind of satire embodied in \"The Beggar's Opera\" and its immediate successors is probably best preserved, although here, as in Weill's version, the music is specially composed, unlike the first ballad operas of the 18th century.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4254743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4254743", "title": "Chorography", "text": "Chorography\n\nChorography (from χῶρος \"khōros\", \"place\" and γράφειν \"graphein\", \"to write\") is the art of describing or mapping a region or district, and by extension such a description or map. This term derives from the writings of the ancient geographer Pomponius Mela and Ptolemy, where it meant the geographical description of regions. However, its resonances of meaning have varied at different times. Richard Helgerson states that \"chorography defines itself by opposition to chronicle. It is the genre devoted to place, and chronicle is the genre devoted to time\". Darrell Rohl prefers a broad definition of \"the representation of space or place\".\n\nIn his text of the \"Geographia\" (2nd century CE), Ptolemy defined geography as the study of the entire world, but chorography as the study of its smaller parts—provinces, regions, cities, or ports. Its goal was \"an impression of a part, as when one makes an image of just an ear or an eye\"; and it dealt with \"the qualities rather than the quantities of the things that it sets down\". Ptolemy implied that it was a \"graphic\" technique, comprising the making of views (not simply maps), since he claimed that it required the skills of a draftsman or landscape artist, rather than the more technical skills of recording \"proportional placements\". Ptolemy's most recent English translators, however, render the term as \"regional cartography\".\n\nPtolemy's text was rediscovered in the west at the beginning of the fifteenth century, and the term \"chorography\" was revived by humanist scholars. An early instance is a small-scale map of Britain in an early fifteenth-century manuscript, which is labelled a \"tabula chorographica\". John Dee in 1570 regarded the practice as \"an underling, and a twig of \"Geographie\"\", by which the \"plat\" [plan or drawing] of a particular place would be exhibited to the eye.\nThe term also came to be used, however, for \"written\" descriptions of regions. These regions were extensively visited by the writer, who then combined local topographical description, summaries of the historical sources, and local knowledge and stories, into a text. The most influential example (at least in Britain) was probably William Camden's \"Britannia\" (first edition 1586), which described itself on its title page as a \"Chorographica descriptio\". William Harrison in 1587 similarly described his own \"Description of Britaine\" as an exercise in chorography, distinguishing it from the historical/chronological text of Holinshed's \"Chronicles\" (to which the \"Description\" formed an introductory section). Peter Heylin in 1652 defined chorography as \"the exact description of some Kingdom, Countrey, or particular Province of the same\", and gave as examples Pausanias's \"Description of Greece\" (2nd century AD); Camden's \"Britannia\" (1586); Lodovico Guicciardini's \"Descrittione di tutti i Paesi Bassi\" (1567) (on the Low Countries); and Leandro Alberti's \"Descrizione d'Italia\" (1550).\n\nCamden's \"Britannia\" was predominantly concerned with the history and antiquities of Britain, and, probably as a result, the term chorography in English came to be particularly associated with antiquarian texts. William Lambarde, John Stow, John Hooker, Michael Drayton, Tristram Risdon, John Aubrey and many others used it in this way, arising from a gentlemanly topophilia and a sense of service to one's county or city, until it was eventually often applied to the genre of county history. A late example was William Grey's \"Chorographia\" (1649), a survey of the antiquities of the city of Newcastle upon Tyne. Even before Camden's work appeared, Andrew Melville in 1574 had referred to chorography and chronology as the \"twa lights\" [two lights] of history.\nHowever, the term also continued to be used for maps and map-making, particularly of sub-national or county areas. William Camden praised the county mapmakers Christopher Saxton and John Norden as \"most skilfull Chorographers\"; and Robert Plot in 1677 and Christopher Packe in 1743 both referred to their county maps as chorographies.\n\nBy the beginning of the eighteenth century the term had largely fallen out of use in all these contexts, being superseded for most purposes by either \"topography\" or \"cartography\". Samuel Johnson in his \"Dictionary\" (1755) made a distinction between geography, chorography and topography, arguing that geography dealt with large areas, topography with small areas, but chorography with intermediary areas, being \"less in its object than geography, and greater than topography\". In practice, however, the term is only rarely found in English by this date.\n\nIn more technical geographical literature, the term had been abandoned as city views and city maps became more and more sophisticated and demanded a set of skills that required not only skilled draftsmanship but also some knowledge of scientific surveying. However, its use was revived for a second time in the late nineteenth century by the geographer Ferdinand von Richthofen. He regarded chorography as a specialization within geography, comprising the description through field observation of the particular traits of a given area.\n\nThe term is also now widely used by historians and literary scholars to refer to the early modern genre of topographical and antiquarian literature.\n\n\n"}

Deaccessioning is a practical and constructive tool of collections care that, if practiced thoughtfully supports the long-term preservation of a collection and can help a museum refine the scope of its collection in order to better serve its mission and community.\n\nThe process undertaken by a museum to deaccession a work involves several steps that are usually laid out in a museum`s Collection Management Policy. The terms under which an object may be considered for removal, as well as the individuals with the authority to approve the process are outlined in the \"Deaccession\" section of this document. Additionally, this section lays out the legal restrictions and ethic considerations associated with removal of the object and the types of disposal that are appropriate based on the reason for the deaccession.\n\nEach museum establishes its own method and workflow for the deaccession process according to its organizational structure. However all object deaccessioning involves the two processing steps of deaccession and disposal.\n\nThe process begins with the curator creating a document called a \"Statement of Justification,\" which outlines their decision criteria and reasoning for presenting the work as a possible deaccession. In order to determine if a work should be deaccessioned from a museum`s collection, a curator or registrar completes and documents a series of justification steps and then present their findings to the museum director and governing board for final approval.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why deaccessioning might be considered. The following is a typical list of criteria for deaccession and disposal:\n\n\nThe typical steps that need to be taken in order to justify the deaccession and disposal of the work include:\n\n\nDisposal is defined as the transfer of ownership by the museum after a work has been deaccessioned. Following approval of deaccession from the Governing Board and/or the CEO/Museum Director, the work is disposed of and the title of ownership is completely transferred away from the museum or terminated. The method chosen is determined by the physical condition of the work, the intrinsic value or cultural value of the work and extrinsic value or monetary value of the work. With all methods of disposal, museums are charged to maintain and retain all records of the object, its deaccession and disposal.\n\nThe process of disposal is completed through the following methods:\n\n\nSeveral professional museum associations have drafted codes of ethics governing the practice of deaccession.nTwo majors areas of ethical concern that are common in these codes of ethics are the prohibition of sale or transfer of collection items to museum trustees, staff, board members, or their relatives and the need to restrict the use of proceeds from any works disposed of via sale or auction.\n\nThe first of these ethical concerns is rather straightforward. The second has become a point of contention in recent years since museums and cities, like Detroit, have been struggling with financial shortfalls.\n\nAccording to the AAMD (The Association of Art Museum Directors): \"Funds received from the disposal of a deaccessioned work shall not be used for operations or capital expenses. Such funds, including any earnings and appreciation thereon, may be used only for the acquisition of works in a manner consistent with the museum’s policy on the use of restricted acquisition funds.\"\n\nAccording to the AAM (the American Association of Museums): \"Proceeds from the sale of nonliving collections are to be used consistent with the established standards of the museum`s discipline, but in no event shall they be used for anything other than acquisition or direct care of collections.\"\n\nAccording to the AASLH (the American Association for State and Local History): \"Collections shall not be deaccessioned or disposed of in order to provide financial support for institutional operations, facilities maintenance, or any reason other than the preservation or acquisition of collections.\"\n\nAccording to ICOM (the International Council of Museums): Proceeds should be applied solely to the purchase of additions to museum collections.\n\nThese associations have each determined to their own degree that all proceeds from sale or auction should be restricted to the future acquisition of collection objects and/ or to the ongoing maintenance of current collection holdings. Their decision and perspective on the practice of deaccession reflects a long-term view of museum collections as items held in public trust and preserved for access, appreciation, education, and enjoyment of not only today`s public but the future public. See Public trust doctrine\n\nDeaccessioning is a controversial topic and activity, with diverging opinions from artists, arts professionals and the general public. Some commentators, such as Donn Zaretsky of The Art Law Blog critique the notion of \"the public trust\" and argue that deaccessioning rules should probably be thrown out altogether. Others, such as Susan Taylor, director of the New Orleans Museum of Art and the AAMD's current president, believes that proceeds from the sale or funds from the deaccession can only be used to buy other works of art.\n\n"}

Description is one of four rhetorical modes (also known as \"modes of discourse\"), along with exposition, argumentation, and narration. In practice it would be difficult to write literature that drew on just one of the four basic modes.\n\nFiction-writing also has modes: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition. Author Peter Selgin refers to \"methods\", including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scenes, and description. Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of fiction-writing modes and their uses.\n\nDescription is the fiction-writing mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story. Together with dialogue, narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes. As stated in \"Writing from A to Z\", edited by Kirk Polking, description is more than the amassing of details; it is bringing something to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect. The most appropriate and effective techniques for presenting description are a matter of ongoing discussion among writers and writing coaches.\n\nA purple patch is an over-written passage in which the writer has strained too hard to achieve an impressive effect, by elaborate figures or other means. The phrase (Latin: \"purpureus pannus\") was first used by the Roman poet Horace in his \"Ars Poetica\" (c. 20 BC) to denote an irrelevant and excessively ornate passage; the sense of irrelevance is normally absent in modern usage, although such passages are usually incongruous. By extension, purple prose is lavishly figurative, rhythmic, or otherwise overwrought.\n\nIn philosophy, the nature of description has been an important question since Bertrand Russell's classical texts.\n\n"}
{"id": "3176466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3176466", "title": "Development anthropology", "text": "Development anthropology\n\nDevelopment anthropology refers to the application of anthropological perspectives to the multidisciplinary branch of development studies. It takes international development and international aid as primary objects. In this branch of anthropology, the term \"development\" refers to the social action made by different agents (e.g. institutions, businesses, states, or independent volunteers) who are trying to modify the economic, technical, political, or/and social life of a given place in the world, especially in impoverished, formerly colonized regions.\n\nDevelopment anthropologists share a commitment to simultaneously critique and contribute to projects and institutions that create and administer Western projects that seek to improve the economic well-being of the most marginalized, and to eliminate poverty. While some theorists distinguish between the anthropology of development (in which development is the object of study) and development anthropology (as an applied practice), this distinction is increasingly thought of as obsolete. With researches on the field, the anthropologist can describe, analyze, and understand the different actions of development that took and take place in a given place. The various impacts on the local population, environment, society, and economy are to be examined.\n\nIn 1971, Glynn Cochrane proposed development anthropology as a new field for practitioners interested in a career outside academia. Given the growing complexity of development assistance, Cochrane suggested that graduates needed to prepare themselves to work in interdisciplinary settings. In 1973, Cochrane was invited by the World Bank to make recommendations for the use of anthropology, and his report (which stressed the need for the systematic treatment of social issues) laid a foundation for future use of the discipline in the World Bank Group. Around ninety anthropologists are now employed by the World Bank Group in various roles.\n\nIn 1974, Bob Berg—of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)—and Cochrane worked together, and, as a result, USAID introduced \"social soundness analysis\" as a project preparation requirement. This innovation led to the employment of more than seventy anthropologists. Social soundness analysis has now been in USAID use for over forty years. USAID ran an in-house development studies course in the 1970s, through which several hundred field personnel eventually passed. In addition to anthropology, the course covered development economics, regional and national planning, and institution building.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Thayer Scudder, Michael Horowitz, and David Brokensha established an Institute for Development Anthropology at the State University of New York at Binghamton. This institute has played an influential role in the continuing expansion of this branch of the discipline.\n\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, development anthropology began to be more widely used in the private sector. Corporate social responsibility and issues ranging from resettlement and human rights to micro-enterprise are now routinely addressed by systematic social assessment as an integral part of investment appraisal.\n\nCriticism of Western development became an important goal in the late 1980s, after the wake of severe economic crisis brought disease, poverty, and starvation to countries and sectors that were the focus of large Western structural adjustment development projects throughout Latin America, Africa, and other parts of the former colonial world. Despite the failure of many of these development projects, and some 40 years of post World War II funding from the US and Europe, scholars know that development has been the key way that Western post-industrialized countries intervene in non-Western society. Development criticism seeks to discover why, given the funds and best intentions of volunteers and policy makers, do the majority of development projects continue to fail to (1) redistribute economic power and resources in a way that helps the poorest sectors of society, and (2) to create economic growth that is sustainable in the country.\n\nAnthropologists who study development projects themselves have criticized the fundamental structure of Western development projects coming from such institutions as USAID and bilateral lenders such as the World Bank. Because they are often working from the perspective of the objects of development in the non-Western world, rather than from within the aid institutions, anthropologists encountering such projects have a unique perspective from which to see the problems. Anthropologists write with concern about the ways that non-Western objects of aid have been left out of the widespread drive to develop after World War II, especially in the ways that such projects limit solutions to poverty in the form of narrow Western capitalist models that promote exploitation and the destruction of household farms, or, more suspiciously, naturalise inequality between Western post-industrialized countries and former colonial subjects.\n\nSome describe the anthropological critique of development as one that pits modernization and an eradication of the indigenous culture, but this is too reductive and not the case with the majority of scholarly work. In fact, most anthropologists who work in impoverished areas desire the same economic relief for the people they study as policymakers; however, they are wary about the assumptions and models on which development interventions are based. Anthropologists and others who critique development projects instead view Western development itself as a product of Western culture that must be refined in order to better help those it claims to aid. The problem therefore is not that of markets driving out culture, but of the fundamental blind-spots of Western developmental culture itself. Criticism often focuses therefore on the cultural bias and blind-spots of Western development institutions, or modernization models that systematically represent non-Western societies as more deficient than the West; erroneously assume that Western modes of production and historical processes are repeatable in all contexts; or that do not take into account hundreds of years of colonial exploitation by the West that has tended to destroy the resources of former colonial society. Most critically, anthropologists argue that sustainable development requires at the very least more involvement of the people who the project aims to target in the project's creation, its management, and its decision-making processes.\n\nA major critique of development from anthropologists came from Arturo Escobar's seminal book \"Encountering Development\", which argued that Western development largely exploited non-Western peoples and enacted an Orientalism (see Edward Said). Escobar even sees international development as a means for the Occident to keep control over the resources of former colonies. Escobar shows that, between 1945 and 1960, the former colonies were going through the decolonization era, and the development plan helped to maintain the third world's dependency on the old metropole. Development projects themselves flourished in the wake of World War II, and during the Cold War, when they were developed to (1) stop the spread of communism with the spread of capitalist markets, and (2) create more prosperity for the West and its products by creating a global consumer demand for finished Western products abroad. Some scholars blame the different agents for having only considered a small aspect of the local people's lives without analyzing broader consequences, while others like dependency theory or Escobar argue that development projects are doomed to failure for the fundamental ways they privilege Western industry and corporations. Escobar's argument echos the earlier work of dependency theory and follows a larger critique more recently posed by Michel Foucault and other post-structuralists.\n\nMore recent studies like James Ferguson's \"The Anti-Politics Machine\" argue that the ideas and institutional structure that support Western development projects are fundamentally flawed because of the way the West continues to represent the former colonial world. International development uses an \"anti-politics\" that ultimately produces failure, despite the best intentions. Finally, studies also point out how development efforts often attempt to de-politicize change by a focus on instrumental assistance (like a school building) but not on the objective conditions that led to the development failure (e.g., the state's neglect of rural children at the expense of urban elite), nor the content of what the school might or might not teach. In this sense, the critique of international development focuses on the insidious effects of projects that at the least offer band-aids that address symptoms but not causes, and that at the worst promote projects that systematically redirect economic resources and profit to the West.\n\nWhile anthropological studies critique the Western assumptions and political context of development projects, anthropologists also consult on and work within aid institutions in the creation and implementation of development projects. While economists look at aggregate measures like gross national product and per capita income, as well as measures of income distribution and economic inequality in a society, anthropologists can provide a more fine-grained analysis of the qualitative information behind these numbers, such as the nature of the social groups involved and the social significance of the composition of income. Thus, development anthropologists often deal with assessing the important qualitative aspects of development sometimes ignored by an economic approach.\n\n\n"}

Theory and Practice of Dialogic Learning\".\n\nEgalitarian dialogue is one of the seven principles of dialogic learning (Flecha, 2000), the others being cultural intelligence, equality of differences, creation of meaning, instrumental dimension, solidarity, and transformation. The principle of egalitarian dialogue is deeply interrelated with the other principles of dialogic learning. By recognizing all people's cultural intelligence and respecting differences from an egalitarian standpoint, egalitarian dialogue encourages individuals to create meaning, develop solidarity among different people, and create new instrumental dimensions. This interdependence among the principles of dialogic learning favors constant social transformation.\n\nThe recognition and respect of different types of knowledge raises the awareness that each person has something to share, something different and equally important. Therefore, the wider the diversity of voices engaged in egalitarian dialogue, the better the knowledge that can be dialogically constructed. In this sense, dialogic learning is oriented towards equality of differences, stating that true equality includes the right to live in a different way (Flecha, 2000). This perspective, which Paulo Freire (1997) calls \"unity in diversity\", never defends diversity or difference without simultaneously proposing equality and fairness toward different individual and groups.\n\nEquality of differences is also enacted in the Learning Communities (Valls, 2000; Elboj et al., 2001). The Learning Communities are schools in Spain, Brazil and Chile that have undergone a process of educational and social transformation based on dialogic learning. In the learning communities, the equality of differences principle is shown, among other practices, in the interactive groups (Aubert et al., 2004), where students and adults who have different levels of instruction and are from different backgrounds, teach and learn from each other. Those interactions create Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky, 1978), this showing that meaning-making and learning do not depend solely on the intervention of professionals, but on all the knowledge brought by anyone related to the students (Flecha, 2000).\n\nHabermas (2004a, 2004b) has stressed the need to recover the lifeworld from its systemic colonization by the “steering media” of power, law and bureaucratization. The systemic decolonization is a way of reinventing democracy in public spaces and institutions and for recovering meaning. Habermas' concept of lifeworld refers to the everyday contexts where people relate to each other and create meaning and structures to organize themselves. In Habermas' view, and also from a dialogic learning perspective, subjects create meaning through intersubjectivity or the interaction among subjects engaged in egalitarian dialogue.\n\nAny person can engage in such meaning making dialogue because humans have \"epistemological curiosity\", which when expressed in egalitarian dialogue can criticize and end with what Freire (2001) called the \"bureaucratizing of the mind\", an invisible power of alienating domestication. Such debureaucratization process can be seen in Dialogic Musical Gatherings (CONFAPEA, 2005), where people develop their epistemological curiosity listening to classical music and later engaging in a dialogue about the instruments that were playing, about the composer, his life and his position in a historical context, the style of the music listened to and its relationship with the cultural claims of each participant belonging to the Music Gathering, etc. In this process, meaning is created and recovered because music escapes the system and goes back to people's lifeworld tearing down the walls of cultural elitism.\n\nThe Instrumental Dimension of learning, as a principle of dialogic learning, should not be confused with instrumentality or the technocratic colonization of learning. In dialogic learning, as in Habermas (1984), the instrumental and communicative rationality are not opposed to each other, but instrumental learning becomes more intense and profound when situated in an adequate dialogical framework. The ability to select and process information is the cognitive tool that best enables one to function confidently in today's society. Dialogue and reflection encourage the development of that ability. Relationships with other people put not only diverse information but also its selection and processing at our disposal(Flecha, 2000, p. 16). In addition, \"when dialogue is egalitarian, it encourages intense reflection, since people need to understand other positions and express their own\" (Flecha, 2000, p. 16). In this sense, in egalitarian dialogue, procedures and ends are dialogically agreed. Those work for purposes of understanding, and do not let interactants hide themselves behind means that obscure exclusionary interests.\n\nIn education without dialogue, every single item becomes a target for power claims, even methods and instruments for learning, and therefore, the bureaucratization of those elements is inevitable. For this reason, the instrumental dimension of dialogic learning is never purely instrumental. It is also ethical, respectful, characterized by a sense of solidarity that contributes to break up the existing educational structure.\n\nSolidarity feeds dialogue, but at the same time, egalitarian dialogue, as essential communication, must underlie any act of solidarity (Freire, 1970). That is why, \"egalitarian educational practices must be grounded in conceptions of solidarity\" (Flecha, 2000, p. 20).\n\nThe emphasis of dialogic learning on solidarity as the wheel that drives this perspective on education can be evidenced in the Learning Communities. For instance, in the School for Adults La Verneda-Sant Martí (Sánchez, 1999; Flecha, 2000) all the activities are open to anyone from the community and the city, and are also deeply integrated in the neighborhood. Because of discussing books from the classic literature through dialogic learning, the dialogic literary gatherings help improve the lives of the participants in the gathering but also of other people in the school and the neighborhood, when for example some participants in the gathering take part of different committees of the school that plan actions of social transformation in the neighborhood, the city and beyond.\n\nIn this sense, solidarity is not only understood as an act for identifying and denouncing problems, but also as means to solve them. Solidarity does not only imply denouncing the process of dehumanization, but also announcing the dream of a new society (Freire, 2001). In this regard, solidarity goes beyond rebellious attitudes that do not propose an alternative, and reaches a more radically critical and dialogical position that implies the transformation of oneself, institutions, and the world.\n\n"}
{"id": "154076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154076", "title": "Epiphany (feeling)", "text": "Epiphany (feeling)\n\nAn epiphany (from the ancient Greek ἐπιφάνεια, \"epiphaneia\", \"manifestation, striking appearance\") is an experience of a sudden and striking realization. Generally the term is used to describe scientific breakthrough, religious or philosophical discoveries, but it can apply in any situation in which an enlightening realization allows a problem or situation to be understood from a new and deeper perspective. Epiphanies are studied by psychologists and other scholars, particularly those attempting to study the process of innovation.\n\nEpiphanies are relatively rare occurrences and generally follow a process of significant thought about a problem. Often they are triggered by a new and key piece of information, but importantly, a depth of prior knowledge is required to allow the leap of understanding. Famous epiphanies include Archimedes's discovery of a method to determine the density of an object (\"Eureka!\") and Isaac Newton's realization that a falling apple and the orbiting moon are both pulled by the same force.\n\nThe word epiphany originally referred to insight through the divine. Today, this concept is more often used without such connotations, but a popular implication remains that the epiphany is supernatural, as the discovery seems to come suddenly from the outside.\n\nThe word's secular usage may owe much of its popularity to Irish novelist James Joyce. The Joycean epiphany has been defined as \"a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mind — the manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly logical relevance of whatever produces it.\" The author used epiphany as a literary device within each entry of his short story collection \"Dubliners\" (1914); his protagonists came to sudden recognitions that changed their view of themselves and/or their social conditions. Joyce had first expounded on epiphany's meaning in the fragment \"Stephen Hero,\" although this was only published posthumously in 1944. For the philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas, epiphany or a manifestation of the divine is seen in another's face (see face-to-face).\n\nIn traditional and pre-modern cultures, initiation rites and mystery religions have served as vehicles of epiphany, as well as the arts. The Greek dramatists and poets would, in the ideal, induct the audience into states of \"catharsis\" or \"kenosis\", respectively. In modern times an epiphany lies behind the title of William Burroughs' \"Naked Lunch\", a drug-influenced state, as Burroughs explained, \"a frozen moment when everyone sees what is at the end of the fork.\" Both the Dadaist Marcel Duchamp and the Pop Artist Andy Warhol would invert expectations by presenting commonplace objects or graphics as works of fine art (for example a urinal as a fountain), simply by presenting them in a way no one had thought to do before; the result was intended to induce an epiphany of \"what art is\" or is not.\n\nEpiphanies can come in many different forms, and are often generated by a complex combination of experience, memory, knowledge, predisposition and context. A contemporary example of an epiphany in education might involve the process by which a student arrives at some form of new insight or clarifying thought. Despite this popular image, epiphany is the result of significant work on the part of the discoverer, and is only the satisfying result of a long process. The surprising and fulfilling feeling of epiphany is so surprising because one cannot predict when one's labor will bear fruit, and our subconscious can play a significant part in delivering the solution; and is fulfilling because it is a reward for a long period of effort.\n\nA common myth predicts that most, if not all, innovations occur through epiphanies. Not all innovations occur through epiphanies; Scott Berkun notes that \"the most useful way to think of an epiphany is as an occasional bonus of working on tough problems\". Most innovations occur without epiphany, and epiphanies often contribute little towards finding the next one. Crucially, epiphany cannot be predicted, or controlled.\n\nAlthough epiphanies are only a rare occurrence, crowning a process of significant labor, there is a common myth that epiphanies of sudden comprehension are commonly responsible for leaps in technology and the sciences. Famous epiphanies include Archimedes' realization of how to estimate the volume of a given mass, which inspired him to shout \"Eureka!\" (\"I have found it!\"). The biographies of many mathematicians and scientists include an epiphanic episode early in the career, the ramifications of which were worked out in detail over the following years. For example, allegedly Albert Einstein was struck as a young child by being given a compass, and realizing that some unseen force in space was making it move. Another, perhaps better, example from Einstein's life occurred in 1905 after he had spent an evening unsuccessfully trying to reconcile Newtonian physics and Maxwell's equations. While taking a streetcar home, he looked behind him at the receding clocktower in Bern and realized that if the car sped up close to the speed of light, he would see the clock slow down; with this thought, he later remarked, \"a storm broke loose in my mind,\" which would allow him to understand special relativity. Einstein had a second epiphany two years later in 1907 which he called \"the happiest thought of my life\" when he imagined an elevator falling, and realized that a passenger would not be able to tell the difference between the weightlessness of falling, and the weightlessness of space - a thought which allowed him to generalize his theory of relativity to include gravity as a curvature in spacetime. A similar flash of holistic understanding in a prepared mind was said to give Charles Darwin his \"hunch\" (about natural selection), and Darwin later stated that he always remembered the spot in the road where his carriage was when the epiphany struck. Another famous epiphany myth is associated with Isaac Newton's apple story, and yet another with Nikola Tesla's discovery of a workable alternating current induction motor. Though such epiphanies might have occurred, they were almost certainly the result of long and intensive periods of study those individuals had undertaken, rather than an out-of-the-blue flash of inspiration about an issue they had not thought about previously.\n\nAnother myth is that epiphany is simply another word for (usually spiritual) vision. Actually, realism and psychology make epiphany a different mode as distinguished from vision, even though both vision and epiphany are often triggered by (sometimes seemingly) irrelevant incidents or objects.\n\nIn Christianity, the Epiphany refers to a realization that Christ is the Son of God. Western churches generally celebrate the Visit of the Magi as the revelation of the Incarnation of the infant Christ, and commemorate the Feast of the Epiphany on January 6. Traditionally, Eastern churches, following the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar, have celebrated Epiphany (or Theophany) in conjunction with Christ's baptism by John the Baptist and celebrated it on January 19; however, other Eastern churches have adopted the Western Calendar and celebrate it on January 6. Some Protestant churches often celebrate Epiphany as a season, extending from the last day of Christmas until either Ash Wednesday, or the Feast of the Presentation on February 2.\n\nIn more general terms, the phrase \"religious epiphany\" is used when a person realizes their faith, or when they are convinced that an event or happening was really caused by a deity or being of their faith. In Hinduism, for example, epiphany might refer to Arjuna's realization that Krishna (incarnation of God serving as his charioteer in the \"Bhagavad Gita\") is indeed representing the Universe. The Hindu term for epiphany would be bodhodaya, from Sanskrit bodha 'wisdom' and udaya 'rising'. Or in Buddhism, the term might refer to the Buddha obtaining enlightenment under the bodhi tree, finally realizing the nature of the universe, and thus attaining Nirvana. The Zen term \"kensho\" also describes this moment, referring to the feeling attendant on realizing the answer to a \"koan\".\n\n"}

In many modern western societies foster care can be organised by the state to care for children with troubled family backgrounds, usually on a temporary basis. In many pre-modern societies fosterage was a form of patronage, whereby influential families cemented political relationships by bringing up each other's children, similar to arranged marriages, also based on dynastic or alliance calculations.\n\nThis practice was once common in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland.\nIn his \"A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland\" (1775), writer Samuel Johnson described the fosterage custom as he saw it practised.\n\nFosterage or \"fostering\" is frequently referred to in the medieval Sagas of Icelanders. Original family ties and rights of inheritance were not affected, nor was it required for the fostered child to be an orphan or for the biological father to be deceased. Moreover, the fostering of another man's child was regarded as a source of honor to the birth father; and conventionally the fostering party was of inferior social status to the biological father. An exception to this convention is found in Njáls saga, where Njál Thorgeirsson, a very prominent man, fosters Hoskuld, the son of Thrain Sigfusson, after the death of Thrain in battle.\nPortions of Ireland, Scotland and the Hebrides were ruled for long periods of time by Norse invaders during the Middle Ages; but it is unknown which culture was the original source of the custom of fosterage.\n\nIn Ancient Ireland, ollams taught children either for payment or for no compensation. Children were taught a particular trade and treated like family; their original family ties were often severed.\n\nThere was similar custom in the Caucasus, called Atalik - .\n\n\n\n"}

GLAMR is another variant which includes Records. More generally, GLAMs are institutions in the public interest, collecting cultural heritage materials.\n\nThe term LAM has been in use at least since the 1990s. It emerged as these institutions saw their missions overlapping, creating the need for a wider industry sector grouping. This became apparent as they placed their collections online—artworks, books, documents, and artifacts all effectively becoming \"information resources.\"\n\nProponents of greater collaboration argue that the present convergence is actually a return to traditional unity. These institutions share epistemological links dating from the “Museum” of Alexandria and continuing through the cabinets of curiosities gathered in early modern Europe. Over time as collections expanded, they became more specialized and their housing was separated according to the form of information and kinds of users. Furthermore, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries distinct professional societies and educational programs developed for each kind of institution.\n\nAs collecting institutions, GLAMs preserve and make accessible primary sources valuable for researchers. \n\n"}
{"id": "232627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=232627", "title": "Gender-blind", "text": "Gender-blind\n\nA gender-blind (or unisex) person is someone who adheres to not distinguishing people by gender. Gender blind people generally advocate gender neutrality in society, such as activities undertaken and services provided without regard to the gender of those who participate. Those who identify as pansexual may also refer to themselves as 'gender-blind': however, pansexuality emphasizes gender-blindness in sexuality.\n\n\"Unisex\" is an older term, and a misnomer meaning \"one sex\". It should not be confused with bisexuality.\n\"Gender-blind\" however goes against most tenets of heteronormativity by not looking at gender at all.\n\nIn 2006 the National Student Genderblind Campaign was created as a collaborative grassroots organization intended to educate college students, administrators, and others throughout the United States. The NSGC advocates for the implementation of gender-inclusive dorm room and bathroom options.\n\nThe use of mixed-gender hospital rooms has proved controversial in both the United Kingdom and Canada. Manitoba's Health Minister, Theresa Oswald, has campaigned actively against such rooms after receiving complaints from a Winnipeg patient, Ollie Ingram. Oswald said if humanity can \"put somebody on the moon\", it can find a way to honor gender requests without leading to delays for patients. At the same time, some medical ethicists have been critical of efforts to return to single-sex rooms. Jacob Appel, an advocate for mixed rooms in the United States, has written that opposition to gender-mixed rooms stems from \"old-fashioned prejudice\" and argues that: \"Because some people have been brought up to fear or dislike sharing a room with a person of the opposite sex, or blush at the prospect of catching a glimpse of an unwelcome body part when a robe slips open, we enshrine and perpetuate this prejudice in social policy.\" Great Britain has agreed to phase out such rooms by 2010.\n\nMuch as with similar approaches to dealing with racism and ethnicity, not recognising and taking account of participants' sex can be harmful. It posits that it functions in a post-sexism society where women are no longer treated differently than men on the basis of their sex. Meanwhile, gendered treatment prevails all over the world. Of a study of organisations which offered women-only services, 23% said that their reason was based on women's inequality and the desire to address that imbalance; 20% that women-only spaces promote female development and empowerment; 18% that they were providing a service not being met by unisex services and which focused on the specific needs of women.\n\nThe legal test of the \"reasonable person\" has been criticised for being genderblind to be applied in some areas of the law, particularly sexual harassment. Women are subjected to more normalised and endemic sexual harassment than men. On the grounds of this, the American case of \"Ellison v. Brady\" 924 F.2d 872 (1991), the court held that \"a sex-blind reasonable person standard tends to be male-based and tends to systematically ignore the experiences of women\". \n\nStudies indicate a broad support for single-sex service options to remain available. Of 1000 women polled by the Women's Resource Centre, 97% stated that women should have the option of accessing female-only services if they were victims of sexual assault. 57% indicated that they would choose a women-only gym over a mixed gym. Single-sex services can have a benefit in providing greater comfort and engaging participants who would otherwise not get involved.\n\n"}

According to this propaganda, Cleopatra would plan to invade Italia.

{"id": "2707946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2707946", "title": "Katabasis", "text": "Katabasis\n\nKatabasis or catabasis (, from \"down\" and \"go\") is a descent of some type, such as moving downhill, the sinking of the winds or sun, a military retreat, a trip to the underworld, or a trip from the interior of a country down to the coast. The term has multiple related meanings in poetry, rhetoric, and modern psychology.\n\nThe term catabasis can refer to a trip from the interior of a country down to the coast (for example, following a river), in contrast to the term \"anabasis\", which refers to an expedition from a coastline up into the interior of a country.\n\nThe main meaning given for catabasis by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\") describes \"A going down; a military retreat, in allusion to that of the ten thousand Greeks under Xenophon, related by him in his \"Anabasis\":\nIn the opening of Plato's \"Republic\", Socrates recounts \"going down\" to the port city of Piraeus, located south of his native Athens. Several scholars, including Allan Bloom, have read this first word, (\"I went down\") as an allusion to Odysseus' journey into the underworld.\n\nIn poetry and rhetoric, the term \"katabasis\" refers to a \"gradual descending\" of emphasis on a theme within a sentence or paragraph, while \"anabasis\" refers to a gradual ascending in emphasis. John Freccero notes, \"In the ancient world, [the] descent in search of understanding was known as katabasis\", thus endowing mythic and poetic accounts of katabasis with a symbolic significance.\n\nIn modern psychology, the term \"katabasis\" is sometimes used to describe the depression some young men experience. Author Robert Bly proposes in his book \"\" several reasons for the \"catabasis phenomenon\", amongst them the lack of Western initiation rites and the lack of strong father figures and role models.\n\nThe trip to the underworld is a mytheme of comparative mythology found in a diverse number of religions from around the world. The hero or upper-world deity journeys to the underworld or to the land of the dead and returns, often with a quest-object or a loved one, or with heightened knowledge. The ability to enter the realm of the dead while still alive, and to return, is a proof of the classical hero's exceptional status as more than mortal. A deity who returns from the underworld demonstrates eschatological themes such as the cyclical nature of time and existence, or the defeat of death and the possibility of immortality.\n\n\"Katabasis\" is the epic convention of the hero's trip into the underworld. In Greek mythology, for example, Orpheus enters the underworld in order to bring Eurydice back to the world of the living.\n\nMost \"katabases\" take place in a supernatural underworld, such as Hades or Hell — as in Nekyia, the 11th book of the \"Odyssey\", which describes Odysseus's descent to the underworld. However, \"katabas\"is can also refer to a journey through other \"dystopi\"c areas, like those Odysseus encounters on his 10-year journey back from Troy to Ithaca. Pilar Serrano allows the term \"katabasis\" to encompass brief or chronic stays in the underworld, including those of Lazarus, and Castor and Pollux. In this case, however, the \"katabasis\" must be followed by an \"anabasis\" (a going or marching up) in order to be considered a true \"katabasis\" instead of a death.\n\nIn the 11th book of the \"Odyssey\", Odysseus follows the advice of Circe and consults Tiresias in the land of the dead. During Odysseus' visit, the souls of many appear to him. The first to appear to Odysseus is Elpenor, his crew member who died prior to leaving Circe's island. Elpenor asks Odysseus to give him a proper burial, and Odysseus agrees. The next to appear to Odysseus is his mother, Anticlea. As Odysseus has been away fighting the Trojan War for nearly 20 years, he is surprised and saddened by the sight of her soul.\n\nTiresias, the soul whom Odysseus came to see, next appears to him. Tiresias gives him several pieces of information concerning his \"nostos\" (homecoming) and his life after. Tiresias details Poseidon's anger at Odysseus' blinding of Polyphemos (and the coming troubles as a consequence), warns Odysseus not to eat the livestock of the god Helios, and prophesies Odysseus' return home to Ithaca and his eventual death at sea at an old age. After Tiresias instructs Odysseus to allow the spirits he wants to talk to drink the sacrificial blood he used to find Tiresias, he is again given the chance to see his mother, and she tells him of the suffering of his family as they await his return home. As his mother leaves, Odysseus is then visited by a string of souls of past queens. He first sees Tyro, the mother of Pelias and Neleus by Poseidon.\n\nHe next talks to Antiope, the mother of Amphion and Zethus (the founders of Thebes) by Zeus. Then, he is visited by Alcmene, the mother of Heracles by Zeus, and Heracle's wife Megara. He is also visited by Epicaste, the mother of Oedipus, and Chloris, the queen of Pylos. Odysseus is then visited by Leda, the mother of Castor and Polydeuces and Iphimedeia, mother of the Aloadae by Poseidon. Odysseus then sees a list of women whom he only briefly mentions: Phaedra, Procris, Ariadne, Maera, Clymene, and Eriphyle, all also lovers of gods or heroes. Next to visit Odysseus is Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae. Agamemnon tells Odysseus of his death by his wife, Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus. He warns Odysseus to return to Ithaca in secret and be wary of his own wife.\n\nOdysseus then encounters Achilles, who asks after the well being of his father, Peleus, and his son, Neoptolemus. Odysseus reassures Achilles of his son's bravery in fighting the Trojans. Odysseus then begins seeing figures of dead souls who do not talk directly to him: Ajax, Minos, Orion, Tityos, Tantalus, and Sisyphus. Odysseus ends his visit with Heracles, who asks about Odysseus' intention in Hades. Odysseus begins to get fearful as he waits for more heroes and leaves.\nThe \"katabasis\" of Virgil's \"Aeneid\" occurs in book 6 of the epic. Unlike Odysseus, Aeneas seeks to enter the underworld, rather than bring the spirits of the dead to him through sacrifice. He begins his journey with a visit to the Cumaean Sibyl (a priestess of Apollo) and asks for her assistance to journey to the underworld and visit his father. The priestess tells him to find a golden branch, and if the branch breaks off in his hands, he is fated to go to the underworld. She also tells Aeneas to bury his dead friend and prepare cattle for sacrifice. When Aeneas reaches the forest to find the golden branch, he is guided by birds to the tree, and the branch breaks into his hand. The branch, however, does not easily break off as the Sibyl said would happen to a person fated to go to the Underworld - the branch is described as \"cunctantem\" (\"hesitant\"). The implications of this have been debated by scholars - some arguing that it means that Aeneas is not as heroic as he needs to be, others arguing that Aeneas has not yet fulfilled his destiny, and several arguing that he is still a hero, with this section added purely for drama. Aeneas buries Misenus and he and the Sibyl prepare a sacrifice to enter the underworld. Aeneas first encounters several beings and monsters as he enters: Sorrows, Heartaches, Diseases, Senility, Terror, Hunger, Evil, Crime, Poverty, Death, Hard Labor, Sleep, Evil Pleasures of Mind, War, Family Vengeance, Mad Civil Strife, Scylla, Briareus, Hydra, Chimaera, Gorgons, Harpies, and Cerberus. Next, Aeneas encounters Charon, the ferryman who leads souls into the underworld, and the mass of people who are unburied. His first conversation is with Palinurus, a man of his crew who fell overboard and died on their journey. Palinurus begs Aeneas to bury him so he can enter the underworld. The Sibyl convinces Charon to carry them across the river Styx in exchange for the golden bough. Aeneas encounters Minos pronouncing judgment on souls and the souls that died for love: Phaedra, Procris, Eriphyle, Evadne, Pasiphae, Laodamia, Caeneus, and Dido. Next, Aeneas sees heroes of battle: Tydeus, Parthenopaeus, Adrastus, Glaucus, Medon, Thersilochus, Polyboetes, Idaeus, Agamemnon, and Deiphobus. The Sibyl then leads Aeneas to Elysium, the place for the blessed. On the way, they pass the place for tortured souls and the Sibyl describes some of the tortured's fates. Tityos has his liver eaten by a vulture daily. Pirithous and Ixion have a rock constantly hanging over them at all times. Many others face the punishment of moving rocks, being stretched, and being tied to wheels. The two then enter the Estates of the Blessed, where they see a utopian land where heroes and good people reside. There, Aeneas finds his father, who tells him of the rich history of Rome to come.\n\nIn Ovid's poetic collection of mythological stories, he includes accounts of \"katabasis\" as well. In book 4, he includes an account of Juno's descent to Hades to bring her perceived justice to Ino. Ovid describes Juno's path to the underworld, noting Cerberus' presence. Juno seeks the Furies (Tisiphone, Megara, and Alecto) to destroy the house of Cadmus, namely Ino and her husband Athamas. While in the underworld, Juno passes several souls who are being punished in Hades. Hades is also a person, and he needs to get rid of those souls because he needs them to fully recover. –Tantalus, Sisyphus, Ixion, and the Belides. When the Furies agree to Juno's request, she happily returns to the heavens where she is purified by Iris.\nThe next major \"katabasis\" in the \"Metamorphoses\" occurs in book 5 by Proserpina, the daughter of Ceres who is kidnapped by Dis. As Proserpina is picking flowers, Dis falls in love with her and decides to grab her and take her to the underworld in his chariot. Worried about her now-missing daughter, Ceres becomes distraught and searches for Proserpina.\n\nWhen Ceres discovers the kidnapping, she goes to Jove to attempt to get Proserpina back. He agrees that she should be returned as long as Proserpina has not touched any food in the underworld. However, she has eaten pomegranate seeds, and cannot be returned to Ceres. To ensure compromise between Ceres and Dis, Jove divides the year into halves and commands that Proserpina must spend equal parts of the year between her mother and her husband. From that point on, Proserpina makes annual trips to the underworld, spending half the year there.\n\nOvid also briefly mentions the \"katabasis\" of Hercules in book 7. Ovid is telling the etiological story of Medea's poison for Theseus. When Hercules travelled to the underworld to capture Cerberus as one of his twelve Labours, Cerberus spread white foam from his mouths which grew poisonous plants.\n\nThe \"katabasis\" of Orpheus in book 10 is the last major inclusion of the theme by Ovid in the \"Metamorphoses\". Orpheus is distraught by the death of his wife, Eurydice. He enters the underworld through the Spartan Gates and visits Dis and Proserpina to beg for the return of his bride. Overcome by the heartfelt song of Orpheus, Proserpina calls Eurydice to leave with her husband–on the condition that he does not look back until he reaches the exit. When he looks back, his wife disappears, and he is pained by grief for her death a second time.\n\n Mesopotamian mythology\n Ancient Egyptian mythology\nGreek mythology and Roman mythology\nChristianity\nNorse religion and Finnish mythology\nWelsh mythology\n\nOther\n\nAir cooled by a glacier flows down the glacier and generates wind movement known as a \"katabatic wind\".

It is based upon deductive reasoning applied for the sake of law, hence it is also called legal deduction or deductive legal reasoning.\n\nIn legal syllogism there are two premises, minor and major, and one conclusion.\n\nThe place of the major premise is taken by a legal norm (or rule). This norm (rule) may be derived from canonical text (text of statutes, constitutions, regulations, international treaties and agreements, ordinances, bylaws etc) or from a judicial precedent. In the latter case, it can be called \"ratio decidendi\" or ruling. In the main, it can be considered as a general expression which, in generic terms, states what one ought to do or ought not to do in a certain type of circumstances. \n\nThe facts of the case at hand (also called pending, instant, \"sub judice\", at bar or under argument) serve as the minor premise. These facts may be understood as all elements of the factual setting of the case at hand, i.e. the details of the events, things and persons which occurred in a case to which the rule/norm that constitutes the major premise is to be applied deductively.\n\nThe conclusion is formed by the legal consequence for the case at hand.\n\nIf the norm that forms the major premise is valid (binding in a given legal system) and the facts of the case at hand are proven or posited as true, the conclusion of legal syllogism which flows from subsuming these facts under this norm (rule) is supposed to be correct as well.\n\nIn that sense, legal syllogism can be deemed to be equally infallible as 'ordinary' ('logical') syllogism. Such a claim is, however, ill-founded and, in fact, subsumption of a concrete case under a general rule proves to be a value-laden and goal-oriented process. Neither is it 'logical', nor 'mechanical'. \n\n"}
{"id": "8042940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8042940", "title": "List of fallacies", "text": "List of fallacies\n\nIn reasoning to argue a claim, a fallacy is reasoning that is evaluated as logically incorrect and that undermines the logical validity of the argument and permits its recognition as unsound. Regardless of their soundness, all registers and manners of speech can demonstrate fallacies.\n\nBecause of their variety of structure and application, fallacies are challenging to classify so as to satisfy all practitioners. Fallacies can be classified strictly by either their structure or content, such as classifying them as formal fallacies or informal fallacies, respectively. The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic, relevance through omission, relevance through intrusion, and relevance through presumption. On the other hand, fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur, such as material fallacies (content), verbal fallacies (linguistic), and again formal fallacies (error in inference). In turn, material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies, while formal fallacies may be clearly placed into the more precise category of logical (deductive) fallacies. Yet, verbal fallacies may be placed into either informal or deductive classifications; compare equivocation which is a word or phrase based ambiguity, e. g. \"he is mad\", which may refer to either him being angry or clinically insane, to the fallacy of composition which is premise and inference based ambiguity, e. g. \"this must be a good basketball team because each of its members is an outstanding player\".\n\nFaulty inferences in deductive reasoning are common formal or logical fallacies. As the nature of inductive reasoning is based on probability, a fallacious inductive argument or one that is potentially misleading, is often classified as \"weak\".\n\nThe conscious or habitual use of fallacies as rhetorical devices are prevalent in the desire to persuade when the focus is more on communication and eliciting common agreement rather than the correctness of the reasoning. The effective use of a fallacy by an orator may be considered clever, but by the same token, the reasoning of that orator should be recognized as unsound, and thus the orator's claim, supported by an unsound argument, will be regarded as unfounded and dismissed.\n\nA formal fallacy is an error in logic that can be seen in the argument's form. All formal fallacies are specific types of non sequiturs. \n\nA propositional fallacy is an error in logic that concerns compound propositions. For a compound proposition to be true, the truth values of its constituent parts must satisfy the relevant logical connectives that occur in it (most commonly: <and>, <or>, <not>, <only if>, <if and only if>). The following fallacies involve inferences whose correctness is not guaranteed by the behavior of those logical connectives, and hence, which are not logically guaranteed to yield true conclusions.\nTypes of propositional fallacies:\n\nA quantification fallacy is an error in logic where the quantifiers of the premises are in contradiction to the quantifier of the conclusion.\n\nSyllogistic fallacies – logical fallacies that occur in syllogisms.\n\nInformal fallacies – arguments that are fallacious for reasons other than structural (formal) flaws and usually require examination of the argument's content.\n\n\nFaulty generalization – reach a conclusion from weak premises. Unlike fallacies of relevance, in fallacies of defective induction, the premises are related to the conclusions yet only weakly buttress the conclusions. A faulty generalization is thus produced.\n\nQuestionable cause - Is a general type error with many variants. Its primary basis is the confusion of association with causation. Either by inappropriately deducing (or rejecting) causation or a broader failure to properly investigate the cause of an observed effect. \n\n\nA red herring fallacy, one of the main subtypes of fallacies of relevance, is an error in logic where a proposition is, or is intended to be, misleading in order to make irrelevant or false inferences. In the general case any logical inference based on fake arguments, intended to replace the lack of real arguments or to replace implicitly the subject of the discussion.\n\nRed herring – a speaker attempts to distract an audience by deviating from the topic at hand by introducing a separate argument the speaker believes is easier to speak to. Argument given in response to another argument, which is irrelevant and draws attention away from the subject of argument. \"See also irrelevant conclusion.\"\n\n\n\nThe following is a sample of books for further reading, selected for a combination of content, ease of access via the internet, and to provide an indication of published sources that interested readers may review. The titles of some books are self-explanatory. Good books on critical thinking commonly contain sections on fallacies, and some may be listed below.\n\n"}

He notes, \"If 118 women had been killed, alarm bells regarding discrimination against women would probably have gone off around the world.\" He notes that able-bodied males were viewed as a more legitimate target during wars in Bosnia, Kosovo, Timor, Rwanda, and Chechnya.\n\nIvana Milojević notes that while patriarchy assigns the role of sex object to women, it assigns to men the role of violence-object, with male expendability being corollary to the sexual objectification of girls. Films such as \"They Were Expendable\" or \"The Expendables\" often are about all-male combat teams. Michael D. Clark notes that Adolf Hitler considered gay men expendable by means of Nazi concentration camps and Nazi medical experiments. Manosphere critics of feminism have argued that poor and working-class men \"are cannon fodder abroad and expendable labor at home, trapped beneath a glass floor in jobs nobody really wants—farm workers, roofers, garbage men—and injured at far higher rates than women\".

{"id": "565176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=565176", "title": "Narration", "text": "Narration\n\nNarration is the use of a written or spoken commentary to convey a story to an audience. Narration encompasses a set of techniques through which the creator of the story presents their story, including:\n\nA \"narrator\" is a personal character or a non-personal voice that the creator (author) of the story develops to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the plot. In the case of most written narratives (novels, short stories, poems, etc.), the narrator typically functions to convey the story in its entirety. The narrator may be a voice devised by the author as an anonymous, non-personal, or stand-alone entity; as the author as a character; or as some other fictional or non-fictional character appearing and participating within their own story. The narrator is considered \"participant\" if he/she is a character within the story, and \"non-participant\" if he/she is an implied character or an omniscient or semi-omniscient being or voice that merely relates the story to the audience without being involved in the actual events. Some stories have multiple narrators to illustrate the storylines of various characters at the same, similar, or different times, thus allowing a more complex, non-singular point of view.\n\nNarration encompasses not only \"who\" tells the story, but also \"how\" the story is told (for example, by using stream of consciousness or unreliable narration). In traditional literary narratives (such as novels, short stories, and memoirs), narration is a required story element; in other types of (chiefly non-literary) narratives, such as plays, television shows, video games, and films, narration is merely optional.\n\nNarrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told. It can be thought of as a camera mounted on the narrator's shoulder that can also look back inside the narrator's mind.\n\nWith the \"first-person\" point of view, a story is revealed through a narrator who is also explicitly a character within his or her own story. In a first person narrative, the narrator can create a close relationship between the reader and the writer. Therefore, the narrator reveals the plot by referring to this viewpoint character with forms of \"I\" (that is, the narrator is a person who openly acknowledges his or her own existence) or, when part of a larger group, \"we\". Frequently, the narrator is the protagonist, whose inner thoughts are expressed to the audience, even if not to any of the other characters. A conscious narrator, as a human participant of past events, is an incomplete witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. Forms include temporary first-person narration as a story within a story, wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character.\n\nThe \"second-person\" point of view is a point of view where the audience is made a character. This is done with the use of the pronouns \"you\", \"your\", and \"yours.\" The narrator is trying to address the audience, not necessarily directly, but rather to administer more of a connection. Stories and novels in second person are comparatively rare. Examples include the short fiction of Lorrie Moore and Junot Díaz. An example in contemporary literature is Jay McInerney's \"Bright Lights, Big City,\" in which the second-person narrator is observing his life from a distance as a way to cope with a trauma he keeps hidden from readers for most of the book.\n\"You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is entirely unfamiliar, although the details are fuzzy.\"—Opening lines of Jay McInerney's \"Bright Lights, Big City\" (1984)\n\nIn the \"third-person\" narrative mode, characters are referred to by the narrator as \"he\", \"she\", or \"they\", but never as \"I\" or \"we\" (first-person), or \"you\" (second-person). This makes it clear that the narrator is an unspecified entity or uninvolved person who conveys the story and is not a character of any kind within the story, or at least is not referred to as such.\n\nTraditionally, third-person narration is the most commonly used narrative mode in literature. It does not require that the narrator's existence be explained or developed as a particular character, as with a first-person narrator. It thus allows a story to be told without detailing any information about the teller (narrator) of the story. Instead, a third-person narrator is often simply some disembodied \"commentary\" or \"voice\", rather than a fully developed character. Sometimes, third-person narration is called the \"he/she\" perspective.\n\nThe third-person modes are usually categorized along two axes. The first is the subjectivity/objectivity axis, with \"third person subjective\" narration describing one or more character's personal feelings and thoughts, and \"third person objective\" narration not describing the feelings or thoughts of any characters but, rather, just the exact facts of the story. The second axis is the omniscient/limited axis, a distinction that refers to the knowledge held by the narrator. A \"third person omniscient\" narrator has, or seems to have, access to knowledge of all characters, places, and events of the story, including any given characters' thoughts; however, a \"third person limited \" narrator, in contrast, knows information about, and within the minds of, only a limited number of characters (often just one character). A limited narrator cannot describe anything outside of a focal character's particular knowledge and experiences.\n\nWhile the tendency for novels (or other narrative works) is to adopt a single point of view throughout the entire novel, some authors have experimented with other points of view that, for example, alternate between different narrators who are all first-person, or alternate between a first- and a third-person narrative perspective. The ten books of the \"\" adventure series, by D. J. MacHale, switch back and forth between a first-person perspective (handwritten journal entries) of the main character along his journey and the disembodied third-person perspective of his friends back home. Margaret Atwood's \"Alias Grace\" provides one character's viewpoint from first-person as well as another character's from third-person limited. Often, a narrator using the first person will try to be more objective by also employing the third person for important action scenes, especially those in which they are not directly involved or in scenes where they are not present to have viewed the events in firsthand. This mode is found in Barbara Kingsolver's \"The Poisonwood Bible\".\n\nAudrey Niffenegger's \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" is a love story, told in alternating first person. This novel alternates between an art student named Clare, and a librarian named Henry. Henry’s disorder called Chronic-Displacement causes him to be put in the wrong time. He is then put in emotional parts from his past and future, going back and forth in time. John Green & David Levithan's novel \"Will Grayson, Will Grayson\" rotates between two boys both named Will Grayson. It alternates between both boys telling their part of the story, how they meet and how their lives then come together. Nick Hornby's \"A Long Way Down\" has four narrators who also, are its main characters. These four characters meet at the top of a tall building known as “the suicide spot” and begin to talk instead of jumping. They then form a group, and continue to meet up.\n\nThe narrative voice is essential for story telling, because it's setting up the story for the reader, for example, by \"viewing\" a character's thought processes, reading a letter written for someone, retelling a character's experiences, etc.\n\nA \"stream of consciousness\" gives the (typically first-person) narrator's perspective by attempting to replicate the thought processes—as opposed to simply the actions and spoken words—of the narrative character. Often, interior monologues and inner desires or motivations, as well as pieces of incomplete thoughts, are expressed to the audience but not necessarily to other characters. Examples include the multiple narrators' feelings in William Faulkner's \"The Sound and the Fury\" and \"As I Lay Dying\", and the character Offred's often fragmented thoughts in Margaret Atwood's \"The Handmaid's Tale\". Irish writer James Joyce exemplifies this style in his novel \"Ulysses\".\n\nOne of the most common narrative voices, used especially with first- and third-person viewpoints, is the \"character voice\", in which a conscious \"person\" (in most cases, a living human being) is presented as the narrator; this character is called a \"viewpoint character\". In this situation, the narrator is no longer an unspecified entity; rather, the narrator is a more relatable, realistic character who may or may not be involved in the actions of the story and who may or may not take a biased approach in the storytelling. If the character is directly involved in the plot, this narrator is also called the viewpoint character. The viewpoint character is not necessarily the focal character: examples of supporting viewpoint characters include Doctor Watson, Scout in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and Nick Carraway of \"The Great Gatsby\".\n\nThe unreliable narrative voice involves the use of an untrustworthy narrator. This mode may be employed to give the audience a deliberate sense of disbelief in the story or a level of suspicion or mystery as to what information is meant to be true and what is meant to be false. The narrator of Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" for example, is significantly biased, unknowledgeable, ignorant, childish, or is perhaps purposefully trying to deceive the audience. Unreliable narrators are usually first-person narrators; however, a third-person narrator may be unreliable.\n\nThe \"epistolary narrative voice\" uses a (usually fictional) series of letters and other documents to convey the plot of the story. Although epistolary works can be considered multiple-person narratives, they also can be classified separately, as they arguably have no narrator at all—just an author who has gathered the documents together in one place. One example is Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein,\" which is a story written in a sequence of letters. Another is Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", which tells the story in a series of diary entries, letters and newspaper clippings. \"Les Liaisons dangereuses (Dangerous Liaisons), \"by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, is again made up of the correspondence between the main characters, most notably the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. Langston Hughes does the same thing in a shorter form in his story \"Passing\", which consists of a young man's letter to his mother.\n\nThe third-person narrative voices are narrative-voice techniques employed solely under the category of the third-person view.\n\nHistorically, the \"third-person omniscient\" (or simply \"omniscient\") perspective has been the most commonly used in narrative writing; it is seen in countless classic novels, including works by Charles Dickens, Leo Tolstoy, and George Eliot. A story in this narrative mode is presented by a narrator with an overarching point of view, seeing and knowing everything that happens within the world of the story, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling. It sometimes even takes a subjective approach. One advantage of omniscience is that this mode enhances the sense of objective reliability (that is, truthfulness) of the plot. The third-person omniscient narrator is the least capable of being unreliable – although the character of omniscient narrator can have its own personality, offering judgments and opinions on the behavior of the story characters.\n\nIn addition to reinforcing the sense of the narrator as reliable (and thus of the story as true), the main advantage of this mode is that it is eminently suited to telling huge, sweeping, epic stories, and/or complicated stories involving numerous characters. The disadvantage of this mode is the increased distance between the audience and the story, and the fact that – when used in conjunction with a sweeping, epic \"cast-of-thousands\" story – characterization tends to be limited, thus reducing the reader's ability to identify with or sympathize with the characters. A classic example of both the advantages and disadvantages of this mode is J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nThe \"third-person subjective\" is when the narrator conveys the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of one or more characters. If there is just one character, it can be termed \"third-person limited\", in which the reader is \"limited\" to the thoughts of some particular character (often the protagonist) as in the first-person mode, except still giving personal descriptions using \"he\", \"she\", \"it\", and \"they\", but not \"I\". This is almost always the main character (for example, Gabriel in James Joyce's \"The Dead\", Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"Young Goodman Brown\", or Santiago in Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea\"). Certain third-person omniscient modes are also classifiable as \"third person, subjective\" modes that switch between the thoughts and feelings of all the characters.\n\nThis style, in both its limited and omniscient variants, became the most popular narrative perspective during the 20th century. In contrast to the broad, sweeping perspectives seen in many 19th-century novels, third-person subjective is sometimes called the \"over the shoulder\" perspective; the narrator only describes events perceived and information known by a character. At its narrowest and most subjective scope, the story reads as though the viewpoint character were narrating it; dramatically this is very similar to the first person, in that it allows in-depth revelation of the protagonist's personality, but it uses third-person grammar. Some writers will shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, such as in Robert Jordan's \"The Wheel of Time\", or George R. R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\".\n\nThe focal character, protagonist, antagonist, or some other character's thoughts are revealed through the narrator. The reader learns the events of the narrative through the perceptions of the chosen character.\n\nThe \"third-person objective\" employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character's thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an objective, unbiased point of view. Often the narrator is self-dehumanized in order to make the narrative more neutral. This type of narrative mode, outside of fiction, is often employed by newspaper articles, biographical documents, and scientific journals. This narrative mode can be described as a \"fly-on-the-wall\" or \"camera lens\" approach that can only record the observable actions but does not interpret these actions or relay what thoughts are going through the minds of the characters. Works of fiction that use this style emphasize characters acting out their feelings observably. Internal thoughts, if expressed, are given voice through an aside or soliloquy. While this approach does not allow the author to reveal the unexpressed thoughts and feelings of the characters, it does allow the author to reveal information that not all or any of the characters may be aware of. A typical example of this so-called \"camera-eye perspective\" is \"Hills Like White Elephants\" by Ernest Hemingway.\n\nThis narrative mode is also called the \"third-person dramatic\" because the narrator, like the audience of a drama, is neutral and ineffective toward the progression of the plot—merely an uninvolved onlooker. It was also used around the mid-20th century by French novelists writing in the \"nouveau roman\" tradition.\n\nThe third person indirect style or free indirect style is a method of presenting a character's voice freely and spontaneously in the middle of an otherwise third-person non-personal narrator.\n\nMany stories, especially in literature, alternate between the third person limited and third person omniscient. In this case, an author will move back and forth between a more omniscient third-person narrator to a more personal third-person limited narrator. Typically, like the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series and the books by George R. R. Martin, a switch of third-person limited viewpoint on some character is done only at chapter boundaries. \"The Home and the World\", written in 1916 by Rabindranath Tagore, is another example of a book switching among just three characters at chapter boundaries. In \"The Heroes of Olympus\" series the point of view changes between characters at intervals.The \"Harry Potter\" series is told in \"third person limited\" (in which the reader is \"limited\" to the thoughts of some particular character) for much of the seven novels. However, it deviates to omniscient on occasions, particularly during the opening chapters of later novels in the series, which switch from the limited view of the eponymous Harry to other characters (for example, Snape).\n\nThe \"narrative tense\" or \"narrative time\" determines the grammatical tense of the story, meaning whether it is presented as occurring before, during, or after the time of narration, that is, in the past, present, or future. In narration using the past tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring before the time at which the narrative was constructed or expressed to an audience or before the present moment; this is by far the most common tense in which stories are expressed. In the present tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring now—at the current moment—in real time. In English, this tense, also known as the \"historical present\", is more common in spontaneous conversational narratives than in written literature, though it is sometimes used in literature to give a sense of immediacy of the actions. A recent example of novels narrated in the present tense are those of the \"Hunger Games\" trilogy by Suzanne Collins. The future tense is the most rare, portraying the events of the plot as occurring some time after the present moment, in a time-period yet to come. Often, these upcoming events are described such that the narrator has foreknowledge (or supposed foreknowledge) of the future, so many future-tense stories have a prophetic tone.\n\n\"Narration\" has more than one meaning. In its broadest sense, narration encompasses all forms of storytelling, fictional or not: personal anecdotes, \"true crime\", and historical narratives all fit here, along with many other non-fiction forms. More narrowly, however, the term \"narration\" refers to all written fiction. In its most restricted sense, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator communicates directly to the reader.\n\nAlong with exposition, argumentation, and description, narration (broadly defined) is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse. In the context of rhetorical modes, the purpose of narration is to tell a story or to narrate an event or series of events. Narrative may exist in a variety of forms: biographies, anecdotes, short stories, or novels. In this context, all written fiction may be viewed as narration.\n\nNarrowly defined, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. But if the broad definition of narration includes all written fiction, and the narrow definition is limited merely to that which is directly communicated to the reader, then what comprises the rest of written fiction? The remainder of written fiction would be in the form of any of the other fiction-writing modes. Narration, as a fiction-writing mode, is a matter for discussion among fiction writers and writing coaches.\n\nThe ability to use the different points of view is one measure of a person's writing skill. The writing mark schemes used for National Curriculum assessments in England reflect this: they encourage the awarding of marks for the use of viewpoint as part of a wider judgment.\n\nIn literature, \"person\" is used to describe the viewpoint from which the narrative is presented. Although second-person perspectives are occasionally used, the most commonly encountered are first and third person. \"Third person omniscient\" specifies a viewpoint in which readers are provided with information not available to characters within the story; without this qualifier, readers may or may not have such information.\n\nIn movies and video games first- and third-person describe camera viewpoints. The first-person is from a character's own perspective, and the third-person is the more familiar, \"general\" camera showing a scene. A so-called second-person may also be used to show a main character from a secondary character's perspective.\n\nFor example, in a horror film, the first-person perspective of an antagonist could become a second-person perspective on a potential victim's actions. A third-person shot of the two characters could be used to show the narrowing distance between them.\n\nIn video games, a first-person perspective is used most often in the first-person shooter genre, such as in \"Doom\", or in simulations (racing games, flight simulation games, and such). Third-person perspectives on characters are typically used in all other games. Since the arrival of 3D computer graphics in games it is often possible for the player to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at will; this is usually done to improve spatial awareness, but can also improve the accuracy of weapons use in generally third-person games such as the \"Metal Gear Solid\" franchise.\n\nText-based interactive fiction conventionally has descriptions written in the second person (though exceptions exist), telling the character what they are seeing and doing, such as Zork. This practice is also encountered occasionally in text-based segments of graphical games, such as those from Spiderweb Software which make ample use of second person flavor text in pop up text boxes with character and location descriptions. Charles Stross's novel Halting State was written in second person as an allusion to this style.\n\n\n"}

While in principle the word may refer to any systematic study of narrative, in practice its usage is rather more restricted. It is an anglicisation of French \"narratologie\", coined by Tzvetan Todorov (\"Grammaire du Décaméron\", 1969). Narratology is applied retrospectively as well to work predating its coinage. Its theoretical lineage is traceable to Aristotle (\"Poetics\") but modern narratology is agreed to have begun with the Russian Formalists, particularly Vladimir Propp (\"Morphology of the Folktale\", 1928), and Mikhail Bakhtin's theories of heteroglossia, dialogism, and the chronotope first presented in \"The Dialogic Imagination\" (1975).\n\nThe origins of narratology lend to it a strong association with the structuralist quest for a formal system of useful description applicable to any narrative content, by analogy with the grammars used as a basis for parsing sentences in some forms of linguistics. This procedure does not however typify all work described as narratological today; Percy Lubbock's work in point of view (\"The Craft of Fiction\", 1921) offers a case in point.\n\nIn 1966 a special issue of the journal \"Communications\" proved highly influential, becoming considered a program for research into the field and even a manifesto. It included articles by Barthes, Claude Brémond, Genette, Greimas, Todorov and others, which in turn often referred to the works of Vladimir Propp (1895–1970).\n\nJonathan Culler (2001) describes narratology as comprising many strands \nimplicitly united in the recognition that narrative theory requires a distinction between \"story,\" a sequence of actions or events conceived as independent of their manifestation in discourse, and \"discourse,\" the discursive presentation or narration of events.'\nThe Russian Formalists first proposed such a distinction, employing the couplet fabula and sujet. A subsequent succession of alternate pairings has preserved the essential binomial impulse, e.g. \"histoire\"/\"discours\", \"histoire\"/\"récit\", \"story\"/\"plot\". The Structuralist assumption that one can investigate fabula and sujet separately gave birth to two quite different traditions: thematic (Propp, Bremond, Greimas, Dundes, et al.) and modal (Genette, Prince, et al.) narratology. The former is mainly limited to a semiotic formalization of the sequences of the actions told, while the latter examines the manner of their telling, stressing voice, point of view, transformation of the chronological order, rhythm and frequency. Many authors (Sternberg, 1993, Ricoeur, 1984, and Baroni, 2007) have insisted that thematic and modal narratology should not be looked at separately, especially when dealing with the function and interest of narrative sequence and plot.\n\nJames Phelan, editor of \"Narrative\" (the journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative), has written numerous books and articles on narrative theory (see reference list). With Frederick Luis Aldama, Brian McHale and Robyn Warhol, Phelan directs Project Narrative at The Ohio State University:)\n\nDesignating work as narratological is to some extent dependent more on the academic discipline in which it takes place than any theoretical position advanced. The approach is applicable to any narrative, and in its classic studies, vis-a-vis Propp, non-literary narratives were commonly taken up. Still the term \"narratology\" is most typically applied to literary theory and literary criticism, as well as film theory and (to a lesser extent) film criticism. Atypical applications of narratological methodologies would include sociolinguistic studies of oral storytelling (William Labov) and in conversation analysis or discourse analysis that deal with narratives arising in the course of spontaneous verbal interaction. It also includes the study of videogames, graphic novels, the infinite canvas, and narrative sculptures linked to topology and graph theory.\nHowever, constituent analysis of a type where narremes are considered to be the basic units of narrative structure could fall within the areas of linguistics, semiotics, or literary theory.\n\n\n\n"}

The character Olli was original created in 2004 by Dutch designer and film director Hein Mevissen and writer Diederiekje Bok as a character for a bottled mineral water. Olli was one of many characters used on the packages and posters of the bottled water brand and John's Phone. Olli was launched on a party of MTV In Rotterdam in 2004. In 2013 Olli was again part of a campaign. This time to save the Rotterdam Zoo Diergaarde Blijdorp. Olli is part of the Ollimania family which is the company that created and owns all characters. Olli became a national hype in the Netherlands from the launch in 2004. After the launch Olli became the symbol of Rotterdam and professional football club Feyenoord.\nOn September 10, 2015, Ollimania and its creators Hein Mevissen and Diederiekje Bok donated a huge Olli statue to the Sophia Children’s Hospital in Rotterdam. They did this to give a smile to the little patients and parents in the hospital. This original big Olli is there to stay.\n\nThe first two Ollimania books were launched in October 2014. 'Olli en het poepkanon' and 'Olli is een olifant'. Both books made it into the top 10 of best sold children books in the Netherlands. In June 2015 Ollimania published again two new books called 'Olli en de woestijndraak' and 'Olli op reis'.\n\n\nHein Mevissen and Diederiekje Bok from design company John Doe designed Olli from the basic shape of a soccer ball. They believe the basic shape, size and character was part of Olli's success. This made Olli easily recognizable to audiences. Olli is drawn in a minimalist style, requiring only a few lines and one primary color. Olli was created in three sizes, one small size 4.7 in. one medium, size 11 in. and one big size 7.2 ft.\n\nThere are two big Olli's. They are the elder version of small Olli. The Big Olli's is a special creature model made for several charities. One is a permanent hard plastic polyester statue at the Sophia Children's Hospital and another one has a temporarily place at the Rotterdam Zoo. The big Olli that is used in the short film to save the Rotterdam ZOO is stored at a secret location according to the creators.\n\nOlli is toy elephant grown to the size of a real elephant. Olli is a lovable character with furry friends living in a Japanese fantasy world. Later in 2013 there was a story added that he was also the favorite toy of Famous Soccer player Giovanni van Bronckhorst. Together they are the main cast of a short film. In Rotterdam, Netherlands of 1980, Giovanni van Bronckhorst is a little boy (played in the short film by the son of Giovanni van Bronckhorst). One day, he discovers a stuffed Elephant at the Rotterdam Zoo and immediately grows attached to it. The name of the elephant is Olli. Giovanni takes him everywhere he goes, especially when he plays soccer. One day during a soccer game, he loses Olli in the canal of Rotterdam. 28 years later in 2013, Giovanni became a Famous Soccer Player and trainer of soccer club Feyenoord and Olli, also grew big, reunite again.\n\nHein Mevissen and Diederiekje Bok have a history in creating things that help people. To give something back to society and convince big brands to do so too. Olli was a few times part of a strategy they developed in 2004 and created Olli as a separate brand to generate awareness and in one campaign to generate more traffic and money for a ZOO in Rotterdam.\n\nIn December 2013 Hein Mevissen and Diederiekje Bok of John Doe got awarded with the highest Dutch advertising award the Golden Loeki for this campaign. The agency John Doe got the award in a Live television show from Arian Buurman, CEO of the Stichting Ether Reclame who hosts the Loeki awards.\n\nIn 2013 Olli was used to help and save the Rotterdam zoo to generate money after the zoo lost government funding. In one year over 200.000 Olli's were sold. Olli also generated 75.000 more visitors for the Rotterdam zoo. Ollimania is a licensing\n\nOllimania is always involved with giving back to the community. Ollimania works with local charity organizations as well as collaborating on common projects, fund‐raisings and social activities. In 2013 Ollimania saved a historic Zoo. In 2015 Ollimania brings its stuffed toy characters to children hospitals, where he interact with little patients by distributing Ollimania presents, reading out Ollimania stories, taking pictures and even organizing birthday celebrations for the most needing ones and their families. On September 10, 2015, Ollimania and its creators Hein Mevissen and Diederiekje Bok donated a huge Olli statue to the Sophia Children’s Hospital in Rotterdam. They did this to give a smile to the little patients and parents in the hospital. This original big Olli is there to stay.\n\nIn 2015 John Doe BV/Ollimania started a lawsuit against the Dutch insurance company ASR Nederland for copyright infringement. The Dutch Insurance company used illegally images and foto’s from Ollimania to sell insurances to their customers. The Dutch court ruled in favor of John Doe BV/ Ollimania and urged ASR Nederland to stop their copyright infringement.\nASR Nederland had a license for a year on one of the Olli toys that expired in August 2014. The insurance company also kept 30.000 toys that were meant for the Rotterdam zoo to earn money to keep the ZOO open. ASR Nederland was entitled to keep the toys and distribute them however they see fit as long they would not infringe the copyrights of John Doe BV and Olli again. ASR Nederland is the biggest insurance company of the Netherlands with almost 3000 employees. Hein Mevissen, the artist and creator of Olli urged the insurance company to look in their hearts and give the toys back to the ZOO where they belong.\n\n\n"}

This structure is particularly effective when \"specifying or enumerating pairs or series of like things\". A scheme of balance, parallelism represents \"one of the basic principles of grammar and rhetoric\".\n\nParallelism as a rhetorical device is used in many languages and cultures around the world in poetry, epics, songs, written prose and speech, from the folk level to the professional. It is very often found in Biblical poetry and in proverbs in general. \n\nThe following sentences and verses possess \"similarity in structure\" in words and phrases:\n\nIn the quote above, the compounded adjectives serve as parallel elements and support the noun \"law\".\n\nIn the above quote, three prepositional phrases produce the parallel structure supporting the noun \"purpose\". Note that this rhetorical device requires that the coordinate elements agree with one another grammatically: \"nouns with nouns, prepositional phrases with prepositional phrases and adverb clauses with adverb clauses.\" \n\nWhen the coordinate elements possess that same number of words (or in the example below, the same number of syllables) the scheme is termed isocolon:\n\nParallelisms of various sorts are the chief rhetorical device of Biblical poetry in the Tristich and in multiples of Distich parallels and also in the poetry of many other cultures around the world, particularly in their oral traditions. Robert Lowth coined the term \"parallelismus membrorum\" (parallelism of members, i.e. poetic lines) in his 1788 book, \"Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrew Nation\". Roman Jakobson pioneered the secular study of parallelism in poetic-linguistic traditions around the world, including his own Russian tradition. \n\nChinese and Vietnamese classical poetry and prose have frequently made use of parallelism. Conversations between learned men in many cases involved exchanging single as a form of playing with words, as well as a kind of mental duel. In a parallel couplet, not only must the content, the parts of speech, the mythological and historico-geographical allusions, be all separately matched and balanced, but most of the tones must also be paired reciprocally. Even tones are conjoined with inflected ones, and vice versa.\n\nParallelisms in artistic speech are common in some languages of Mesoamerica, such as Nahuatl (Aztec). It has also been observed in a language of Indonesia (that Fox imprecisely referred to as \"Rotinese\") and Navajo. Other research has found parallelisms in the languages of the Ural-Altaic area (including Finnish-Karelian folk poetry and the epics and songs of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples) and Toda, suggesting wider distribution among Dravidian languages.\n\nParallelisms in proverbs are very common in languages around the world. Parallel structures in short passages such as proverbs help direct the listener or reader to compare the parallel elements and thereby more easily deduce the point. \n\n\n"}

First published in 1991, it hypothesizes a conspiracy by the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and possibly the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, to fabricate the Anno Domini dating system retrospectively, in order to place them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence. According to this scenario, the entire Carolingian period, including the figure of Charlemagne, is a fabrication, with a \"phantom time\" of 297 years (AD 614–911) added to the Early Middle Ages. The proposal has been universally rejected by mainstream historians.\n\nIllig was born in 1947 in Vohenstrauß, Bavaria.\nHe was active in an association dedicated to Immanuel Velikovsky, catastrophism and historical revisionism,\n\"Gesellschaft zur Rekonstruktion der Menschheits- und Naturgeschichte\".\nFrom 1989 to 1994 he acted as editor of the journal \"Vorzeit-Frühzeit-Gegenwart\".\nSince 1995, he has worked as a publisher and author under his own publishing company, \"Mantis-Verlag\", and publishing his own journal, \"Zeitensprünge\".\nOutside of his publications related to revised chronology, he has edited the works of Egon Friedell.\n\nBefore focusing on the early medieval period, Illig published various proposals for revised chronologies of prehistory and of Ancient Egypt.\nHis proposals received prominent coverage in German popular media in the 1990s. His 1996 \"Das erfundene Mittelalter\" also received scholarly recensions, but was universally rejected as fundamentally flawed by historians.\nIn 1997, the journal \"Ethik und Sozialwissenschaften\" offered a platform for critical discussion to Illig's proposal, with a number of historians commenting on its various aspects.\nAfter 1997, there has been little scholarly reception of Illig's ideas, although they continued to be discussed as pseudohistory in German popular media.\nIllig continued to publish on the \"phantom time hypothesis\" until at least 2013.\nAlso in 2013, he published on an unrelated topic of art history, on German Renaissance master Anton Pilgram, but again proposing revisions to conventional chronology, and arguing for the abolition of the art historical category of Mannerism.\n\nThe bases of Illig's hypothesis include:\n\n\nPublications by Illig:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1393461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1393461", "title": "Pollen zone", "text": "Pollen zone\n\nPollen zones are a system of subdividing the last glacial period and Holocene paleoclimate using the data from pollen cores. The sequence provides a global chronological structure to a wide variety of researchers, such as geologists, climatologisists, geographers and archaeologists, who study the physical and cultural environment of the last 15,000 years.\n\nThe palynological aspects of the system were first investigated extensively by the Swedish palynologist Lennart von Post in the years before the First World War. By analysing pollen in core samples taken from peat bogs, von Post noticed that different plant species were represented in bands through the cores.\n\nThe differing species and differing quantities of the same species are caused by changes in climate. Von Post was able to confirm the Blytt-Sernander climatic sequence showing fluctuations between warmer and colder periods across thousands of years. He used local peat sequences combined with varve dating to produce a regional climatic chronology for Scandinavia.\n\nIn 1940 Harry Godwin began applying von Post's methods to pollen cores from the British Isles to produce the wider European sequence accepted today. It basically expanded the Blytt-Sernander further into the late Pleistocene and refined some of its periods. Following the Second World War, the technique spread to the Americas.\n\nCurrently scientists are focusing a repertory of several different methods on core samples in peat, ice, lake and ocean bottoms, and sediments to achieve \"high resolution\" dating not possible to only one method: Carbon dating, Dendrochronology, isotope ratios on a number of gases, studies of insects and molluscs, and others. While often doubting the utility of the modified Bytt-Sernander, they seem to confirm and expand it all the more.\n\nAt present nine main pollen zones, I-IX, are defined, based on the work of J. Iversen, published in 1954. These are matched to period names called \"biostratigraphic divisions\" in the table, which were defined for Denmark by Iverson based on layers in the peat bogs. They represent climatic and biological zones in the peat. \n\nOthers have used these names in different senses, such as the 1974 chronozones of J. Mangerud. The sequences in Germany and Sweden are not exactly the same as those in Denmark, inviting scientists there to use the names still differently or make other definitions. Moreover, the names are apt to be used interchangeably for glacials, interglacials, stadial, interstadials, or oscillations, leading some scientists to deplore the lack of system.\n\nThe system of the table below covers from around 13,000 BC to the modern day. Dates, given in years BC, are best viewed as being based on uncalibrated C-14 dates, which, when calibrated, would result in much earlier BC dates. For example, an Older Dryas start date of 10,000 BC translates roughly into an uncalibrated BP date of 12,000. Calibrated, that becomes 14,000 BP, 12,000 BC. To obtain quick, on-line calibrations, you may use CalPal.\n\nThe dates in the table correspond relatively well to more modern dates for the earlier periods. Larger discrepancies begin at the end of the Boreal. More, and more modern, details on the dating of the periods are given under the article for each one.\n\nThe archaeological periods listed only apply to north Europe, and do so approximately. For example, there is no uniform chronozone, \"the Bronze Age\", which would apply globally or even be of the same dates between north and south Europe.\n\nThe geological stages listed are only defined for the British Isles. Scientists use different names for north Europe, south Europe and other regions. However, they are cross-correlated in the articles for the ones listed.\n\nIn contrast to glacial periods, these pollen zones are being used to apply globally, with but few exceptions. It is acceptable, for example, to refer to the \"Younger Dryas\" of Antarctica, which has no pollen of its own. A few scientists disapprove of such uses.\n\n"}
{"id": "8494466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8494466", "title": "Priming (media)", "text": "Priming (media)\n\nThe priming theory states that media images stimulate related thoughts in the minds of audience members.\n\nGrounded in cognitive psychology, the theory of media priming is derived from the associative network model of human memory, in which an idea or concept is stored as a node in the network and is related to other ideas or concepts by semantic paths. Priming refers to the activation of a node in this network, which may serve as a filter, an interpretive frame, or a premise for further information processing or judgment formation.\n\nThe general aggression model (GAM) integrates the priming theory with the social learning theory to describe how previously learned violent behavior may be triggered by thoughts, emotions, or physiological states provoked by media exposure. However, the GAM has come under considerable criticism in recent years regarding underlying and unproven assumptions and poor data support for the theory.\n\nPolitical media priming is \"the process in which the media attend to some issues and not others and thereby alter the standards by which people evaluate election candidates\". A number of studies have demonstrated that there is a dimension of powerful media effects that goes beyond agenda setting. In 1982, Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder first identified this added dimension as the “priming effect.” The theory is founded on the assumption that people do not have elaborate knowledge about political matters and do not take into account all of what they do know when making political decisions — they must consider what more readily comes to mind. Through drawing attention to some aspects of politics at the expense of others, the media might help to set the terms by which political judgments are reached, including evaluations of political figures.\n\nIt should be noted that priming is often discussed in tandem with agenda-setting theory. The reason for this association is two-fold. The first, per Hastie & Park, is that both theories revolve around salient information recall, operating on the idea that people will use information that is most readily available when making decisions. The second, per Iyengar and Kinder, is that priming is latter part of a two-fold process with agenda-setting that takes place over time. Once agenda setting has made an issue salient, priming is the process by which \"mass media can... shape the considerations that people take into account when making judgements about political candidates or issues\". In short, both theories point to ease of accessibility of information in one's mind but priming is something that can occur over a period of time after exposure to a given media segment.\n\nPriming isn’t always unintentional, as Jacobs and Shapiro demonstrate in a quantitative and historical analysis of John F. Kennedy’s 1960 presidential campaign. Their research extends the application of priming theory from its original focus of how individuals form attitudes and make decisions to the study of candidate behavior. This new approach, they say, \"changes the analytic focus from unintentional priming to intentional priming, namely, the deliberate strategies that candidates pursue to influence voters\". Priming can be an effective campaign strategy for presidential candidates, the authors indicate, by a process of carefully calculated uses of public opinion on policy issues to influence voters’ standards for assessing the candidates’ attributes. In this study, the authors focus on the 1960 election because innovative public opinion surveys were incorporated into Kennedy’s campaign strategy that enabled him to use position taking to shape his image. Their research was based on primary evidence drawn from archival records and interviews, as well as a combination of interpretative and quantitative analysis. They found that a relationship exists between Kennedy’s positions on policy matters and results from his private public opinion surveys. His campaign combined image building with position taking on issues that responded to perceived public opinion. Though this study does neglect questions concerning how and why real politicians use polling results to prime voters, Jacobs and Shapiro effectively demonstrate that the priming process is powerful enough to be used intentionally by political candidates as a tool to influence public opinion during election campaigns.\n\nIn Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder's 1982 study of priming, they set out to determine what effect intentional priming might have on the public's evaluation of president Jimmy Carter. Their hypothesis stated that making certain political topics salient through primetime media, such as defense or spending, would cause viewers to evaluate president Carter based on said topics. The experiment's results demonstrated the phenomena of agenda-setting and priming. First, Iyengar et al. found evidence of agenda-setting in the positive correlation between exposure to a given political topic and its importance when evaluating the president. They then found that said standards affected the actual evaluation of the president's performance, demonstrating priming. This experiment points to the potential of news media to direct the public's attention and perception of political figures, though the researchers also indicate that subjects with higher self-reported levels of knowledge of politics showed decreased effects of priming. This lead Iyengar's team to the conclusion that priming has varied implications depending on an individual's given knowledge prior to political news media exposure.\n\n\n"}

Modern comic books typically use similar conventions. It is thus comparable to a row, or a line in modern texts. In the study of ancient writing, such as cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs, \"register\" may be used of vertical compartments like columns containing writing that are arranged side by side and separated by lines, especially in cylinder seals, which often mix text and images. Normally, when dealing with images it only refers to row compartments stacked vertically. \n\nAmong many other cultures, the use of registers is common in Ancient Egyptian art, from the Narmer Palette onwards, and in medieval art in large frescos and illuminated manuscripts. Narrative art, especially covering the lives of sacred figures, is often presented as a sequence of small scenes arranged in registers. \n\nSculpted Luwian language hieroglyphs were also usually arranged in registers one above the other. The direction of reading ran from one of the top corners, and reversed direction in each lower register, so that the reader did not have to start at the other end of each new row. Other examples, in the art of Mesopotamia, are Kudurru, or boundary stones, which often had registers of gods on the upper registers of the scenes.\n"}

This can be for the purpose of acting, architecture, painting, pottery (ceramics), sculpture, origami, woodworking, scrapbooking, photography, graphic design, filmmaking, animation, industrial design, radio or television production broadcasting or the making of music. The term is also used for the workroom of dancers, often specified to dance studio.\n\nThe word \"studio\" is derived from the , from , from \"studere\", meaning to or zeal.\n\nThe French term for studio, atelier, in addition to designating an artist's studio is used to characterize the studio of a fashion designer. Atelier also has the connotation of being the home of an alchemist or wizard.\n\n\"Studio\" is also a metonym for the group of people who work within a particular studio. \n\nThe studio of any artist, especially from the 15th to the 19th centuries, characterized all the assistants, thus the designation of paintings as \"from the workshop of...\" or \"studio of...\"\nAn art studio is sometimes called an atelier, especially in earlier eras. In contemporary, English language use, \"atelier\" can also refer to the Atelier Method, a training method for artists that usually takes place in a professional artist's studio. \n\nThe above-mentioned \"method\" calls upon that zeal for study to play a significant role in the production which occurs in a studio space. A studio is more or less artful to the degree that the artist who occupies it is committed to the continuing education in his or her formal discipline. Academic curricula categorize studio classes in order to prepare students for the rigors of building sets of skills which require a continuity of practice in order to achieve growth and mastery of their artistic expression. A versatile and creative mind will embrace the opportunity of such practice to innovate and experiment, which develops uniquely individual qualities of each artist's expression. Thus the method raises and maintains an art studio space above the level of a mere production facility or workshop.\n\nSafety is or may be a concern in studios, with some painting materials required to be handled, stored, or used properly to prevent poisoning, chemical burns, or fire.\n\nIn educational studios, students learn to develop skills related to design, ranging from architecture to product design. In specific, educational studios are studio settings where large numbers of students learn to draft and design with instructional help at a college. Educational studios are colloquially referred to as \"studio\" by students, who are known for staying up late hours into the night doing projects and socializing.\n\nThe studio environment is characterized by 2 types in education:\n\nStudio pottery is made by an individual potter working on his own in his studio, rather than in a ceramics factory (although there may be a design studio within a larger manufacturing site).\n\nProduction studios are those studios which act as centres for the production in any of the arts; alternatively they can also be the financial and commercial entity behind such endeavours. In radio and television production studio is the place where programs and radio commercial and television advertising are recorded for further emission.\n\nAnimation studios, like movie studios, may be production facilities, or financial entities. In some cases, especially in anime, they continue the tradition of a studio where a master or group of talented individuals oversee the work of lesser artists and crafts persons in realising their vision. Animation studios are a fast rising entity and they include established firms such as Walt Disney and Pixar.\n\nArtists or writers, predominantly those producing comics, still employ small studios of staff to assist in the creation of a comic strip, comic book or graphic novel. In the early days of Dan Dare, Frank Hampson employed a number of staff at his studio to help with the production of the strip. Eddie Campbell is another creator who has assembled a small studio of colleagues to help him in his art, and the comic book industry of the United States has based its production methods upon the studio system employed at its beginnings.\n\nMany universities are creating studio settings for courses outside the artist's realm. There are several different projects along these lines, most notably the SCALE-UP (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs) initiated at NC State.\n\nIn audio, a mastering studio is a facility specialised in audio mastering. Tasks may include but not be limited to audio restoration, corrective and tone-shaping EQ, dynamic control, stereo or 5.1 surround editing, vinyl and tape transfers, vinyl cutting, and CD compilation. Depending on the quality of the original mix, the mastering engineer's role can change from small corrections to improving the overall sound of a mix drastically. Typically studios contain a combination of high-end analogue equipment with low-noise circuitry and digital hardware and plug-ins. Some may contain tape machines and vinyl lathes. They may also contain full-range monitoring systems and be acoustically tuned to provide an accurate reproduction of the sound information contained in the original medium. The mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination, which may be radio, CD, vinyl or digital distribution.\n\nIn video production, a mastering studio is a facility specialized in the post-production of video recordings. Tasks may include but not be limited to: video editing, colour grading correction, mixing, DVD authoring and audio mastering. The mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination, which may be broadcast, DVD or digital distribution.\n\nAn \"acting studio\" is an institution or workspace (similar to a dance studio) in which actors rehearse and refine their craft. The Neighborhood Playhouse and Actors Studio are legendary acting studios in New York.\n\nA movie studio is a company which develops, equips and maintains a controlled environment for filmmaking. This environment may be interior (sound stage), exterior (backlot) or both.\n\nA photographic studio is both a workspace and a corporate body. As a workspace it provides space to take, develop, print and duplicate photographs.\n\nA radio studio is a room in which a radio program or show is produced, either for live broadcast or for recording for a later broadcast. The room is soundproofed to avoid unwanted noise being mixed into the broadcast.\n\nA recording studio is a facility for sound recording which generally consists of at least two rooms: the studio or live room, and the control room, where the sound from the studio is recorded and manipulated. They are designed so that they have good acoustics and so that there is good isolation between the rooms.\n\nA television studio is an installation in which television or video productions take place, for live television, for recording video tape, or for the acquisition of raw footage for post-production. The design of a studio is similar to, and derived from, movie studios, with a few amendments for the special requirements of television production. A professional television studio generally has several rooms, which are kept separate for noise and practicality reasons.\n\nMany of the healing arts and activities such as yoga, judo, karate are \"studied\" in a studio. It is very common to see yoga studios and martial arts studios established in settings that might previously have been for other uses, described as studios. These are not really recreation centers, or gyms in the traditional sense, but places where students of these activities practice or study their art.\n\n"}
{"id": "9730355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9730355", "title": "Vienna School of Art History", "text": "Vienna School of Art History\n\nThe Vienna School of Art History () was the development of fundamental art-historical methods at the University of Vienna. This school was not actually a dogmatically unified group, but rather an intellectual evolution extending over a number of generations, in which a series of outstanding scholars each built upon the achievements of their forerunners, while contributing their own unique perspectives. Essential elements of this evolution became fundamental for modern art history, even if the individual methods can today no longer claim absolute validity.\n\nA characteristic trait of the Vienna School was the attempt to put art history on a \"scientific\" (\"wissenschaftlich\") basis by distancing art historical judgements from questions of aesthetic preference and taste, and by establishing rigorous concepts of analysis through which all works of art could be understood. Nearly all of the important representatives of the Vienna School combined academic careers as university teachers with curatorial activity in museums or with the preservation of monuments.\n\nThe concept of a Viennese \"school\" of art history was first employed by the Czech art critic and collector Vincenc Kramář in 1910; it attained general currency following articles published by Otto Benesch in 1920 and by Julius von Schlosser in 1934. In the following entry it has only been possible to make cursory mention of the most important representatives of the school.\n\nRudolf Eitelberger is considered to have been the \"forefather\" of the Vienna School. He acquired a profound knowledge of art through private study during the Vormärz, and in 1852 was appointed as the first professor of art history at the University of Vienna. His greatest concern was to render the aesthetic appreciation of art more objective through giving weight to historical sources and demonstrable facts. He perceived art-historical research as an absolute prerequisite for the elevation of taste and for the improvement of contemporary art. On account of this goal-oriented attitude he became one of the most important protagonists in the historicist movement in Austrian art and architecture.\n\nThe first graduate of the Eitelberger's new program in art history was Moritz Thausing, who in 1879 became the second \"Ordinarius\" (full professor) of art history at Vienna. He advanced beyond his teacher's program in his advocacy of an autonomous art history and promoted the separation of art history from aesthetics.\n\nThausing's students Franz Wickhoff (Professor 1891) and Alois Riegl (Professor 1897) furthered his approach, insofar as they developed the methods of comparative stylistic analysis and attempted to avoid all judgements of personal taste. Thus both contributed to the revaluation of the art of late antiquity, which before then had been despised as a period of decline. Riegl in particular, as an avowed disciple of positivism, focused on the purely formal qualities of the work of art, and rejected all arguments about content as metaphysical speculation.\n\nAfter the early deaths of Riegl and Wickhoff, one of the art-historical positions at the University was filled by Max Dvořák, who at first continued the tradition of his predecessors. However, Dvořák's interest gradually turned towards issues of content; that is, to precisely those issues that, for Riegl, were not the object of art history. Dvořák, in part influenced by the contemporary expressionist movement in German painting, developed a deep appreciation for the unclassical formal qualities of Mannerism. Dvořák's idealistic method, which would later be termed \"Kunstgeschichte als Geistesgeschichte\" (\"art history as intellectual history\"), found its most committed champions in Hans Tietze and Otto Benesch.\n\nDvořák also died young, and in 1922 Julius von Schlosser was appointed as his successor. Schlosser embodied the type of the classical, humanistic scholar, and nourished a deep attachment to the art and culture of Italy throughout his life. He was a close friend of the Italian philosopher Benedetto Croce and of Karl Vossler, a Munich-based professor of the Romance languages, under whose influence he developed an art-historical method based on philological models. He drew a distinction between the \"Stilgeschichte\" (\"style-history\") of brilliant artists and their unique creations, and the \"Sprachgeschichte\" (\"language-history\") of the fine arts, which latter embraced the entire spectrum of artistic creation. Among those to emerge from Schlosser's school, besides Ernst Gombrich, were Hans Sedlmayr and Otto Pächt, who in the 1930s founded art-historical \"structuralism.\" Their methodology was described by Meyer Schapiro as the \"New Vienna School\"; it has also been described as the \"Second Vienna School.\"\n\nJosef Strzygowski, who was appointed in 1909, at the same time as Dvořák, holds a unique position in the history of the Vienna School. He was a vehement opponent of the traditional view of history, in place of which he advocated an anticlassical, antihumanist, and anticlerical outlook. In opposition to the standard view of history, which was centered on ancient Greece and Rome, Strzygowski turned his attention towards the Orient, where he thought he had discovered the traces of an original \"Nordic\" character, which was superior to the \"Mediterranean.\" As he held such a single-minded point of view, he found himself in irreconcilable opposition to the \"orthodox\" branch of the Vienna School, in particular to the \"arch-humanist\" Schlosser, who on his side condemned Strzygowski as the \"Attila of art history.\" The dispute resulted in a complete separation, not only ideological but also physical, so that two art-historical institutes existed within the University without any relationship to each other. As Strzygowski could naturally not allow himself to adopt the methods of his opponents, he devised a tabular method of \"\"Planforschung\",\" which was supposed to guarantee absolute objectivity, but in hindsight was completely impracticable and clearly intended to justify his abstruse theories. Strzygowski's worldview developed a markedly bizarre, racist tendency that approached Nazi ideology. However, his institute was closed upon his retirement in 1933. Nevertheless, he is to be credited with the expansion of the boundaries of western art history, which he opened to the consideration of non-European cultures. Moreover, his esteem for abstract art, which he understood as uniquely \"Nordic,\" was a step towards an art-historical confrontation with modernity. With all due care, then, Strzygowski may also find his proper place today in the history of the Vienna School.\n\nThe era of Nazism signified a turning point for the Vienna School. Numerous scholars were forced to emigrate and came into contact with the methdological approaches of other nations, in particular in the Anglo-American world. Hans Sedlmayr, a declared Nazi, led the institute throughout the war, and at war's end his career in Vienna likewise came to an end. In 1946, Karl Maria Swoboda assumed leadership of the \"Insitut\", where he constructed a synthesis of the previously irreconcilable schools of Schlosser and Strzygowski, now drained of their ideological intransigence. In 1963 two \"Ordinarius\" positions were once more created, and were filled by Otto Pächt (a student of Schlosser) and Otto Demus (a student of Strzygowski). Under the \"two Ottos\" Vienna became a \"Mekka der Mittelalterkunstgeschichte\" (\"a mecca for medieval art history\"), while also offering excellent coverage of post-medieval art through the appointment of Fritz Novotny. Today Werner Hoffmann, who developed the traditions of the school and adapted them for an intellectual engagement with contemporary art, may count as the youngest heir of the Vienna School.\n\nThis article is substantially based on the equivalent entry in the German Wikipedia.\n\n\n\"\n"}
{"id": "3772064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3772064", "title": "Yde Girl", "text": "Yde Girl\n\nYde Girl () is a bog body found in the \"Stijfveen\" peat bog near the village of Yde, Netherlands. She was found on 12 May 1897 and was reputedly uncannily well-preserved when discovered (especially her hair), but by the time the body was turned over to the authorities a fortnight later it had been severely damaged and deteriorated. Most of her teeth had been pulled from the skull by villagers as well as a large amount of hair. The peat cutting tools had also been reported to have severely damaged the body.\n\nCarbon-14 tests have indicated that Yde Girl died between 54 BCE and 128 CE at an approximate age of 16 years. She had long reddish blond hair, but one side of her head was initially thought to have been shaved before she died. Recent studies of Windeby I, however, have suggested that the shaved hair phenomenon in some bog bodies may simply attest to one side of the head being exposed to oxygen slightly longer than the other. Scans have shown that she suffered from scoliosis. She stood at , which is comparatively small for a sixteen-year-old.\n\nThe body was found clad in a woolen cape and with a woolen band, made in a braiding technique known as sprang, wrapped around the neck, suggesting she was executed or sacrificed. There was also a stab wound in the area of her collarbone, but that was not determined as the cause of death. It is thought that she may have died while unconscious, as defensive wounds were absent on the hand that was recovered from the body, unlike a similar case in Germany, the Kayhausen Boy, who had a cut on his left hand from an apparent defense attempt. As with most bog bodies, the skin and features are still preserved because of the tannic acid in the marsh water. When Yde Girl was excavated, the diggers accidentally caused a wound to the skull. Only the torso of the girl, the head, the right hand and the feet remain intact today. The rest of her body was not preserved or had been damaged by peat cutting tools.\n\nThe Yde Girl was put on display and further study was not carried out on the remains until 1992. Richard Neave, of University of Manchester, took a CT scan of the skull of Yde Girl and determined her age, both anatomically and historically. The Yde Girl became internationally known when Neave made a reconstruction of her head, using techniques from plastic surgery and criminal pathology. Due to the state of the body, the work on the reconstruction included some guesswork, for example, the nose. Yde Girl and her modern reconstruction are displayed at the Drents Museum in Assen.\n\nYde Girl, along with Roter Franz and the Weerdinge Men, were transported across the world for a museum tour in both the early and mid 2000s. Due to the intensity of the girl's death, protests in Canada prevented the tour from traveling through several locations in the country.\n\n"}
