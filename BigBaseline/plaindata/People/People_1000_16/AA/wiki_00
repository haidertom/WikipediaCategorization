According to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue an estimated 550 women and girls from Western countries have travelled to join the Islamic State as of 2015—part of what some have called \"a jihadi, girl-power subculture\".\n\nThe three girls had been questioned by the police in December 2014 after another girl from their school travelled to Syria, but were found not to be at risk. They flew via Turkish Airlines from Gatwick Airport, London, to Istanbul on 17 February. Their families went to Turkey in March to probe the disappearance, deeming the police investigation inadequate.\n\nTheir disappearance has been attributed to Aqsa Mahmood, a Glasgow woman who joined ISIL in 2013. There have been electronic communications between the girls and Mahmood. She faces criminal charges if she returns. Mahmood denies the allegations.\n\nIn March 2015, footage was circulated of Abase Hussen, father of Amira Abase, on a 2012 rally led by Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary against the film \"Innocence of Muslims\". The Metropolitan Police examined the footage but said that it was unlikely that offences had been committed. Hussen said in April that he feels ashamed of his involvement in the rally, as he did not know who had organised it.\n\nThe girls stole family jewellery to pay for their flight. They will not face criminal charges if they return to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe disappearance resulted in the Metropolitan Police giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons on its circumstances in March 2015. The families of the girls received an apology from Scotland Yard, who did not tell them about the other girl from their school who went to Syria in 2014.\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron has said that police should not be made \"scapegoats\" for people joining ISIL. Contrary to the stance of the Metropolitan Police, Cameron said \"Whoever has gone out to join a terrorist organisation is breaking the law and has to face the consequences of breaking the law and we have to let the law take its course in the proper way\".\n\nIn March 2015, a travel ban was imposed upon five girls from the Bethnal Green Academy due to concerns from social services that they the girls attend the same school as the three who had already joined the group, stating that it was in the public interest.\n\nThe teenagers have not made contact with their families since May 2016. Begum was reported to have married an American jihadist recruit who left her once she became pregnant. Sultana is said to have married a western ISIS fighter with Somali heritage, but wanted to return to the UK after he was killed in battle. Shortly afterwards she was killed in a Russian airstrike. Sultana's family in a phone interview with ITV in August 2016 said that they believed her to have died in an airstrike in May 2016 at the age of 17 while planning to escape. The lawyer who represents the family of the teenagers Tasnime Akunjee told ITV that she became too scared of making an escape attempt after another girl Samra Kesinovic was beaten to death for trying to escape. Abase married an 18-year-old Australian jihadist, Abdullah Elmir in July 2016 who was reported by Australian intelligence agencies to have been killed in coalition airstrikes. After the teenagers married foreign jihadists, they moved into the homes of their new husbands in ISIL' de facto capital of Raqqa.\n\n"}
{"id": "31663216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31663216", "title": "Apostles", "text": "Apostles\n\nIn Christian theology and ecclesiology, the apostles (), particularly the Twelve Apostles (also known as the Twelve Disciples or simply the Twelve), were the primary disciples of Jesus, the central figure in Christianity. During the life and ministry of Jesus in the 1st century AD, the apostles were his closest followers and became the primary teachers of the gospel message of Jesus. The word \"disciple\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"apostle\"; for instance, the Gospel of John makes no distinction between the two terms.\n\nIn modern usage, prominent missionaries are often called apostles, a practice which stems from the Latin equivalent of \"apostle\", i.e. \"\", the source of the English word \"missionary\". For example, Saint Patrick (AD 373–463) was the \"Apostle of Ireland\", Saint Boniface (680–755) was the \"Apostle to the Germans\", Saint José de Anchieta (1534–1597) was the \"Apostle of Brazil\" and Saint Peter of Betancur (1626–1667) was the \"Apostle of Guatemala\".\n\nWhile Christian tradition often refers to the apostles as being twelve in number, different gospel writers give different names for the same individual, and apostles mentioned in one gospel are not mentioned in others. The commissioning of the Twelve Apostles during the ministry of Jesus is recorded in the Synoptic Gospels. After his resurrection, Jesus sent eleven of them (minus Judas Iscariot, who by then had died) by the Great Commission to spread his teachings to all nations. This event is commonly called the Dispersion of the Apostles. There is also an Eastern Christian tradition derived from the Gospel of Luke of there having been as many as 70 apostles during the time of Jesus' ministry. Prominent figures in early Christianity, notably Paul, were often called apostles, even though their ministry or mission came after the life of Jesus.\n\nThe period of early Christianity during the lifetimes of the apostles is called the Apostolic Age. During the 1st century AD, the apostles established churches throughout the territories of the Roman Empire and, according to tradition, through the Middle East, Africa, and India.\n\nThe word \"apostle\" comes from the Greek word (\"apóstolos\"), formed from the prefix (\"apó-\", \"from\") and root (\"stéllō\", \"I send\", \"I depart\") and originally meaning \"messenger, envoy\". It has, however, a stronger sense than the word messenger, and is closer to a \"delegate\". The \"Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament\" argues that its Christian use translated a Jewish position known in Hebrew as the \"sheliach\" (). This ecclesiastical meaning of the word was later translated into Latin as \"\", the source of the English \"missionary\".\n\nIn the New Testament, the majority of the apostles have Hebrew names, although some have Greek names. Many Jews at the time had Latin or Greek names as well as Hebrew names.\n\nLater in the Gospel narratives the twelve apostles are described as having been commissioned to preach the Gospel to \"all the nations\", regardless of whether Jew or Gentile. Paul emphasized the important role of the apostles in the church of God when he said that the household of God is \"built upon the foundation of apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone\".\nAlthough not one of the apostles commissioned during the life of Jesus, Paul, a Jew named Saul of Tarsus, claimed a special commission from the risen Jesus and is considered \"the apostle of the Gentiles\", for his missions to spread the gospel message after his conversion. In his writings, the epistles to Christian churches throughout the Levant, Paul did not restrict the term \"apostle\" to the Twelve, and often refers to his mentor Barnabas as an apostle. The restricted usage appears in the Revelation to John.\n\nBy the 2nd century AD, association with the apostles was esteemed as an evidence of authority. Churches which are believed to have been founded by one of the apostles are known as apostolic sees. Paul's epistles were accepted as scripture, and two of the four canonical gospels were associated with apostles, as were other New Testament works. Various Christian texts, such as the \"Didache\" and the \"Apostolic Constitutions\", were attributed to the apostles. Bishops traced their lines of succession back to individual apostles, who were said to have dispersed from Jerusalem and established churches across great territories. Christian bishops have traditionally claimed authority deriving, by apostolic succession, from the Twelve. Early Church Fathers who came to be associated with apostles, such as Pope Clement I with St. Peter, are referred to as the Apostolic Fathers. The Apostles' Creed, popular in the West, was said to have been composed by the apostles themselves.\n\nThe three Synoptic Gospels record the circumstances in which some of the disciples were recruited, Matthew only describing the recruitment of Simon, Andrew, James, and John. All three Synoptic Gospels state that these four were recruited fairly soon after Jesus returned from being tempted by the devil.\n\nDespite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, they are all described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets to do so. Traditionally the immediacy of their consent was viewed as an example of divine power, although this statement is not made in the text itself. The alternative and much more ordinary solution is that Jesus was simply friends with the individuals beforehand, as implied by the Gospel of John, which states that Peter (Simon) and Andrew were disciples of John the Baptist, and started following Jesus as soon as Jesus had been baptized.\n\nAlbright and Mann extrapolate from Simon's and Andrew's abandonment of their nets that Matthew is emphasizing the importance of renunciation by converting to Christianity, since fishing was profitable, although required large start-up costs, and abandoning everything would have been an important sacrifice. Regardless, Simon and Andrew's abandonment of what were effectively their most important worldly possessions was taken as a model by later Christian ascetics.\nMatthew describes Jesus meeting James and John, also fishermen and brothers, very shortly after recruiting Simon and Andrew. Matthew and Mark identify James and John as sons of Zebedee. Luke adds to Matthew and Mark that James and John worked as a team with Simon and Andrew. Matthew states that at the time of the encounter, James and John were repairing their nets, but readily joined Jesus without hesitation.\n\nThis parallels the accounts of Mark and Luke, but Matthew implies that the men have also abandoned their father (since he is present in the ship they abandon behind them), and Carter feels this should be interpreted to mean that Matthew's view of Jesus is one of a figure rejecting the traditional patriarchal structure of society, where the father had command over his children; most scholars, however, just interpret it to mean that Matthew intended these two to be seen as even more devoted than the other pair.\n\nThe Synoptic Gospels go on to describe that much later, after Jesus had later begun his ministry, he noticed, while teaching, a tax collector in his booth. The tax collector, called Matthew in , Levi in and , is asked by Jesus to become one of his disciples. Matthew/Levi is stated to have accepted and then invited Jesus for a meal with his friends. Tax collectors were seen as villains in Jewish society, and the Pharisees are described as asking Jesus why he is having a meal with such disreputable people. The reply Jesus gives to this is now well known: \"it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners\".\n\nAfter Judas Iscariot betrayed Christ and then in guilt committed suicide before Christ's resurrection (in one Gospel account), the apostles numbered eleven. When Jesus had been taken up from them, in preparation for the coming of the Holy Spirit that he had promised them, Peter advised the brethren:\nSo, between the ascension of Christ and the day of Pentecost, the remaining apostles elected a twelfth apostle by casting lots, a traditional Israelite way to determine the will of God (see ). The lot fell upon Matthias.\n\nPaul the Apostle in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, appears to give the first historical reference to the twelve apostles:\nIn his writings, Paul the Apostle, although not one of the original twelve, described himself as an \"apostle\", one \"born out of due time\" (e.g., , 1 Corinthians 15:8 and other letters). He was called by the resurrected Jesus himself during his Road to Damascus vision and given the name \"Paul\". With Barnabas, he was allotted the role of apostle in the church. He referred to himself as the \"apostle of the Gentiles.\"\n\nAs the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" states, \"It is at once evident that in a Christian sense, everyone who had received a mission from God, or Christ, to man could be called 'Apostle'\"; thus extending the original sense beyond the twelve.\n\nSince Paul claimed to have received the gospel through a revelation of Jesus Christ after the latter's death and resurrection (rather than before like the twelve), he was often obliged to defend his apostolic authority () and proclaim that he had seen and was anointed by Jesus while on the road to Damascus.\n\nJames, Peter and John in Jerusalem accepted his calling to the apostleship from the Lord to the Gentiles (specifically those not circumcised) as of equal authority as Peter's to the Jews (specifically those circumcised) according to Paul. \"James, Peter and John, those reputed to be pillars ... agreed that we [Paul and Barnabas] should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.\"\n\nPaul, despite his divine calling as an apostle, considered himself perhaps inferior to the other apostles because he had originally persecuted Christ's followers. In addition, despite the Little Commission of Matthew 10, the twelve did not limit their mission to solely Jews as Cornelius the Centurion is widely considered the first Gentile convert and he was converted by Peter, and the Great Commission of the Resurrected Jesus is specifically to \"all nations\".\n\nOf the twelve Apostles to hold the title after Matthias' selection, Christian tradition has generally passed down that all but one were martyred, with John surviving into old age. Only the death of James, son of Zebedee is described in the New Testament.\n\nAccording to the 18th-century historian Edward Gibbon, early Christians (second half of the second century and first half of the third century) believed that only Peter, Paul, and James, son of Zebedee, were martyred. The remainder or even all of the claims of martyred apostles do not rely upon historical or biblical evidence.\n\nThe relics of the Apostles are claimed by various Churches, many in Italy.\n\nEach of the four listings of apostles in the New Testament (, , , and ) indicate that all the apostles were men. The canonical gospels and the book of Acts give varying names of the twelve apostles. The list in the Gospel of Luke differs from Matthew and Mark at two points. It lists \"Judas the son of James\" instead of \"Thaddeus\". (For more information, see Jude the Apostle.) Unlike the Synoptic Gospels, the Gospel of John does not offer a formal list of apostles. Although it refers to \"the Twelve\" (), the gospel does not present any elaboration of who these twelve actually were, and the author of the Gospel of John does not mention them all by name. There is also no separation of the terms \"apostles\" and \"disciples\" in John.\n\nIn Luke (10:38–42), Mary, sister of Lazarus, is contrasted with her sister Martha, who was \"cumbered about many things\" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen \"the better part,\" that of listening to the master's discourse. John names her as the \"one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair\" (11:2). In Luke, an unidentified \"sinner\" in the house of a Pharisee anoints Jesus' feet. In Medieval Catholic folklore, Mary, the sister of Lazarus, was seen as the same as Mary Magdalene.\n\nLuke refers to a number of people accompanying Jesus and the twelve. From among them he names three women: \"Mary, called Magdalene, ... and Joanna the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their resources\" (Luke 8:2-3). Mary Magdalene and Joanna are among the women who went to prepare Jesus' body in Luke's account of the resurrection, and who later told the apostles and other disciples about the empty tomb and words of the \"two men in dazzling clothes\". Mary Magdalene is the most well-known of the disciples outside of the Twelve. More is written in the gospels about her than the other female followers. There is also a large body of lore and literature covering her.\n\nOther gospel writers differ as to which women witness the crucifixion and witness to the resurrection. Mark includes Mary, the mother of James and Salome (not to be confused with Salomé the daughter of Herodias) at the crucifixion and Salome at the tomb. John includes Mary the wife of Clopas at the crucifixion.\n\nThe \"seventy disciples\" or \"seventy-two disciples\" (known in the Eastern Christian traditions as the \"Seventy Apostles\") were early emissaries of Jesus mentioned in the Gospel of Luke . According to Luke, the only gospel in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.\n\nIn Western Christianity, they are usually referred to as disciples, whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as Apostles. Using the original Greek words, both titles are descriptive, as an \"apostle\" is one sent on a mission (the Greek uses the verb form: \"apesteilen\") whereas a \"disciple\" is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words \"apostle\" and \"disciple\".\n\nThe Gospel of Matthew is anonymous: the author is not named within the text, and the superscription \"according to Matthew\" was added some time in the 2nd century. The tradition that the author was Matthew the Apostle begins with Papias of Hierapolis (c. AD 100–140), an early bishop and Apostolic Father, who is cited by the Church historian Eusebius (AD 260–340), as follows: \"Matthew collected the oracles [\"logia\": sayings of or about Jesus] in the Hebrew language [\"Hebraïdi dialektōi\"], and each one interpreted [\"hērmēneusen—\"perhaps 'translated'] them as best he could.\"\n\nAlthough the Gospel of John is anonymous, Christian tradition historically has attributed it to John the Apostle, son of Zebedee and one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles. The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving Johannine epistles that commentators treat the four books, along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not necessarily written by the same author.\n\nThe Gospel of Mark was written anonymously. Early Christian tradition, first attested by Papias of Hierapolis, ascribes it to John Mark, a companion and interpreter of the apostle Peter. Hence its author is often called Mark, even though most modern scholars are doubtful of the Markan tradition and instead regard the author as unknown. It was probably written c. AD 66–70, during Nero's persecution of the Christians in Rome or the Jewish revolt, as suggested by internal references to war in Judea and to persecution. The author used a variety of pre-existing sources, such as conflict stories (Mark 2:1–3:6), apocalyptic discourse (4:1–35), and collections of sayings (although not the Gospel of Thomas and probably not the Q source).\n\nAccording to Church tradition, Luke the Evangelist, the companion of Paul, is believed to have authored the Gospel of Luke, though anonymously written and lacking an author's name; but while this view is still occasionally put forward the scholarly consensus emphasises the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters. The most probable date for its composition is around 80–110 AD, and there is evidence that it was still being revised well into the 2nd century.\n\n"}

They were subsequently imprisoned until May 6, 2013, when Berry escaped with her six-year-old daughter and contacted the police. Knight and DeJesus were rescued by responding officers and Castro was arrested within hours.\n\nOn May 8, 2013, Castro was charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. Castro pleaded guilty to 937 criminal counts of rape, kidnapping, and aggravated murder as part of a plea bargain. He was sentenced to life plus 1,000 years in prison without the possibility of parole. One month into his sentence, Castro committed suicide by hanging himself with bedsheets in his prison cell.\n\nAriel Castro was born on July 11, 1960, in Yauco, Puerto Rico, to Pedro Castro and Lillian Rodriguez. When he was a child, his parents divorced. Shortly after the divorce, Castro moved to the mainland with his mother and three siblings. The family first settled in Reading, Pennsylvania, and later moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where Castro's father and several other extended family members were living. Castro had nine siblings. According to Castro's uncle, his family knew the DeJesus family and had lived in the same West Cleveland neighborhood. Castro was a 1979 graduate of Cleveland's Lincoln-West High School.\n\nCastro met his future girlfriend, Grimilda Figueroa, when his family moved into a house across the street from hers in the 1980s. They lived with both sets of parents, but moved into their own home at 2207 Seymour Avenue in 1992. Their home was a two-story, , four-bedroom, one-bathroom house with a unfinished basement built in 1890 and remodeled in 1956. According to Figueroa's sister, Elida Caraballo, when the couple moved into their new home, \"all hell started breaking loose\". Caraballo and her husband Frank claim Castro beat Figueroa, breaking her nose, ribs, and arms. He also threw her down a flight of stairs, cracking her skull. In 1993, Castro was arrested for domestic violence but was not indicted by a grand jury.\n\nFigueroa moved out of the home in 1996 and secured custody of her four children. Police assisted in the move and detained Castro, but did not pursue charges. Castro continued to threaten and attack Figueroa after she left him, according to Caraballo. A 2005 filing by Figueroa in Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court accused Castro of inflicting multiple severe injuries on her and of \"frequently abduct[ing]\" her daughters. A temporary restraining order against Castro was granted, but was dismissed a few months later. Figueroa died in 2012 due to complications from a brain tumor.\n\nBefore his arrest at the age of 52, Castro worked as a bus driver for the Cleveland Metropolitan School District until he was fired for \"bad judgment\", including making an illegal U-turn with children on his bus, using his bus to go grocery shopping, leaving a child on the bus while he went for lunch, and leaving the bus unattended while he took a nap at home. He was earning $18.91 per hour when he was discharged. At the time of his arrest, Castro's home was in foreclosure due to three years (2010–12) of unpaid real estate taxes.\n\nAll of Castro's victims were kidnapped after accepting a ride from Castro. He drove each to his home, lured them inside, took them to the basement, and restrained them. The house at 2207 Seymour Avenue, where they were held, was located in Cleveland's residential Tremont neighborhood, where they had all disappeared. It has since been demolished.\n\nMichelle Knight (born April 23, 1981) disappeared on August 23, 2002, after leaving a cousin's house. She was 21 years old at the time. On the day of her disappearance, she was scheduled to appear in court for a child custody case involving her son, who was in the custody of the state.\n\nFollowing Knight's rescue, police acknowledged that limited resources had been spent on investigating her disappearance, in part because she was an adult. Knight was believed to have run away voluntarily due to anger over losing custody of her son. According to Cleveland Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba, she \"was the focus of very few tips\". Her removal from the National Crime Information Center database fifteen months after she disappeared has been criticized. Cleveland Police and the FBI maintain that her inclusion or exclusion had no bearing on her rescue.\n\nAmanda Marie Berry (born April 22, 1986) disappeared on April 21, 2003, the day before her 17th birthday. She was last heard from when she called her sister to tell her that she was getting a ride home from her job at a Burger King at West 110th Street and Lorain Avenue. The FBI initially considered Berry a runaway until a week after her disappearance, when an unidentified male used her cell phone to call her mother, saying, \"I have Amanda. She's fine and will be coming home in a couple of days\".\n\nBerry was featured in a 2004 segment of Fox's \"America's Most Wanted\" (re-aired in 2005 and 2006), which linked her to Gina DeJesus, who by that point had also gone missing in Cleveland. Berry and DeJesus were profiled on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and \"The Montel Williams Show\", where in 2004 self-proclaimed psychic Sylvia Browne told Berry's mother, Louwana Miller, that her daughter was dead and that she was \"in water\". This pronouncement devastated her mother, causing her to take down pictures and give away Berry's computer. However, Miller continued to search for Berry until her death from heart failure in 2006. After Berry was found alive in 2013, Browne received criticism for the false declaration that Berry was dead.\n\nIn July 2012, Robert Wolford, a prison inmate who previously lived in Tremont, claimed to have information about the location of Berry's body and led police to an empty lot on Cleveland's West Side, where a fruitless search was conducted. Wolford was sentenced in January 2013 to four-and-a-half years in prison for obstruction of justice, making a false report, and making a false alarm.\n\nOn December 25, 2006, Berry gave birth to a daughter at 2207 Seymour Avenue. DNA evidence has confirmed that Castro was the biological father of the child.\n\nGeorgina \"Gina\" Lynn DeJesus (born February 13, 1990) went missing at age 14. She was last seen at a payphone at about 3 p.m. on April 2, 2004, on the way home from her middle school at West 105th Street and Lorain Avenue. DeJesus and her friend, Castro's daughter Arlene, had called Figueroa for permission to have a sleepover at DeJesus's house, but Figueroa replied they could not and the two girls parted ways. Arlene was the last person to see DeJesus before her disappearance.\n\nDeJesus was taken under the impression that she was being dropped off, and trusted Castro because she was friends with his teenage daughter. Because no one witnessed DeJesus's abduction, an AMBER Alert was not issued, which angered DeJesus's father. He said in 2006, \"The Amber Alert should work for any missing child … Whether it's an abduction or a runaway, a child needs to be found. We need to change this law\".\n\nA year after DeJesus' disappearance, the FBI released a composite sketch and description of a male suspect, described as \"Latino, 25 to 35 years of age, , , with green eyes, a goatee and possibly a pencil-thin beard\". According to court records, Castro was , ; he had brown eyes and a goatee.\n\nDeJesus was featured in the aforementioned \"America's Most Wanted\" segment, which linked her to Berry. The disappearances received regular media attention over the years, continuing into 2012, while the families held public vigils. Castro attended at least two of these vigils, reportedly participated in a search party, and tried to get close to the DeJesus family. While a journalism student in 2004, Castro's son Anthony interviewed DeJesus's mother for an article about the disappearances in the \"Plain Press\". Police kept an active investigation open, offering a $25,000 reward for information.\n\nAfter Knight's kidnapping, Castro took her upstairs, tied her hands and feet together, and pulled her up using her hands, feet, and neck. He left her there for three days without food. Prosecutors at Castro's sentencing wrote that diaries kept by the women \"speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of being held like a prisoner of war, of missing the lives they once enjoyed, of emotional abuse, of his threats to kill, of being treated like an animal, of continuous abuse, and of desiring freedom\". The women were kept in locked upstairs bedrooms, where they were forced to use plastic toilets that were \"emptied infrequently\". They were fed one meal a day, and allowed to shower twice a week at most.\n\nKnight told police that Castro had impregnated her at least five times, and had induced miscarriages each time through beatings: hitting with dumbbells, punching, and slamming her against walls. Starvation was also included. Knight's grandmother told reporters that she would require facial reconstruction surgery due to the beatings she endured; she also lost hearing in one ear. At one point, Knight had a pet dog while in captivity, but Castro killed the dog by snapping its neck after it bit him while trying to protect Knight. DeJesus told law enforcement she was raped but did not believe she was ever impregnated.\n\nIn December 2006, Castro allegedly ordered Knight to assist in the birth of Berry's child, which took place in a small inflatable swimming pool, and threatened to kill Knight if the baby did not survive. At one point, the baby stopped breathing, but Knight was able to resuscitate her. Castro occasionally took the child out of the house, including to visit his mother; the girl called Castro \"daddy\" and Castro's mother \"grandmother\". In 2013, he showed one of his adult daughters a picture of the child and said that she was his girlfriend's daughter from another man. He had told others who saw her that she was his granddaughter.\n\nAccording to a statement from Cleveland Police, officers visited Castro's home only once following the kidnappings to discuss an unrelated incident. Castro did not appear to be home at the time and was later interviewed elsewhere. Although neighbors claimed to have called the police about suspicious activity observed at the home, police have said they have no record of any such calls. Castro's son Anthony reported that there were certain areas of the house that were inaccessible due to being locked. He also mentioned an occasion where, three weeks before the women's escape, Castro asked him if Berry would ever be found. Anthony said he told Castro that Berry was likely dead, to which Castro responded: \"Really? You think so?\"\n\nNBC affiliate WKYC reported that during Castro's interrogation, he recalled each of the three abductions in great detail and indicated that they were unplanned crimes of opportunity. According to WKYC's sources, Castro did not have an \"exit plan\" and believed that he would eventually be caught. He referred to himself as \"coldblooded\" and a sex addict. Police found a suicide note in Castro's home in which he allegedly discussed the abductions and wrote that his money, videos and possessions should be given to the kidnapped women if he were caught.\n\nOn May 6, 2013, Berry was finally able to make contact with Castro's neighbors, leading to her escape with her 6-year-old daughter, and the rescue of DeJesus and Knight by authorities. According to police, when Castro left the house that day, Berry realized that he failed to lock the home's \"big inside door\", although the exterior storm door was bolted. She did not attempt to break through the outer door because \"she thought [Castro] was testing her\", according to the police report. Previously, Castro tested the women by leaving the house partially unlocked and exits unsecured. If they attempted to escape, he beat them. Instead, Berry screamed for help when she saw neighbors through the screen. \n\nNeighbor Angel Cordero responded to the screaming but was unable to communicate with Berry, because he spoke little English. Another neighbor, Charles Ramsey, joined Cordero at the house's front door during the rescue. A hole was kicked through the bottom of the storm door, and Berry crawled through, carrying her daughter; Ramsey said Berry told him that she and her child were being kept inside the house against her will. Upon being freed, she went to the house of another Spanish-speaking neighbor and called 9-1-1, saying;\n\nResponding police officers entered Castro's house. As they walked through an upstairs hallway with guns drawn, they announced themselves as Cleveland Police. After peeking out from a slightly opened bedroom door, Knight entered the hallway and leaped into an officer's arms, repeatedly saying, \"You saved me.\" Soon afterward, DeJesus entered the hallway from another room. Knight and DeJesus walked out of the home, and all three women, plus the child, were taken to MetroHealth Medical Center. Berry and DeJesus were released from the hospital the next day. Knight was discharged four days later, on May 10.\n\nCastro was arrested on May 6, 2013. He was charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape on May 8, which carry prison sentences of ten years to life in Ohio. Two of Castro's brothers were also initially taken into custody, but were released on May 9 after police announced that they had no involvement in the kidnappings.\n\nCastro made his first court appearance at the Cleveland Municipal Court on May 9, where bail was set at $2 million per kidnapping charge, adding to a total of $8 million. Additional charges were reported to be pending, including aggravated murder (for intentional induction of miscarriages), attempted murder, assault, a charge for each alleged instance of rape, and a kidnapping charge for each day each captive was allegedly held. On May 14, Castro's attorneys said he would plead \"not guilty\" to all charges if indicted for kidnapping and rape.\n\nA Cuyahoga County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment against Castro on June 7. It contained 329 counts, including two counts of aggravated murder (under different sections of the Ohio criminal code) for his alleged role in the termination of one of the women's pregnancies. The indictments covered only the period from August 2002 to February 2007. The county prosecutor, Timothy J. McGinty, stated that the investigation was ongoing, and that any further findings would be presented to the grand jury. McGinty said that pursuing a death penalty specification would be considered following completion of indictment proceedings.\n\nAfter entering a not guilty plea for Castro on June 12, one of his attorneys, Craig Weintraub, said that although some of the charges against Castro were indisputable, \"it is our hope that we can continue to work toward a resolution to avoid having an unnecessary trial about aggravated murder and the death penalty\". He noted, \"We are very sensitive to the emotional strain and impact that a trial would have on the women, their families and this community\". Castro was found competent to stand trial on July 3.\n\nOn July 12, a Cuyahoga County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment for the remainder of the period after February 2007. It brought the total to 977 counts: 512 counts of kidnapping, 446 of rape, seven of gross sexual imposition, six of felonious assault, three of child endangerment, two of aggravated murder, and one of possession of criminal tools. On July 17, Castro pleaded not guilty to the expanded indictment.\n\nCastro pleaded guilty on July 26 to 937 of the 977 charges against him, including charges of kidnapping, rape, and aggravated murder, as part of a plea bargain which called for consecutive sentences of life in prison plus 1,000 years, all without parole. Under the plea deal, Castro forfeited his right to appeal, and could not profit in any way due to his crimes. He also forfeited his assets, including his home, which prosecutors said would be demolished. Castro was told by Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Russo, \"You will not be getting out. Is that clear?\" to which Castro responded, \"I do understand that, your honor.\" Castro also made comments about his \"addiction to pornography\" and \"sexual problem\", but was cut off by Judge Russo, who said such issues could be discussed at the August 1 sentencing hearing. A law firm representing Berry, DeJesus, and Knight released a statement that the three women were \"relieved by today's plea. They are satisfied by this resolution to the case, and are looking forward to having these legal proceedings draw to a final close in the near future\".\n\nAt the sentencing hearing on August 1, Castro was sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison, plus 1,000 years, all without any possibility of parole. He was also fined $100,000. The court forfeited all of his property and assets to the Cuyahoga County government. Before his sentencing, Castro addressed the court for twenty minutes, in which he said he was \"a good person\" and \"not a monster\", but that he was addicted to sex and pornography, and had \"practiced the art of masturbation\" from a young age. He claimed that he had never beaten or tortured the women, and insisted that \"most\" of the sex he had with them \"was consensual\". He shifted between an apologetic tone and blaming the FBI for failing to catch him, as well as his victims themselves, insisting to the court that when he had sex with them he discovered they were not virgins. He would alternatively shift back into apologetic comments, saying: \"I hope they can find in their hearts to forgive me because we had a lot of harmony going on in that home\".\n\nThe sentencing judge also heard from Knight and family members of Berry and DeJesus. Knight told Castro: \"You took eleven years of my life away. I spent eleven years in hell, now your hell is just beginning. I will overcome all that has happened, but you will face hell for eternity. I will live on, you will die a little every day as you think of the eleven years of atrocities that you inflicted on us... I can forgive you, but I will never forget.\"\n\nOn July 9, 2013, Knight, Berry, and DeJesus broke their public silence for the first time since their rescue by releasing a video statement thanking the public for their support. An attorney for Berry and DeJesus said the women \"still have a strong desire for privacy\" and did not wish to speak to the media about their ordeal. The Cleveland Courage Fund, a bank account set up to help the women in their transition to independent life, had collected approximately $1.05 million at the time of the video's release. Before Berry's disappearance, her grandfather had promised to give her a classic Chevrolet Monte Carlo from the year Berry was born. He kept the car after her kidnapping, in case she was still found alive. After her rescue, Berry called her grandfather, and asked if he still had the car, which he did, although it was in need of restoration from having gone unused. Several automotive shops offered to perform the restoration for free.\n\nIn an interview with \"People\" magazine on the first anniversary of her rescue, Knight discussed some of her ordeals as well as her life leading up to her abduction. Since her rescue, she legally changed her first name to Lily, and began to get several tattoos as her way of coping with the healing process. Knight also revealed that her son was adopted by his foster parents while she was in captivity, and that while she wanted to see him, she does not want to bring him into the ordeal she has had to deal with, and planned to see him after he becomes an adult. Knight planned to open a restaurant, dreamed of getting married — which she did in 2016 — and adopt children. Knight also planned to reunite with Berry and DeJesus in the future, but began focusing on getting her own life back on track. Berry and DeJesus received honorary diplomas from John Marshall High School in 2015.\n\nAs part of the plea bargain, the house where Castro lived, and where he had held the women captive, was demolished on August 7, 2013. Knight was present and handed out yellow balloons, which she said represented missing children, to the gathered crowd. The balloons were released before DeJesus's aunt began the demolition with a swing of a crane.\n\nOn the evening of September 3, 2013, one month into his life sentence, Castro was found hanging with a bed sheet in his detention cell at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient, Ohio. Prison staff performed CPR on Castro before he was taken to the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, where he was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. The following day, Franklin County coroner Dr. Jan Gorniak announced that a preliminary autopsy had found the cause of Castro's death to be suicide by hanging.\n\nOn October 10, 2013, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction released a report that suggested Castro may have died accidentally from auto-erotic asphyxiation rather than suicide. Gorniak rejected the possibility, standing by her ruling of suicide. The report also said two prison guards had falsified logs documenting their observation of Castro hours before he was found dead. Castro was not on suicide watch at the time of his death, but had been subject to routine checks every thirty minutes due to his notoriety.\n\nA consultant's report was released on December 3, and officially concluded that \"all available evidence pointed to suicide, including a shrine-like arrangement of family pictures and a Bible in Castro's cell, an increasing tone of frustration in his prison journal and the reality of spending the rest of his life in prison while subject to constant harassment.\" The Ohio State Highway Patrol also reviewed the case and reached the same conclusion.\n\n\n"}

Although gay sex was partially decriminalised by the Sexual Offences Act 1967, they were all convicted under section 13 of the 1956 Act because more than two men had sex together, which was still illegal. One of the participants (Craig Turner) was also six months under the statutory age of consent for gay sex which was 18 at the time. \n\nUnder the provisions of the 1967 Act, the age of consent for gay sex was different from that of the heterosexual age of consent of 16, and had only been reduced from 21 to 18 by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Equivalent heterosexual behaviour was not a crime.\n\nThe offences only came to light after police seized videos of the men having sex, which they had filmed for their own personal use. All the men were either lovers, ex-boyfriends, or friends of friends.\n\nDuring sentencing on 20 February 1998 Gary Abdie, David Godfrey, Mark Love and Jonathan Moore (all of whom were in their early 20s), and Craig Turner (17 at the time of the offences but 18 when he appeared in court) were given probation and community service orders. The Judge gave Norman Williams a two-year suspended prison sentence and Terry Connell received a nine-month suspended sentence and was ordered to pay £500 towards the cost of the prosecution. Moore (20), Williams (33) and Connell (55) were also required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for the age of consent offences committed with Turner. Estimates of the overall cost of the prosecution were in the region of £500,000.\n\nDespite their convictions, none of them received custodial sentences possibly as a result of a high-profile campaign led by gay human rights group OutRage!. Over 400 letters were presented to the court in support of the men including those from MPs, Bishops and human rights groups. The letters urged the judge not to impose a custodial sentence, with one group, Amnesty International, pledging to declare the men prisoners of conscience should they be imprisoned.\n\nIn 2000, six of the men appealed to the European Court of Human Rights arguing that the prosecutions against them had violated their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights by interfering with 'the right to respect for a private family life' enshrined in article 8 of the Convention. They were subsequently awarded compensation. As Williams was not part of the litigation, he was not deemed eligible by the Home Office for the compensation.\n\nLegislation subsequently introduced by the Labour Government has broadly equalised the treatment of homosexual and heterosexual behaviours in criminal law. The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 equalised the age of consent for gay sex with that of the heterosexual age of consent which is now 16 for both. The Sexual Offences Act 2003, though subject to some controversy, introduced an overhaul in the way sexual offences are dealt with by the police and courts, replacing provisions that date as far back to the 1956 legislation. The offences of gross indecency and buggery have been repealed and sexual activity between more than two men is no longer a crime in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

According to one article, \"every decade brings a new Brit Pack, another disparate group of actors backed by the media to achieve simultaneous Hollywood stardom.\" However, the term is most closely associated with the crop of British actors which emerged in the late 1980s, because of the prominence of the American Brat Pack actors at that time.\n\nThe journalist Elissa Van Poznak interviewed Gary Oldman, Tim Roth, Paul McGann, Bruce Payne, Spencer Leigh, and Colin Firth for \"The Face\" magazine, in January 1987. The magazine had also intended to interview Daniel Day-Lewis but he was busy filming \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\". The title of the interview was \"The Brit Pack\". The moniker stuck and has been referenced in subsequent articles concerning the actors. An issue of the 1988 magazine Film Comment stated that 'Rupert Everett, Gary Oldman, Miranda Richardson, and Daniel Day-Lewis' were the leaders of the pack.\n\nIn July 1993, an article for \"The Face\" was titled \"The New Brit Pack\", which included Jaye Davidson, Naveen Andrews, Jude Law, David Thewlis, Craig Kelly, Samuel West and Rufus Sewell.\n\nUnlike the Brat Pack or other similarly defined groups of American actors, \"Brit Pack\" actors have rarely associated with each other socially or in film. As a 1988 article put it, the Brit Pack \"aren't seen together at parties or in restaurants or in gossip columns. And since British cinema has had no equivalent to Hollywood's Eighties conveyor-belt youth movies – \"Weird Science\", \"About Last Night...\", \"St. Elmo's Fire\", et al. – they don't keep re-meeting each other on-screen either\". Nonetheless, Bruce Payne and Tim Roth had both appeared in the \"Tales Out of School\" television series, Gary Oldman and Tim Roth both appeared in \"Meantime\" and \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\", Gary Oldman and Colin Firth appeared together in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Bruce Payne and Spencer Leigh both appeared in \"Smart Money\".\n\nCurrently, the phrase 'Brit Pack' is often used to describe any disparate group of young British actors and actresses of rising prominence. No group has emerged which is as readily identifiable as the group from the 1980s.\n\nIn 2014, it was used to describe a new wave of actors born in the late 1970s and early 1980s who were garnering success in Hollywood. These actors include Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hiddleston, Henry Cavill, James McAvoy, Tom Hardy, Eddie Redmayne and Rupert Friend.\n\n"}
{"id": "13747254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13747254", "title": "Burgher arms", "text": "Burgher arms\n\nBurgher arms are coats of arms borne by persons of the \"burgher\" social class of Europe (usually called \"bourgeois\" in English) since the Middle Ages. By definition, however, the term is alien to British heraldry, which follows other rules.\n\nAlthough the term \"burgher\" arms refers to the bourgeoisie, it is often extended also to arms of (Protestant) clergy and even to arms of peasants. In several European countries, the use of armorial bearings was restricted to a particular social class, e.g. the use of supporters in Great Britain, tinctures in Portugal or coronets in Sweden. In other countries, every individual, family and community has been free to adopt arms and use it as they please, provided they have not wrongfully assumed the arms of another. \nUse of coats of arms by burghers and artisans began during the 13th century and in the 14th century some peasants took to using arms. The arms of burghers bore a far wider variety of charges than the arms of nobility like everyday objects, in particular, tools. In burgher arms are met sometimes also house marks which are not met in arms of nobility. Most widespread burgher heraldry was and still is in Switzerland and in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands only a small percentage of the existing arms belong to the nobility.\n\nCrest-coronets in burgher arms are correct only if the arms were granted by a sovereign and the coronet is explicitly mentioned in the grant.\nAlthough assumption of arms always remained free, the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire since Charles IV began to grant arms without raising people to nobiliary status. In the 15th century the authority to grant arms was delegated to “Counts Palatine of the Imperial Court” (), who from then on also granted arms to burghers. This was regarded as luxury everyone was not able to afford.\n\nThe tilting helmet was prescribed for arms of non-nobles, while the barred helmet was restricted by the imperial chancellery to the nobility as upholders of the tradition of tourneying. This privilege was also shared by certain people who enjoyed the same standing as the nobility, e.g. those who had a doctor's title in law or theology.\nCustom of the use of the barred helmet was also followed by city patricians. Although the rule of the use of the tilting helmet by burghers was not always obeyed, it has still become the norm in many countries of the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, e.g. in Swedish heraldry.\n\nAfter the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, arms were no longer granted to burghers except in the Kingdom of Saxony, where such grants continued from 1911 until 1918. Elsewhere burgher arms were assumed. Such family heraldry is still alive in Germany and burgher arms are protected by law.\n\nBurgher arms used to be common in France, but they disappeared in the French Revolution, which was hostile to heraldry. In the end of the 17th century, an attempt was made to list all arms in \"Armorial général\" as a device to increase tax revenue. When the attempt failed, in order to force people to pay tax, arms were given to many burghers who had never had them. These arms were never used by their recipients. In France burgher arms are not supposed to have a helmet.\n\nBurgher arms had a complicated and suppressed history in Portugal. During the reign of King Afonso V, burgher arms were restricted to the use of colours only. This restriction would become irrelevant when King Manuel I forbade the use of arms to those who were not of the Portuguese nobility. This restriction against burgher arms in Portugal lasted until 1910.\n\nIn some regions (Normandy, Flanders) even peasants sometimes bore arms.\nIn Switzerland 14th century arms of farmers are known, but they are rare and did not become numerous until the 17th century, as well as in Lower Saxony, Frisia and Tyrol, where farmers had personal freedom. In Denmark arms of farmers are preserved on seals from about 1300. In Norway peasants have used arms since the Middle Ages and some of the arms have even been used as family arms.\n\n"}

She may be identical with Cleopatra V.\n\nThere were at least two, perhaps three Ptolemaic women called \"Cleopatra Tryphaena\":\n\nTryphaena was a sister of Ptolemy IX Lathyros, Ptolemy X Alexander I, Cleopatra IV and Cleopatra Selene. If this \"Tryphaena\" also bore the name \"Cleopatra\", has not been attested. This Tryphaena may have been born in early 140 or 141 BC. She married Antiochus VIII Grypus, king of Syria, in 124 BC, and bore him five sons: Seleucus VI Epiphanes, the twin Antiochus XI Epiphanes and Philip I Philadelphus, Demetrius III Eucaerus, and Antiochus XII Dionysus. The couple also had a daughter called Laodice. Tryphaena was killed in Antioch (Greek: Αντιόχεια), capital of Syria, by Antiochus IX Cyzicenus, as a revenge for his own wife's (Cleopatra IV) death by the orders of her sister Tryphaena (in 111 BC).\n\nCleopatra V Tryphaena was a Queen of Egypt until her mysterious disappearance from the records in 69 BC. If, as some scholars believe, her disappearance is attributable to her death, then it must be assumed that she had a daughter also called \"Cleopatra Tryphaena\".\n\nShe is called \"Cleopatra VI Tryphaena\" by some modern historians and she would have been an older sister of the famous Cleopatra VII. If so, her birth year would correctly be c. 75 BC. The only instance she is mentioned in historical sources is by Porphyry. He says that when Ptolemy XII fled to Rome to avoid an uprising in Alexandria against him (in 58 BC), Berenice IV took control of Ptolemaic Egypt and ruled alongside her sister, Cleopatra Tryphaena. Strabo, however, states that Ptolemy had three daughters, of whom only the eldest (Berenice) was legitimate. This suggests that the Cleopatra Tryphaena referred to by Porphyry may have been Ptolemy's wife, not his daughter. Some, though not all, experts now identify Cleopatra VI with Cleopatra V of Egypt, Ptolemy's wife.\n"}

Charles was the first sole monarch of Spain, inheriting the kingdoms first united by his maternal grandparents, Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon (the Catholic Monarchs). From his father, Philip I of Castile, he inherited the Burgundian Netherlands, which came from his paternal grandmother, Mary of Burgundy. Finally, on the death of his paternal grandfather, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, he inherited the Habsburg lands in Austria. His coat of arms, representing much of the land he inherited, is blazoned as follows:\n\nThe first and fourth quarters represents holdings derived from the Spanish crowns: that is, the quartered arms of Castile and Leon themselves quartered with the quartered arms of Aragon and Sicily. After 1520 the Aragon/Sicily quartering also incorporated the arms of Jerusalem, Naples, and Navarre.\n\nThe second and third quarters represents holdings derived from Charles's Austrian and Burgundian inheritance: these quarters shows further quartering of Austria, Duchy of Burgundy, County of Burgundy, and the Duchy of Brabant, with the escutcheon in the middle showing Flanders on the left and Tyrol on the right.\n\nThe Granada pomegranate is represented at the bottom between the two.\n\nIn 1477, the territory of the Duchy of Burgundy had been conquered and annexed by France. In the same year, Mary \"the Rich\", the last Burgundian duke's only child, had married Charles' grandfather Maximilian, giving the Habsburgs control of the remainder of the Burgundian Inheritance: although the territory of the Duchy of Burgundy itself remained in the hands of France, the Habsburgs remained in control of the title of Duke of Burgundy and the other parts of the Burgundian inheritance, notably the Low Countries and the Free County of Burgundy in the Holy Roman Empire. They often used the term Burgundy to refer to it until the late 18th century, when the Austrian Netherlands were lost to the French Republic. Although Charles V had inherited the grand mastership of numerous orders, the only order which he habitually wore and awarded was that of the Burgundian Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\n"}

It is, strictly speaking, not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise.\n\nThe most common use is a name change through a deed of change of name (often referred to simply as a \"deed poll\"). Deeds poll are used for this purpose in countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Hong Kong and Singapore. In the UK, a deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it and the child does not object to it. The child's parents execute the deed poll on the child's behalf. In some other jurisdictions, a person may simply start using a new name without any formal legal process. The usual requirements are that the new name must be used exclusively and that the change must not be made with intent to defraud. In Australia, prior to 1 November 2000, name change was formerly accomplished by deed poll but now is done by completing a Change of Name form.\n\nThe UK Government provides a free web-based service to advise individuals on changing name using a deed poll. Several websites have been established that charge for this service, some of which appear to be from government agencies. However, these have no official status.\n\nAnother common use is to partition land into different sections. For example, a piece of land may be partitioned (or carved out) by a deed poll into Section A and the Remaining Portion thereof. This form of deed poll is commonly used in Hong Kong.\n\nA deed poll may also be used (in England and Wales) for clergy of the Church of England to relinquish their holy orders.\n\nThe term \"deed\", also known in this context as a \"specialty\", is common to signed written undertakings not supported by consideration: the seal (even if not a literal wax seal but only a notional one referred to by the execution formula, \"signed, sealed and delivered\", or even merely \"executed as a deed\") is deemed to be the consideration necessary to support the obligation. \"Poll\" is an archaic legal term referring to documents with straight edges; these distinguished a deed binding only one person from one affecting more than a single person (an \"indenture\", so named during the time when such agreements would be written out repeatedly on a single sheet, then the copies separated by being irregularly torn or cut, i.e. \"indented\", so that each party had a document with corresponding tears, to discourage forgery).\n\n"}

Deng ruled as paramount leader, although he never held the top title of the party or the state. However, Deng was able to remove three Party leaders with the aid of the Eight Elders.

The controversy stems from a policy that those who have been adversely affected describe as penalizing users who are in fact using their real names which Facebook has nevertheless deemed to be \"fake\", while simultaneously allowing anyone to create fake yet plausible-sounding names, as well as obviously implausible-sounding names comprising word combinations that Facebook's software fails to recognize as unlikely to be real because their alleged nonstandard spelling or confusion with fictional characters. Facebook furthermore prohibits users from accurately representing names which according to the site have \"too many words\", and prohibits initializing first names, preventing users who do so in real life from formatting their own names as they see fit.\n\nThe social networking website Facebook has maintained the real-name system policy for user profiles. According to Facebook, the real-name policy stems from the position \"that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe.\" Likewise per this policy, a \"real name\" is defined by \"your real name as it would be listed on your credit card, driver's license or student ID.\" In August 2012, Facebook estimated that more than 83 million Facebook accounts are fake accounts. As a result of this revelation, the share price of Facebook dropped below $20. Facebook has asserted that \"authentic identity is important to the Facebook experience, and our goal is that every account on Facebook should represent a real person.\"\n\nNative Americans have been repeatedly targeted due to Facebook's policy. \n\nA number of Native Americans have objected to Facebook's inquiries into their names, and to Facebook's request that they provide proof of identification or other documentation in order to use the service. Native American activists claimed to be planning to file a class action lawsuit against Facebook regarding the 'real name' policy.\n\nIn 2008, a woman in Japan named Hiroko Yoda had her Facebook account suspended over her surname, which is common in Japan, being confused with a Star Wars character of the same name.\n\nThe Dublin branch of the Irish language rights group, Misneach, started a Change.org online petition to demand the right to use Irish names on Facebook and protested outside Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin on October 7, 2015.\n\nIn 2015, one Gaelic-speaking retired policeman won the right to use his Gaelic name on Facebook, even though it was not his legal name. Some Scottish Gaelic surnames, such as NicIllAnndrais, contain more than two capital letters and are still disallowed by Facebook.\n\nIn the Spanish-influenced indigenous Chamoru culture of the Marianas, the standard naming convention has historically been for a person to use their mother's maiden name as their middle name. (Chamoru culture, having been colonized by Spain, went through a period where indigenous names and naming conventions were forcibly eradicated and replaced by what the conquering Spanish deemed acceptable.) Furthermore, using one's full name rather than simply the first and last is commonplace, if only for disambiguation purposes due to a relatively small pool of surnames. Therefore, middle names such as De Leon Guerrero and De La Cruz are frequently encountered. However, attempting to register such names as one's middle name results in a message telling users that \"Names can't have too many words.\" Therefore, many Chamoru users are forced to either run all of the words together as if they were one single word, or to initialize each word to a common acronym such as DLG or DLC.\n\nIn cases where the acronym is employed, Facebook automatically changes to lower-case all letters except the first. (Use of periods, e.g. D.L.G., will result in a message telling users that \"Profile names can't have too many periods.\") Therefore, someone commonly known in real life by a name such as Mary De Leon Guerrero Mafnas would have to resort to using what on Facebook would end up being \"Mary Dlg Mafnas\". The message is not accompanied by an option to challenge/appeal the restriction or to send Facebook documentation that the format is how one normally formats their name in real life.\n\nIn January 2015, a 23-year-old Australian bank employee claiming to be named Phuc Dat Bich posted a photo of his passport identification page to Facebook, protesting that the company had unfairly shut down his account for being \"false and misleading\". \"Is it because I'm Asian? Is it?\" he asked. The BBC reported that in Vietnamese the name is pronounced similarly to \"Phoo Da Bi\" (IPA: ). After his reinstatement, Bich posted a thank you note to supportive Facebook fans, stating he was \"glad and honoured to be able to make people happy by simply making them laugh at something that appears outrageous and ridiculous\". Subsequently \"Phuc Dat\" published a further message admitting it was a hoax.\n\nTamils do not have surnames: They have their father or mother or both father and mother's first name as initials. This standard naming practice has not been acknowledged by Facebook.\n\nFacebook's real-name policy does not reflect adopted names or pseudonyms used by the transgender community, and has led to suspending users with real names that might be thought to be fake. A user via the anonymous Android and iOS app Secret began reporting \"fake names\" which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the stage names of drag queens.\n\nTransgender people have also been affected by the policy, including one former Facebook employee who initiated development on Facebook's custom gender options, who was suspended on the day the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional. According to gender non-conforming activist D. Dragonetti, Facebook even disregarded their government identification when supplied.\n\nOn October 1, 2014, Chris Cox, Chief Product Officer at Facebook, offered an apology to the LGBT community and drag kings and queens: In the two weeks since the real-name policy issues surfaced, we've had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it. We've also come to understand how painful this has been. We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook, and we're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were.\n\nSecular, atheist, agnostic, humanist, or users who comment or blog expressing views critical of particular religions, sects or religion in general, as well as religious people who express the opposing views critical of atheism or agnosticism very often have a legitimate need to use an alias. Some of these users could suffer rejection, retaliation or violence if their views – contrary to those of their family, friends or community – are known. In some cases, secular bloggers are exposed to imprisonment by an intolerant government, violent attacks in the street or even being killed by religious fanatics. Examples are the incarceration of activist and blogger Raif Badawi in Saudi Arabia and a string of attacks and murders of secular activists in Bangladesh or Pakistan.\n\nInternational non-profit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation stated they were \"alarmed to hear that Facebook's 'real name' policy is disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ community.\"\n\nOnline magazine \"Queerty\" called Facebook's policy \"a frankly creepy overreach of authority\", adding \"There are a million reasons why someone would choose to self-identify with a name other than the one that's printed on their birth certificate. And really, it's absolutely none of your business in the first place.\"\n\nIn an interview for MAGE Magazine, Second Life entrepreneur Jennifer Ceara Firehawk stated: \"If we are not using our page to abuse or grief others they just need to leave us be. We are not hurting anyone… FB does not realize some SL people earn lindens to turn into RL (real life) money and that is how they make a living. Once you force a person to change the SL name they will lose money due to not being able to find them on FB or SL as they may use FB for their buisness [sic] or advertise. So they end up losing buisness [sic] and money.\"\n\nSeattle drag performer Olivia LaGarce started a Change.org online petition titled \"Allow performers to use their stage names on their Facebook accounts!\"\n\nOn December 15, 2015, Facebook announced in a press release that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay/lesbian community and abuse victims. The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their \"special circumstance\" or \"unique situation\" with a request to use pseudonyms, subject to verification of their true identities. At that time, this was already being tested in the U.S. Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook. The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified, forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation.\n\nThis measure was criticised by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who pointed out that it forces the most vulnerable users to reveal intimate details of their personal lives. Furthermore, as of January 2018, there is no evidence in Facebook's policies that this measure was ever implemented.\n\n\n\n"}

The names of the Forgotten Ten are Kevin Barry, Patrick Moran, Frank Flood, Thomas Whelan, Thomas Traynor, Patrick Doyle, Edmond Foley, Thomas Bryan, Bernard Ryan, and Patrick Maher.\n\nThe executioner was John Ellis, one of the United Kingdom's hangmen at that time.\n\nFollowing the Irish War of Independence, Mountjoy Prison was transferred to the control of the Irish Free State, which became the State of Ireland in 1937. In the 1920s, the families of the dead men requested their remains be returned to them for proper burial. This effort was joined in the later 1920s by the National Graves Association. Through the efforts of the Association, the graves of the men were identified in 1934, and in 1996 a Celtic cross was erected in Glasnevin Cemetery to commemorate them.\n\nThe campaign to rebury the men dragged on for 80 years from their deaths. Following an intense period of negotiations, the Irish government relented. Plans to exhume the bodies of the 10 men were announced on 1 November 2000, the 80th anniversary of the execution of Kevin Barry. On 14 October 2001, the Forgotten Ten were afforded full state honours, with a private service at Mountjoy Prison for the families of the dead, a requiem mass at St Mary's Pro-Cathedral and burial in Glasnevin Cemetery.\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", some criticised the event as glorifying militant Irish republicanism. It coincided with the Fianna Fáil party conference.\n\nThe progress of the cortège through the centre of Dublin was witnessed by crowds estimated as being in the tens of thousands who broke into spontaneous applause as the coffins passed. On O'Connell Street, a lone piper played a lament as the cortege paused outside the General Post Office, the focal point of the 1916 Easter Rising. In his homily during the requiem mass, Cardinal Cahal Daly, a long-time critic of the IRA campaign in Northern Ireland, insisted that there was a clear distinction between the conflict of 1916–22 and the paramilitary-led violence of the previous 30 years:\n\nIn his graveside oration the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern echoed these sentiments and also paid tribute to the Ten:\n\nThe state funeral, broadcast live on national television and radio, was only the 13th since independence. Patrick Maher would not be reburied with his comrades. In accordance with his wishes, and those of his family, he was reinterred in Ballylanders, County Limerick.\n\nA feature length Irish language documentary on the re-interments, \"An Deichniúr Dearmadta\" (\"The Forgotten Ten\") aired on TG4 on 28 March 2002.\n\nAn episode of the BBC series \"Who Do you Think You Are?\" with Boy George describes the life of Thomas Bryan, who was his great uncle.\n\n\n"}

Numerous members of the family were recorded in the 15th and 16th centuries, and thereafter, with the title Prince.\n\nThe two lines of the family for which coherent genealogies are available (the family's \"central core\") descend from (i) Prince Aleksander (late 15th century) and (ii) Prince Bartłomiej (died in 1524).\n\nThe 1569 Act of Union inaugurating the Polish-Lithuanian Royal Commonwealth confirmed that, as previously in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Lithuanian families of dynastic origin remained entitled to use the title Prince. Many subsequent Giedroyć family members, both of the Line of Aleksander and of the Line of Bartłomiej, were recorded with the title Prince – including several (of both Lines) whose right to the title was individually confirmed under Imperial Russian legislation of 1832. Other members did not seek such specific confirmation under the Russian Empire, but relied on confirmation of their noble status and princely origins under Russian legislation of 1801/3. The Imperial Russian heraldic authority classified these as \"of the Princes\".\n\nUnder the usage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as confirmed by the 1569 Act of Union, princely origins in themselves establish princely status.\n\nThe Second Edition of the Lithuanian Chronicle records that a centaur was the armorial charge of the forebears of Giedrus. A decree issued in 1401 by Władisław Jagiello, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, confirms the right of Prince Michał Giedroyć vel. Ratybor (baptized c.1387) to the arms Hippocentaurus \"as used by his illustrious grandfather\" Ginwill (2nd Duke of Giedrojcie and candidate to the grand ducal office of Lithuania).\n\nBut the earliest surviving illustrated Giedroyć armorial charge is a rose, on seals attached to state documents of 1431-4.\n\nThrough the 17th and 18th centuries, the centaur was used predominantly by most members of the family, sometimes in combination with the rose; while the descendants of Mikołaj (died 1657, sixth generation in the Line of Bartłomiej) continued to use the rose alone. But the centaur (sometimes with the rose, sometimes without) predominates in all the 19th century Russian records, even for the descendants of Mikołaj.\n\nAt the English College of Arms, the arms of Michal Giedroyc (born 1929, 16th generation in the Line of Bartłomiej) include both the rose and the centaur (called a sagittary in English heraldry) blazoned as follows: Per fess Or and Gules in chief a Rose Gules barbed and seeded proper and in base a Sagittary trippant to the dexter the head facing to the sinister his tail a serpent facing to the dexter holding in the hands a Bow with arrow drawn and set towards the head of the serpent all Or.\n\nEarly bearers of the Giedroyć name included:\n\n\nOther distinguished members of the two main lines of the family included:\n\n\nCurrent members of the family include:\n\n\nBearers of the name Guedroitz (the French version of the Russian version of Giedroyć) include:\n\n\n"}

When Ireland's potato crop failed in 1845, James Irvine and his younger brother William were among those who left for the United States. The family name is Scottish, meaning that James would have been an Ulster Scot, or Scots-Irish. Irvine worked for two years in New York City. In 1848 Irvine went to join the California Gold Rush as a merchant and miner. In 1854, he purchased an interest in a San Francisco commission house on Front Street, operated by a relative, John Lyons. The business was renamed \"Irvine & Co., wholesale produce and grocery merchants\". He began investing his profits in income-producing San Francisco real estate and soon became a wealthy man. Irvine also became a silent partner in the sheep-raising venture Flint, Bixby & Company of brothers Thomas and Benjamin Flint, and their cousin Llewellyn Bixby. The purchase of the Rancho San Joaquin in 1864 and the Rancho Lomas de Santiago in 1866 marked the beginning of their operations in Southern California. In 1867, Irvine married Henrietta Maria (Nettie) Rice, the daughter of prominent Cleveland, Ohio, educator, writer, poet and State Senator Harvey Rice, who was a direct descendant of Edmund Rice. Nettie died in 1874, and Irvine married Margaret Byrne in 1880. He died March 15, 1886, and is buried in San Francisco.\n\nJames Harvey Irvine, Sr. (1867–1947), son of James Irvine I and Henrietta Maria (Nettie) Rice, was born October 16, 1867, in San Francisco. His mother died when he was seven years old, and his father died when he was about eighteen. Between the time of James Irvine I's death in 1886 and James Irvine II's inheritance of the Southern California real estate holdings upon his twenty-fifth birthday in 1892, the properties were supervised by James Irvine I's brother, George Irvine. James II bought out Flint and the other partners, and formed the Irvine Company. He married Frances Anita Plum in 1892, and they had three children, \"Jase\", James Harvey Irvine Jr. (1894–1935), Katharine Helena Irvine (1894–1920) and Myford Plum Irvine (1898–1959). In 1931, James II married Mrs. Kathryn Brown White, who died in 1950. James II lived in San Francisco until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, when he relocated to the Irvine Ranch. He was a member of the Bohemian Club, and kept a residence in San Francisco, at 2421 Pierce Street. He established the James Irvine Foundation in 1937, an entity dedicated to the \"general well-being of the citizens and residents of the state of California.\" James II owned nearly a third of the land in present-day Orange County. The city of Irvine (formerly Myford) is named after him. He died of Bright's disease in 1947.\n\nJames Harvey Irvine, Jr. (1894–1935) was groomed since a young man to take over the Ranch. He married Madeline Agassiz in 1914, but they were divorced in 1928. He married Athalie Richardson (1903–1993) in 1929, and they had one daughter, Athalie Anita \"Joan\" Irvine (1933– ). When James Irvine III died of tuberculosis in 1935, James II set up the James Irvine Foundation, a charitable organization to hold controlling stock in the Irvine Company. When James II died in 1947, Myford Plum Irvine (1898–1959), James II's only surviving child, took over the presidency of the Irvine Company.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "325918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=325918", "title": "Jeanne Calment", "text": "Jeanne Calment\n\nJeanne Louise Calment (; 21 February 1875 – 4 August 1997) was a French supercentenarian who has the longest confirmed human lifespan of 122 years, 164 days.\n\nShe lived in Arles all her life, outliving both her daughter and grandson. She became the oldest living person on 11 January 1988 at 112, one hundred years after encountering Vincent van Gogh, who visited her father's shop. She was declared the oldest person ever on 17 October 1995 at 120.\n\nAlthough Calment came from a long-living family, there is no particular explanation for her remarkable longevity. She had lived a comfortable and stress-free life, with a healthy appetite and a daily exercise routine, enabling her to walk without a stick until 114.\n\nCalment was born in Arles, Bouches-du-Rhône, Southern France on 21 February 1875. Her father, Nicolas Calment (8 November 1837– 28 January 1931), was a shipbuilder, and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (20 February 1838 – 18 September 1924), was from a family of millers. She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of her close family members also lived an above-average lifespan, although none lived anywhere near as long as Jeanne: her older brother François lived to the age of 97, her father to 93, and her mother to 86.\n\nFrom the age of seven until her first holy communion, Jeanne Calment attended Madame Benet's church primary school in Arles, and then attended the local college, finishing at the age of 16 with the diploma \"brevet Classique\", after which she continued to live with her parents, awaiting marriage, painting, and improving her piano skills. On 8 April 1896, at the age of 21, she married her double second cousin, Fernand Nicolas Calment (1868–1942). Their paternal grandfathers were brothers, hence the same surname and their paternal grandmothers were also sisters. Fernand was a wealthy shop owner and she moved into the apartments above his shop \"Grands Magasins de Nouveautés\", where she lived until the age of 110. His wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work; instead they led a leisured lifestyle within the upper society of Arles, pursuing hobbies such as fencing, cycling (at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence), tennis, swimming, rollerskating at Alyscamps, and playing the piano and making music with friends.\n\nIn the summer, the couple would stay at Uriage for mountaineering all the way up to the glacier. She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the Provence to shoot rabbits and wild boars, but disliked killing birds. She considered the most important historical event in her lifetime to have been the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the execution of the Russian imperial family, a view shared by many fellow centenarians. The Second World War had little effect on her life in the south of France. German soldiers slept in her rooms but she bore no grudge against them because \"they did not take anything away\". In 1942, Fernand ate cherries treated with copper sulfate the day before, developed jaundice, and died of the poisoning in the course of one and a half months on 2 October 1942 at the age of 73. Jeanne had eaten fewer of the cherries and survived.\n\nTheir only child, a daughter named Yvonne Marie Nicolle Calment (19 January 1898 – 19 January 1934), produced a grandson, Frédéric Billiot, on 23 December 1926. Yvonne died from pneumonia, after which Calment raised Frédéric herself. Frédéric became a doctor, and lived with her until his death in an automobile accident in 1963.\nIn 1965, at age 90 and with no heirs, Calment signed a contract to sell her apartment to lawyer André-François Raffray, retaining a life estate. Raffray, then aged 47 years, agreed to pay her a monthly sum of 2,500 francs (€381.12) until she died. Raffray ended up paying Calment the equivalent of more than €140,000, more than double the apartment's value. After Raffray's death from cancer at the age of 77, in 1995, his family continued the payments until Calment's death. Calment's comment on this situation was reported to be, \"In life, one sometimes makes bad deals.\" During all these years, Calment used to say to them that she \"competed with Methuselah\". In 1985, she moved into a nursing home, having lived on her own until age 110.\n\nOn 20 June 1986 Jeanne Calment became the oldest living person in France at the age of 111 when Eugenie Roux died. Her international fame escalated in 1988, when the centenary of Vincent van Gogh's visit to Arles provided an occasion to meet reporters. She said at the time that she had met Van Gogh 100 years before, in 1888, as a thirteen-year-old girl in her uncle's shop, where he bought some canvas, later describing him as \"ugly\" (\"laid\"), \"blighted by alcohol\" (\"brûlé par l'alcool\"), and visiting brothels (\"il fréquentait des maisons de tolérance\").\n\nAfter her 1988 interview, at age 112, Calment was given the Guinness World Records title for the world's ‘Oldest person (living)’ upon the death of Florence Knapp on 11 January 1988. In 1989, however, the title was withdrawn and given to Carrie C. White of Florida, who claimed to have been born in 1874, although this was discounted by subsequent census research. Upon White's death on 14 February 1991, Calment, then a week shy of 116, became recognized as the oldest living person, though there are unverified claims that older people were alive at the time (see Longevity claims and Longevity myths).\n\nAt the age of 114, she appeared briefly in the 1990 film \"Vincent and Me\" as herself, becoming the oldest person ever to appear in a motion picture.\n\nA documentary film about her life, entitled \"Beyond 120 Years with Jeanne Calment\", was released in 1995. In 1996, \"Time's Mistress\", a four-track CD of Calment speaking over a background of rap, was released.\n\nOn 17 October 1995, Calment reached 120 years and 238 days to become the \"oldest person ever\" according to Guinness, surpassing Shigechiyo Izumi of Japan, whose claim (120 years 237 days old at the time of his death on 21 February 1986, which was Calment's 111th birthday) was discounted in February 2011, more than thirteen years after Calment's death.\nExceeding any other longevity case reported, Calment establishes the record as the most verifiable supercentenarian ever recorded. For example, beginning with the 1876 census (Calment is listed as a one-year-old), she was indexed in fourteen census documents until 1975.\n\nAfter her death, 116-year-old Marie-Louise Meilleur became the oldest recognized living person. Both before and after Calment's death, there have been several claims to have surpassed her age (see Unverified longevity claims), but none of these have been proven and Calment therefore continues to hold the record for the oldest verified person ever.\n\nCalment's remarkable health presaged her later record. On television she stated \"J'ai jamais été malade, jamais, jamais\" (I have never been ill, never ever). Asked about her daily routine while at primary school, she replied that \"when you are young you get up at eight o'clock\". In lieu of a solid breakfast she would have either white coffee or hot chocolate, and at noon her father would pick her up from school to have lunch at home before she returned to school for the afternoon. \n\nAt age 15 her cousin and eventual husband started courting her, but she was too young to be interested in boys and preferred sweets. At age 20, incipient cataracts were discovered when she suffered a major episode of conjunctivitis. After marriage at 21, her husband's wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work. They led an active life including fencing, cycling (at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence), tennis, swimming, rollerskating at Alyscamps (\"I fell flat on my face\"), and playing the piano and making music with friends. In the summer, the couple would stay at Uriage for mountaineering up to the glacier (\"Even at 16 I had good legs\"). She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the Provence to shoot rabbits and wild boars. Her husband introduced her to smoking, offering cigarettes after a meal, but it was not her passion. (\"After the meal, after just one, I'd had enough of it\".) Calment is known to have smoked in her elderly years, and is claimed to have smoked tobacco cigarettes from the age of 21 (1896) to 117 (1992). According to one source, she smoked no more than two cigarettes per day and it is not known whether she inhaled, whereas an earlier medical source states that she smoked cigars with her husband before changing to cigarettes more recently. \n\nAll her life she took care of her skin with olive oil and a puff of powder to finish off. On Sundays she went to Mass, and on Fridays to vespers, and regularly conversed with and sought help from God, but expressed skepticism about an afterlife. At an unspecified time in her youth, she had suffered from migraines. \n\nShe and her husband sometimes travelled to nearby Marseilles where, at the \"Phocéen\" restaurant, they treated themselves to seafood, a glass of white wine, and bread and butter. Unlike her husband she did not enjoy pastries, but she did like creams (\"crèmes\"), cakes and in particular \"quatre-quarts\" (pound cake), and vanilla ice cream. At \"retirement age\" she broke her ankle and apart from that had never been ill. She continued cycling until her hundredth birthday. Around her hundredth year she fractured her leg but recovered quickly and was able to walk again. \n\nAfter the death of her grandson in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands. According to one of her doctors, she had formerly been healthy but began showing signs of senescence (or aging) at this point.\n\nAfter her admission to the care home \"Maison du Lac\" [House on the Lake] in January 1985 at the age of 109, she initially had a highly ritualized daily routine whereby, uniquely among the care home residents, she requested to be woken at 6:45 am and started the day with a long prayer at her window thanking God for being alive and for the beautiful day which was starting, sometimes loudly asking the reason for her longevity and why she was the only one alive in her family. Seated on her armchair she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands (\"a distinguished woman must have beautiful hands\"), then the legs, and her carers noted that she moved faster than the other residents, who were 30 years younger, despite her blindness. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk, and rusks. \n\nHer morning ablutions included washing herself unassisted with a flannel rather than taking a shower (\"an odd invention\"), and applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed \"daube\" (braised beef) but was not keen on boiled fish. After the meal she smoked a Dunhill cigarette (formerly a cigar, a habit she had acquired from her husband) and drank a small amount of Port wine. She enjoyed chocolate (and at the age of 112 received a delivery of 800 kilogrammes after challenging a TV presenter – this was then distributed to care homes), and made herself daily a fruit salad based on banana slices and squeezed orange. \n\nIn the afternoon she would take a nap for two hours in her armchair, and then visit her neighbours in the care home, telling them about the latest news she had heard on the radio. At nightfall she would dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music (her eyesight now being too poor for her favorite pastime of crosswords), smoke a last cigarette and go to bed at 10pm.\n\nMedical student Georges Garoyan published a thesis on Calment when she was 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with arthropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150 cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed the presence of the DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.\n\nAt this stage Calment was still in good shape, and continued to walk without a cane until she fractured her femur during a fall at age 114 (January 1990), which required surgery. After her operation, Calment required a wheelchair and abandoned her daily routine.\n\nAt the age of 115 she attracted the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard, who collaborated with Calment's attending doctor, Dr. Victor Lèbre to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. They analysed her for over a year and reported that Jeanne Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to have a routine operation to restore her vision; she had a moderately weak heart and a chronic cough (\"caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco\") and bouts of rheumatism. On the other hand, she always had good digestion, slept well and had no problems with incontinence. During the last years her height was 4 ft 6 in [137 cm] and her weight was 88 pounds [40 kg]; she confirmed that she had always been small, but she had lost weight in recent years. In terms of pigmentation, her eyes were light gray and her white hair had once been chestnut brown.\n\nWith regards to her diet, the three researchers' interviews revealed that in the care home she said she always had a dessert with every meal. She complained about the blandness of the food in the care home and, given a choice, would wish to order fried and spicy foods. She occasionally (\"more than once\") feasted on chocolate in her old age: sometimes over a kilogram (2.2 lb) of chocolate per week.\n\nAt the age of 118, over a period of six months, she was submitted to neurophysiological tests and a CT scan. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency was comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration and there was no evidence of progressive neurological disease, depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was in fact found to improve slightly over the six-month period. Calment reportedly remained mentally intact until the end of her life.\n\nApocryphal media articles reported varying details. One report claimed that Calment recalled selling \"coloured pencils\" to Van Gogh, and seeing the Eiffel Tower being built. Another wrote that she did not start fencing until age 85 (1960). Calment reportedly ascribed her longevity and relatively youthful appearance for her age to a diet rich in olive oil. She is also said to have credited her calmness, saying, \"That's why they call me Calment.\"\n\nBertrand Jeune, Jean-Marie Robine and colleagues compared Jeanne Calment with a list of nearly 20 people worldwide who had securely been verified to have attained at least 115 years of age. The researchers concluded that the lives of these people differed widely, and that there were but few common characteristics: the overwhelming majority were female (only two were male), most smoked little or not at all, and they had never been obese. They all seem to have had strong characters, but certainly not all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical functions declined markedly, especially after their 105th birthdays. In their final years they required wheelchairs, and were nearly blind and deaf. \"But they did not fear death, and they appeared to be reconciled to the fact their lives would soon end\".\n\nOn her 122nd birthday on 21 February 1997, it was announced that she would make no more public appearances, as her health had seriously deteriorated. Demographer Jean-Marie Robine, a co-author of a book about Jeanne Calment, reportedly said that this \"allowed her to die, as the attention had kept her alive\", while the \"New York Times\" reported Robine to have stated that she had been in good health, though almost blind and deaf, as recently as a month before her death. Jeanne Calment died on 4 August 1997 around 10 am Central European Time of unspecified causes. According to the researchers, the care home committed her body quickly and in a strictly private ceremony to a coffin, which was then solemnly driven by limousine through Arles, stopping at her house in the \"rue Gambetta\", and finally to the cemetery, where her doctor placed on her coffin the photographs of her daughter and grandson, in accordance with her wishes.\n\n\n\n"}

A \"mythological\" figure does not always mean a \"fictional\" one, but rather, someone of whom stories have been told that have entered the cultural heritage of a people. Some women warriors are documented in the written record and as such form part of history (e.g. the Ancient Briton queen Boudica, who led the Iceni into battle against the Romans). However, to be considered a warrior, the woman in question must have belonged to some sort of military, be it recognized, like an organized army, or unrecognized, like revolutionaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonhelema was a Shawnee chieftess and sister of Cornstalk. She was known by white settlers as the Grenadier or Grenadier Squaw because of her height. She promoted an alliance with the Americans on the frontier in Ohio.\n\nWoman Chief (c. 1806 – 1858) was a Crow chief and war leader in the mid-19th century. Born to the Gros Ventre people, she was adopted into the Crow. She gained renown in battles and raids, and assumed leadership of her lodge when her father died, becoming a leading chief. She married four wives and later participated in peace negotiations after the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie.\n\nFallen Leaf (often called Woman Chief by the Americans): She was born to the Gros Ventre nation and taken captive by the Crow when she was 12. After she had counted coup four times in the prescribed Crow tradition, she was considered a warrior and chief and sat in the council of chiefs.\n\nRunning Eagle: she became a Blackfoot (Piegan) warrior after her husband was killed by the Crow.\n\nColestah: In the 1858 battle of Spokane Plains in Washington, Yakama leader Kamiakin's wife Colestah was known as a medicine woman, psychic, and warrior. Armed with a stone war club, Colestah fought at her husband's side. When Kamiakin was wounded, she rescued him, and then used her healing skills to cure him.\n\nBuffalo Calf Road Woman: In the 1876 battle of the Rosebud in Montana, Buffalo Calf Road (aka Calf Trail Woman), the sister of Comes in Sight, rode into the middle of the warriors and saved the life of her brother. Buffalo Calf Road had ridden into battle that day next to her husband Black Coyote. This was considered to be one of the greatest acts of valor in the battle.\n\nMoving Robe Woman: One of the best-known battles in the annals of Indian-American warfare is the 1876 Battle of the Greasy Grass in Montana where Lt.

She is famous for having given up her life in the defense of her husband, King Maha Chakkraphat, in a battle during the Burmese-Siamese War of 1548. For the movie, see \"The Legend of Suriyothai\".\n\nThao Thep Kasattri () and Thao Sri Sunthon () were styles awarded to Than Phuying Chan (), wife of the then recently deceased governor, and her sister, Khun Muk (), who defended Phuket Province in the late 18th century. According to popular belief, they repelled a five-week invasion by Burmaese in 1785, by dressing up as male soldiers and rallying Siamese troops. Chan and Muk were later honored by King Rama I with the Thai honorific \"Thao\", as Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Sri Sunthon, respectively. The \"Heroine's Monument\" honouring them is situated on the main highway (402) between the Phuket International Airport and Phuket town.\n\n\nThree historical women:\n\nTwo legendary women:\n\nThis Amazon is famous in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; some of the inhabitants dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in the centre of the floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go off the side of the wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix’d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.\n\nSimilar stories of a female warrior who hunted the now submerged land between the Outer Hebrides and St Kilda are reported from Harris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"From sunrise to the sundown no paragon had she.\n\n\n\n\nKhawlah bint al-Azwar was the daughter of one of the chiefs of Bani Assad tribe, and her family embraced Islam in its first days. The recorded history of that era mentions repeatedly the feats of Khawla in battles that took place in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Moslem army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her. She was a brunette, tall, slim and of great beauty, and she was also a distinguished poet.\n\nNusaybah bint Ka’ab, also known as Umm Ammarah (Ammarah's mother), a Hebrew woman by origin from the Banu Najjar tribe, was an early convert to Islam. Nusaybah was attending the Battle of Uhud like other women, and her intention was to bring water to the soldiers, and attend the wounded while her husband and son fought on the side of the Moslems. But after the Moslem archers disobeyed their orders and began deserting their high ground believing victory was at hand, the tide of the battle changed, and it appeared that defeat was imminent. When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism. During the battle her son was wounded and she cut off the leg of the aggressor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The most common and widespread use of the term is to refer to the souls of the dead and the indigenous ancestors of old. The word is also used for shamans or witch doctors in some Colombian indigenous cultures (such as the s).\n\nVarious different legends exist about the Mohan, with many of them emerging from Colombia. In Colombia, Mohan can also mean a forest or barren land kind of supernatural being associated with natural forces such as the great rivers and the mysteries lying within the forests, beyond human reach and comprehension. In some legends, it is a satyr-like being who steals and rapes young women and lives in a cave-like grotto in the bottom of the great jungle rivers where he keeps his female captives. In others, it is depicted as the spirit of an old Indian, brawny and stout, with a terrifying grin and stare, with larger than human stature and proportions, who steals fishermen's bait, catch or nets, and has the power to change shape into a cat-like beast. Other legends describe the Mohan as a \"big-headed Indian, with short legs and fish fins on his back, and very brown.\" He is portrayed as an extremely hairy being with a very treacherous personality who dwells in the backwaters and is feared by many people. He also causes mischief for young girls who come to wash clothes in the water. The Mohan is also known as an avatar whose form shamans are able to adopt. One myth tells of how a shaman became an alligator in order to be close to the girls who played in the river. The shaman was not able to fully transform back into a human, and became an alligator with a human head. The Poira, whose name is interchangeable with the Mohan, is described by others as an Indian warlock who lives on the in Tolima, Colombia. The Poira is also believed to be a small, naked invisible boy or adult who can also appear formless or as a black bear.\n\n"}
{"id": "18520676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18520676", "title": "Mononymous person", "text": "Mononymous person\n\nA mononymous person is an individual who is known and addressed by a single name, or mononym. In some cases, that name has been selected by the individual, who may have originally been given a (\"multiple name\"). In other cases, it has been determined by the custom of the country or by some interested segment. In the case of historical figures, it may be the only one of the individual's names that has survived and is still known today.\n\nThe structure of persons' names has varied across time and geography. In some societies, individuals have been mononymous, receiving only a single name. Alulim, first king of Sumer, is one of the earliest names known; Narmer, an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, is another. In addition, Biblical names were typically mononymous, as were names in the surrounding cultures of the Fertile Crescent. \n\nAncient Greek names also follow the pattern, with epithets (similar to second names) only used subsequently by historians to avoid confusion, as in the case of Zeno the Stoic and Zeno of Elea; likewise, patronymics or other biographic details (such as city of origin, or another city the individual was associated with, borough, occupation) were used to specify whom one was talking about, but these details were not considered part of the name.\n\nA departure from this custom occurred, for example, among the Romans, who by the Republican period and throughout the Imperial period used multiple names: a male citizen's name comprised three parts (this was mostly typical of the upper class, while others would usually have only two names): \"praenomen\" (given name), \"nomen\" (clan name) and \"cognomen\" (family line within the clan) — the \"nomen\" and \"cognomen\" were almost always hereditary.\n\nMononyms in other ancient cultures include the Celtic queen Boudica and the Numidian king Jugurtha. However, the historical records of some of these figures are scanty or rely completely on the documentation of those outside the person's culture, so it is possible such figures may have had other names within their own cultures that have since been lost to history.\n\nDuring the early Middle Ages, mononymity slowly declined, with northern and eastern Europe keeping the tradition longer than the south; an example is Edeko, the East Germanic chieftain whose son ruled Italy as Flavius Odoacer. By the end of the period, surnames had become commonplace: Edmund Ironside, for example, ruled England (although Ironside was an epithet added later in life), Brian Boru was High King of Ireland, Kenneth MacAlpin had united Scotland, and even in Scandinavia surnames were taking hold. The Dutch Renaissance scholar and theologian Erasmus is a late example of mononymity; though sometimes referred to as \"Desiderius Erasmus\" or \"Erasmus of Rotterdam\", he was christened only as \"Erasmus\", after the martyr Erasmus of Formiae.\n\nBetween Columbus' arrival in the New World and the late 19th century, most Native Americans were mononymous. Examples include Moctezuma (Mexico, 1398–1469), Anacaona (Haiti, 1464–1504), Agüeybaná (Puerto Rico, died 1510), Diriangen (Nicaragua, fl. 1520), Urracá (Panama, died 1531), Guamá (Cuba, died 1532), Atahualpa (Peru, 1497–1533), Lempira (Honduras, died 1537), Lautaro (Chile, 1534–1557), Tamanaco (Venezuela, died 1573), Pocahontas (United States, 1595–1617), Auoindaon (Canada, fl. 1623), Cangapol (Argentina, fl. 1735), and Tecumseh (United States, 1768–1813). \n\nUniquely, the Dutch-Seneca diplomat Cornplanter received both a Seneca-language mononym (Kaintwakon, roughly \"corn-planter\") from his mother and a given name and surname (John Abeel) from his father, and he used both throughout his life. His later descendants, such as Jesse Cornplanter, used \"Cornplanter\" as the family name instead of \"Abeel\". \n\nIn the 19th century, most chiefs involved in the Apache Wars had mononym birth names, and some replaced those with mononymous nicknames: Geronimo (born Goyaałé), Victorio (born Beduiat), Cochise, and so on.\n\nSince the medieval period, mononyms in the West have almost exclusively been used to identify people who already had surnames. These nicknames were either adopted by the persons themselves or conferred by contemporaries.\n\nSome French authors have shown a preference for mononyms. In the 17th century, the dramatist and actor Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (1622–73) took the mononym stage name Molière.\n\nIn the 18th century, François-Marie Arouet adopted the mononym Voltaire, for both literary and personal use, in 1718 after his imprisonment in Paris' Bastille, to mark a break with his past. The new name combined several features. It was an anagram for a Latinized version of his family surname, \"Arouet, l[e] j[eune]\"; it reversed the syllables of the name of a family \"château\", Airvault; and it has implications of speed and daring through similarity to French expressions such as \"voltige\", \"volte-face\" and \"volatile\". \"Arouet\" would not have served the purpose, given that name's associations with \"roué\" and with an expression that meant \"for thrashing\".\n\nThe 19th-century French author Marie-Henri Beyle used many pen names, most famously the mononym Stendhal, adapted from the name of the little Prussian town of Stendal, birthplace of the German art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann, whom Stendhal admired. \n\nIn the 20th century, a fourth French writer, Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette (author of \"Gigi\", 1945), used her actual surname as her mononym pen name, Colette. Some French actors and singers have used their given name or surname as a stage mononym.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, most Italian castrato singers used mononyms as stage names (e.g. Caffarelli, Farinelli). The German writer, mining engineer and philosopher, Georg Friedrich Philipp Freiherr von Hardenberg (1772–1801), became famous as Novalis. \n\nThe 19th-century Dutch writer Eduard Douwes Dekker (1820–87), better known by his mononymous pen name Multatuli (from the Latin \"multa tuli\", \"I have suffered [or \"borne\"] many things\"), became famous for the satirical novel, \"Max Havelaar\" (1860), in which he denounced the abuses of colonialism in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). In 2002 Multatuli was proclaimed by the Society for Dutch Literature to have been the most important Dutch writer of all time. \n\nThe Dutch writer Jan Hendrik Frederik Grönloh (1882–1961) wrote under the pseudonym Nescio (Latin for \"I don't know\").\n\nThe 20th-century British author Hector Hugh Munro became known by his pen name, Saki. In 20th-century Poland, the theater-of-the-absurd playwright, novelist, painter, photographer and philosopher Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz after 1925 often used the mononymous pseudonym Witkacy, a conflation of his surname (\"Witkiewicz\") and middle name (\"Ignacy\").\n\nA number of visual artists, such as Michelangelo, Titian, Tintoretto, Caravaggio and Rembrandt, are commonly known by mononyms. The modern Russian artist Erté formed his mononymous pseudonym from the initials of his actual name, as did the Belgian comics writers Hergé and Jijé.\n\nItalian painter Bernardo Bellotto, who is now ranked as an important and original painter in his own right, traded on the mononymous pseudonym of his uncle and teacher, Antonio Canal (Canaletto), in those countries—Poland and Germany—where his famous uncle was not active, calling himself likewise \"Canaletto\". Bellotto remains commonly known as \"Canaletto\" in those countries to this day.\n\nMononymity was represented in photography, from that art's infancy, by Nadar (Gaspard-Félix Tournachon).\n\nThe American writer of non-fiction and fiction, Rodney William Whitaker (1931–2005), is best known for some novels that he wrote under the mononym pen name, Trevanian. The Armenian-Canadian portrait photographer Yousuf Karsh was commonly known as \"Karsh of Ottawa\".\n\nMonarchs and other royalty, for example Napoleon, have traditionally availed themselves of the privilege of using a mononym, modified when necessary by an ordinal or epithet (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II or Charles the Great). This is not always the case: King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden has two names. While many European royals have formally sported long chains of names, in practice they have tended to use only one or two and not to use surnames. \n\nIn Japan, the emperor and his family have no surname, only a given name, such as Hirohito, which in practice in Japanese is rarely used: out of respect and as a measure of politeness, Japanese prefer to say \"the Emperor\" or \"the Crown Prince\". Following an Emperor's death or retirement, he is renamed according to the era of his reign. In India, the first six Mughal emperors were known by just one name, adopted by each emperor upon his accession.\n\nRoman Catholic popes have traditionally adopted a single, regnal name upon their election (except for John Paul I and II). The mononymous tradition reverted to form with the election and succession of Pope Benedict XVI in 2005 and Pope Francis in 2013.\n\nThe Western practice of combining a given name (Christian name or forename) with a family name (surname) is not universal.\n\nSurnames were introduced in Turkey only after World War I, by that country's first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, as part of his westernizing and modernizing program. His own surname, Atatürk, which was bestowed by the Turkish parliament, means \"Father Turk\". Common people can be addressed semi-formally by their given name plus the title Bey or Hanım (without surname), whereas politicians are often known by surname only (Ecevit, Demirel). Many Turkish sportspeople, especially football players, wear jerseys with only their first name.\n\nMononyms are also common in Indonesia for Javanese individuals, both prominent government figures such as former presidents Sukarno and Suharto and commoners such as Triyatno.\n\nMost Icelanders do not have surnames, only patronymics (sometimes matronymics), and they address each other by given name, even in formal situations.\n\nIn modern times, in countries that have long been part of the Chinese cultural sphere (Japan, Korea, Vietnam and China itself), mononyms are rare. An exception pertains to the Emperor of Japan (a common opinion being that there is no state to give the family name () to the Emperor). \n\nMononyms are common as stage names in the entertainment industry, usually when the performer's legal name is not publicly known; e.g., Ayaka, Becky, Gackt, hide, Hyde, Mana, Kamijo, Miyavi, Tsunku, and Yui. Also, Japanese baseball star Ichiro Suzuki is widely known in both Japan and North America as \"Ichiro\". In Hong Kong, a few musicians are also known by mononyms, e.g., Janice, Jin, and Justin Lo (who uses the Chinese mononym, \"\"). In Korea, singers such as BoA, Rain, Zelo, Shoo and Psy are known by their mononyms.\n\nMononyms continue to be used in parts of India, especially the South. Mayawati, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, chooses to use only a single name. Several Indian film personalities, such as Asin, Tabu, Rekha, Kajol, Dharmendra, Rajnikanth, and Pran, are also mononymous. Govindjee, Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Plant Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, an Indian-American and an authority on photosynthesis, publishes his research under his singular name. In the northeastern India state of Mizoram, most people have a single name, mostly of three syllables (e.g., Lalthansanga, Thangrikhuma, Zorinmawia). Everyone also has a tribal or clan name inherited from their father, but they do not include it in their official name.\n\nMononyms are also common in Indonesia, especially in Javanese names. In some cases, such as those of former Presidents Sukarno and Suharto, the mononym is the full legal name. Other mononyms, such as Rossa, Chrisye and Tohpati, are stage names taken from a nickname or are part of the full name.\n\nSingle names still also occur in Tibet and Mongolia. Most Afghans have no surname.\n\nIn Thailand, people usually address each other in informal situations by nicknames (). Given by parents or relatives in early childhood, these nicknames are typically one syllable (or worn down from two syllables to one). They may often be nonsense words or humorous, and usually have no relation to the person's actual name, although in some cases may be diminutive forms of their first name, like \"Nok\" for \"Noknoi\" which means respectively bird and little bird, the first used as nickname and the second being the first name. All Thais have such a name, even the royal family, and they are freely used in everyday life.\n\nMononyms are common in Myanmar. U Thant, a Myanmar diplomat, was the third Secretary-General of the United Nations (1961–71). \"U\" is an honorific in Burmese, roughly equal to \"Mr\". \"Thant\" was his only name, per local convention. In Myanmar, he was known as \"Pantanaw U Thant\", in reference to his hometown, Pantanaw.\n\nIn the Near East's Arab world, the Syrian poet Ali Ahmad Said Esber (born 1930) at age 17 adopted the mononym pseudonym, Adunis, sometimes also spelled \"Adonis\". A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in literature, he has been described as the greatest living poet of the Arab world.\n\nIn the West, mononymity, as well as its use by royals in conjunction with titles, has been primarily a privilege of famous persons such as prominent writers, artists, entertainers, musicians and athletes.\n\nSome persons, such as the artists Vincent and Christo, the sculptor Chryssa, and the singer-songwriter Basia, have had polynymous names that were unwieldy, or unfamiliar and difficult to remember or to pronounce in the community in which they were currently active, but have not wanted to entirely change their names to something more familiar to the broad public at the cost of abandoning their sense of self-identification, and so have used only a single part of their full names.\n\nThe case of the Icelandic musician Björk is similar, but her use of a single name also has roots in her native culture. Like most Icelanders, she has no family name; the second part of her full name is a patronymic. In her case, \"Björk Guðmundsdóttir\" literally translates to \"Björk, Guðmund's daughter\". Icelanders generally address one another solely by given names even in formal settings.\n\nSome mononym stage names are the performer's given name (e.g., Cheryl, Zendaya, Elvis, Selena, Cher, Madonna, Beyoncé) while others may be the performer's middle name (e.g., Rihanna, Drake), or surname (e.g. Liberace, Mantovani, Morrissey). Some mononym stage names are invented (e.g. Eminem, P!nk, Lorde), adopted words (e.g. Capucine, French for \"nasturtium\") or nicknames (e.g., Sting, Bono, Fergie).\n\nIn Lusophone countries such as Portugal, Cape Verde and especially Brazil, football players often adopt a mononym (e.g. Pelé, Nani, Ronaldo, Eusébio, Marta). In Spain, mononyms for football players are also very common; they include the player's first name (Xavi, Sergi, Raúl), derivations of the player's surname (Coro, Guti), derivations of the player's first name (Juanfran, Kiko), diminutives (Juanito, Mista), and nicknames (Michel, Arteaga, Arzu). Because there are a few very common surnames in Spain (García, Pérez, López, Hernández), the use of mononyms makes it easier to distinguish between the many Garcías and Pérezes on each team. Mononyms are occasionally used by players from other countries, for example the Venezuelan Miku, the Ivorian Gervinho and the Serbian-born American Preki. Mononyms can be seen in other sports in these countries, with examples including Brazilian basketball players Hortência and Nenê.\n\nAlso in Brazil, former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is known as \"Lula\", a nickname he officially added to his full name. Such mononyms, which take their origin in given names, surnames or nicknames, are used because Portuguese names tend to be rather long.\n\nThe comedian and illusionist Teller, the silent half of the duo Penn & Teller, has legally changed his original polynym, Raymond Joseph Teller, to the mononym \"Teller\" and possesses a United States passport issued in that single name.\n\nThe professional wrestler Warrior (born James Hellwig) legally changed his name to the mononym \"Warrior\" in an effort to boost his standing in a trademark dispute with his employer, the World Wrestling Federation. His children now use the Warrior name (as opposed to Hellwig) as their surname. Chyna did likewise when the now-WWE attempted to restrict her use of the name in pornographic titles; reports conflict as to whether she changed it back to her birth name, Joan Laurer, before she died.\n\nSome have selected their mononym themselves, when they have been able to do so, because of its distinctiveness. Others have come to be known by a mononym that has been applied to them by some segment of the public. Oprah Winfrey, famed American talk show host, is usually referred to by only her first name, Oprah. The public has referred to President George W. Bush by the mononym \"Dubya\" (eye dialect of \"W\"), to distinguish from his father, President George (H.W.) Bush.\n\nBoth mechanisms contributed in the case of Hillary Clinton, who has been called, and has publicly called herself, \"Hillary\". Peter Funt, of \"Candid Camera\", wrote in a February 21, 2007 \"New York Times\" op-ed piece, \"The Mononym Platform\": \"Someone has apparently decided that Mrs. Clinton will be the first major single-name candidate since 1952, when Ike's P.R. gurus realized that 'Eisenhower' was tough to fit on a bumper sticker. ... In an apparent attempt to model her marketing on the likes of Madonna, Beyoncé and Cher, Mrs. Clinton's site proclaimed: 'Today, Hillary took the first step...'\" In an interview with Hillary Clinton published in Salon.com, the interviewer acknowledged receiving reader accusations of sexism whenever he referred to Clinton in print as \"Hillary\" (in contrast with male candidates who were almost always referred to by their last names), although he stated it was primarily to avoid confusion with her husband, President Bill Clinton.\n\nExamples of mononyms also exist in modern popular culture. For instance, some characters on the NBC television sitcom \"Seinfeld\" are referred to only by their last names as a mononym, most prominently: Kramer, played by Michael Richards, and Newman, played by Wayne Knight. Newman's name is clearly a true mononym, in that his first name (or possibly last name) is never used or even revealed. Kramer's first name, Cosmo, is revealed to the other characters and the audience, and so his name could be seen as less of a mononym. However, this does not occur until the show's sixth season, and after the revelation he is still referred to as Kramer. Additionally, on the ABC television sitcom \"Home Improvement\", the character Wilson, played by Earl Hindman, a next-door neighbor of the central characters, is only referred to as Wilson. His full name, Wilson Wilson, is not revealed until the fourth season.\n\n\n\n"}

They played music, intending to calm the passengers, for as long as they possibly could, and all went down with the ship. All were recognized for their heroism.\nThe ship's eight musicians - members of a three-piece ensemble and a five-piece ensemble - were booked through C.W. & F.N. Black, in Liverpool. They boarded at Southampton and traveled as second-class passengers. They were not on the White Star Line's payroll but were contracted to White Star by the Liverpool firm of C.W. & F.N. Black, who placed musicians on almost all British liners. Until the night of the sinking, the players performed as two separate groups: a quintet led by violinist and official bandleader Wallace Hartley, that played at teatime, after-dinner concerts, and Sunday services, among other occasions; and the violin, cello, and piano trio of Georges Krins, Roger Bricoux, and Theodore Brailey, that played at the À La Carte Restaurant and the Café Parisien.\n\nAfter the \"Titanic\" hit an iceberg and began to sink, Hartley and his fellow band members started playing music to help keep the passengers calm as the crew loaded the lifeboats. Many of the survivors said that Hartley and the band continued to play until the very end. One second-class passenger said: \n\nTheodore Ronald Brailey (25 October 1887 – 15 April 1912) was an English pianist on the on its maiden voyage who died in the disaster.\n\nTheodore Ronald Brailey, born on 25 October 1887 in Walthamstow in Greater London (then part of Essex), was the son of William \"Ronald\" Brailey, a well-known figure of Spiritualism at the time. He studied piano at school, and one of his first jobs was playing piano in a local hotel.\n\nIn 1902, he joined the Royal Lancashire Fusiliers regiment signing for 12 years service as a musician. He was stationed in Barbados but resigned his commission prematurely in 1907. He returned to England and lived at 71 Lancaster Road, Ladbroke Grove, London. In 1911, he enlisted aboard ship, playing first on the , prior to joining the Cunard steamer in 1912, where he met the French cellist Roger Marie Bricoux. Both men then joined the White Star Line and were recruited by Liverpool music agency C.W. and F.N. Black to serve on the Brailey boarded the \"Titanic\" on Wednesday 10 April 1912 in Southampton, UK. His ticket number was 250654, the ticket for all the members of Wallace Hartley's orchestra. His cabin was in the second class quarters.\n\nBrailey was 24 years old when he died. His body was never recovered.\n\nRoger Marie Bricoux (1 June 1891 – 15 April 1912) was a French cellist on the on its maiden voyage. He died in the disaster.\n\nBefore joining the \"Titanic\", Bricoux and pianist Theodore Ronald Brailey had served together on the Cunard steamer before joining the White Star Line He boarded the \"Titanic\" on Wednesday 10 April 1912 in Southampton, UK. His ticket number was 250654, the ticket for all the members of Wallace Hartley's orchestra. His cabin was second class, and he was the only French musician aboard the \"Titanic\".\n\nBricoux was 20 years old when he died. His body was never recovered.\n\nIn 1913, after his apparent disappearance, he was declared a \"deserter\" by the French army. It was not until 2000 that he was eventually officially registered as dead in France, mainly due to the efforts of the Association Française du Titanic. On 2 November 2000, the same association unveiled a memorial plaque to Bricoux in Cosne-Cours-sur-Loire.\n\nWallace Henry Hartley (2 June 1878 – 15 April 1912), an English violinist, was the bandleader on the \"Titanic\". He died in the disaster. His body was recovered by the CS \"Mackay-Bennett\", a cable repair ship owned by the Commercial Cable Company, registered in London.\n\nJohn Law Hume (9 August 1890 – 15 April 1912) was a Scottish violinist on the on its maiden voyage. He died in the disaster.\n\nJohn Law Hume (also known as 'Jock') was born on 9 August 1890 in Dumfries, Scotland and lived with his parents at 42 George Street, Dumfries. He had already played on at least five ships before the \"Titanic\". He was recruited to play on the maiden voyage due to his good reputation as a musician.\n\nHe boarded the \"Titanic\" on Wednesday 10 April 1912 in Southampton, UK. His ticket number was 250654, the ticket for all the members of Wallace Hartley's orchestra. His cabin was in the second class quarters.\n\nHume was 21 years old when he died, unaware that his fiancée, Mary Costin, was pregnant with his child. His body was recovered by the CS \"Mackay-Bennett\", a cable repair ship owned by the Commercial Cable Company, registered in London. He was buried in grave 193 at Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada on Wednesday 8 May 1912. A memorial was erected for John Law Hume and Thomas Mullin (third class steward) in Dock Park, Dumfries. It reads:\n\nHume and the other members of Wallace Hartley's orchestra all belonged to the Amalgamated British Musicians Union and were employed by a Liverpool music agency, C.W. and F.N. Black, which supplied musicians for Cunard and the White Star Line. On 30 April 1912, Jock Hume's father, Andrew, received the following note from the agency:\n\nThe letter caused controversy at the time when it was reprinted in the Amalgamated Musicians Union's monthly newsletter. Andrew Law Hume decided not to settle the bill.\nIn April 1914 John W. Furness, the violinist of the Canadian liner RMS Empress of Ireland made a pilgrimage with Anglican Church officials to visit the grave of John Law Hume at the Fairview Lawn Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia and pay his respects, little knowing that Furness himself would perish in a shipwreck only a few weeks later when \"Empress of Ireland\" sank on May 29, 1914.\n\nGeorges Alexandre Krins (18 March 1889 – 15 April 1912) was a Belgian violinist on the on its maiden voyage. He died in the disaster.\n\nGeorges Alexandre Krins was born on 18 March 1889 in Paris, France. His family was from Belgium, and soon after his birth they moved back there to the town of Spa. He first studied at Academie de Musique de Spa. He then moved to the Conservatoire Royal de Musique in Liège, Belgium, where he studied from 30 October 1902 until 1908, when he won first prize for violin, with the highest distinction.\n\nAs a young man he wanted to join the army; however, his parents persuaded him otherwise. He worked in his father's shop and played in La Grande Symphonie, Spa. In 1910, he moved to Paris to be first violin at Le Trianon Lyrique. He subsequently moved to London and played for two years at the Ritz Hotel until March 1912. He lived at 10 Villa Road, Brixton, London and became bandmaster of the Trio String Orchestra, which played near the Café Français. This led to his being recruited by CW & FN Black, Liverpool to play on the \"Titanic\".\n\nHe boarded the \"Titanic\" on Wednesday 10 April 1912 in Southampton, UK. His ticket number was 250654, the ticket for all the members of Wallace Hartley's orchestra. His cabin was second class, and he was the only Belgian musician aboard the \"Titanic\". After the \"Titanic\" hit an iceberg and began to sink, Krins and his fellow band members assembled in the first class lounge and started playing music to help keep the passengers calm. They later moved to the forward half of the boat deck, where they continued to play as the crew loaded the lifeboats. Krins was 23 years old when he died. His body was never recovered.\n\nTwo documentary films have been made about the \"Titanic's\" band. \n\nBooks written specifically about the \"Titanic\"'s musicians include:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58589", "title": "Name change", "text": "Name change\n\nName change generally refers to the legal act by a person of adopting a new name different from their name at birth, marriage or adoption.\n\nThe procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, common law jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while civil law jurisdictions are more restrictive.\n\nA pseudonym is a name that differs from the original or true name and does not require legal sanction. It is generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but can also be done for personal, social or ideological reasons.\n\n\nIn the United States, state laws regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes (changing the name at will), including \"Lindon v. First National Bank\".\n\nUsually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change. Although the states (except Louisiana) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a court order is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a state court), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change. It is necessary to plead that the name change is not for a fraudulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a lien or debt or for defaming someone else.\n\nApplicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited judicial discretion to grant or deny a change of name, usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or immoral purposes.\nIn 2004, a Missouri man succeeded in changing his name to They. The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (\"Application of Dengler\", 1979); the North Dakota Supreme Court had denied the same request several years before (\"Petition of Dengler\", 1976).\n\nIn nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a racial slur, a threat, or an obscenity.\n\nSome examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:\n\nUnder the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more Americanized names. During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a federal court. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of law enforcement. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a federal court naturalizes an applicant.\n\nTo maintain a person's identity, it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.\n\nThe \"open and notorious\" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an assumed name. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, secretary of state, or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under pseudonyms; such a right is protected under case law pursuant to United States Constitution.\n\nA common law name (i.e. one assumed for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name. In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method, unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.\n\nIn California the \"usage method\" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name. Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively. Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.\n\nSpecifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 and Family Code § 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 (a) reads, \"Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name.\" Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code § 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)\n\nMany universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a \"preferred name\" instead of one's legal name. This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and student ID cards. It provides a \"transitional\"\nname change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.\n\nA legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the Social Security Administration, Bureau of Consular Affairs (for passports), the Federal Communications Commission, the Selective Service System and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.\n\nAlthough state requirements differ, it is generally recommended to first register a new name with the Social Security office as some state motor-vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes; Arizona is one of these states.\n\nMost states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time. For example, South Carolina, and Wyoming require a name change be registered with their office within ten days. Illinois, Texas and Vermont require it be registered within 30 days, while North Carolina allows up to 60 days. New York requires visiting a local motor vehicle office to change the name on all records and documents, but without a definite deadline to do so. The fees for registering a new name vary from state to state. The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.\n\nMany states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (\"e.g.\", intellectual property rights) of others.\n\nIn the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.\n\nIn theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their passport, driving licence, tax and National Insurance records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that \"documentary evidence\" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as birth, marriage and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are \"matters of fact\", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.\n\nDocumentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, decree absolute, civil partnership certificate, statutory declaration or deed of change of name. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.\n\nPeople whose births are registered in England and Wales may have their deed poll enrolled at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. See also College of Arms#Change of names.\n\nFrom the mediaeval age to the 19th century, the era of family dynasties, name changes were frequently demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, of members of the gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by marriage settlements, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's dowry her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private Act of Parliament or by obtaining a Royal Licence. A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname \"in addition to\" his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the \"double-barrelled\", even the \"triple-barrelled\" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy \"squirearchy\" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.\n\nWell known examples are:\n\nPeople whose births are registered in Scotland (or who were adopted in Scotland) can change their name in the same way as people from the rest of the United Kingdom. However they can optionally apply to the Registrar General for Scotland to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated.\n\nIndividuals may legally change their name through the state and territory governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled \"Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages\". Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate) and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.\n\nInstitutions such as banks, the Passports Office and transport authorities require proof of identity, so people who change their names need to have proof of the change.\n\nIf a person's birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person's birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued birth certificate if born in Australia and/or \"Change of Name Certificate\". These certificates are recognised secure identity documents and can be verified electronically through the Attorney-general of Australia's Document Verification Service.\nIn Canada a person can informally call themselves whatever they want. In all provinces except Quebec, when someone gets married they can change their last name without legally changing their name by using their Marriage Certificate as verification of the name change. It is almost impossible for married women in Québec to take their husbands' names.\nLike the United States, the requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. Except for Ontario, British Columbia and New Brunswick, Canadians must be 18 to change their names and have lived in the province they are changing it in for at least 3 months to a year, depending on province. (In British Columbia, Canadians must be 19 to change their names, in Ontario and New Brunswick 16.) People younger than the province's age of majority can change their names if they have their guardians' consent, are legally married, or have a common law marriage. To change a name, a Name Change application must be submitted to either the Ministry of Government Services, Court of justice or Registrar of civil status. A document such as a birth certificate must be submitted. A statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious. In Canada, a name cannot cause confusion, be used for misrepresentation or fraud and in most cases the name change is announced in newspapers. There is a fee involved and it ranges from $10 to $185 depending on the territory or province. British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba need fingerprints to be submitted before one changes their name.\n\nIt is a common practice for ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong to adopt a western-style English name in addition to their transliterated Chinese name. As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their legal English name is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.\n\nHowever, the Immigration Department which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll. Only one application of this kind is allowed for each applicant; any application for subsequent change(s) must be made with a deed poll.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, a person earns their name by \"use and repute\". For most purposes it is enough to simply use the desired name and ask others to call you by that name. For some administrative purposes, such as changing a name on a driving licence or legally changing gender, a deed of change of name must be registered with the Four Courts.\n\nFrom September 1995, New Zealanders can change their name by making a statutory declaration and, if approved, the new name is registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriages section of the Department of Internal Affairs (Identity Services). Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by deed poll.\n\nIn general, unlike in common law countries, names cannot be changed at will in civil law jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of personal identification numbers, that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.\n\nIn Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: \"Arrêté royal\", Dutch: \"Koninklijk besluit\") for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:\n\nAccording to the Brazilian Civil Code and the Public Registries Act, the name registered after birth is definitive and immutable. However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: \n\nIn India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.\n\nAlthough it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.\n\n2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order. Administrative Order No. 1 Series of 2001, implemented the law. It authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change the first name or nickname in the civil register without need of a judicial order.\n\nIn case of controversial and substantial changes, Philippines jurisprudence requires full-blown court lawsuit, that must include the local civil registrar in the petition, since RA 9048 and Rule 108 (Cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court do not allow the change of sex in a birth certificate.\n\nThe only landmark case in the Philippines on name and legal sex change is the Jeff Cagandahan case. The Supreme Court of the Philippines Justice Leonardo Quisumbing on September 12, 2008, allowed Cagandahan, 27, who has congenital adrenal hyperplasia, to change his birth certificate name from Jennifer to Jeff, and his legal gender from female to male.\n\nAlthough as in other jurisdictions residents of Quebec may informally use whatever name they want, procedures for formal name change are very strict as Quebec (unlike the rest of Canada) operates under a civil law system. The decision must be authorized by the Director of Civil Status, and requires a valid reason for changing the name, including long-term use of the new name (in the Montreuil case cited below, the Quebec appeals court has considered five years' use to be a sufficient reason), difficulty of use due to spelling or pronunciation, or bearing a name that another person has made infamous.\n\nOnly a judge may authorize a name change for a child for reasons of abandonment, deprivation of parental authority, or change in filiation such as adoption.\n\nThis has occasionally led to controversy. A lawyer named Micheline Montreuil, a non-operative transgender woman, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the director of civil status refused to permit the change on the grounds that a legal male could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed sex reassignment surgery, which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeal ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name. (Montreuil was initially prevented from changing her name despite this ruling on the grounds that she had not established general use, as normally required for a name change; the Quebec appeals court finally authorized the change on November 7, 2002.)\n\nThe Director of Civil Status will amend a Quebec birth certificate if a name change certificate is issued by another province. Some have used that loophole by temporarily moving to one of Canada's other provinces, which follow the more permissive common-law rules, in order to get the legal documents.\n\nSouth Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil Roman Dutch law, mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in South Africa are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.\n\nA person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the Department of Home Affairs. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a \"good and sufficient reason\" for the change.\n\nA married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)\n\nSouth Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.\n\nThe surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.\n\nIn Switzerland, a name change requires the approval of the respective Cantonal government, if there are important reasons (\"wichtige Gründe\" / \"justes motifs\") for the change, according to article 30 of the Swiss Civil Code. When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. According to the case law of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.\n\nIn Taiwan, the government strictly regulates when one's surname, given name or both may or may not be changed, under the Name Act (姓名條例) since 1953 with 10 articles, totally amended into 14 articles in 2001, and the (姓名條例施行細則).\n\nLegally permitted reasons to change one's given name are:\n\nAdherents of various religions change their name upon conversion or confirmation. The name adopted may not have any legal status but will represent their adopted religious beliefs.\n\n\n\nThere is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called Shudhikaran (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become Hindu may be optionally given a new Dharma (religious) name, which is usually based on Sanskrit or Indian name such as names based on Hindu deities.\n\nThe last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This Aklanon Katipunero was tasked by Bonifacio to establish Katipunan in Panay Island. On March 17, 1897, the young patriot, defender of liberty and leader of the Aklan revolutionists was killed by an assassin during a fight in the present-day Pastrana Park. The untimely death of Gen. del Castillo had signaled the end of the major struggle for freedom in Aklan. His close friends, assistants and soldiers were forced to give up arms, some due to the promise of receiving amnesty. These Nineteen Men, weak from hunger and thirst and racked with rain, were bound together and forced into a black hole of a stone cell on Amadeo Street (now Nineteen Martyrs Street) in Kalibo. Here their hands were manacled and a long bamboo pole was passed through their locked arms across their mangled backs. Then they were strung high up against the wall of the cell, with their backs to the firing line, and during the first hours of March 23, they were shot to death. The few who did not die instantly were bayoneted. That was a night of darkness and terror in Kalibo.\nBut such promise was quickly broken. So on the fateful day of March 23, 1897, the Martyrs of Aklan were executed. \n\nOn March 23, 1897, all 19 prisoners were summarily executed by a firing squad in the town square. Their bodies were hastily buried in a mass grave inside a cemetery. By virtue of a Municipal Council resolution, the mortal remains of 19 martyrs were transferred to its present site at corner M. Laserna and Veterans’ Avenue on March 23, 1926.\nIn order to commemorate the death anniversary of the 19 Martyrs of Aklan, Republic Act No. 7806 was made into law setting the 23rd day of March of every year as a special public holiday in the Province of Aklan.

And on September 1, 1994, in accordance with Article VI, Sec. 27(1) of the Constitution became law.\n\nOn the 102th martyrdom anniversary of the 19 Martyrs of Aklan on March 23, 2018, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines officially turned over to the Provincial Government of Aklan a tableau memorial in honor of the freedom heroes at the Goding Ramos Park. \n"}
{"id": "51027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51027", "title": "Patronymic", "text": "Patronymic\n\nA patronymic, or patronym, is a component of a personal name based on the given name of one's father, grandfather (i.e., an avonymic), or an earlier male ancestor. A component of a name based on the name of one's mother or a female ancestor is a matronymic. Each is a means of conveying lineage.\n\nPatronymics are still in use, including mandatory use, in many countries worldwide, although their use has largely been replaced by or transformed into patronymic surnames. Examples of such transformations include common English surnames such as Johnson (son of John).\n\nThe usual noun and adjective in English is \"patronymic\", but as a noun this exists in free variation alongside \"patronym\". (The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" records the corresponding \"metronymic\" and \"metronym\", alongside \"matronymic\" but not, however, \"matronym\".) The first part of the word \"patronym\" comes from Greek πατήρ \"patēr\" \"father\" ( πατρός \"patros\" whence the combining form πατρο- \"patro\"-); the second part comes from Greek ὄνυμα \"onyma\", a variant form of ὄνομα \"onoma\" \"name\". In the form \"patronymic\", this stands with the addition of the suffix -ικός (\"-ikos\"), which was originally used to form adjectives with the sense ‘pertaining to’ (thus 'pertaining to the father's name'). These forms are attested in Hellenistic Greek as πατρώνυμος (\"patrōnymos\") and πατρωνυμικός (\"patrōnymikos\"). The form \"patronym\", first attested in English in 1834, was borrowed into English from French \"patronyme\", which had previously borrowed the word directly from Greek. \"Patronymic\", first attested in English in 1612, has a more complex history. Both Greek words had entered Latin, and, from Latin, French. The English form \"patronymic\" was borrowed through the mutual influence of French and Latin on English.\n\nIn many areas around the world, patronyms predate the use of family names. Family names in many Celtic, English, Iberian, Scandinavian, Armenian and Slavic surnames originate from patronyms, e.g. Wilson (son of William), FitzGerald (son of Gerald), Powell (from \"ap Hywel\"), Fernández (son of Fernando), Rodríguez (son of Rodrigo), Anderson or Andersen (son of Anders, Scandinavian form of Andrew), Carlson or Carlsen (son of Carl), Ilyin (of Ilya), Petrov (of Peter), Grigorovich (son of Grigory, Russian form of Gregory), Stefanović (son of Stefan, little Stefan), MacAllister (from \"mac Alistair\", meaning son of Alistair, anglicized Scottish form of Alexander) and O'Conor (from \"Ó Conchobhair\", meaning grandson/descendant of Conchobhar). Other cultures which formerly used patronyms have switched to the more widespread style of passing the father's last name to the children (and wife) as their own.\nIn Iceland, family names are unusual; Icelandic law favours the use of patronyms (and more recently, matronyms) over family names.\n\nTraditionally Muslim and non-Arabic speaking African people, such as Hausa and Fulani people usually (with some exceptions) follow the Arab naming pattern. The word or phrase meaning \"son of\" is, however, omitted. So Mohamed son of Ibrahim son of Ahmed is \"Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed\", and Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed's son Ali is \"Ali Mohamed Ibrahim\".\n\nEthiopians and Eritreans have no concept of family name and surname. If one is to refer to a person with a single name he/she will always use the person's given name. Ethiopian and Eritreans use a naming pattern very similar to the Arab naming pattern, but with one exception: no suffix or prefix. The full name is written as: First name (given name) followed by the father's name, and last by the grandfather's name. For example, Sara Yohannes Petros is Sara (given name) Yohannes (father's name) Petros (grandfather's name). The grandfather's name is usually only used in official documents. The father's name is not considered a middle name. Instead, it is considered a last name. The same is true for females; they do not take their husband's last name. They go independently by their given name, followed by their father's name, and then their grandfather's name, even after marriage.\n\nSome Kenyan communities used patronyms. As of 2010 the practice has largely dropped off with the use of just the father's last name as a surname.\nKalenjin use 'arap' meaning 'son of'; \nKikuyu used 'wa' meaning 'of'. Because of polygamy, matronyms were also used and 'wa' used to identify which wife the child was born of; \nMaasai use 'ole' meaning 'son of'; \nMeru use 'mto' abbreviated M' thus son of Mkindia would be M'Mkindia, pronounced Mto Mkindia.\n\nPatronymic naming is very common in parts of Mozambique. Although the practice is not universal, patronymic naming has been documented in the Zambezia province.\n\nNow not as prominent as before, Many people of southern Nigeria took their father's given name (father's first name) as their surname. It could also be the father's prominent nickname, which takes the place of a first name. An example would be a man named Kolade Fabiyi, who had a son named Dele. The son's name would now be Dele Kolade, not Dele Fabiyi. This is used to distinguish between extended family who would have the same last name, like cousin. This custom has dropped to the modern English one due to increase in British style education.\n\nSomalis use their paternal grandfather's given name as their legal surname for documentation purpose. They also use the term \"ina\" or \"iña\" meaning \"the son of\" or \"the daughter of,\" which is similar to other African- and the Arab-naming patterns. For example, the name \"Ahmed Mohamed Ali Farah\" means \"Ahmed son of Mohamed son of Ali son of Farah.\" When stating one's lineage, one will say \"Ahmed ina Mohamed\" (Ahmed, the son of Mohamed). To identify themselves and the sub=clan they belong to, Somalis memorize their long lineage back a common ancestor. Women never adopt their husbands' patronym but keep theirs for life.\n\nAmong the Zulu patronymics were used in the pre-colonial era. The prefix \"ka\" was attached to the father's name, for example Shaka kaSenzangakhona means Shaka son of Senzangakhona. The practice disappeared from everyday use with the introduction of the modern European style surname system but still remains part of traditional cultural practices, particularly in the case of chieftains and royalty where reciting lineages forms a part of many ceremonial occasions.\n\nYi people's sons' given names are based on the last one or two syllables of father's name. Hani people also have patronymic customs.\n\nAtayal people's names are followed by the name of their father, both son and daughter are patronymic. \nAmis people's son names are also followed by the father's name, while a daughter's name is followed by her mother's name.\n\nPatronymy is common in parts of India. For example, if a father is named Khurram Suleman (a Muslim masculine name), he might name his son Taha Khurram, who in turn might name his son Ismail Taha. As a result, unlike surnames, patronymics will not pass down through many generations.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu and some parts of Kerala and South Karnataka, patronymy is predominant. This is a significant departure from the rest of the country where caste names are mostly employed as surnames. This came into common use during the 1950s and 1960s when the Dravidian movement campaigned against the use one's caste as part of the name.\n\nHowever, rather than using the father's full name, only the first letter — popularly known as the initial — is prefixed to the given name. For example, if a person's given name is \"Saravanan\" and his father's \"Krishnan\", then the full name is \"K. Saravanan\" and is seldom expanded, even in official records. Only where it is forced by stipulation — such as when applying for an Indian passport which does not usually allow initials — is the initial expanded and the name rendered as \"Krishnan Saravanan\". Some families follow the tradition of retaining the name of the hometown, the grandfather's name, or both as initials. The celebrated Indian English novelist R. K. Narayan's name at birth was Rasipuram Krishnaswami Ayyar Narayanaswami, which was shortened at the behest of his writer friend, Graham Greene. Rasipuram, the first name, is a toponym and Krishnaswami Ayyar, the second name, is a patronym.\n\nIn Tamilnadu the use of initials and/or surname is up to the prerogative of the person with no strict rules. The late chief minister Karunanidhi preferred to be referred as M. Karunanidhi where the initial M stood for Muthuvel - his father's given name. M.Karunanidhi's son prefers to be referred as M.K.Stalin incorporating both his fathers and grandfather's names. However M.K.Stalin's son prefers to be referred as Udhayanidhi Stalin. Where Udhayanidhi is his given name and Stalin his father's given name as his surname rather than as an initial.\n\nLikewise, cricketer Ashwin son of Ravichandran prefers to be referred to as R.Ashwin or Ravichandran Ashwin. This is because commentators in sports often call players by their last names only and it would be embarrassing to call him by his fathers name, therefore he puts his own given name in the last.\n\nAnother upcoming trend is to expand the initials to reflect how it would sound in the native language. For example Karuppiah prefers to be called Pala. Karuppiah instead of P. Karuppiah and his son Palaniappan prefers Karu. Palaniappan. Cinema director Ranjith prefers Pa. Ranjith instead of P. Ranjith as Pa sounds closer to the name in Tamil rather than P which sounds like Pe unlike the first syllable Pa.\n\nCelebrated scientist M. Annadurai would expand his name as Mayilsami Annadurai, however he has to be referred to as Annadurai as referring to him as Mayilsami would be referring to him with his father's given name which could be embarrassing for him.\n\nWhile the usage of caste names as surnames/last names is discouraged(but not banned) in Tamil Nadu, such usage by out of state people is greeted with indifference. So Lakshmi Menon, Shilpa Shetty, Pranab Mukherjee, Somnath Chaterjee etc. are referred by their preferred names which include their caste names. Likewise old tamil names with caste in them are also fully used while referring to them such as Pasumpoan Muthuramalinga Thevar, U.Ve. Swaminatha Iyer etc.\n\nIn Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat, a very common convention among the Hindu communities is to have the patronymic as the middle name. Examples:\n\n\nThis system works for both boys and girls, except that after marriage, a woman takes her husband's given name as her middle name – her new middle name is no longer a patronymic.\n\nIndians, particularly Tamils in Singapore, often continue the patronymic tradition; this entails having a single given name, followed by son / daughter of, followed by their father's name.\n\nMalaysian Indians may also follow this custom with \"son\" or \"daughter\" of being replaced by \"anak lelaki\" or \"anak perempuan\", respectively.\n\nIndians of the Muslim Isma'ili sect also have patronymic middle names which use the father's first name and the grandfather's first name plus a family name. Someone called \"Ramazan Rahim Ali Manji\" might call his son \"Karim Ramazan Rahim Manji\" and his granddaughter might be called \"Zahra Karim Ramazan Manji\".\n\nIn Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, ethnic Malays generally follow the Arabic patronymic naming system of \"given name\" + bin/binti + \"father's name\".\n\nIn Brunei, the ruling family of the monarch uses \"given name\" + \"ibni\" + \"father's name\" instead of using bin/binti.\n\nIn Indonesia, there are a number of ethnic groups with different naming systems. The Batak of North Sumatra (Sumatra Utara) give every child the family's name. Sometimes the family's name is prefixed by Huta-, Batu-, etc., but most use Si-, such as Sitanggang, Sihombing, Sibutar-butar, Sinaga, or Sitohang. The family's name is given from the father's family. For example, if the father's name is Boggi Sinaga who married to Moetia Siregar then all children will be given family's name of Sinaga.\n\nIn Sunda a similar cultural rule is used to that of the Batak. The family's name for Sunda is -Wijaya, but this isn't true for all Sundanese families.\n\nIn Arabic, the word \"\" ( or : \"bin\", \"ben\" and sometimes \"ibni\" and \"ibnu\" to show the grammatical case of the noun) is the equivalent of the \"-son\" suffix discussed above. (The prefix ben- is used similarly in Hebrew.) In addition, \"\" () means \"daughter of\". Thus, for example, \"Ali ibn `Amr\" means \"Ali son of `Amr\". In Classical Arabic, the word \"ibn\" is written as \"bn\" between two names, since the case ending of the first name then supplies a vowel. Consequently, ibn is often written as \"b.\", as bint is often written as \"bt.,\" in name formulas rendered from Arabic into Roman characters. Thus Hisham ibn al-Kalbi is alternatively written as Hisham b. al-Kalbi. However, the pronunciation \"bin\" is dialectal and has nothing to do with either the spelling or pronunciation in Classical Arabic. The word \"Abu\" (\"Aba\" or \"Abi\" in different grammatical cases) means \"father of\", so \"Abu `Ali\" is another name for \"`Amr\".\n\nIn medieval times, an illegitimate child of unknown parentage would sometimes be termed \"ibn Abihi\", \"son of his father\" (notably Ziyad ibn Abihi.) In the Qur'an, Jesus (Isa in Arabic) is consistently termed \"`Isa ibn Maryam\" - a matronymic (in the Qur'an, Jesus has no father; see Islamic view of Jesus). An Arabic patronymic can be extended as far back as family tree records will allow: thus, for example, Ibn Khaldun gives his own full name as \"`Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Jabir ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn `Abd ar-Rahman ibn Khaldun\".\n\nPatronymics are still standard in parts of the Arab world, notably Saudi Arabia and Iraq. (In the case of Iraq, with the omitted ibn or bint.) However, most of the Arab world has switched to a family name system. As in English, the new family names are sometimes based on what was formerly a patronymic. Another form widely used in the Arab world is the usage of both the patronymic and a family name, often using both the father's and paternal grandfathers given name in sequence after the own given name, and then the family name. In Iraq for example, full names are formed by combining the given name of an individual with the given name of their father (sometimes the father is skipped and the paternal grandfather's given name is used instead, sometimes both father and paternal grandfather are used), along with the town, village, or clan name. For instance, Hayder Muhammed al-Tikriti is the son of Muhammed named Hayder, and he is from the town of Tikrit. In Saudi Arabia naming conventions are similar to Iraq's but family names are used much more often.\n\nIn Aramaic, the prefix bar- means \"son\" and is used as a prefix meaning \"son of\". In the Bible, Peter is called Bar-Jonah in and Nathanael is possibly called Bartholomew because he is the son of Tolmai (or son of Ptolemy, with \"P\" being reduced). The titles can also be figurative, for example in Acts 4:36-37 a man named Joseph is called Barnabas meaning \"son of consolation\".\n\nThe Assyrians for centuries have used the patronymic bet or bit literally meaning \"house\" in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic; however, in the context of the name it means \"from the house of [the father's name].\"\n\nJews have historically used Hebrew patronymic names after the Bar Kokhba revolt, before which the most common language was Aramaic. In the Jewish patronymic system the first name is followed by either ben- or bat- (\"son of\" and \"daughter of\", respectively), and then the father's name, mother's name, or both. In Aramaic, the first name was followed by bar- or bat- (\"son of\" and \"daughter of\", respectively).\n\nPermanent family surnames exist today, first by Sephardic Jews in 10th or 11th century Iberia and by Ashkenazi Jews in the late 18th century, when Austria passed the first law requiring Jews adopt surnames. Similar laws were passed in Prussia, Galicia, France, regions of Germany, and other countries.\n\nWhile Jews now have permanent surnames for everyday life, the patronymic form is still used in religious life. It is used in synagogue and in documents in Jewish law such as the ketubah (marriage contract). Many Sephardic Jews used the Arabic \"ibn\" instead of \"bat\" or \"ben\" when it was the norm. The Spanish family Ibn Ezra is one example.\n\nThere is a strong cultural pressure for immigrants to modern Israel to Hebraize their names. \nThis practice is especially common among Ashkenazic immigrants, because most of their names were taken during the period from the end of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th century. For example, Golda Meir was born \"Golda Mabovitch\", took the name \"Golda Meyerson\" after her marriage to American Morris Meyerson, and, upon making Aliyah and at the urging of Moshe Sharett, Hebraized her last name to Meir.\n\nIn Persian, patronymics پَتوَند are formed by names ending with the suffix \"Pur\" \"پور\" for men and \"Dokht\" \"دُخت\" for women. For example: Shahpoor (son of king) and Sinapoor (Ebne sina). Depending on country, some suffixes are more common than others. For example, in Iran, the suffix \"pur\" is common while in Afghanistan, the suffix \"Zadah\" \"زاده\" or \"Zad\" \"زاد\" is common.\n\nIn Western Europe patronyms were formerly widespread but later became confined to Scandinavia and Iceland.\n\nIn England, names ending with the suffix \"son\" were often originally patronymic. In addition, the archaic French (more specifically, Norman) prefix \"fitz\" (cognate with the modern French \"fils\", meaning \"son\"), appears in England's aristocratic family lines dating from the Norman Conquest, and also among the Anglo-Irish. Thus there are names such as Fitzgerald and Fitzhugh. Of particular interest is the name \"Fitzroy\", meaning \"son of [the] king\", which was used by illegitimate royal children who were acknowledged as such by their fathers.\n\nThe use of \"Mac\" in some form was prevalent in Scottish Gaelic, Irish and Manx, in all of which it denotes \"son\". \"Mc\" is also a frequent anglicisation in both Scotland and Ireland. In Ireland, the forms \"Mag\" and \"M'\" are encountered. The prefix \"Mac\" is used to form a patronym, such as \"Mac Coinnich\" – or the anglicized 'Mackenzie' – son of Coinneach/Kenneth. The female equivalent of \"Mac\" is \"Nic\", condensed from \"nighean mhic\" (in Scottish Gaelic) or \"iníon mhic\" (in Irish), both meaning daughter. For example, the Scottish Gaelic surname, \"Nic Dhòmhnaill\" meaning 'daughter of a son of Dòmhnall' (in English, Donald), as in \"Mairi Nic Dhòmhnaill\", or Mary MacDonald.\n\nAt the north end of the Irish Sea, in Ulster, the Isle of Man and Galloway (indeed as far north as Argyll), \"Mac\" was frequently truncated in speech to /k/, leading to such anglicisations as \"Qualtrough\" (Son of Walter) & \"Quayle\" (son of Paul, cf. MacPhail) – usually beginning with \"C\", \"K\" or \"Q\". In Ireland, this truncation resulted in surnames such as \"Guinness\" (son of Aonghus, cf. MacAonghusa) beginning usually in \"C\" or \"G\" for patronymics prefixed with Mac, and in \"H\" (e.g. \"Hurley\" (descendant of Jarlath, cf. Ua h-Iarfhlatha/O'Hurley)) for surnames prefixed with \"O\". Colloquial Scottish Gaelic also has other patronymics of a slightly different form for individuals, still in use (for more information please see: Scottish Gaelic personal naming system).\n\nBefore the 1536 Act of Union, the Welsh did not generally employ surnames, but instead used epithets (e.g. Selyf Sarffgadau, \"Selyf the Battle-Serpent\"), patronyms (e.g. Rhodri ap Merfyn, \"Rhodri son of Merfyn\"), and (much less often) matronyms (e.g. Rhodri ap Nest, \"Rhodri son of Nest\") to identify people. Welsh, as a P-Celtic language, originally used \"map\" or \"mab\" instead of the Q-Celtic \"mac\" employed in Ireland and Scotland. These were later simplified to the modern Welsh \"ap\" and \"ab\". A common practice is to use \"ab\" before a father's name beginning with a vowel (e.g., Llywelyn ab Iorwerth), but they are also employed arbitrarily in many sources.\n\nDaughters were indicated by \"ferch\" or \"verch\" (mutated from \"merch\", \"girl, daughter\"). \"Angharad verch Owain\" would be \"Angharad, daughter of Owain\".\n\nAfter the Acts of Union, this led to many Welsh surnames being variants of their father or ancestor's personal name: \"ap\" or \"ab Ieuan\" often became \"Evans\"; \"ap Rhys\", \"Price\"; \"ap\" or \"ab Owain\", \"Bowen\"; \"ap Hywel\", \"Powell\" or \"Howell\". In addition to these Anglicised baptismal and official names, patronyms continued to be commonly employed in Welsh until the Industrial Revolution, particularly in the north and west of Wales. Patronyms were sometimes employed within the English names as well by using the father's personal name as the sons' middle name.\n\nSimilar rules might apply in Cornwall were it not for its earlier inclusion into England; and therefore patronyms (e.g.[m]ap Ros>Rouse, [m]ap Richard>Pritchard, Davies, Evans) are less common than toponyms (e.g. Tresillian, Trevithick, Nanskeval/Nankeville) and occupational surnames (e.g. An Gof, [An] Gove, \"(Blacksmith)\"; Helyer (Cornish dialect - possibly a slater or huntsman (helgher)).\n\nIn Dutch, patronymics were often used in place of family names or as middle names. Patronymics were composed of the father's name plus an ending \"-zoon\" for sons, \"-dochter\" for daughters. For instance, Abel Janszoon Tasman is \"Abel son of Jan Tasman\", and Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer: \"Kenau, daughter of Simon Hasselaer\". In written form, these endings were often abbreviated as \"-sz.\" and \"-dr.\" respectively e.g. Jeroen Cornelisz. \"Jeroen son of Cornelis\", or Dirck Jacobsz. The endings \"-s\", \"-se\" and \"-sen\" were also commonly used for sons and often for daughters too. In the northern provinces, \"-s\", as genitive case, was almost universally used for both sons and daughters. The suffix -\"x\" as in \"Tacx\" also denoted the son or daughter of Tac, and is now integrated as a complete name.\n\nPatronymics were common in the Dutch United Provinces until the French invasion in 1795 and subsequent annexation in 1810. As the Netherlands were now a province of France, a registry of births, deaths and marriages was established in 1811, whereupon emperor Napoleon forced the Dutch to register and adopt a distinct surname.\n\nIn France, the terms \"patronyme\" and \"nom patronymique\" had long been used interchangeably to designate the family name, meaning that it is inherited from the father.\n\nThe tradition of patronymic lineage is still used among some Canadian descendants of French colonists: in the oral tradition of many Acadians, for example, \"Marc à Pierre à Gérard\" (lit. \"Marc of Pierre of Gérard\"), means \"Marc, son of Pierre, grandson of Gérard\".\n\nIn the past, both in Spanish and Portuguese, the endings \"-ez\" and \"-es\" tended to be conflated since pronunciation was quite similar in the two languages. Today, Portuguese has been fully standardized to \"-es\"; Spanish is also standardized to \"-ez\", but it is very common to see archaic endings in \"-es\". For instance, Pires/Peres and Pérez are the modern forms of \"Peterson\" in Portuguese and Spanish.\n\nIn Portugal, there are some surnames which had a patronymic genesis, while still common they no longer indicate patronymic usage. For instance, \"Álvares\" was the son of \"Álvaro\" and \"Gonçalves\" was the son of \"Gonçalo\" (it was the case of Nuno Álvares Pereira, son of Álvaro Gonçalves Pereira, son of Gonçalo Pereira). Other cases include \"Rodrigues\" (\"son of Rodrigo\"), \"Nunes\" (\"son of Nuno\") and \"Fernandes\" (\"son of Fernando\").\nIn the same way the surname Soares means son of Soeiro (in Latin Suarius). It comes from Latin Suaricius (son of Suarius); the Latin genitive suffix \"-icius/a\" was used to indicate a patronymic. Later it became Suáriz, Suárez and eventually Soares. Another theory attributes the Iberian -ez style patronymics to Germanic (Visigothic) rather than Latin influence.\n\nSpanish patronyms follow a similar pattern to the Portuguese (e.g., López: of Lope; Hernández: of Hernán; Álvarez: of Álvaro). Common endings include -ez, -az, -is, and -oz. However, not all names with similar endings are necessarily patronymic. For example, Chávez is not the son of \"Chavo\", but comes from Galician or Portuguese \"Chaves\", meaning \"keys\", and its \"s\" stands for the plural form, as in key/keys in English.\n\nA list of some Iberian patronymics:\n\nIn Norse custom patronyms and matronyms were formed by using the ending -son (later -søn and -sen in Danish, Norwegian and German) to the genitive form of the father's name to indicate \"son of\", and -dóttir (Icelandic and Faroese -dóttir, Swedish and Norwegian -dotter, Danish and Norwegian -datter) for \"daughter of\". This name was generally used as a last name although a third name, a so-called byname based on location or personal characteristic, was often added to differentiate people and could eventually develop into a kind of family name. Some Early Modern examples of the latter practice, where the patronymic was placed after the given name and was followed by the surname, are Norwegian Peder Claussøn Friis, the son of Nicolas Thorolfsen Friis (Claus in Claussøn being short for Nicolas) and Danish Thomas Hansen Kingo, the son of Hans Thomsen Kingo.\n\nEventually, most Nordic countries replaced or complemented this system with the prevailing \"international\" standard of inherited family names. In Norway, for example, the parliament passed a family name act in 1923, citing the rising population and the need to avoid the confusion of new last names in every generation. The law does allow a person to retain a patronymic as a middle name in addition to the surname, as was common in Early Modern times; this is not a common practice, but does occur, a modern example being Audhild Gregoriusdotter Rotevatn. The Danish government outlawed the practice in 1856 and eased the regulations in 1904 to deal with the limited number of patronymics. In Sweden the practice of children keeping their father's and wives keeping their husband's patronymic as a surname occurred in the 1700s but was first prevalent in the late 1800s, still present yet uncommon in the 1900s and finally abolished in 1966. In 1982 the right to use patronyms (and matronyms) was partially restored, and from 1 July 2017 parents in Sweden are free to give their children patronyms/matronyms at birth instead of inherited family names.\n\nMatronyms were used exceptionally if the child was born out of wedlock or if the mother was much more high-born or well known than the father, a historical example being Sweyn Estridsson.\n\nIn Iceland, patronymics or matronymics are still used as last names and this is in fact compulsory by law, with a handful of exceptions. The father's name (occasionally with a minor alteration for genitive) plus the word \"son\" for sons, \"dóttir\" for daughters. For example, Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir (to be read in English as \"Jóhanna, daughter of Sigurð[ur]\").\n\nIn Finland, the use of patronymics was a result of relatively recent Swedish influence and remained uncommon outside official documents. Only in the 19th century did the use of patronymics gain any sort of popularity among the Finnish-speaking lower classes. Family names became obligatory in Finland by law in 1920.\n\nHistorically, patronymics were composed in Swedish fashion: the father's name and the suffix -n for genitive plus the word \"poika\" for sons, \"tytär\" for daughters. For example, Tuomas Abrahaminpoika (to be read in English as \"Tuomas, Abraham's son\") and Martta Heikintytär (to be read in English as \"Martta, Heikki's daughter\").\n\nIn Bulgarian, the patronymics are \"-ov\"/\"-ev\" and \"-ova\"/\"-eva\" for men and women, respectively. These are identical to the endings of \"family\" names in Bulgarian and some other Slavic family names (such as names in Russian and Czech). In Bulgarian official documents, the patronymic is inserted before the surname - e.g. \"Ivan Marinov Yordanov\" would be the son of \"Marin Yordanov\".\n\nThe use of patronymics was introduced in Armenia by Russians during the times of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Previously to that the use of patronymics was very limited. Patronymics are usually formed by addition of \"i\" (\"of\", pronounced as ee) to the father's name, e.g. if father's name is \"Armen\", the corresponding patronymic would be \"Armeni\" (of Armen). Russified version of the same patronymic would be \"Armenovich\" for males and \"Armenovna\" for females. After Armenia re-gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 a massive decline in the use of Russified patronymics occurred; nowadays few Armenians use patronymics outside of official contexts.\n\nMany Armenian surnames were once patronymics first used by distant ancestors or clan founders. These are characterized by the suffix \"-ian\" in Western Armenian, often transliterated as \"-yan\" in Eastern Armenian. These are appended to the given name, i.e. Kardashian, Asdvadzadourian, Hagopian, Khachadourian, Mardirosian, Bedrosian, Sarkissian, etc. Note that the suffix \"-ian\" was also appended to trades, as in Adakhtsakordzian (issued from the carpenter), Chalian (issued from the candlemaker, using the Turkish word \"chal\", meaning candle).\n\nOf particular note are the surnames of the children of married priests, or kahanas. Though not as common nowadays, it was customary for a long time for these children (particularly the sons) to change their last names to the name-in-religion of their father. For example, the son of Ter (Reverend) Bartev would change his last name to Ter Bartevian.\n\nIn Azeri, patronymics are formed through \"-oğlu\" (sometimes transliterated as \"ogly\") for males and \"qızı\" (often transliterated as \"gizi\" or \"kizi\") for females. Prior to the late 19th–early 20th century, patronymics were used as an essential part of a person's full name, i.e. \"Sardar Ilyas oğlu\" (\"Sardar, son of Ilyas\") and \"Mina Nabi qızı\" (\"Mina, daughter of Nabi\"), since surnames were mostly non-existent before Sovietization (with the exception of the upper and some middle-class families). After surnames were commonly adopted in Azerbaijan in the 1920s, patronymics still remained parts of full names, i.e. \"Sardar Ilyas oğlu Aliyev\" (\"Sardar Aliyev, son of Ilyas\"). Nowadays in Azerbaijan, patronymics sometimes replace surnames in unofficial use. Normally in such case, they are spelled as one word (i.e. \"Eldar Mammadoğlu\", \"Sabina Yusifqızı\"). Many Azeri surnames are also derived from Persian-style patronymics ending in \"-zadeh\" (\"Kazimzadeh\", \"Mehdizadeh\", etc.). They are found among both Caucasian and Iranian Azeris. However unlike the former, Azeris in Iran do not generally use patronymics in \"oglu\" / \"qizi\". Azeri patronymics are not to be confused with Turkish surnames in \"-oğlu\" and Greek surnames in -ογλού (\"-oglou\"), which do not have specific female versions and do not reflect names of fathers.\n\nIn Georgian, patronymics, when used, come with the addition of \"s\" to the end of the father's name, followed by \"dze\" for a man and \"asuli\" for a woman. For example, Joseph Stalin's actual name was Ioseb Besarionis Dze Jugashvili. \"s\" in Georgian is a possessive, and \"dze\" and \"asuli\" mean male and female descendant. After collapse of the USSR, patronymics in Georgia are disused as part of Russian tradition.\nGeorgian last names derive mostly from patronymics, nicknames and places of origin. Two common elements in Georgian last names, \"dze\" and \"shvili\" mean son of, and child, respectively.\n\nMost Greek surnames are patronymics by origin, albeit in various forms depending on ancestral locality. Diminutive suffixes which denote \"\"son of\", or more generally \"descendant of\"\", are produced as follows: starting with the given name Δημήτριος, \"Dēmétrios\", for example, the patronymic surnames Dēmētr\"ópoulos\" (Peloponnese), Dēmētr\"ákos\" (Laconia), Dēmētr\"éas\" (Messenian Mani), Dēmētr\"átos\" (Cephalonia), Dēmētr\"ákēs\" (Crete), Dēmētr\"iádēs\"/Dēmētr\"-ídēs\" (Pontus, Asia Minor), Dēmētr\"éllēs\" (Lesbos), Dēmétr\"oglou\" (Asia Minor) (identical to Turkish patronym \"-oğlu\"), or simply \"Dēmētríou\" (esp. common in Cyprus, the first name in the Genitive) are formed. The same principle can apply to surnames deriving from professions, for example from παπάς, \"papás\", priest, one derives the surnames \"Papadópoulos, Papadákos, Papadéas, Papadátos, Papadákēs, Papadéllēs, Papazoglou\" etc., all of which signify a \"priest's son\". The same principle(s) may apply in combination, e.g. \"Papanikoláou, Papanikolópoulos\", \"the son of the priest Nikolaos\". A daughter's family name is the same as the son's, but \"always\" declined in the Genitive, e.g. \"Dēmētropoúlou, Papanikoláou\" etc.\n\nIn addition to these surnames, \"actual\" patronymics are used in official documents as \"middle names\" preceding the surname. For example, the children of a \"Giánnēs Papadópoulos\" are, say, \"María Ioánnou Papadopoúlou\" and \"Andréas Ioánnou Papadópoulos\" (\"Ioánnou\" is the genitive case form of \"Ioánnēs\", which is the formal form of the father's name, \"Giánnēs\"). Traditionally, a married woman would adopt her husband's family name. Now, however, women in Greece can keep their own surname if they so choose.\n\nIn Hungarian, patronyms were traditionally formed with the ending \"-fi\" (sometimes spelled as \"-fy\" or \"-ffy\"). This system is no longer in common use, though traces of it can still be found in some frequent present-day surnames such as \"Pálfi\" (son of Paul), \"Győrfi\", \"Bánfi\" or in the name of the famous poet Sándor Petőfi (who chose this Hungarian form instead of his Slavic birth name \"Petrovics\"). In the Old Hungarian period (10th−16th century, see History of Hungarian), when surnames were not in common use, the full genitive was represented as in \"Péter fia András\" (\"Peter's son Andrew\"); these forms are in frequent use in charters and legal documents dated back to that time.\n\nIn Romanian, the endings \"-escu\" and \"-eanu\" were used, as in \"Petrescu\", 'son of Petre (Peter)'; many modern Romanian family names were formed from such patronymics. Less commonly, matronymics formed with the genitive form (using the prefix \"a-\") were used, as in \"Amariei\", '(son/daughter) of Maria'.\n\nIn East Slavic languages, the endings \"-ovich\", \"-evich\" and \"-ich\" are used to form patronymics for men. It would be cognate to the Latin genitive -ici, used for marking family line, and also as equivalent to: 'little' -Vladic= 'the little Vlad'-. For women, the ending is \"-yevna\", \"-ovna\" or \"-ichna\". For example, in Russian, a man named Ivan with a father named Nikolay would be known as Ivan Nikolayevich or \"Ivan, son of Nikolay\" (\"Nikolayevich\" being a patronymic). Likewise, a woman named Lyudmila with a father named Nikolay would be known as Lyudmila Nikolayevna or \"Lyudmila, daughter of Nikolay\" (\"Nikolayevna\" being a patronymic). For masculine names ending in a vowel, such as Ilya or Foma, when they are used as a base for patronymic, the corresponding endings are \"-ich\" (for men) and \"-inichna\" (for women). Examples in titles of classical Russian literature include\" The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin\", \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\" and \"The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich\".\n\nIn Russia, the patronymic is an official part of the name, used in all official documents, and when addressing somebody both formally and among friends. Individuals are addressed by their given name followed by patronymic (e.g., \"Mikhail Nikolayevich\") in many situations including on formal occasions, by colleagues at work, by acquaintances, or when addressed by someone younger in age. It is becoming more common for younger individuals (under 50) to drop the patronymic at work. In informal situations, if a person is called by a diminutive (such as Misha for Mikhail or Nastya for Anastasia), the patronymic is not used.\n\nIn colloquial, informal speech, it is also possible to contract the ending of a patronymic: thus Nikolayevich becomes Nikolaich, and Stepan Ivanovich becomes Stepan Ivanych or simply Ivanych as the given name may be omitted altogether. In this case the contraction, if possible, is obligatory: Ivan Sergeyevich Sidorov may be called \"Sergeich\" or, more rarely, \"Sergeyevich\". In contrast to male names, if a woman is called by her patronymic name without a given name, the patronymic is usually not contracted: \"Ivanovna\" but \"Mar' Ivanna\"; \"Sergeyevna\"/\"Sergevna\" is one exception, where both forms are fine. Typically, a patronymic name alone is a familiar form of addressing an older female.\n\nVuk Karadžić reported in the 19th century that Serbs sometimes used their old family names, and sometimes patronymics. Vuk Karadžić himself used patronymic Stefanović (son of Steven), and sometimes Karadzić, old family name. However, nowadays, the patronymic names in Serbia are mostly used on legal documents, and have the form of the father's name that says the child is 'of so and so'... example: Marija Dragoljuba Pavlovic, where Dragoljub is the father's name and 'Dragoljuba' literally means 'of Dragoljub'.\n\nIn Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, the patronymic names do not change form between masculine and feminine. Example: Marija Dragoljuba Pavlović (Dragoljub is the father's name; Dragoljuba is the form that says she is his daughter, or literally 'of Dragoljub').\n\nIn Turkish, the suffixes used to indicate paternal ancestry are \"-oğlu\" and \"-zade\", which indicate the ancestry as coming from a certain man. Like many other patronymics in other languages, with the formalization of naming conventions by laws in the late modern contemporary age many turned into surnames. After the 'Surname revolution' in 1934, many people chose professions or habitat as surnames with or without the suffix \"-oğlu\", such as \"Elbeyioğlu\", \"Bakkaloğlu\" or \"Giritlioğlu\" and with \"-zade\" such as \"Beyzade\", \"Mehmedzade\", \"Yusufzade\".\n\nIn Ukrainian, the female patronymic always ends with \"-івна\" \"(-ivna)\" or \"-ївна\" \"(-yivna)\". The male patronymic always ends with -\"ович\" \"(-ovych)\" or \"-йович\" \"(-yovych)\". Exception: \"Illia (Ілля)\" -> \"Illich (Ілліч)\" (e.g. Illia Illich Mechnikov), \"Sava (Сава)\" -> \"Savych (Савич)\", \"Iakiv (Яків)\" -> \"Iakovych (Якович)\"\n\n\n"}

Most of the members attended Stanford University or University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign at some point in their studies. Six members, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Luke Nosek, Ken Howery, and Keith Rabois, have become billionaires.\n\nOriginally, PayPal was a money-transfer service offered by a company called Confinity which was acquired by X.com in 1999. Later X.com was renamed PayPal and purchased by eBay in 2002. The original PayPal employees had difficulty adjusting to eBay's more traditional corporate culture and within four years all but 12 of the first 50 employees had left. They remained connected as social and business acquaintances, and a number of them worked together to form new companies in subsequent years. This group of PayPal alumni became so prolific that the term PayPal Mafia was coined. The term gained even wider exposure when a 2007 article in \"Fortune\" magazine used the phrase in its headline and featured a photo of former PayPal employees in gangster attire.\n\nThe PayPal Mafia is sometimes credited with inspiring the re-emergence of consumer-focused Internet companies after the dot-com bust of 2001. The PayPal Mafia phenomenon has been compared to the founding of Intel in the late 1960s by engineers who had earlier founded Fairchild Semiconductor after leaving Shockley Semiconductor. They are discussed in journalist Sarah Lacy's book \"Once You're Lucky, Twice You're Good.\" According to Lacy, the selection process and technical learning at PayPal played a role, but the main factor behind their future success was the confidence they gained there. Their success has been attributed to their youth; the physical, cultural, and economic infrastructure of Silicon Valley; and the diversity of their skill-sets. PayPal's founders encouraged tight social bonds among its employees, and many of them continued to trust and support one another after leaving PayPal. An intensely competitive environment and a shared struggle to keep the company solvent despite many setbacks also contributed to a strong and lasting camaraderie amongst former employees.\n\nIndividuals whom the media refers to as members of the PayPal Mafia include:\n\n"}

Different types of religious names may be in use among clergy of a religion, as well in some cases among the laity.\n\nIn baptism, Catholics are given a Christian name, which should not be \"foreign to Christian sentiment\" and is often the name of a saint. In East Asia, in Africa and elsewhere, the baptismal name is distinct from the traditional-style given name.\n\nIn some countries, it is common to adopt a confirmation name, in addition to the baptismal name.\n\nIn some religious institutes, a new member takes a religious name. In Italian, a religious figure is often referred to by their religious name and by their secular name or their \"\" name. A newly elected Pope also takes on a new name, called his regnal name or papal name.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church converts often take a new name at the time of their reception into the church, either by baptism or chrismation. A person's religious name is always the name of a saint, who then becomes that person's patron saint. When deciding on a name for their child, Orthodox parents will often name the child after a saint whose feast day falls on either the day of the child's birth or the day of its baptism. Traditionally, Orthodox Christians celebrate their \"name day\" (i.e., the feast day of their patron saint), rather than their birthday.\n\nOrthodox monks and nuns are often given a new monastic name at the time of their tonsure (i.e., when they take their monastic vows). A monastic name is usually the name of a prophet or a monastic saint. Sometimes, the monastic name will begin with the same initial as the individual's baptismal name.\n\nConverts to Judaism take a Hebrew name upon conversion. Born Jews generally have a patronymic Hebrew name which is used for religious purposes; this is frequently different from their legal name, especially when the latter is of gentile or non-Hebrew origin.\n\nMany Buddhist sects also practice this, with newly ordained sangha often given new names by their master. Lay Buddhists are also given Dharma names during their refuge ceremony.\n\nMembers of ISKCON and some other Gaudiya Vaishnava organisations are given a \"spiritual name\" by their guru upon initiation. This name ends in \"Das\" or \"Dasa\" for men and \"Dasi\" for women (meaning \"servant\"), and generally begins with the same letter as the devotee's given name.\n\nIn Wicca, a craft name is often used.\n\nIt is usual for a Discordian Episkopos to adopt a faux-mystical and bizarre name for the duration of the Episkoposity; such names are not immutable and are frequently adapted over time.

Helen McCullough claims that they were selected because they all had distinctive personal styles in a time of homogeneity, and that by aligning them in his commentary with the six major styles of Han Dynasty poetry, Tsurayuki was showing off his knowledge of those sources. Thomas Lammare also believes that Tsurayuki picked these poets to match the six Han styles, and focuses more on how Tsurayuki claimed these styles did not properly align heart (\"kokoro\" 心) and words (\"kotoba\" 言葉).\n\nThe concept of the \"rokkasen\" had a lasting legacy on poetic scholarship both in the pre-modern and modern periods.\n\nIn 1009–1011, Fujiwara no Kintō compiled an expanded list known as the Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry, which came to supplant this list of six. This led to the creation of similar lists based on this pattern, such as the \"Thirty-Six Court Lady Immortals of Poetry,\" and the \"Thirty-Six Heian-period Immortals of Poetry.\"\n\nMany Japanese scholars of the twentieth century conceptualized the history of \"waka\" poetry in the ninth century as a time when it was overshadowed by Chinese poetry in the first part of the century and then returned to prominence by the end of the century. These narratives held that this time was a transitional period between the \"waka\" anthologies \"Man'yōshū\" and \"Kokin wakashū\". When discussing the \"waka\" poetry of this period, some scholars have referred to it as the Rokkasen Period (六歌仙時代 \"rokkasen jidai\"), although there has been disagreement on when this period starts. Most of the scholars agree that it ends with the reign of Emepror Kōkō, but disagree on whether it begins with Emperor Ninmyō or Emperor Montoku. Both Hidehito Nishiyama and Ryōji Shimada conclude that they believe Ninmyō is the better choice for the start of this periodization.\n\nAdditionally, all but one of the Rokkasen, Ōtomo Kuronushi, appear in the famous collection of poetry, \"Hyakunin isshū\".\n\nThirty-Six Immortals of Poetry\n\nKokin Wakashū\n"}

These arms are used by the Queen in her official capacity as monarch of the United Kingdom. Variants of the Royal Arms are used by other members of the British royal family; and by the British government in connection with the administration and government of the country. In Scotland, there exists a separate version of the Royal Arms, a variant of which is used by the Scotland Office. The arms in banner form serve as basis for the monarch's official flag, known as the \"Royal Standard\".\n\nIn the standard variant used outside of Scotland, the shield is quartered, depicting in the first and fourth quarters the three passant guardant lions of England; in the second, the rampant lion and double tressure flory-counterflory of Scotland; and in the third, a harp for Ireland. The crest is a statant guardant lion wearing the St Edward's Crown, himself on another representation of that crown. The dexter supporter is a likewise crowned English lion; the sinister, a Scottish unicorn. According to legend a free unicorn was considered a very dangerous beast; therefore the heraldic unicorn is chained, as were both supporting unicorns in the royal coat of arms of Scotland.\n\nIn the greenery below, a thistle, Tudor rose and shamrock are depicted, representing Scotland, England and Ireland respectively. This armorial achievement comprises the motto, in French, of English monarchs, \"Dieu et mon Droit\" (God and my Right), which has descended to the present royal family as well as the Garter circlet which surrounds the shield, inscribed with the Order's motto, \"Honi soit qui mal y pense\" (Shame on him who thinks evil).\nThe official blazon of the Royal Arms is:\n\nThe Royal Arms as shown above may only be used by the Queen herself. They also appear in courtrooms, since the monarch is deemed to be the fount of judicial authority in the United Kingdom and law courts comprise part of the ancient royal court (thus so named). Judges are officially Crown representatives, demonstrated by the display of the Royal Arms behind the judge's bench in all UK courts (with the exceptions of the magistrates' court in the City of London, where behind the Justices of the Peace stands a sword upright flanked by the arms of the City and the Crown). In Northern Ireland, the Royal Arms cannot be displayed in courtrooms or on court-house exteriors. There are a few exceptions, with the Royal Arms allowed to be displayed in the courtrooms of the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast and the courts in Armagh, Banbridge, Downpatrick, Magherafelt, or Omagh. They may be shown on the exterior of court buildings that had them in place prior to the 2002 law.\n\nAs the United Kingdom is governed in the monarch's name, the British Government also uses the Royal Arms as a national symbol of the United Kingdom, and, in that capacity, the coat of arms can be seen on several government documents and forms, passports, in the entrance to embassies and consulates, etc. However, when used by the government and not by the monarch personally, the coat of arms is often represented without the helm. This is also the case with the sovereign's Scottish arms, a version of which is used by the Scotland Office.\n\nThe Royal Arms have regularly appeared on the coinage produced by the Royal Mint including, for example, from 1663, the Guinea and, from 1983, the British one pound coin. In 2008, a new series of designs for all seven coins of £1 and below was unveiled by the Royal Mint, every one of which is drawn from the Royal Arms. The full Royal Arms appear on the one pound coin, and sections appear on each of the other six, such that they can be put together like a puzzle to make another complete representation of the Royal Arms.\n\nThe monarch grants Royal Warrants to select businesses and tradespeople which supply the Royal Household with goods or services. This entitles those businesses to display the Royal Arms on their packaging and stationery by way of advertising.\n\nIt is customary (but not mandatory) for churches throughout the United Kingdom whether in the Church of England or the Church of Scotland to display the Royal Arms to show loyalty to the Crown.\n\nA banner of the Royal Arms, known as the Royal Standard, is flown from the royal palaces when the monarch is in residence, Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace being her principal abodes; and from public buildings only when the monarch is present. This protocol equally applies to the monarch's principal residences in Scotland (the Palace of Holyroodhouse and Balmoral Castle), where the Royal Standard (Scottish version) is flown. When the monarch is not in residence the Union Flag, or in Scotland the ancient Royal Standard of Scotland, is flown.\n\nThe widely sold British newspaper \"The Times\" uses the Hanoverian Royal Arms as a logo, whereas its sister publication, \"The Sunday Times\", displays the current Royal Arms.\n\nThe Royal Arms are also displayed in all courts in British Columbia, as well as in other Canadian provinces such as Ontario, where the judges are appointed by Crown authority.\n\nThe Royal Arms were also displayed by all Viceroys of Australia as representation of their Crown authority.\n\nThe Royal Arms are also used and displayed in the Supreme Courts of South Australia and Victoria.\n\nThe Royal Arms are also the coat of arms for the Western Australian Legislative Council.\n\nThe Royal Arms were controversially used by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her official letterhead from .\n\nSince the Union of the Crowns in 1603, a separate version of the Royal Arms has been used in Scotland, giving the Scottish elements pride of place.\n\nThe shield is quartered, depicting in the first and fourth quarters the lion \"rampant\" of Scotland; in the second, the three lions \"passant guardant\" of England; and in the third, the harp of Ireland.\n\nThe crest atop the Crown of Scotland is a red lion, seated and forward facing, itself wearing the Crown of Scotland and holding the two remaining elements of the Honours of Scotland, namely the Sword of State and the Sceptre of Scotland. This was also the crest used in the Royal Arms of the Kingdom of Scotland. The motto, in Scots, appears above the crest, in the tradition of Scottish heraldry, and is an abbreviated form of the full motto: \"In My Defens God Me Defend\".\n\nThe supporters change sides and both appear wearing the crowns of their respective Kingdom. The dexter supporter is a crowned and chained unicorn, symbolising Scotland. The sinister supporter is a crowned lion, symbolising England. Between each supporter and the shield is a lance displaying the flag of their respective Kingdom.\n\nThe coat also features both the motto \"Nemo me impune lacessit\" (No one wounds (touches) me with impunity) and, surrounding the shield, the collar of the Order of the Thistle. On the compartment are a number of thistles, Scotland's national flower.\n\nUnlike the Acts of Union 1707 with Scotland, the Acts of Union 1800 with Ireland did not provide for a separate Irish version of the royal arms. The crest of the Kingdom of Ireland (\"on a wreath Or and Azure, a tower triple-towered of the First, from the portal a hart springing Argent attired and unguled Or\") has had little or no official use since the union. When the Irish Free State established its own seals in the 1930s, the \"Fob Seal\" used on letters of credence varied the British arms by having the harp in two quarters.\n\nThe harp quarter of the Royal Arms represents Ireland on both the English and Scottish versions. Likewise, one English quarter is retained in the Scottish version, and one Scottish quarter is retained in the English version. Thus, England, Scotland and Ireland are represented in all versions of the Royal Arms since they came under one monarch.\nBy contrast, there is no representation at all for Wales in the Royal Arms, as at the Act of Union 1707 Wales was an integral part of the Kingdom of England pursuant to the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542; thus, it has been argued Wales is represented in the English coat of arms. However the argument is somewhat disengenuous as in 1535 the Welsh Dragon was already part of the Tudor Coat of Arms. Upon the accession of the Tudor monarchs, who were themselves of Welsh descent, a Welsh Dragon was used as a supporter on the Royal Arms. This was dropped by their successors, the Scottish House of Stuart, who replaced the Tudors' dragon supporter with the Scottish unicorn\nIn the 20th century, the arms of the principality of Wales were added as an inescutcheon to the coat of arms of the Prince of Wales, and a banner of those arms with a green inescutcheon bearing the prince's crown is flown as his personal standard in Wales. The so-called Prince of Wales's feathers are a heraldic badge rather than a coat of arms upon a shield, but they are not Welsh in any case. They derive, in fact, from the English Princes of Wales (who may owe them to an exploit of Edward, the Black Prince at the Battle of Crécy) and carry the motto \"\" (German, \"I Serve\"). In any event, they do not form part of the Royal Arms, as opposed to the heraldic achievement of the Prince of Wales, who drops them upon his accession as King.\n\nThe current royal arms are a combination of the arms of the former kingdoms that make up the United Kingdom, and can be traced back to the first arms of the kings of England and kings of Scotland. Various alterations occurred over the years as the arms of other realms acquired or claimed by the kings were added to the royal arms. The table below tracks the changes in the royal arms from the original arms of King Richard I of England, and William I, King of Scots.\n\nMembers of the British royal family are granted their own personal arms which are based on the Royal Arms. Only children and grandchildren in the male line of the monarch are entitled to arms in this fashion: the arms of children of the monarch are differenced with a three-point label; grandchildren of the monarch are differenced with a five-point label. An exception is made for the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, who bears a three-point label. Since 1911, the arms of the Prince of Wales also displays an inescutcheon of the ancient arms of the Principality of Wales. \nQueens consort and the wives of sons of the monarch also have their own personal coat of arms. Typically this will be the arms of their husband impaled with their own personal arms or those of their father, if armigerous. However, the consorts of a Queen regnant are not entitled to use the Royal Arms. Thus Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh has been granted his own personal arms.\n\nCurrently the following members of the royal family have their own arms based on the Royal Arms:\n\nVarious versions of the Royal Arms are used by Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, the Parliament of the United Kingdom and courts in some parts of the Commonwealth.\n\nHM Government generally uses a simplified version of the Royal Arms with a crown replacing the helm and crest, and with no compartment. In relation to Scotland, the Scotland Office and the Advocate General for Scotland use the Scottish version, again without the helm or crest, and the same was used as the day-to-day logo of the Scottish Executive until September 2007, when a rebranding exercise introduced the name \"Scottish Government\", together with a revised logo incorporating the flag of Scotland.\n\nThe Scottish Government continues to use the Arms on some official documents.\n\nThe simplified Royal Arms also feature:\n\n\nVarious courts in the Commonwealth also continue to use the Royal Arms:\n\n\nFurthermore:\n\nThis table breaks down the official blazons to enable comparison of the differences between the general coat and the coat used in Scotland.\n\n\nOf all the former Dominions only three retain elements from the British Coat of Arms:\n\n\nIreland uses the medieval arms of Ireland that are incorporated into the British Coat of Arms:\n\nAll other former Dominions have changed their coat of arms with little or no British influence:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "723799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=723799", "title": "Sanat Kumara", "text": "Sanat Kumara\n\nAccording to the post-1900 publications of Theosophy, Lord Sunat Kumara is an \"Advanced Being\" at the Ninth level of initiation who is regarded as the 'Lord' or 'Regent' of Earth and of the humanity, and is thought to be the head of the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth who dwells in Shamballah (also known as 'The City of Enoch').\n\nShamballah is said by the adherents to the Ascended Master Teachings, to be a floating city manifested on the etheric plane somewhere above the Gobi Desert in the borderlands of Mongolia.\n\nThe Great White Brotherhood is a spiritual 'fraternity' of Ascended Beings, including Lord Sunat Kumara, long since dedicated to the eventual Salvation of Mankind and the establishment of Divine Law again in this Three-dimensional reality.\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Van Buren, the Brotherhood once maintained (earthly) headquarters hidden in a remote valley near a sacred lake in old Tibet, until relatively recently, when, possibly due to the surmised threat of Communist China, they withdrew, allegedly through subterranean tunnels to an alternative earthly location in Peru, where they are still reported as having an earth base (circa 1985).\n\nThese authors believe that Lord Sunat Kumara is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, composed of Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (called in the Ascended Master Teachings Ascended Masters) and volunteers from other worlds who have joined together to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.\n\nSanat Kumara appears as a rishi in the Hindu religious text the Chandogya Upanishad. A shrine to Sanat Kumara which attracts and unites people of all religions and faiths is situated in the town of Kataragama, Sri Lanka. In Sanskrit, \"Sanat Kumara\" is \"Eternal Youth\" (from Sanat \"eternal\", Ku \"with difficulty\" and Mara \"mortal\").\n\nThe Kumar resides in the most sublime center of our planet, Shamballa, the sahasrara of the world. The Kumara has several names, relating to the sahasrara centers of different Systemic Existences: At the Supra-Cosmic plane, he is called \"Sanatana\"; at the Cosmic plane, it is \"Subrahmanya\"; at the Solar plane, the Kumara is \"Sanaka\"; at the Planetary plane, it is \"Sanandana\"; and on this planet, it is \"Sanath\" Kumara. So Sanath Kumara is an aspect of Kumara that resides in Shamballa.\n\nScriptures, especially the Mahabharata, say that it is Sanath Kumara who comes down to help the Divine Plan of Creation, when Lord Krishna came to be. He was born to Lord Krishna as his son, and he was named Pradyumna. Sanath Kumara incarnates himself through the Divine Mother Rukmini as Pradyumna. On completion of his work, He again gets back to his original position and takes to the seat in Shambala as Sanath Kumara. These details are given in the last chapters of Mahabharata.\n\n\"Shambhala\" (Tib. \"bde 'byung\") in Vajrayana Buddhism (the religion of Tibet) is a Sanskrit term meaning \"place of peace/tranquility/happiness\". Gautama Buddha is said by Vajrayana Buddhists to have taught the Kalachakra tantra on request of King Suchandra of Shambhala; the teachings are also said to be preserved in Shamballa. The Stanzas of Dzyan from which Madame Blavatsky claimed to have gotten the information in The Secret Doctrine are believed by some scholars to have been a mistranslation of words \"Kalachakra tantra\" (\"rGyud-sde\" in Tibetan). Shambhala is ruled over by a line of Kings of Shambhala known as Kulika or Kalki Kings (Tib. \"Rigden\"), a monarch who upholds the integrity of the \"Kalachakra tantra\". In the teachings of Vajrayana Buddhism, the King of Shamballa is often metaphorically referred to as \"The King of the World\". Shamballa was thought by the Tibetans to be somewhere north of Lake Manasarovar and its adjacent Mount Kailasa, a sacred mountain in Tibet where it is thought that all the dragon currents intersect.\n\nThe ancient Buddhist temple, Kurama-dera in Japan, is host to a unique bodhisattva, the \"Defender Lord\", who is said to come from the planet Venus 6.5 million years ago. He is described as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy.\n\nSanat Kumara was mentioned briefly by the theosophist Helena Blavatsky. She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the \"Lords of the Flame\", whom Christian tradition has presented as Lucifer and the fallen angels.\n\nSanat Kumara gained greater prominence when Blavatsky's close-friend and colleague Charles W. Leadbeater wrote that Sanat Kumara was the \"King\" or \"Lord of the World\", and the head of the Great White Brotherhood of Mahatmas who had revealed the principles of theosophy.\n\nLater authors who draw from Theosophical teachings such as Alice Bailey and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have added to the story with further details. He is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy, said to be the incarnation of the Will of the Logos, and purportedly possesses an unaging body not born of mortal woman.\n\nC.W. Leadbeater and later adherents of Theosophy such as Alice A. Bailey believe that Sanat Kumara descended from the etheric plane of the planet Venus to Earth 18,500,000 years ago (A.E. Powell gives a figure of 16,500,000 years ago; Elizabeth Clare Prophet of Church Universal and Triumphant does not give a specific date but says it was a minimum of 2,500,000 years ago). In Theosophy, the beings that helped Sanat Kumara organize the expedition from Venus are called the \"Lords of the Flame\". C.W. Leadbeater and Annie Besant said that Sanat Kumara brought 30 \"Lords of the Flame\" with him from Venus to help him set up his colony. In the later version of the story promulgated by Guy Ballard, notable \"Lords of the Flame\" include Gautama Buddha, and the World Teacher (the being referred to alternately as Maitreya or Christ by Benjamin Creme). Elizabeth Clare Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant teaches that Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Flame also brought 144,000 souls with them from Venus. Alice Bailey, on the other hand, gives the number 105 only. The prior incarnation and only incarnation of Maitreya, the Lord of Consciousness, according to some interpretations (not C.W. Leadbeater's), is Gauthama Siddartha Sakyamuni / Lord Buddha; according to these interpretations, he essentially 'overshadowed' the body of Gautama Siddhartha Buddha with Siddhartha's permission.\n\nSanat Kumara is regarded as the great guru, saviour of Earth. Believers in him see him in all the major religions, as Skanda/Kartikkeya in Hinduism, Brahma-Sanam Kumar in Buddhism, the Ancient of Days in Judeo-Christian traditions, and identify him as Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism (although the last of these claims is contested from a lack of information on the subject). It is also considered that Sanat Kumara is Al Khdir (green man) known to Sufi Muslims (according to Dakshinamurti).\n\nIt is maintained in most of these versions of Theosophy that Venus, the 'Planet of Love', is the most spiritually advanced planet of our solar system. The beings living on the etheric plane of Venus are said to be hundreds of millions of years ahead of us in their spiritual evolution. It is said that the governing council of Venus – the \"Seven Holy Kumars\" – sent one of themselves, Sanat Kumara, here to guide us.\n\nAccording to Theosophy, once Sanat Kumara arrived here, he directed the construction of the city of Shamballa on the etheric plane above the Gobi Desert to serve as his headquarters. Elizabeth Clare Prophet teaches that Shamballa was built physically on the White Island in the Gobi Sea (now the Gobi Desert), and was only later withdrawn from the physical to the etheric plane.\n\nThe main temple of Shamballa is topped with a golden dome and is surrounded by seven smaller temples—one for each of the seven rays. These temples are located on a number of wide boulevards resembling the Champs-Elysees. According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, George Washington was divinely inspired by the Ascended Masters to choose city planner Pierre L'Enfant to create the city plan of Washington DC which, it is claimed, he unconsciously modeled on the plan of the city of Shamballa.\n\nThe most common title attributed to Lord Sanat Kumara in the Theosophical religious tradition is \"Lord of the World\". C.W. Leadbeater also states that an important duty of Sanat Kumara is to participate in an elaborate ritual every Wesak (the Full Moon of May) led by Gautama Buddha, and also participated in by the Maitreya (the being Theosophists identify as Christ), in which cosmic energy is focused from the \"Solar Logos\" to Earth in order to keep our planet's cosmic energy in balance. The ritual is said to take place in a ravine in southern Tibet (the Frontispiece of Leadbeater's book \"The Masters and the Path\" has a picture of the ritual taking place) and, it is stated by Leadbeater, can be viewed by in the etheric body or in the physical body by those who have etheric sight.\n\nParadoxically, two other common appellations of Sanat Kumara are two opposite titles: \"The Ancient of Days\" (because he has been on Earth millions of years) and \"The Youth of Sixteen Summers\" (because even though he is millions of years old, he still looks like he is 16 years old). Another of his titles is \"The One Initiator\" because it is said by C. W. Leadbeater in the \"Masters and the Path\" that he personally performs the initiation ceremony for anyone who has reached the third level of spiritual initiation. Alice A. Bailey indicates the same in her writings.\n\nIn the all organizations subscribing to the \"Ascended Master Teachings\", Sanat Kumara is presented as an Ascended Master. He is also currently, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, known as the \"Regent Lord of the World\" in deference to Gautama Buddha having taken the office of \"Lord of the World\". (1956). With Sananda Buddha taking on more of the day-to-day administrative tasks of governing the planet, this arrangement allows Sanat Kumara more time for the long-range galactic planning and interstellar diplomacy that is necessary for him to prepare Earth for its eventual admission to what Joshua David Stone calls the Galactic Confederation of Planets.\n\nSanat Kumara's symbol of the authority of his office as \"Lord of the World\" is a , magic wand called the \"Rod of Power\" made of the metal orichalcum, with cone-shaped diamonds on each end.\n\nThe Bridge to Freedom, Church Universal and Triumphant and all other \"Ascended Master Teachings\" organizations believe that Sanat Kumara has a \"Divine Complement\" (\"Twin Flame\") (i.e., a \"celestial wife\") – Lady Master Venus – the New Age \"Goddess of Love\". The Ascended \"Lady Master Venus\" is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old girl. Sanat Kumara is believed to have married Lady Master Venus millions of years ago on Venus before he came to Earth.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus have a daughter named the Lady Master Meta who they brought with them from Venus. She is said to have incarnated as an Avatar in Atlantis (where she served as the high priestess at the \"Temple of Healing\") and in Sassanian Persia, where she married a mortal and had three children. In the Ascended Master Teachings, she is revered as the \"Goddess of Healing\" and is the patron deity of doctors and nurses. Since she is immortal, possessing a celestial body like Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus, she, like the Lady Master Venus, also has the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Cha Ara \nwas originally one of the three children of Lady Master Meta when she incarnated as an Avatar in Sassanian Persia. He became a master alchemist who formulated an elixir of immortality made from rose petals, tea leaves from mcleod ganj and other ingredients. This enabled him to quickly achieve ascended masterhood. He uses small amounts of the elixir to heal people. He is the protector of all Zoroastrians. He works with St. Germain to bring about the New Age in the West Americas. Lady Master Meta’s husband and her other two children from her descent as an Avatar to Sassanian Persia have also become ascended masters but their names have not yet been revealed.\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, a group of religions based on Theosophy, Lady Master Nada is the \"Chohan of the Sixth Ray\" (see Seven Rays), and is the Ascended Lady Master governing humanity's development of the Divine Qualities of Ministration, Service, and Peace. The colors of her Ray are purple and gold, and also ruby.\n\nShe is also considered a Member of the Karmic Board; she handles the appeals of those on the third ray. She is believed by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to have succeeded the previous Chohan, the Master Jesus / Sananda Buddha, on January 1, 1956, when she is said to have fully taken on the Office of Chohan of the Sixth Ray., thus advancing from the fifth to the sixth level of initiation. She primarily serves at \"Arabian Retreat\" in the Arabian Peninsula, northeast of the Red Sea. Nada serves there with the Brothers and Sisters of the Indigo Cape, as well as with Jesus, his Mother Mary and El Samyam, the Chief of the Arabian Council. She also serves at \"The Rose Temple\", located on the etheric plane above New Bedford, Massachusetts. Designed after the pattern of a rose, with each \"petal\" being a room, this Retreat is the etheric counterpart of the \"Temple of Love\" on Atlantis where Nada once served as a High Priestess. In another human incarnate life in Atlantis, she was a lawyer. She was described as having raised her body and Ascended approximately 2,776 years ago.\n\nAlthough the Lady Master Nada's home residence (called in the Ascended Master Teachings her \"retreat\") is underground on the etheric plane on the Arabian peninsula, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, she teleports to Shamballa every workday to her day job on the Karmic Board, hearing the cases of those souls who are on the third ray.\n\nAccording to the \"I AM\" Activity, the Church Universal and Triumphant and others, the Ascended Masters (The great beings the original Theosophists called the \"Masters of the Ancient Wisdom\"), such as the Master Jesus, Saint Germain, Megha Alcorn aka Megan Sebastian on Earth, Kuthumi, Hatton, Gopal Das and others are working for the Spiritual Hierarchy of our planet, under the leadership of Lord Sanat Kumara, Gautama Buddha, and Maitreya. Many theosophists believe the \"Masters\" utilize the cosmic power of the Seven Rays to advance the \"Plan of the Masters\" to encourage the continual advance of civilization on Earth toward higher levels of consciousness. One of the beliefs of adherents of these belief systems is that the Masters of Wisdom have united together in an organization called the \"Great White Brotherhood\".\n\nThe Theosophist A.E. Powell stated that Sanat Kumara (whom he refers to as the \"Lord of the World\") is in continuous telepathic rapport with ANNA / Gaia, the \"Spirit of the Earth\" (i.e., the \"Planetary Logos\" – equivalent to the goddess known in some religions as Gaia or as Prithivi in Hinduism).C.W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey stated that Sanat Kumara is in continuous telepathic rapport with the Solar Logos (the Being considered by Theosophists as the consciousness of the Sun). It is believed in Theosophy that Sanat Kumara captures the mystical power of the Seven Rays from the Solar Logos and distributes it to his assistants who guide the spiritual evolution of humanity, the \"Masters of the Ancient Wisdom\" (the Ascended Masters), who then focus the power to us. An intermediate trinity of Pratyeka-Buddhas assists Lord Buddha in stepping down this power from Sanat Kumara to Earth's Spiritual Hierarchy, and these Buddhas are also said to be Kumars originally from Venus.\n\nAccording to the \"Alice A. Bailey material\", Lord Sanat Kumara conducts business in an enormous room in his palace called \"The Council Chamber of the Lord of the World\". It is here that he regularly meets with Maitreya, the Maha Chohan, Djwal Khul, St. Germain, the Master Jesus and the other Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, of which it is said there are 24 principal council members, to assess the progress being made in implementing \"The Plan of the Masters\" to bring the human race to higher levels of consciousness. According to C.W. Leadbeater, it is also here that he periodically personally receives ambassadors from other solar systems.\n\nAccording to the \"Alice A. Bailey material\", Sanat Kumara has many assistants who help him in his arduous task of spiritually governing Earth as its presiding Regent. \nThese include The Watcher (also called the \"Silent Watcher\" or the \"Great Silent Watcher\"), whose function it is to continually watch the Akashic records and download daily all the information on them relevant to the life waves of Earth and forward it to the \"Custodian of the Hall of Records\". (the Watcher is part of a special race of beings who fulfill this function that are posted on planets throughout the Cosmos ); the Lords of Karma – Alice A. Bailey mentioned three \"Lords of Karma\" but did not name them; they are called in the Ascended Master Teachings the Karmic Board and they are stated to number seven and each of them is identified by name: The Great Divine Director (1st ray), The Goddess of Liberty (2nd ray), Lady Master Nada (3rd ray), Cyclopea (4th ray), Pallas Athena (5th ray), Lady Master Portia (6th ray), and Kwan Yin (7th ray). The Karmic Board decides when souls that are between lives are to reincarnate again (if a disembodied soul desires to reincarnate somewhere or somewhen else than where they have been assigned, they must file an appeal with the Karmic Board—each person has to file an appeal to the member of the board that handles the appeals for their \"soul ray\"); and the one Alice A. Bailey calls the Custodian of the Hall of Records (called the Keeper of the Scrolls in the Ascended Master Teachings), the being who is in charge of the \"Hall of Records\", an enormous administrative complex near Sanat Kumara’s palace in the etheric city of Shamballa—this is where the \"Recording Angels\" and those souls who are between incarnations who volunteer to give up their time in Summerland and help perform this work make visual records (utilizing the most advanced supercomputers on the etheric plane of Earth) of everything that happens in everyone’s lives on Earth. The raw data is first downloaded daily by \"The Watcher\" from the Akashic records and fed by him to the \"Custodian of the Hall of Records\" and thence forwarded to the \"recording angels\" and their volunteer helpers. These imprint records are sorted daily first into one of seven general files by the \"soul ray\" (see seven rays) of the soul that is reincarnating, and then downloaded from that general file into a special individual file for each soul that can be consulted by the \"Karmic Board\" if that soul makes an appeal before it.\n\nOmri-Tas, the \"Ruler of the Violet Planet\", is a Galactic level Ascended Master (Spiritual Hierarchy, Cosmic Beings) who with his celestial mate, Irmo-Sat, , is Sanat Kumara's violet flame supplier. The violet flame is composed of a special type of etheric matter particles, which may plausibly be called \"violetrons\", that are capable of cleansing bad karma. \"Omri-Tas\" rules a planet on the etheric plane called the Violet Planet, which is apparently several dozen to several hundred light years from Earth. The Violet Planet is one of many throughout the Cosmos that serve as reservoirs for the violet flame. Omri-Tas is the ruler of the Violet Planet that is closest to Earth and which is responsible for transmitting the violet flame from the Great Central Sun of the Cosmos via the Galactic Logos to planets in Ursa Major (Our sector is reputedly 'Sector Nine' of the 48 Sectors in this spiral Galaxy). Omri-Tas or one of his representatives periodically teleports from the Violet Planet to Shamballa with canisters of violet flame to replenish the violet flame in the large circular pool in the \"Temple of the Violet Flame\" in Shamballa (In return for the violet flame. Lord Sanat Kumara assigns to his care and tutelage worthy initiated Adepts/Chelas for etheric transport to their next assignments.\n\nBenjamin Creme subscribes to the modern esoteric view that Nordic aliens (like those mentioned by George Adamski – Creme accepts Adamski's sightings as valid.) pilot flying saucers from the Way-Station on Venus that is thought to exist on the etheric plane (Esotericists believe that since the Venusians' civilization is on the \"etheric plane\", the planet's heat doesn't affect them) and are capable of stepping down the level of vibration of themselves and their craft to the slower level of vibration of the atoms of the physical plane. Thus, Creme's followers assume that Sanat Kumara and the 'Lords of the Flame' [See Elizabeth Van Buren's Book of the same name.](Nordic aliens themselves) visit from Venus in a flying saucer. How, they ask, did Sanat Kumara get to Earth from Venus if it wasn't on a flying saucer? Creme's disciples believe that there is regular flying saucer traffic between Venus and Shamballa as well as other locations on Earth, especially areas where crop circles appear. Creme's acolytes believe that Shamballa is equipped with an astrodrome as well as with numerous flying saucer landing pads attached to the tops or the sides of the buildings to accommodate the heavy flying saucer traffic from Venus. Since Shamballa is envisioned as a floating city about five miles above the surface of the earth on the etheric plane, there are also numerous entrances in the basements of the buildings, where flying saucers can enter from the bottom of the city and park in spacious flying saucer parking garages provided in the basement levels of the buildings. In addition, says Creme, the Venusians have cigar-shaped mother ships up to four miles long to accommodate the transport of multiple individual flying saucers to and from Venus. According to Creme, sometimes flying saucers from places more distant than Venus, such as from Mars, the Moons of Jupiter, Uranus, Sirius, the Pleiades, and beyond, fly in to pay a visit at Shamballa. Since, according to Creme, the Venusians flying saucer designers outsource the actual construction of their flying saucers to the Martians (who are said to dwell on the etheric plane of Mars), whom he describes as the \"master engineers of the solar system\", Shamballa provides a convenient neutral ground where the Venusians and the Martians can meet to evaluate new flying saucer designs and negotiate flying saucer construction contracts between themselves.\n\nThe Master Ashtar was first incorporated into the Ascended Master Teachings by Joshua David Stone in the early 1990s, based on his incorporation of the early 1980s revelations of the medium Tuella into his own teachings. Stone had already begun teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of Tuella, that the Master Jesus, under his galactic name Sananda (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after his resurrection), works with Commander Ashtar, flying with Pallas Athena in their own flying saucer within the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet as its \"Commander-in-Chief\". According to Stone, another name used by \"Commander Ashtar\" to denote his flying saucer fleet is \"The Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood\". Although the Ashtar Command is ultimately under the titular authority of Sanat Kumara, the Master Jesus in consultation with Pallas Athena and Ashtar, make all the day to day command decisions. Stone continued to present these teachings after 1996 at the yearly Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings.\n\nAccording to some, The Ashtar Command is simply a modern concept of the Sumerian/Babylonian goddess and deity Astarte/Ishtar/Isis and her entourage whose assigned function is to protect an evolving mankind from the Satanic forces, then extant, on this planet, that sought to usurp the Earthly Regency of the local Ascended Masters in their role of protecting and engendering Divine Law upon the Earth until the arrival, at 'The Meridian of Time' of 'The Son of God'... Jesus/Sananda and his incarnation of 'The Christ Being'.\n\nLourene Altiery, also known as \"Karita\" to her followers, is an Ascended Master Teachings teacher originally from Joliet, Illinois who now resides in Sun Lakes, Arizona – she set up her website in 2001. According to Altiery, there are four Masters originally from the Spiritual Hierarchy Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet who are now permanently stationed on Shamballa. These are the Masters Ballerian, who is the proprietor of a flying saucer repair facility in Shamballa called \"God's Garage\"; Kumad, an expert linguist who helps the Keeper of the Scrolls decipher and interpret ancient manuscripts; Ashlem, a Tibetan Master who resides at the Hall of Records and helps people decipher their past lives by assisting them in accessing the Akashic records; and Sutko, the \"space detective\", who helps the Master K-17 solve unusually difficult cases. Elements of the \"Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet\" sometimes dock at Shamballa so the flying saucer crews can go on 'shore leave'.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings of Anne Bellringer of Rapid City, South Dakota, who began teaching in 1990, Hatonn, an android Pleiadean Master who flies aboard the flying saucer \"Phoenix\" (one of the flying saucers of the \"Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet\", piloted by Hatonn’s partner the Master Soltec), monitors events on Earth for the \"Galactic Hall of Records\" at the galactic core.\n\nHe feeds information about events on Earth via subspace relay to the supercomputers at the \"Galactic Hall of Records\". However, Bellringer says that this activity is secondary to Hatonn's primary task, which is functioning as the liaison officer between Sanat Kumara and the Pleiadeans in order for him to be able to help Earth safely navigate in 2012 through the approaching so-called \"photon belt\", said to emanate from the Pleiades.\n\nAccording to many Christians, notably the anti-New Age author Constance Cumbey, New Age Leaders, including Masters of the Illuminati, are actually worshipping the Lord of this World, whose name is Sanat Kumara (Alice Bailey, \"Externalisation of the Hierarchy\", p. 676, 709, 725; and Elizabeth Van Buren, \"The Secret of the Illuminati\", p. 1). Bailey goes on to explain that Sanat Kumara is the \"life and the forming intelligence\", presiding over the Council of Shamballa [the Heaven of Earth according to New Age doctrine]. (\"The New Age Dictionary\", p. 172) Further, Sanat Kumara is \"the eternal youth from the Planet Venus\". The name Lucifer is one of the ancient Greek names for Venus. Therefore, according to Cumbey, Sanat Kumara is merely another name for Satan or Lucifer. (Cumbey, \"Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow\") [7].\n\nOther New Age leaders have tried to separate themselves from the Illuminati movement, and view that burdening the two groups as entirely coexistent is inaccurate and ineffectual. New Age theosophy also counters these critics, teaching the fact that the being known as Sanat Kumara would rather see spiritual harmony and peace, a fact which many Illuminati members ignore and abuse.\n\nIn the glossary of in the back of the book \"Alchemy\", which Elizabeth Clare Prophet claims was dictated to her by Kuthumi, Satan and Sanat Kumara are clearly distinguished as two different and opposed beings—Satan working for evil and Sanat Kumara for good.\n\nThe scholar K. Paul Johnson maintains that the \"Masters\" that Madame Blavatsky wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her mentors. However, \"Sanat Kumara\", although mentioned in passing by Madame Blavatsky, was never mentioned by her as an important \"Master\" that Blavatsky claimed to have met. He was first presented, under the name \"Lord of the World\", as the head of the \"Masters\" by C.W. Leadbeater in his 1925 book \"The Masters and the Path\".\n\nPanelology\nVideo games\n\n\n\n"}

It debrands the traditional Coke logo, replacing \"Coca-Cola\" from one side of a bottle with the phrase \"Share a Coke with\" followed by a person's name. The campaign, which uses a list containing 250 of the country's most popular names (generic nicknames and titles are also used in some cases), aims to have people go out and find a bottle with their name on it, then share it with their friends. The campaign began in Australia in 2011.\n\nThe Share a Coke campaign was subsequently rolled out in over 80 countries. In Australia, the advertising agency, Ogilvy have estimated that the campaign increased Coke's share of the category by 4% and increased consumption by young adults by 7%. The campaign received multiple awards at the Creative Effectiveness Lion Awards at Cannes.\n\nIn the United States, where the campaign is credited with increasing sales by more than 2% and according to a piece by \"The Atlantic\" writer Kalle Oskari Mattila, said to have reversed more than 10 years of decline in Coke consumption, the company and its agency has sought ways to extend the campaign while maintaining its relevance. In 2015, the company extended the campaign by increasing the number of names to 1,000. Nicknames such as \"bro\", \"better half\" and \"sidekick\" were also added to the inventory of names. In 2016, the company replaced people's names with lyrics from 70 popular songs including \"Lean on Me\" and \"We are the Champions\". In 2017, the campaign returned to the US with a new variant; holiday destinations. Bottles of coke are labelled with favourite summer holiday spots such as Hawaii, Ibiza, Barbados etc. Additionally, Coca-Cola collaborated with Fitzco//Mccann and Score a Score to create over 1000 unique songs based on names found on bottles of Coke. \n\nFinancial analysts and advertising experts have used the success of the 'Share-a-Coke' campaign to remind marketers and advertisers of the need to personalise the communications message.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52406994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52406994", "title": "She-wolf (Roman mythology)", "text": "She-wolf (Roman mythology)\n\nIn the Roman foundation myth, it was a she-wolf that nursed and sheltered the twins Romulus and Remus after they were abandoned in the wild by order of King Amulius of Alba Longa. She cared for the infants at her den, a cave known as the Lupercal, until they were discovered by a shepherd, Faustulus. Romulus would later become the founder and first king of Rome. The image of the she-wolf suckling the twins has been a symbol of Rome since ancient times and is one of the most recognizable icons of ancient mythology.\n\nThere is evidence that the wolf held a special place in the world of the ancient inhabitants of Italy. One legend claims that the Hirpini people were so-called because, when they set out to found their first colony, they were led to its location by a wolf (from the Sabine word for wolf: \"hirpus\"). The tale of the Lupercal is central to that of the twins, and probably predates theirs. To the Roman god Mars the wolf is a sacred animal. There is an ongoing debate about a connection to the ancient Roman festival of the Lupercalia.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Apollo's mother Leto is reported to have given birth to him as a she-wolf, to evade Hera.\n\nThe 3 \"canonical\" versions of the myth--those of Livy, Plutarch and Dionysius of Halicarnassus--all draw heavily on Quintus Fabius Pictor. He is considered one of Rome's earliest historians and his now lost work describes the she-wolf and her episode with the twins. The twins were abandoned at the order of Amulius. Some tales claim that they were to be left along the riverbank, others that they were to be cast into the water. The servant charged with the task either thought better of it, or could not get close enough to do the deed because of the flooding. Instead, he left them in the standing water that had formed at the foot of Palatine Hill. The twins were found either after their basket had been left at the foot of the fig tree, or came to rest there after floating in the water. In each case, the she-wolf rescued them and gently cared for them in or near the Lupercal. Later, they were discovered by local shepherds.\n\nDionysius reports that rains had raised the water level such that when Amulius' servant arrived at the appointed spot (around a dozen miles from Alba Longa), they left the twins in the floodwaters because they couldn't go any further. The basket they were in floated along until the waters receded and it struck a stone, tossing them out into the mud. The she-wolf arrived and lowered her teats to the crying babes and licked them clean of the mud.\n\nAfter a shepherd happened upon the scene in the course of tending his flock, he ran to tell his companions, and a group gathered to witness the remarkable sight. The twins were clinging to her as she was their true mother. The she-wolf was nonplussed when the men began making a ruckus to scare her off. She withdrew into a cave that was sacred to the Greek colonists who had formerly lived in the area and held an altar to the nature god Pan.\n\nLivy claims that the servants of Amulius dropped the twins in the standing water out of simple laziness. The fig tree just happened to be the first spot they came to and they figured the twins would drown no matter what. The twins cried in their basket until the waters receded and left them back on land. The she-wolf arrived from the hills looking for a drink of water when she heard their cries.\n\nThe servant was too afraid of the torrential waters to fully carry out the king's orders, according to Plutarch. After being left on the bank, the waters rose further and swept the twins away. It gently carried them along and then dropped them at the fig tree.\n\nThe three relay accounts wherein the term \"lupa\" refers not to a she-wolf, but is a slang word for prostitute. Plutarch tells two other stories not involving the she-wolf or abandonment. In one, the twins are fathered by Hercules after he wins a dice game. Their mother is the unwitting \"prize\". In another, the twins are switched at birth by their grandfather for a different pair of infants and secreted out of the city to be raised by shepherds and later, educated in nearby Gabii.\n\nThe \"Bolsena Mirror\" features a depiction of the she-wolf and the twins surrounded by human and animal figures. Differences in interpretation have precluded virtually any consensus regarding many of its features. This includes its age. However, it is consistent with other such mirrors, made as bridal gifts, in 4th century BC Euritria, perhaps circa 330-340. The famous Capitoline Wolf may be of Etruscan or Old Latin origin. But, a discovery during its restoration in 2000 and radiocarbon dating has cast doubt on an ancient origin. A stele from Bologna, dated to between 350-400 BC, depicts an animal, possibly a wolf, nursing a single infant. By 269 BC, the silver didrachm is the earliest depiction of the complete icon, with the characteristic \"turning of the she-wolf's head\" backward and downward at the twins.\n\nThe distinctive imagery of the she-wolf and the twins made it more recognizable than other symbols of the city, such as Roma, the patron deity of the city, or the Roman eagle. That was useful as the Roman world expanded and symbols of Rome became more important in maintaining unity. By the 1st century AD, the she-wolf was common in both Rome and the provinces. She and the twins were featured on the elaborate Ara Pacis, built in honor of Augustus and dedicated to Pax, the goddess of peace.\n\nCoins with their depiction were minted and widely circulated. They were also produced in Roman Colonies as a way to express their own \"Roman-ness\". They have been found on personal items such as swords, buckles, lamps and statuettes as well as monuments, mosaic floors and funerary stones that date from the 1st through the 3rd centuries AD.\n\nThe Franks Casket, an ornately carved, Anglo-Saxon chest from the 8th–9th century, probably crafted in a monastery in Northern France, features the she-wolf and twins, along with a Runic account of the lupercal. Other Anglo-Saxon artifacts and coins from the same period also feature them. The Byzantines continued to use the image, and coins attributed to them have been found in various locations in central Asia at sites located in modern Tadjikistan and Uzbekistan along with an 8th-century Sogdian painted mural with a she-wolf, head turned back and down, suckling two infants.\n\nThe Italian football clubs A.S. Roma and S.S. Robur Siena use the imagery in their respective team logos.\n\nThe Fascist government of Benito Mussolini made use of the she-wolf while in power.\n\nThe Sienese have a traditional tale that the city was founded by Senius and Aschius, another pair of twins who were also suckled by a she-wolf. They were the sons of Remus and fled Rome after his death at the hands of their uncle Romulus. The legend cannot be attested to prior to the Renaissance. However, depictions of a she-wolf and twins are common in the city and some can be dated earlier.\nThe she-wolf and twins appeared on what may have been the earliest silver coin ever minted in Rome.\nThe Lupercalia was a very ancient festival even during Roman times. Roman historians speculated as to its origins. It may be associated with the god Lupercus, the god of shepherds and protector of flocks. Some historians link it to the she-wolf and the Lupercal.\n\n"}
{"id": "914436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=914436", "title": "Shield-maiden", "text": "Shield-maiden\n\nA shield-maiden (), in Scandinavian folklore and mythology was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in sagas such as \"Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks\" and in \"Gesta Danorum\". Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other Germanic peoples: Goths, Cimbri, and Marcomanni. The mythical valkyries may have been based on the shield-maidens.\n\nThe historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including Neil Price, argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.\n\nThere are few historic attestations that Viking Age women took part in warfare, but the Byzantine historian John Skylitzes records that women fought in battle when Sviatoslav I of Kiev attacked the Byzantines in Bulgaria in 971. When the Varangians (not to be confused with the Byzantine Varangian Guard) had suffered a devastating defeat in the Siege of Dorostolon, the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.\n\nWhen Leif Erikson's pregnant half-sister Freydís Eiríksdóttir was in Vinland, she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking Skrælings. The fight is recounted in the \"Greenland saga\", though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.\n\nSaxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the Danes at the Battle of Brávellir in the year 750:\nExamples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include Brynhildr in the \"Vǫlsunga saga\", Hervor in \"Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks\", the Brynhildr of the \"Bósa saga ok Herrauðs\", the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in \"Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar\" and Princess Hed, Visna and Veborg in \"Gesta Danorum\".\n\nTwo shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the \"Hervarar saga\". The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword Tyrfing from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider. She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking Huns. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield. Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.\n\nBrynhildr of the \"Vǫlsunga saga\", along with her rival in love, Guðrún Gjúkadóttir, provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas. Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior. When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother Gunnarr instead of Sigurðr, the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:\nBrynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her. Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.\n\nGuðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, \"Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires.\" In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.\n\nGraves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted. Norse immigrant graves in England and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons. In a tie-in special to the TV series \"Vikings\" Neil Price showed that a 10th Century Birka-burial excavated in the 1970s containing a large number of weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström. In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female; the so called Birka female Viking warrior, but others including respected scholar of the Vikings, Judith Jesch says that conclusion is premature. \n\nWhile women warriors are a staple of fantasy, they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include Éowyn in J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" and Thorgil in Nancy Farmer's \"The Sea of Trolls\" trilogy.\n\nIn the 2013 TV series \"Vikings\", the legendary Viking shield-maiden Lagertha, played by Katheryn Winnick, is a principal character.\n\n"}

{"id": "75849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75849", "title": "The Five (composers)", "text": "The Five (composers)\n\nThe Five, also known as the Mighty Handful and the New Russian School, were five prominent 19th-century Russian composers who worked together to create distinct Russian classical music. Mily Balakirev (the leader), César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Borodin all lived in Saint Petersburg, and collaborated from 1856 to 1870.\n\nIn May 1867 the critic Vladimir Stasov wrote an article, titled \"Mr. Balakirev's Slavic Concert\", covering a concert that had been performed for visiting Slav delegations at the \"All-Russian Ethnographical Exhibition\" in Moscow. The four Russian composers whose works were played at the concert were Mikhail Glinka, Alexander Dargomyzhsky, Mily Balakirev, and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. The article ended with the following statement:\n\nThe expression \"mighty handful\" (, \"Moguchaya kuchka\", \"Mighty Bunch\") was mocked by enemies of Balakirev and Stasov: Aleksandr Serov, academic circles of the conservatory, the Russian Musical Society, and their press supporters. The group ignored critics and continued operating under the moniker. This loose collection of composers gathered around Balakirev now included Cui, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Borodin — the five who have come to be associated with the name \"Mighty Handful\", or sometimes \"The Five\". Gerald Abraham stated flatly in the \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" that \"they never called themselves, nor were they ever called in Russia, 'The Five'\" (although today the Russian equivalent \"Пятёрка\" (\"Pyatyorka\") is occasionally used to refer to this group). In his memoirs, Rimsky-Korsakov routinely refers to the group as \"Balakirev's circle\", and occasionally uses \"The Mighty Handful\", usually with an ironic tone. He also makes the following reference to \"The Five\":\n\nThe Russian word \"kuchka\" also spawned the terms \"kuchkism\" and \"kuchkist\", which may be applied to artistic aims or works in tune with the sensibilities of the Mighty Handful.\n\nThe name of Les Six, an even looser collection of French-speaking composers, emulates that of \"The Five\".\n\nThe formation of the group began in 1856, with the first meeting of Balakirev and César Cui. Modest Mussorgsky joined them in 1857, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1861, and Alexander Borodin in 1862. All the composers in The Five were young men in 1862. Balakirev was 25, Cui 27, Mussorgsky 23, Borodin the eldest at 28, and Rimsky-Korsakov just 18. They were all self-trained amateurs. Borodin combined composing with a career in chemistry. Rimsky-Korsakov was a naval officer (he wrote his First Symphony on a three-year naval voyage circumnavigating the globe). Mussorgsky had been in the prestigious Preobrazhensky Regiment of the Imperial Guard, and then in the civil service before taking up music; even at the height of his career in the 1870s he was forced by the expense of his drinking habit to hold down a full-time job in the State Forestry Department.\n\nIn contrast to the élite status and court connections of Conservatory composers such as Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, The Five were mainly from the minor gentry of the provinces. To some degree their \"esprit de corps\" depended on the myth, which they themselves created, of a movement that was more \"authentically Russian,\" in the sense that it was closer to the native soil, than the classic academy.\n\nBefore them, Mikhail Glinka and Alexander Dargomyzhsky had gone some way towards producing a distinctly Russian kind of music, writing operas on Russian subjects, but the Mighty Handful represented the first concentrated attempt to develop such a music, with Stasov as their artistic adviser and Dargomyzhsky as an elder statesman to the group, so to speak. The circle began to fall apart during the 1870s, no doubt partially due to the fact that Balakirev withdrew from musical life early in the decade for a period of time. All of \"The Five\" are buried in Tikhvin Cemetery in Saint Petersburg.\n\nThe musical language The Five developed set them far apart from the Conservatoire. This self-conscious Russian styling was based on two elements:\n\n\nOne hallmark of \"The Five\" was its reliance on orientalism. Many quintessentially \"Russian\" works were composed in orientalist style, such as Balakirev's \"Islamey\", Borodin's \"Prince Igor\" and Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Scheherazade\". Orientalism, in fact, became widely considered in the West both one of the best-known aspects of Russian music and a trait of Russian national character. As leader of \"The Five,\" Balakirev encouraged the use of eastern themes and harmonies to set their \"Russian\" music apart from the German symphonism of Anton Rubinstein and other Western-oriented composers. Because Rimsky-Korsakov used Russian folk and oriental melodies in his First Symphony, Stasov and the other nationalists dubbed it the \"First Russian Symphony,\" even though Rubinstein had written his \"Ocean\" Symphony a dozen years before it. These were themes Balakirev had transcribed in the Caucasus. \"The symphony is good,\" Cui wrote to Rimsky-Korsakov in 1863, while the latter was out on naval deployment. \"We played it a few days ago at Balakirev's—to the great pleasure of Stassov. It is really Russian. Only a Russian could have composed it, because it lacks the slightest trace of any stagnant Germanness.\"\n\nOrientalism was not confined to using authentic Eastern melodies. What became more important than the melodies themselves were the musical conventions added to them. These conventions allowed orientalism to become an avenue for writing music on subjects considered unmentionable otherwise, such as political themes and erotic fantasies. It also became a means of expressing Russian supremacy as the empire expanded under Alexander II. This was often reinforced through misogynist symbolism—the rational, active and moral Western man versus the irrational, passive and immoral Eastern woman.\n\nTwo major works entirely dominated by orientalism are Rimsky-Korsakov's symphonic suite \"Antar\" and Balakirev's symphonic poem \"Tamara\". \"Antar\", set in Arabia, uses two different styles of music, Western (Russian) and Eastern (Arabian). The first theme, Antar's, is masculine and Russian in character. The second theme, feminine and oriental in melodic contour, belongs to the queen, Gul Nazar. Rimsky-Korsakov was able to soften the implicit misogyny to some extent. However, female sensuality does exert a paralyzing, ultimately destructive influence. With Gul Nazar extinguishing Antar's life in a final embrace, the woman overcomes the man.\n\nBalakirev gives a more overtly misogynistic view of oriental women in \"Tamara\". He had originally planned to write a Caucasan dance called a \"lezginka\", modeled on Glinka, for this work. However, he discovered a poem by Mikhail Lermontov about the beautiful Tamara, who lived in a tower alongside the gorge of Daryal. She lured travelers and allowed them to enjoy a night of sensual delights, only to kill them and throw their bodies into the River Terek. Balakirev uses two specific codes endemic to orientalism in writing \"Tamara\". The first code, based on obsessive rhythms, note repetitions, climactic effects and accelerated tempi, represents Dionysian intoxication. The second code, consisting of unpredictable rhythms, irregular phrasing and based on long passages with many repeat notes, augmented and diminished intervals and extended melismas, depict sensual longing. Not only did Balakirev use these codes extensively, but he also attempted to supercharge them further when he revised the orchestration of \"Tamara\" in 1898.\n\nA direct result of such orientalism was the big influence that this circle left on the formation of classical traditions in other nations of the east and south of Russia. For instance, one of Rimsky-Korsakov's famous students, Alexander Spendiaryan went on to become the founder of Armenian classical music, carrying on the traditions and aesthetics of the Mighty Handful to the Caucasus.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov provides the following picture of \"The Mighty Handful\" in his memoirs, \"Chronicle of My Musical Life\" (translated by J. A. Joffe):\n\nExcept perhaps for Cui, the members of this group influenced or taught many of the great Russian composers who were to follow, including Alexander Glazunov, Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov, Sergei Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, and Dmitri Shostakovich. They also influenced the two French symbolist composers Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy through their radical tonal language.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51289352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51289352", "title": "Widowhood effect", "text": "Widowhood effect\n\nThe widowhood effect is the increase in the probability of a person dying a relatively short time after their long-time spouse has died. The pattern indicates a sharp increase in risk of death for the widower, particularly but not exclusively, in the three months closest thereafter the death of the spouse. This process of losing a spouse and dying shortly after has also been called \"dying of a broken heart\". Becoming a widow is often a very detrimental and life changing time in a spouse's life, that forces them to go through changes that they may not have anticipated to make for a significant amount of time. Responses of grief and bereavement due to the loss of a spouse increases vulnerability to psychological and physical illnesses (Ramadas & Kuttichira, 2013).\n\nPsychologically, losing a long-term spouse can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt. Physical illness may also occur as the body becomes more vulnerable to emotional and environmental stressors. There are many factors that may be affected when one becomes a widow. A widow (or widower if referring to a male who lost a spouse) tends to have a decline in health regulation. Higher prevalence in mortality rates are noted among bereaved spouses during the first six months of bereavement compared to the last six months of bereavement. The most crucial are said to be the first three months during grief processing. Grieving spouses are more vulnerable during these few months not only health wise but socially and physically. During this early period of bereavement spouses tend to have less interest in their health as well as physical appearance caring less about continuing with medications or adapting healthy behaviors such as eating healthy or exercising. Also, they are likelier to practice risky behaviors and commit suicide. Men on the other hand, are more likely to look for social support such as friends, family, or support groups regarding the matter.\n\nThis effect appears to be far more prevalent in older married couples than in younger married couples. As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows. Through the many studies that have been conducted over the years, it has been found that the widowhood effect affects the mortality rates of people with varying levels of severity depending on their genders and religions.It is far more frequent in more seasoned, long-term, elder couples than in recently married couples. Since the topic has only been recently studied within this last decade, and due to the prevalence of older couples being affected, most widows in similar studies are typically over the age of 50 (Jegtvig, 2013).\n\nAlthough there have not been many studies, the phenomenon is one of the best documented examples of the effect of social relations on health. Through the numerous studies that have been directed throughout the years, it has been found that the widowhood impact influences the death rates of individuals with changing levels of stringencies relying upon their sexual orientations and religions. There are many theories as to what causes this to occur. There are many factors and theories about the widowhood effect, but in general, a study on a large population sample has suggested rates of death nearly double during the first three months after loss of a spouse, and quickly taper thereafter. (Moon, et al., 2013)\n\nBoth men and women respond differently to the death of their spouse. In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women. Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.\n\nThe majority of peer-reviewed articles suggest that it is indeed women that are more frequently at risk of succumbing to the widowhood effect. A collaborative study by Gary R. Lee et al. (2001) surveyed 1686 married and widowed people age 65 or older using data from 1988 National Survey of Families and Households. The study took into account the psychological well-being of each person on a Center for Epidemiologic Studies— Depression scale (CES-D), and found that women were further depressed by the loss of their spouse than men were. Women were also more likely to die soon after the death of their spouse compared to men. The researchers hypothesized that this was because older married women had a higher baseline happiness than their spouses, so they had more happiness to lose. Women in this study were also less likely to be avid church goers, despised chores, and were not as adept at helping their adult children. The lack of social behavior and general activity may contribute to the widowhood effect's influence on female mortality.\n\nExperimenters involved in the study regarding: \"The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes\", took a deeper look into the overall health differences between recent widowers and those who are currently involved in a marriage (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Mental health alterations include those of depression and socially extracting yourself were the most common for women who have become widowed in the past year or so (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Although some of these women were shown to extract them selves from social settings, the study also supported an alternate hypothesis that women experiencing the effects of widowhood are less likely to engage coping mechanisms such as support groups, fellow widowers, and overall strong support systems such as close friends and family (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003).\n\nIn a study done by Stahl and Shultz, they found that the death of a woman’s spouse affected her physical activity (2014). Women’s physical activity increases immediately following the death of a spouse, and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms (Stahl & Shultz, 2014). In the year following the death of a spouse, women are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die (Stahl & Shultz, 2014). Women in the youngest age group of this study (55– 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the death of their spouse (Brenn & Ytterstad, 2016). Elwert and Christakis found that within the first month of bereavement after widowhood morality is largest and doesn’t decline sharply until the sixth month of widowhood for females, compared to only the third month for males (2006).\n\nNicholas A. Christakis of Harvard and Felix Elwert of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 9 years’ worth of data gathered from almost 373,189 elderly married couples in the U.S. Their findings showed an 18 percent increase in “all-cause mortality” for women whose husbands died first; for men, the risk is 16 percent (Elwert 2008). Although the percentage of females was higher than males, it is not a significant difference to state that women are more affected than men. It is hard to say whether males or females suffer from the widowhood effect more, however it is clear that it is higher in couples that are older.\n\nThe death of a spouse can have a major impact on a person’s mental health. Each individual may respond to their spouse’s death differently. After the death of a spouse many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues (Avis, Brambilla, Vass, & Mckinlay, 1991). The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Women become more depressed in widowhood compared to men because women may not have as strong of a support group. Married women also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the death of their spouse could drastically alter this happiness. Men may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while women tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the death of a spouse but the rates of depression in women tends to be higher than in men (Lee, DeMaris, & Sullivan, 2001).\n\nRecently, there has been a phenomenon discussed and researched dubbed the takotsubo condition, also referred to as the broken heart syndrome (Brenn & Ytterstad, 2016). Takotsubo has been discussed in contexts surrounding great physical and emotional stress, such as circumstance in which someone has been widowed, and emotional stress has long been associated with myocardial infarction. In their research, Brenn and Ytterstad saw an increase in death of women 55–64 years old due to heart disease in the first week of widowhood than married women 55–64 years old (2016). Although takotsubo is not considered to be the direct cause of death at this time, it is an observed phenomenon (Brenn & Ytterstad, 2016.)\n\nElderly widows experience changes in their social lives prior to and following the deaths of their spouses. A study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood spent more time with family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to a network of family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the death of their husband or wife. Elderly widows were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends. It has been noted that widows who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss of a spouse affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic (Bennett, 2012). With all of these aspects of a widowed individuals being affected maintaining a sense of normality is important to help avoid depression like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals.\n\nA study conducted by Rosato, O’Reilly and Wright (2015) revealed that there is a significant difference in urban-rural variation in the social environment as well as in health outcomes. There is evidence that social support from family and friends have better health outcomes on mortality rates. Investigations showed that the race of the partner influences widowhood effect; whites in endogamous marriages had greater mortality risks that were not obvious among blacks, which the authors concluded was due to a high level of family support for elderly among black families versuswhite families. Moreover, the study also found differences in urban and rural areas around the world. They found that elderly married couples in the US suffered significant mortality risks compared to those in Ireland where older people living in more rural areas receive more social support from their families, and they live with their children, while in the US elderly people live in care homes. As a result, mortality rates are greater in urban areas and less in rural areas.\n\nIn a study done by Elwert and Christakis, they found that there was no widowhood effect found in endogamously married black men or women (2016). Deducing this finding, they proposed that this might be because blacks are able to extend their marital survival advantage into widowhood. This is likely because blacks are prone to have kin nearer to help take care of them, they may be more self-sufficient than their white counterparts, and there is greater religious participation in blacks that may help them with spiritual comfort (Elwert & Christakis, 2016). Whites were found to have “a large and enduring widowhood effect” because there is no reparation to make up for the survival advantages that marriage gave them, even if they have been widowed for years (Elwert & Christakis, 2008).\n\nThe widowhood effect appears to have a higher impact in rural and intermediate areas compared to urban areas. One factor may be that there are greater distances to primary care services in rural areas, and this increases mortality due to discouraged health checkups (Wright, 2015). It is known that the size of family and social network coincides with physical functioning; the bigger the social group one belongs to the better they can physically function. Residential areas near green areas are associated with an increase in physical activity and lowered mortality (Wright, 2015). Researchers measured peak flow to show the increases or decreases in physical functioning, and the results suggest that married subjects have a higher peak flow compared to those divorced or widowed (Clouston, 2014).\n\nIt was suggested that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., & Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased mortality rate of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The results provided evidence that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood.\n\nIn April 2016, the American Heart Association published an article regarding phenomenon referred to as \"broken heart syndrome\". This particular syndrome seems to occur when a person experiences an overwhelming amount of stress in their life in a short period of time. The cases mentioned involved both positive events like winning the lottery as well as negative events like experiencing the death of a spouse. Though broken heart syndrome has been misdiagnosed as a heart attack, the differences between the two phenomena are clear. Heart attacks are the result of a blockage of arteries, but broken heart syndrome is the result of a hormone induced enlargement of a portion of the heart. The enlarged region of the heart is less effective in regards to pumping blood, and the normal sized regions of the heart are forced to work harder as a result.\n Widowhood effect is important to be aware of because of the affects that it can have on the body; mentally, physically, emotionally. Although there is no correct coping mechanism when losing a partner, it is important to find preventative ways to fight this from occurring because of the depressive symptoms and state of mental health that are a result from a partner passing away. Being aware of widowhood effect and acknowledging the feelings, such as grieving over that individual can be a way of coping with their current situation. Individuals that result to safe methods with grieving such as counseling or finding different hobbies can decrease their chances of experiencing widowhood effect. \nThere is no universally accepted “proper” method or way to grieve or adjust to life after loss; it varies among individuals, influenced by their cultural and social practices, personality, and the circumstances surrounding the death. Even though grief processing varies, there are ways to reduce the effects of widowhood. Since a spouse is often one’s primary source of social interactions, maintaining and establishing social bonds is a crucial aspect in determining the outcome of a widowed individual’s bereavement (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Social participation may be utilized “as an active coping strategy” as discovered in a study by Rebecca Utz and colleagues (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Additionally, the loss of a spouse means the loss of a partner; the loss of a supportive presence with whom responsibility was shared amongst one another. Studies have shown that for couples who followed traditional gender roles, adjustment to life after their loss was often more difficult than for couples who did not (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Undertaking the responsibilities previously considered the ‘job’ of one’s deceased partner is often hard to handle on top of processing the loss; therefore, the utilization of organizations built to support and help widowed individuals may also prove to be helpful in reducing grief. The Widowed Persons Service (WPS) and their parent organization, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), are two organizations which provide aid specifically to widowed individuals (DeSpelder & Strickland, 2015). Effective and safe methods of grief processing are important for all individuals dealing with loss; however, the utilization of organizations may prove to be beneficial for those who need a little more help.\n\nDeSpelder, L.
