According to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue an estimated 550 women and girls from Western countries have travelled to join the Islamic State as of 2015—part of what some have called \"a jihadi, girl-power subculture\".\n\nThe three girls had been questioned by the police in December 2014 after another girl from their school travelled to Syria, but were found not to be at risk. They flew via Turkish Airlines from Gatwick Airport, London, to Istanbul on 17 February. Their families went to Turkey in March to probe the disappearance, deeming the police investigation inadequate.\n\nTheir disappearance has been attributed to Aqsa Mahmood, a Glasgow woman who joined ISIL in 2013. There have been electronic communications between the girls and Mahmood. She faces criminal charges if she returns. Mahmood denies the allegations.\n\nIn March 2015, footage was circulated of Abase Hussen, father of Amira Abase, on a 2012 rally led by Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary against the film \"Innocence of Muslims\". The Metropolitan Police examined the footage but said that it was unlikely that offences had been committed. Hussen said in April that he feels ashamed of his involvement in the rally, as he did not know who had organised it.\n\nThe girls stole family jewellery to pay for their flight. They will not face criminal charges if they return to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe disappearance resulted in the Metropolitan Police giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons on its circumstances in March 2015. The families of the girls received an apology from Scotland Yard, who did not tell them about the other girl from their school who went to Syria in 2014.\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron has said that police should not be made \"scapegoats\" for people joining ISIL. Contrary to the stance of the Metropolitan Police, Cameron said \"Whoever has gone out to join a terrorist organisation is breaking the law and has to face the consequences of breaking the law and we have to let the law take its course in the proper way\".\n\nIn March 2015, a travel ban was imposed upon five girls from the Bethnal Green Academy due to concerns from social services that they the girls attend the same school as the three who had already joined the group, stating that it was in the public interest.\n\nThe teenagers have not made contact with their families since May 2016. Begum was reported to have married an American jihadist recruit who left her once she became pregnant. Sultana is said to have married a western ISIS fighter with Somali heritage, but wanted to return to the UK after he was killed in battle. Shortly afterwards she was killed in a Russian airstrike. Sultana's family in a phone interview with ITV in August 2016 said that they believed her to have died in an airstrike in May 2016 at the age of 17 while planning to escape. The lawyer who represents the family of the teenagers Tasnime Akunjee told ITV that she became too scared of making an escape attempt after another girl Samra Kesinovic was beaten to death for trying to escape. Abase married an 18-year-old Australian jihadist, Abdullah Elmir in July 2016 who was reported by Australian intelligence agencies to have been killed in coalition airstrikes. After the teenagers married foreign jihadists, they moved into the homes of their new husbands in ISIL' de facto capital of Raqqa.\n\n"}
{"id": "45467653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45467653", "title": "Angelets", "text": "Angelets\n\nThe Angelets, or “the Angelets of the Earth” (in Catalan, \"“els Angelets de la Terra”\"), were peasants who rose up from 1667 to 1675 against the French authorities of the Roussillon province. The group of conflicts of the period is subsumed under the name of “the Revolt of the Angelets”. The cause was the instituting of the gabelle (salt tax) in 1661 — a measure contrary to traditional constitutions of the earldom (the earldom of Roussillon and Cerdanya, the lands of the crown of Majorca from 1276 to 1344).\n\nThe revolt first concerned the county of Vallespir, then it won those of Conflent and Roussillon.\n\nThe reason why the revolts are referred to as “angelets” is unknown. One of the explanations advanced is the popular belief according to which the angels know the mountains well; another is the faculty that they have of appearing and disappearing.\n\nAs for the word \"“miquelets,”\" it refers primarily to Catalan mercenaries but sometimes to armed peasants. There is thus confusion among the ancient authors, particularly in relation to the war of Holland: They designate under the name “\"miquelets\"” all those who, in the province of Roussillon, oppose the king of France — though it be angelets or Catalan mercenaries in the service of the king of Spain.\n\nArchangel Michael is the patron saint of the miquelets and the wool-workers of Prats-de-Mollo, he who gave a sacred tint to one revolt that reclaimed liberties with the patriotic cry of \"“Visca la terra!”\" (“Long live the Land!”)\n\nOn May 8, 1659, the Catalan Revolt came to an end, and on November 7, the Treaty of the Pyrenees was signed between the Spanish and the French monarchies. The agreement notably foresaw a sharing of the principality of Catalonia between the two sovereigns. The crown of France annexed five comarques (corresponding to the two Counts, minus lower Cerdanya and Llívia):\n\n\nLouis XIV engaged himself with respecting the local customs. But, since June 1660, he replaced Catalan institutions and agencies with his own political, judiciary, and fiscal structures. He created a sovereign Council at Perpignan. Then he named a steward.\n\nResistance to the new master began in March 1661. Having come to settle a disagreement between the inhabitants of Ayguatébia and those of Oreilla, the viguier (magistrate) Marsal was violently attacked. He succeeded in escaping, but the notary and the domestic who accompanied him were killed. Immediately, the comarque of Conflent was subjected to a tax intended to pay the sometent français (the militia).\n\nThe gabelle, a tax on salt, had been abolished by the Catalan courts since the time of King James II of Majorca, in 1283. In 1661, the French reestablished it. Its revenue was intended to finance the maintenance and construction of fortresses, as well as the payment of French functionaries. The measure was very unpopular. The king of France’s misuse of this tax’s revenue — to the detriment of Perpignan, which was only cashing an insignificant part of it — was considered an abjuration of the royal oath to respect the capital privileges of the comarque of Roussillon. The consuls of Perpignan protested. But the sovereign Council’s decision rejected the municipal complaint and imposed the will of the Louvre.\n\nIn Vallespir, a country of pastures, salt was necessary for feeding livestock and preserving meat. The inhabitants sent for it from the other side of the wholly new border. The tax made its price rise inordinately. In 1667, the peasants of Vallespir refused to pay it.\n\nSmuggling was organized. The inspectors tracked down the traffickers in order to try to put an end to this activity. The peasants reacted, transforming themselves into veritable guerrilla fighters, harassing the French soldiers and especially the functionaries of the salt tax. An armed resistance was organized under the leadership of Joseph of Trinxeria, a merchant of Prats-de-Mollo.\n\nThe insurgents spread themselves in the county of Vallespir. In 1667, they hid in the villages of Serralongue and Montferrer. The following year, they attacked the hotel of Amélie-les-Bains, where the tax collectors are housed. They besieged the deputy provost Maniel in the church of Saint-Laurent-de-Cerdans. The repression did not rest: eight inhabitants were condemned to death and 51 put into slavery. This did nothing to discourage the smugglers.\n\nThe president of the sovereign Council, the collaborator Francesc de Segarra, offered a reward of 100 gold \"doubles tournois\" (coins) to whoever would give information against the leaders of the resistance. On September 14, 1668, he left with 300 soldiers to make base at Arles in order to begin a harsh suppression. The punitive expedition was routed at Llop pass and had to retreat to Arles.\n\nFor several years, the rebels, knowing the terrain well, inflicted substantial losses on the French troops. From August 3, 1667 to June 30, 1668, they also pursued and eliminated a good number of salt tax inspectors.\n\nThe authorities of the salt tax resolved to negotiate: The armed struggle ceased and, in exchange, the townships of Vallespir could obtain smuggled salt. Through the “Compromise of Céret,” the salt tax inspectors began to put an end to the controls and to coordinate with the council of each village, as to who would be charged from then on with the distribution of salt to the inhabitants.\n\nIn 1669, in Conflent, Joan Miquel Mestre, called “the Righteous Heir,” demanded a similar arrangement for Baillestavy. From September to November, he kept track of the customs officers. It was at that moment that the revolts were referred to under the name of “angelets.” Mestre was stopped by chance on the road from Camprodon on January 22, 1670 by the governor of Prats-de-Mollo. This set off a revolt on the part of the inhabitants, led by Josep de la Trinxeria and his lieutenant Damià Nohell, son of the mayor of Serralongue. They took the governor’s wife and children hostage and negotiated their release in return for that of the Righteous Heir. The exchange completed, the angelets returned via the Tech, seeing their troops grow to 1,500 men.\n\nAt this moment the revolt not only began again but also intensified considerably. The fighting stretched to all of Vallespir: On February 27, 1670, the insurgents seized Arles, from which they chased the garrison and killed the mayor. From March 31 to April 2, they besieged Céret, the capital of Vallespir.\n\nThe angelets held the high valley of Tech as well as Conflent. This was when the French sent an army of 4,000 soldiers. Avoiding offering an easy target on the route from the valley, they progressed through the mountains of Haut-Conflent that separated the two comarques, in order to take Vallespir from the rear. The technique of guerrilla warfare did not allow for maintaining a lined-up battle, on open terrain, facing a complete army: On May 5, the angelets were defeated at the Queen’s Pass, at the food of the Guillem Flat. Some took refuge in the principality of Catalonia; others hid in the mountains. The last bastion of the angelets having been defeated, the village of Py was sentenced to be razed. Salt had to be scattered over its ruins.\n\nHostilities were revived by the Franco-Dutch War (1672–78), of which the Spanish front became one of the theaters. The struggle of the population then took the character of an anti-French uprising. The angelets collaborated with the Spanish monarchy (1673).\n\nThe village and church of Ayguatébia were burned by French troops on February 7, 1673.\n\nThe year 1674 was particularly difficult for the French, in the province of Roussillon. They would face conspiracies (Villefranche and Perpignan) and an entry of Spanish troops.\n\nThe angelets were involved in the Villefranche Conspiracy, which aimed to reunite the Counties at the principality of Catalonia, on “Holy Saturday” in 1674.\n\nThe conspiracy was discovered. Its leader, Manuel Descatllar, was arrested. He was transferred to Perpignan where, under terrible torture, he confessed all his activities. He was executed in the square of La Loge on April 20, 1674. As for his companion Francesc Puig i Terrats, he was condemned to death and had his throat cut in public, in front of his own house, on May 16. His body was quartered. The four parts of him were exhibited at four points in the city. Many other conspirators paid for their involvement through the loss of their civic and patrimonial rights.\n\nThe population was always in question. The king of Spain’s troops crossed the frontier and took the fort of Bellegarde (beginning 1674). They controlled a great part of the province (Cerdagne and Vallespir, a part of Roussillon and of Conflent) after they won the Battle of Maureillas over the French army on July. It was only in 1675 that the Count of Schomberg, taking advantage of the Spanish withdrawal of troops to face the recent Revolt of Messina, took back Bellegarde and routed them once and for all.\n\nThe region was now overrun with the French troops. The repression reached the whole population: imprisonment, sentencing to the galleys, executions, confiscation of goods, and heavy fines imposed on the communes (that of Prats-de-Mollo was of 3,500 pounds, that of Saint-Laurent was of 1,600 pounds).\n\nThe revolt of the angelets was considered finished in 1675.\n\nThe hatreds were so exacerbated, and the cost of suppression was so high, that Louis XIV tried to exchange the Counties in return for Flanders. But Charles II of Spain refused.\n\nThe revolt being completely put out, the king of France renounced this exchange during negotiations of the Treaty of Nijmegen, which put an end, in 1678, to the Franco-Dutch War.\n"}
{"id": "26591223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26591223", "title": "Biographical criticism", "text": "Biographical criticism\n\nBiographical criticism is a form of literary criticism which analyzes a writer's biography to show the relationship between the author's life and their works of literature. Biographical criticism is often associated with historical-biographical criticism, a critical method that \"sees a literary work chiefly, if not exclusively, as a reflection of its author's life and times\".\n\nThis longstanding critical method dates back at least to the Renaissance period, and was employed extensively by Samuel Johnson in his \"Lives of the Poets\" (1779–81).\n\nLike any critical methodology, biographical criticism can be used with discretion and insight or employed as a superficial shortcut to understanding the literary work on its own terms through such strategies as Formalism. Hence 19th century biographical criticism came under disapproval by the so-called New Critics of the 1920s, who coined the term \"biographical fallacy\" to describe criticism that neglected the imaginative genesis of literature.\n\nNotwithstanding this critique, biographical criticism remained a significant mode of literary inquiry throughout the 20th century, particularly in studies of Charles Dickens and F. Scott Fitzgerald, among others. The method continues to be employed in the study of such authors as John Steinbeck, Walt Whitman and William Shakespeare.\n\nIn \"The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism\", in a chapter titled \"Peripatetic Biographical Criticism\", George Alexander Kennedy notes that in the Hellenistic age, \"The works of authors were read as sources of information about their lives, personalities and interests. Some of this material was then used by other commentators and critics to explain passages in their works. The process became a circular one in that, though Peripatetic biographers utilized external evidence where available, they had little to go on and quarried the texts for hints\".\n\nJackson J. Benson describes the form as a \"'recognition of 'otherness'—that there is an author who is different in personality and background from the reader—appears to be a simple-minded proposition. Yet as a basic prerequisite to the understanding and evaluation of a literary text it is often ignored even by the most sophisticated literary critics. The exploration of otherness is what literary biography and biographical criticism can do best, discovering an author as a unique individual, a discovery that puts a burden on us to reach out to recognize that uniqueness before we can fully comprehend an author's writings.'\"\n\nBiographical criticism shares in common with New Historicism an interest in the fact that all literary works are situated in specific historical and biographical contexts from which they are generated. Biographical Criticism, like New Historicism, rejects the concept that literary studies should be limited to the internal or formal characteristics of a literary work, and insists that it properly includes a knowledge of the contexts in which the work was created. Biographical criticism stands in ambiguous relationship to Romanticism. It has often been argued that it is a development from Romanticism, but it also stands in opposition to the Romantic tendency to view literature as manifesting a \"universal\" transcendence of the particular conditions of its genesis.\n\nIn \"The Art of Literary Biography\" (1995), John Worthen writes:\n\n"}
{"id": "31961763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31961763", "title": "Biography in literature", "text": "Biography in literature\n\nWhen studying literature, biography and its relationship to literature is often a subject of literary criticism, and is treated in several different forms. Two scholarly approaches use biography or biographical approaches to the past as a tool for interpreting literature: literary biography and biographical criticism. Additionally, two genres of fiction rely heavily on the incorporation of biographical elements into their content, biographical fiction and autobiographical fiction.\n\nA literary biography is the biographical exploration of the lives of writers and artists. Biographies about artists and writers are sometimes some of the most complicated forms of biography. Not only does the author of the biography have to write about the subject of the biography but also must incorporate discussion of the individual's literary works into the biography itself. Literary biographers must balance the weight of commentary on the individual works against the biographical content to create a coherent narrative. This balance is affected by the degree of biographical elements in an author's literary works. The close relationship between writers and their work relies on ideas that connect human psychology and literature and can be examined through psychoanalytic theory.\n\nLiterary biography tends to have a plethora of autobiographical sources. Elizabeth Longford, a biographer of Wilfrid Blunt, noted, \"Writers are articulate and tend to leave eloquent source material which the biographer will be eager to use.\" However, some authors and artists go out of their way to discourage the writing of their biographies, as was the case with Kafka, Eliot, Orwell and Auden. Auden said, \"Biographies of writers whether written by others or themselves are always superfluous and usually in bad taste... His private life is, or should be, of no concern to anybody except himself, his family and his friends.\"\n\nWell-received literary biographies include Richard Ellmann's \"James Joyce\" and George Painter's \"Marcel Proust\".\n\nBiographical criticism is the deliberate use of biographical information to shed light on the difference created by experience between an author and his audience, and so provide insight into how to understand that particular work.\n\nBiographical fiction is a type of historical fiction that takes a historical individual and recreates elements of his or her life, while telling a fictional narrative, usually in the genres of film or the novel. The relationship between the biographical and the fictional may vary within different pieces of biographical fiction. It frequently includes selective information and self-censoring of the past. The characters are often real people or based on real people, but the need for \"truthful\" representation is less strict than in biography. \n\nThe various philosophies behind biographical fiction lead to different types of content. Some asserts itself as a factual narrative about the historical individual, like Gore Vidal's \"Lincoln\". Other biographical fiction creates two parallel strands of narrative, one in the contemporary world and one focusing on the biographical history, such as Malcolm Bradbury's \"To the Hermitage\" and Michael Cunningham's \"The Hours\". No matter what style of biographical fiction is used, the novelist usually starts the writing process with historical research.\n\nBiographical fiction has its roots in late 19th and early 20th-century novels based loosely on the lives of famous people, but without direct reference to them, such as George Meredith's \"Diana of the Crossways\" (1885) and Somerset Maugham's \"The Moon and Sixpence\" (1919). During the early part of the 20th century this became a distinct genre, with novels that were explicitly about individuals' lives.\n\nAutobiographical fiction, or autofiction, is fiction that incorporates the author's own experience into the narrative. It allows authors to both rely and reflect on their own experience. However, the reading of the autobiographical fiction need not always be associated with the author. Such books may be treated as distinct fictional works.\n\n"}

He was identified in 1942, by Holger Dyggve, as Jean II of Nesle (near Amiens), who was nicknamed 'Blondel' for his long blond hair. He married at the time of his father's death in 1202, and that same year, went on the Fourth Crusade; he later fought in the Albigensian Crusade. However, in 1994, Yvan Lepage suggested that the poet may have been Jean I, father of Jean II, who was Lord of Nesle from 1180 to 1202; this Jean took part in the Third Crusade, which may explain the subsequent legend linking him with King Richard I of England.\n\nIf the works are correctly identified and dated, he was a significant influence on his European contemporaries, who made much use of his melodies. (The melody of \"L'amours dont sui espris\" is used in \"Carmina Burana\", for the song \"Procurans Odium\"). His works are fairly conventional, and several have been recorded in modern times.\n\nBy 1260, Blondel's name had become attached to a legend in the highly fictionalised \"Récits d'un Ménestrel de Reims\"; this claimed that, after King Richard of England was arrested and held for ransom in 1192, he was found by the minstrel Blondel, whom he saw from his window, and to whom he sang a verse of a song they both knew. Later versions of the story related that Blondel went from castle to castle, singing a particular song that only he and Richard knew, and that the imprisoned Richard replied with the second verse – thus identifying where he was imprisoned. Then, Blondel either aided the king's escape or reported his position back to his friends. Blondel finally found Richard at Dürnstein; in fact, there was no mystery about Richard's location which was widely publicized by his ransomers.\n\n'Blondel' is a common surname on the Channel Island of Guernsey. It is recorded that King Richard granted a fief on the island to a vassal named Blondel, but it remains uncertain as to whether this has any connection with the legend, or whether the legend has any connection with the known trouvère.\n\nThe legend of Blondel did not achieve great popularity in the Middle Ages, but was taken up in the late eighteenth century. It was the basis of André Ernest Modeste Grétry's opera \"Richard Coeur-de-lion\" (1784). In 1822, Eleanor Anne Porden used the legend in her epic poem \"Cœur De Lion\": in her version, Blondel is really Richard's wife, Berengaria of Navarre, in disguise.\n\nA poem by Johann Gabriel Seidl titled Blondel's Lied was set to music by Robert Schumann.\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century, the legend became a key component in the mythology surrounding Richard. Some later twentieth century novelists, placed a homosexual interpretation on his supposed relationship with the king. Norah Lofts in \"The Lute Player\" (1951) has Richard make a (rather gentlemanly ) approach to Blondel, which is refused, Blondel's heart and devotion being entirely given to Richard's neglected wife Berengaria. \n\nIn the 1962–63 ITV British television series \"Richard the Lionheart\", Blondel was a semi-regular character, played by Iain Gregory.\n\nThe English acoustic band of the early 1970s, Amazing Blondel, was named after Blondel.\n\nThe legend inspired \"Blondel\", a 1983 musical by Stephen Oliver and Tim Rice. The play, a comedic rock opera, is set during the period of the Third Crusade. Blondel is portrayed as a frustrated artist, seeking fame as a composer and performer, even as he searches for his imprisoned monarch. Rice collaborated with director Patrick Wilde to revive the show at the Pleasance Theatre in London in 2006.\n\n\n\n"}

She may be identical with Cleopatra V.\n\nThere were at least two, perhaps three Ptolemaic women called \"Cleopatra Tryphaena\":\n\nTryphaena was a sister of Ptolemy IX Lathyros, Ptolemy X Alexander I, Cleopatra IV and Cleopatra Selene. If this \"Tryphaena\" also bore the name \"Cleopatra\", has not been attested. This Tryphaena may have been born in early 140 or 141 BC. She married Antiochus VIII Grypus, king of Syria, in 124 BC, and bore him five sons: Seleucus VI Epiphanes, the twin Antiochus XI Epiphanes and Philip I Philadelphus, Demetrius III Eucaerus, and Antiochus XII Dionysus. The couple also had a daughter called Laodice. Tryphaena was killed in Antioch (Greek: Αντιόχεια), capital of Syria, by Antiochus IX Cyzicenus, as a revenge for his own wife's (Cleopatra IV) death by the orders of her sister Tryphaena (in 111 BC).\n\nCleopatra V Tryphaena was a Queen of Egypt until her mysterious disappearance from the records in 69 BC. If, as some scholars believe, her disappearance is attributable to her death, then it must be assumed that she had a daughter also called \"Cleopatra Tryphaena\".\n\nShe is called \"Cleopatra VI Tryphaena\" by some modern historians and she would have been an older sister of the famous Cleopatra VII. If so, her birth year would correctly be c. 75 BC. The only instance she is mentioned in historical sources is by Porphyry. He says that when Ptolemy XII fled to Rome to avoid an uprising in Alexandria against him (in 58 BC), Berenice IV took control of Ptolemaic Egypt and ruled alongside her sister, Cleopatra Tryphaena. Strabo, however, states that Ptolemy had three daughters, of whom only the eldest (Berenice) was legitimate. This suggests that the Cleopatra Tryphaena referred to by Porphyry may have been Ptolemy's wife, not his daughter. Some, though not all, experts now identify Cleopatra VI with Cleopatra V of Egypt, Ptolemy's wife.\n"}

The first line is the name of the poem's subject, usually a famous person put in an absurd light, or revealing something unknown or spurious about them. The rhyme scheme is AABB, and the rhymes are often forced. The line length and metre are irregular. Bentley invented the clerihew in school and then popularized it in books. One of his best known is this (1905):\n\nA clerihew has the following properties:\n\nClerihews are not satirical or abusive, but they target famous individuals and reposition them in an absurd, anachronistic or commonplace setting, often giving them an over-simplified and slightly garbled description (not unlike the schoolboy style of \"1066 and All That\").\n\nThe form was invented by and is named after Edmund Clerihew Bentley. When he was a 16-year-old pupil at St Paul's School in London, the lines of his first clerihew, about Humphry Davy, came into his head during a science class. Together with his schoolfriends, he filled a notebook with examples. The first use of the word in print was in 1928. Bentley published three volumes of his own clerihews: \"Biography for Beginners\" (1905), published as \"edited by E. Clerihew\"; \"More Biography\" (1929); and \"Baseless Biography\" (1939), a compilation of clerihews originally published in \"Punch\" illustrated by the author's son Nicolas Bentley.\n\nG. K. Chesterton, a friend of Bentley, was also a practitioner of the clerihew and one of the sources of its popularity. Chesterton provided verses and illustrations for the original schoolboy notebook and illustrated \"Biography for Beginners\". Other serious authors also produced clerihews, including W. H. Auden, and it remains a popular humorous form among other writers and the general public. Among contemporary writers, the satirist Craig Brown has made considerable use of the clerihew in his columns for \"The Daily Telegraph\".\n\nThere has been newfound popularity of the form on Twitter.\n\nBentley's first clerihew, published in 1905, was written about Sir Humphry Davy:\nThe original poem had the second line \"Was not fond of gravy\"; but the published version has \"Abominated gravy\".\n\nOther clerihews by Bentley include:\n\nand\nW.

The black bands tying the red pack is one of several existing contraventions of the heraldic rule of tincture, which in general does not allow the placing of colour on colour or metal (gold or silver) on another metal.\n\nThe charges of the arms — the Moor's head, Corbinian's bear, and scallop — appeared on Ratzinger's previous coat of arms, used when he was Archbishop of Munich and Freising. However, they relate not only to his origins, but also to his trust in God, as well his calling to spread this faith to others.\n\nThe symbolism of the scallop shell is multiple. Saint Augustine is said to have been walking along the seashore, meditating on the unfathomable mystery of the Holy Trinity. A boy was using a shell to pour sea water into a little hole. When Augustine asked him what he was doing, he replied, \"I am emptying the sea into this hole.\" Thus did Augustine understand that man would never penetrate to the depths of the mystery of God. While a doctoral candidate in 1953, Fr. Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on \"The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church\", and the shell therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this great Doctor of the Church.\n\nThe scallop shell is also an allusion to the Sacrament of Holy Baptism. In the Roman Catholic Church, a sea shell is often used to pour water over the head of the child being baptized. Thus, a sea shell is used to evoke the imagery of this rite which is fundamental to the Christian life.\n\nThe shell also stands for pilgrimage. When topped with a scallop shell a pilgrim's staff, or \"Jacob's staff\", is the sign of a pilgrim. In Church art it is a symbol of the apostle Saint James the Great, and his sanctuary at Santiago de Compostela in Spain, perhaps the principal place of pilgrimage during the Middle Ages. This symbol also alludes to \"the pilgrim people of God\", a title for the Church which Joseph Ratzinger championed at the Second Vatican Council as \"peritus\" (theological adviser) to Cardinals Josef Frings of Cologne and Julius Döpfner of Munich-Freising (his episcopal predecessor). When he became Archbishop he took the shell in his coat of arms. It is also found in the insignia of the Schottenkloster in Regensburg, where the major seminary of that diocese is located, a place where Benedict taught as a professor of theology.\n\nFinally, the pilgrimage symbolism of the shell may also refer both to the reconfigured role of the pope as not only ruler, but also pilgrim among the peoples and nations of the world. Pope Paul VI—who created Joseph Ratzinger as a cardinal in 1977—was often called the \"Pilgrim Pope\" for his ground-breaking travels to the Holy Land, India, the United States, Colombia, the Philippines, and elsewhere. This precedent was greatly elaborated upon by Pope John Paul II with his historic trips, numbering over a hundred. As a result, Benedict may be paying homage to these men and the new role for the papacy.\n\nThe Moor's head is a heraldic charge associated with Wörth, Upper Bavaria, Germany. The origin of the Moor's head in Freising is not entirely known. Typically facing to the heraldic right, the viewer's left (\"dexter\" in heraldic terms) and depicted in natural brown colour \"caput Aethiopum\" (literally \"Ethiopian head\") with red lips, crown and collar. This is the ancient emblem of the Diocese of Freising, founded in the 8th century, which became a Metropolitan Archdiocese with the name of München und Freising in 1818, subsequent to the Concordat between Pius VII and King Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria (5 June 1817).\n\nThe Moor's head is fairly common in European heraldry. It still appears today in the arms of Sardinia and Corsica, as well as in the blazons of various noble families. Italian heraldry, however, usually depicts the Moor wearing a white band around his head instead of a crown, indicating a slave who has been freed; whereas in German heraldry the Moor is shown wearing a crown. The Moor's head is common in the Bavarian tradition and is known as the \"caput Ethiopicum\" or the \"Moor of Freising\".\n\nA legend states that while traveling to Rome, Saint Corbinian's pack horse was killed by a bear. He commanded the bear to carry the load. Once he arrived, he released it from his service, and it returned to Bavaria. The implication is that \"Christianity tamed and domesticated the ferocity of paganism and thus laid the foundations for a great civilization in the Duchy of Bavaria.\" At the same time, Corbinian's bear, as God's beast of burden, symbolizes the weight of office that Benedict carried.\n\nTraditionally, a pope's coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered papal tiara with lappets and the crossed keys of Saint Peter with a cord. No other objects nor a motto was added. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind on heaven and earth (). Pope Benedict's arms maintain the keys, but replace the tiara with a mitre and add a pallium. However, the tiara and keys remain the symbol of the papacy, and appear on the coat of arms of the Holy See and (reversed) on the flag of Vatican City.\n\nIn Pope Benedict's arms, the tiara is replaced with a silver mitre with three gold stripes. These stripes recall the three crowns of the tiara, which came to represent the three powers of the Bishop of Rome: Orders, Jurisdiction and Magisterium. The stripes preserve that meaning and are joined at the centre to show their unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for “sovereign” (王).\n\nThe pallium with red crosses is also a new addition. It represents a bishop's role of being pastor of the flock entrusted to him by Christ. The form of the pallium included in the coat of arms recalls that used by metropolitan archbishops (but with black crosses) rather than the much larger pallium worn by Pope Benedict at his inauguration.\n\nSome have voiced objection to Pope Benedict's use of the mitre and pallium in his coat of arms, and the absence of the traditional papal tiara.\n\nTheir arguments include:\nRegardless of the validity of such arguments, the Pope, as supreme legislator and interpreter of Church law, had full authority to decide the form of his armorial bearings.\n\nSome claimed that Benedict's arms could still properly be rendered with the tiara and keys and without the pallium. This was done in the Vatican gardens behind St. Peter's Basilica, viewable from atop the dome. Shortly after the death of John Paul II, the contents of his shield were removed from the flowerbed, but the tiara was left in place. After the election of Benedict XVI, the gardeners put the design of the new Pope's arms within the shield, but rather than digging up the flowers depicting the tiara and replacing them with a mitre design, they left the tiara in place and omitted the pallium.\n\nIn a 2013 interview, Cardinal Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo, designer of the coat of arms, said that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms now that he was no longer the pontiff. “The problem now is whether the Pope Emeritus can keep that same coat of arms or not,”. “And as a person who has always dedicated himself to this, I say ‘no,’”. He drew up a new coat of arms, which he believed could be used now by the former pontiff. He moved the big keys of Saint Peter from the back of the coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller. “But this is only a proposal, it isn’t official,” Montezemolo qualified.\n\n"}

{"id": "5509726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5509726", "title": "Dezallier d'Argenville", "text": "Dezallier d'Argenville\n\nThe family of Dezallier d'Argenville produced two writers and connoisseurs in the course of the 18th century.\n\nAntoine-Joseph Dezallier d'Argenville (Paris, 1 July 1680 – 29 November 1765), avocat to the Parlement de Paris and secretary to the king, was a connoisseur of gardening who laid out two for himself and his family, before writing \"La théorie et la pratique du jardinage\" (published anonymously, 1709; second edition, 1713), based on his experience and his reading. The majority of the illustrations were by Jean-Baptiste Alexandre Le Blond, who was credited as the author in the third edition, 1722. As the work of a gentleman rather than a gardener, as previous French books on gardening had all been, Dezallier d'Argenville's work was laid out like a treatise of architecture, addressed as much to the architect and the patron as to the practising gardener. As its title suggests, the treatise is composed of two parts: the theoretical principles of the art of fine gardening and its practical applications. The first section considers the principles of siting the \"maison de plaisance\" relative to its gardens, techniques of laying out geometric figures in parterres, avenues and formal tree plantations (\"bosquets\"), and the planning of garden pavilions and the siting of sculpture, an essential element in the \"jardin français\". The second part applies the principles in earth works, terraces and stairs, and the hydraulics necessary for constructing \"jeux d'eau\": fountains, cascades, pools (\"bassins\") and canals.\n\nHis rational principles could adapt formal parterre gardening to the simplified programs available to the upper middle class, which accounts for the immense popularity of his book, which is the central document in the 18th century formal garden in the wake of André Le Nôtre. The work went through thirteen editions in France, where the English mode of landscape design scarcely made itself known before the French Revolution. It was published in a German version (1731) and translated into English by the architect John James, as \"The Theory and Practice of Gardening\" (1712, with a 2nd edition in 1728, and a 3rd edition in 1743, when the English landscape garden, might have seemed to make its formal designs passé.) Dezallier d'Argenville's \"Théorique\" in its English version introduced the Ha-ha, the invisible fence, to English practice.\n\nDezailler d'Argenville was called upon to edit or contribute more than 600 entries in the \"Encyclopédie\" of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert, published in parts from 1751.\n\nDezallier d'Argenville's interest in natural history resulted in two treatises, on shells and minerals, \"L'histoire naturelle éclaircie dans deux de ses parties principales, la lithologie et la conchyliologie\". (Paris 1742) \"La Conchyliologie, ou Traité sur la nature des coquillages\" 1757 etc.. The connoisseurship of shells and their most colourful and fantastic form was a gentleman's occupation and a worthy inclusion in a \"cabinet de curiosités\" before it became a science under the Linnaean system of classification.\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in March 1750.\n\nBeyond his success in the fields of gardening and natural history, Dezallier d'Argenville was a print collector. He organised his extensive collection by subject rather than by school, as outlined in the 'Lettre sur le choix et l'arrangement d'un Cabinet curieux…' that he published in the \"Mercure de France\" in 1727. Within the 'Lettre', which takes the form of an article, Dezallier d'Argenville describes 'Three volumes containing the clothing and fashion of the different nations of the world', and a further volume documenting costumes from his native France. The sale of Dezallier's property, which took place on 3 March 1766 following his death in 1765, mentions within these volumes a total of 1,600 costume prints from the time of King Charles II until 1730. It also describes 'good prints by le Clerc, Picart, Hollar, Royn de Hoog and several Chinese drawings.' All four volumes are now located at the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris.\n\nHis son, Antoine-Nicolas Dezallier d'Argenville (1723–1796), was the anonymous author \"(M. D***.)\" of \"Voyage Pictoresque de Paris; ou Indication de tout ce qu'il y a de plus beau dans cette grande Ville en Peinture, Sculpture, & Architecture\", which appeared in Paris in 1749, a connoisseur's guide to the chief artistic and architectural monuments of Paris, with accounts of the leading academic and scientific organisations of the city. At least six further editions appeared before the Revolution (Paris, 1752, 1757, 1765, 1770, 1778, 1780). A \"Voyage pittoresque des environs de Paris, ou Description des Maisons Royales, Châteaux & autres Lieux de Plaisance, situés à quinze lieues aux environs de cette Ville \" by the same author appeared in Paris in 1755, a connoiseur's guide to the chief artistic and architectural monuments of the surroundings of Paris in which the author especially paid a tribute to the triumphe of gardening. At least one further edition appeared before the Revolution (Paris, 1768, 3rd edition).\n\nFurther works were \"Dénombrement de tous les fossiles de France\" and \"L'Oryctologie ou Traité des pierres, des minéraux et autres fossiles\".\n\nHe compiled also the \"Vies des Fameux Architectes Depuis la renaissance des Arts\" in two volumes, 1787, of which the second was devoted to sculptors. An abridged edition (\"Abrégé de la vie...\") was often reprinted. A facsimile was published in Geneva 1972. He also wrote a \"Dictionnaire du jardinage, relatif à la théorie. et à la pratique de cet art\" (Paris, 1771) and a \"Manuel du jardinier ou journal de son travail distribué par mois,\" (Paris, 1772) \n\n\n"}

Numerous members of the family were recorded in the 15th and 16th centuries, and thereafter, with the title Prince.\n\nThe two lines of the family for which coherent genealogies are available (the family's \"central core\") descend from (i) Prince Aleksander (late 15th century) and (ii) Prince Bartłomiej (died in 1524).\n\nThe 1569 Act of Union inaugurating the Polish-Lithuanian Royal Commonwealth confirmed that, as previously in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Lithuanian families of dynastic origin remained entitled to use the title Prince. Many subsequent Giedroyć family members, both of the Line of Aleksander and of the Line of Bartłomiej, were recorded with the title Prince – including several (of both Lines) whose right to the title was individually confirmed under Imperial Russian legislation of 1832. Other members did not seek such specific confirmation under the Russian Empire, but relied on confirmation of their noble status and princely origins under Russian legislation of 1801/3. The Imperial Russian heraldic authority classified these as \"of the Princes\".\n\nUnder the usage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as confirmed by the 1569 Act of Union, princely origins in themselves establish princely status.\n\nThe Second Edition of the Lithuanian Chronicle records that a centaur was the armorial charge of the forebears of Giedrus.

Starting their hunt for regional American food in the early 1970s they were the first food writers to regard this food as being as worthy to report on as the haute cuisine of other nations. \n\nSince the Sterns began documenting regional American food in the 1970s many other writers and television personalities have used their pioneering work as inspiration. In addition to their early work with regional American food the Sterns' book \"Square Meals\" (Knopf 1985) put \"comfort foods\" like mac and cheese, meatloaf, and mashed potatoes on the culinary map. \"Square Meals\" did an audacious reverse spin on the tricked up and precious nouvelle cuisine that was beloved by food critics at that time. \n\nJane Grossman grew up in New York City, where she attended the Walden School and received a BFA in graphic design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Michael Stern grew up in Winnetka, Illinois, and graduated from the University of Michigan in 1968. They met as graduate students in art at Yale University and their first date, at Pepe's Pizza in New Haven, had a food focus. The couple married in 1970. The following year, Jane earned an MFA in painting from Yale and Michael changed schools and earned an MFA from Columbia University in film. Neither found work in their fields of study.\n\nAfter a short stint of producing documentaries for WNBC, a teaching job at Hunter College and another at Wesleyan University they began work on the book that eventually became the first \"Roadfood\". The book was conceived as a book on \"truck-stop dining,\" funded with an advance from a publisher. The Sterns set out in their car to travel through the United States and eat up to 12 meals daily at diners and local cafes. The resulting first edition of \"Roadfood\" was published in 1977; the most recent edition was released in 2017.\n\nIn addition to their food writing, the Sterns have written books on American popular culture, including \"The New York Times\" bestselling \"Elvis World\" (1987) and \"The Encyclopaedia of Bad Taste\" (1990). In all, they have written over 30 books. They were staff writers for \"Gourmet\" magazine for 18 years, have written for \"The New Yorker\", \"The Atlantic Monthly\", and are now contributing editors at \"Saveur\". \n\nThey are regular guests on American Public Media's public radio program, \"The Splendid Table\". They have won numerous awards, including James Beard awards, and were inducted into Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America in 1992. The Sterns founded Roadfood.com; the site was sold to Fexy Media in 2016. After the sale, the Sterns remained in charge of editorial content of their website.\n\nIn 2003, Jane Stern published \"Ambulance Girl: How I Saved Myself by Becoming an EMT\", a memoir in which she described suffering from severe clinical depression when she was in her early 50s and overcame her depression by training and working as an emergency medical technician in Connecticut. In 2005 the book was made into a television movie, \"Ambulance Girl\", for which actress Kathy Bates was nominated for an Emmy Award. The Sterns wrote a joint memoir, \"Two for the Road: Our Love Affair With American Food\", in 2006. \n\nThe couple divorced in 2008; they still write as a team. She now lives in Ridgefield, Connecticut; he and his present wife, Linda, reside in Aiken, South Carolina. \n\nIn 2011 the former couple published \"The Lexicon of Real American Food\", and Jane Stern published a book on her little known but long-standing career as a tarot card reader. \n\n\n"}

A 73-year-old ethnic Indian Singaporean man, Aravindan Balakrishnan, and a 67-year-old Tanzanian woman, his wife, Chanda Pattni, had been investigated for slavery and domestic servitude. The case centred around the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought commune which was led by Balakrishnan. In the early 1980s after a police raid, Balakrishnan decided to move the group's activities underground. Balakrishnan's control over his followers intensified and the commune became a prison to his followers. On 25 October 2013, three women were rescued from the commune. These were: a 69-year-old Malaysian woman (later revealed to be Aishah Wahab), a 57-year-old Irish woman (Josephine Herivel) and a 30-year-old British woman (Katy Morgan-Davies). Katy Morgan-Davies was born into the sect and hadn't experienced the outside world until her release.\n\nAravindan Balakrishnan (known to his followers as \"Comrade Bala\") was born in Kerala, India but migrated to Singapore, Malaya, where his father was a soldier, when he was 10. Balakrishnan was a student at Raffles Institution and later the University of Singapore, where although gaining a reputation as a \"quiet chap\", he became increasingly politically active and believed that he would have been imprisoned in Singapore had he openly admitted to being a communist. In 1977, while living in London, His Singaporean citizenship – which he gained in 1960 – was revoked due to his leadership of the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought, which the Ministry of Home Affairs accused of engaging in \"activities which are prejudicial to the security\" of Singapore, and denounced him as a radical \"closely associated with Eurocommunists\". The authorities claimed that Balakrishnan and others, many of them former Singaporean students he had associated with in London, were plotting to overthrow Singapore's leader, Lee Kuan Yew.\n\nDespite believing the United Kingdom to be a fascist state due to its treatment of the people of Singapore during the Malayan Emergency, Balakrishnan emigrated to the UK in 1963 on a British Council scholarship to study at the London School of Economics, and married his wife Chandra in 1971. Over the years he built up a following by giving lectures and staging various sit-ins and protests. He was a regular attendee at London demonstrations, where he waved banners depicting the Chinese leader Mao Zedong and addressed the crowds.\n\nIn 1974, Balakrishnan and his \"small clique\" were expelled from the Communist Party of England (Marxist–Leninist) on account of \"their pursuance of conspiratorial and splittist activities ... spreading social fascist slanders against the Party and the proletarian movement\" and attempting \"to put themselves above the discipline of the Party\". The CPE(M–L) \"repudiated the metaphysical logic harmfully promoted\" by Balakrishnan in \"opposition to dialectical materialism and the concrete analysis of concrete conditions\". In response, Balakrishnan set up the Workers' Institute and launched his own publication, the \"South London Workers' Bulletin\", which accused the CPE(M–L) of being \"fascists\" and \"agents of imperialism\".\n\nBetween 1974 and 1976, his followers attempted to \"build revolutionary stable base areas in working-class communities\", primarily South London, and worked in ordinary jobs. Balakrishnan discouraged his followers from joining trade unions, describing them as agents of the \"imperialist fascist bourgeoisie\".\n\nEventually, after the more liberal members of his group drifted away, a cult of around 10 female members formed around him. The collective moved to Brixton in 1976, under the title Workers Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. Following Mao's death in 1976, the Institute built the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre at 140 Acre Lane, Brixton, which also functioned as a communist collective of \"thirteen comrades\", with \"13 members living on the premises, half in paid work, six doing full-time revolutionary work, with a strong emphasis on women taking a leading role (apart from leading the Party Committee headed by Bala)\". Members were handed a rota of chores and only allowed to go out in pairs, which Balakrishnan claimed was because the area they lived in was \"notorious for violence\" and \"anything could happen\".\n\nFollowing a police raid on the Memorial Centre in March 1978, which the group claimed involved \"over 200 police\", including officers from the Special Patrol Group, \"under the pretext of searching for drugs\", the Workers' Institute effectively went underground, with the remaining members being convinced to end all contact with others and maintain an intense level of secrecy. Family members were later branded fascist agents and ostracised, and Balakrishnan and his captives moved to a number of properties during this time as a means for him to escape detection from the authorities. Balakrishnan convinced his followers that everything was controlled by him from the sun, the moon, wind and fires; that he could overthrow governments, control natural disasters, and make people live or die. In order to progress his cause, Balakrishnan invented \"JACKIE\" (an acronym for Jehovah, Allah, Christ, Krishna and Immortal Easwaran) – a type of dangerous, mystical machine that monitored all thought and could control minds. \n\nBalakrishnan began sexually abusing two of the women in 1979, often physically beating them and making others watch as he did so. All of the women were beaten and four (not including his wife) were said to have been sexually assaulted or engaged with sexual relations with him. Balakrishnan forced the women to swallow his ejaculate as it was \"the elixir of life\", and claimed the women he sexually abused had been trying to seduce him out of \"jealousy\" for his lover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two older victims are believed to have met Balakrishnan in London through, according to police, a shared political ideology, as he was the leader of the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought. The women were not being physically restrained, but held by \"invisible handcuffs\" after being subjected to brainwashing, emotional abuse and physical abuse by their captors. \nThe three women, who are not related, are said to have been held captive for more than 30 years with the youngest of the three thought to have spent her whole life in servitude. However it has not yet been established if she was born in the house from where she was rescued. The police were tipped off by Freedom Charity who contacted police following a phone call they had received on 18 October, during which a woman stated that she'd been held unwillingly for more than 30 years. Aneeta Prem of Freedom Charity confirmed that the Irish woman made contact with the charity after watching the ITV television documentary \"Forced to Marry\" about forced marriage in the United Kingdom. The women, who are said to be \"highly traumatised\", are now in safe accommodation.\n\nThe two suspects were bailed until April 2014, and were unable to return to the three-bedroom flat they rented from a housing association.\n\nOn 11 December 2014, it emerged that Balakrishnan had been charged with offences relating to cruelty to a person under 16, four counts of rape and 17 counts of indecent assault. Balakrishnan appeared before Westminster magistrates on 17 December 2014. His wife, Chanda Pattni, was released earlier in 2014, as there was considered to be insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. \n\nBalakrishnan's trial started on 11 November 2015. During his trial, he acted as the only defence witness, and told jurors that a challenge to his leadership resulted in the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, and that JACKIE was responsible for the death of a Malaysian prime minister and the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Leader of the Labour Party.\n\nOn 4 December 2015, Balakrishnan was convicted of child cruelty, false imprisonment, four counts of rape, six counts of indecent assault and two counts of assault. On 29 January 2016, Balakrishnan was jailed for 23 years. \n"}

{"id": "1702660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1702660", "title": "List of wives of King Henry VIII", "text": "List of wives of King Henry VIII\n\nIn legal terms, King Henry VIII of England had only three wives, because three of his putative marriages were annulled. Unlike a divorce, where a married couple chooses to end their union, annulments essentially declare that a true marriage never took place. However, in common parlance, the so-called wives of Henry VIII were the six queens consort wedded to Henry between 1509 and his death in 1547.\n\nThe six women who were married to Henry VIII were, in chronological order:\n\nHenry's first marriage lasted nearly 24 years; the five that followed less than 10 years combined.\n\nA common mnemonic device to remember the fates of Henry's consorts is \"Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived\". There are also two rhymes:\n\nand\n\nIt is often noted that Catherine Parr \"survived him.\" In fact, Anne of Cleves also survived the king, and was the last of his queens to die. Of the six queens, Katherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, and Jane Seymour each gave Henry one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children would eventually ascend to the throne: King Edward VI, Queen Mary I, and Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nCatherine Howard and Anne Boleyn, the two of Henry's queens who were beheaded, were first cousins. Several of Henry's wives worked in at least one of his other wives' service, typically as ladies-in-waiting: Anne Boleyn worked in Catherine of Aragon's service, Jane Seymour worked in Catherine of Aragon's and Anne Boleyn's, and Catherine Howard worked in Anne of Cleves's.\n\nHenry and at least four of his wives (Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, and Catherine Parr) were portrayed in opera.\n\nKatherine of Aragon (16 December 14857 January 1536; ) was Henry's first wife. Although her name is sometimes spelled \"Catherine\", Katherine of Aragon spelled and signed her name with a \"K,\" which was the accepted spelling in England. After the death of Arthur, her first husband and Henry's brother, a papal dispensation was obtained to enable her to marry Henry, though the marriage did not take place until after he came to the throne in 1509. Prospects were looking good when Katherine became pregnant in 1510, just 4 months after their marriage, but the girl was stillborn. Katherine became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to a boy, Henry, Duke of Cornwall, who died almost two months later. In 1513, Katherine gave birth to a stillborn boy, and gave birth to a boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally, Katherine bore him a healthy daughter in 1516, Mary. It took her two years to conceive again. This pregnancy ended in a short-lived girl. It is said that Henry truly loved Katherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times in declarations, etc.\n\nHenry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an annulment on the grounds that his marriage was invalid because Katherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21) to justify his stance: \"If a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.” \nHenry had begun an affair with Anne Boleyn, who is said to have refused to become his mistress (Henry had already consummated an affair then dismissed Anne's sister, Mary Boleyn, and most historians believe that Anne wanted to avoid the same treatment). Despite the pope's refusal, Henry separated from Katherine in 1531. In the face of the Pope's continuing refusal to annul his marriage to Katherine, Henry ordered the highest church official in England, Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, to convene a court to rule on the status of his marriage to Katherine. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer ruled the marriage to Katherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows, probably in late January 1533). This led to the break from the Roman Catholic Church and the later establishment of the Church of England.\nShakespeare called Katherine \"The Queen of Earthly Queens.\"\n\nMarriage to Henry VIII: 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 (23 years, 11 months, 19 days); marriage annulled.\n\nAnne Boleyn (c.1501/150719 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of Elizabeth I. Henry's marriage to Anne, and her subsequent execution, made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that was the start of the English Reformation. The daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), Anne was of nobler birth than Jane Seymour, Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired, with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a lady-in-waiting to Queen Claude of France.\n\nAnne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her in 1526 and she refused to become his mistress, as her sister, Mary Boleyn, had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife, Catherine of Aragon, so he could marry Anne. Evidence of intimacy between the King and Anne is found in a love letter written by the King, in which he expressed admiration for her \"pretty duckies\" (breasts). When it became clear that Pope Clement VII was unlikely to give the king an annulment, the breaking of the power of the Roman Catholic Church in England began.\n\nHenry had Thomas Wolsey dismissed from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain, Thomas Cranmer, appointed Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service. She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service, which took place in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of excommunication against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the Church of England was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.\nAnne was crowned Queen Consort of England on 1 June 1533. Later that year, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Henry's second daughter, Elizabeth. When Anne failed to quickly produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, the King grew tired of her, annulled their marriage, and a plot was hatched by Thomas Cromwell to execute her.\n\nAlthough the evidence against her was unconvincing, Anne was beheaded on charges of adultery, incest, and high treason on 19 May 1536. Following her daughter Elizabeth's coronation as queen, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of John Foxe. Over the centuries, Anne has inspired or been mentioned in numerous artistic and cultural works.\n\nMarriage to Henry VIII: 28 May 153317 May 1536 (2 years, 11 months, 19 days); annulled, then beheaded.\n\nJane Seymour (c.roughly 150824 October 1537) was Henry's third wife. She served Catherine of Aragon and was one of Anne Boleyn's ladies-in-waiting. It is strongly believed that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 10–11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Finally, a year later, Jane gave birth to a healthy, legitimate male heir, Edward, but she died twelve days later, presumably because of post-natal complications. This apparently caused her husband genuine grief, as she was the only queen to receive a proper Queen's burial; when the King died in 1547, he was buried next to her.\n\nMarriage to Henry VIII: 30 May 153624 October 1537 (1 year, 4 months, 24 days); death from complications of childbirth.\n\nAnne of Cleves (22 September 151516 July 1557) was Henry's fourth wife, for only six months in 1540, from 6 January to 9 July. Anne of Cleves was a German princess. It has been stated that Henry referred to her as \"A Flanders Mare\", which may or may not be true; nevertheless, the label has stuck with Anne. Her pre-contract of marriage with Francis I, Duke of Lorraine, was cited as grounds for an annulment. Anne agreed to this, claiming that the marriage had not been consummated, and because she hadn't resisted the annulment, was given a generous settlement, including Hever Castle, former home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns. She was given the name \"The King's Sister\", and became a friend to him and his children until his death. She outlived both the King and his last two wives, making her the last of the six wives to die.\n\nMarriage to Henry VIII: 6 January 15409 July 1540 (6 months, 3 days); annulled.\n\nCatherine Howard (c.152113 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540–1542, sometimes known as \"the rose without a\nthorn\". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with Thomas Culpeper on 1 November 1541.\n\nMarriage to Henry VIII: 28 July 154023 November 1541 (1 year, 3 months, 26 days); beheaded.\n\nCatherine Parr (15125 September 1548), also spelled Kateryn, was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, 1543–1547. She was the daughter of Sir Thomas Parr of Kendal and his wife Maud Green. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of John of Gaunt, son of King Edward III. Through John of Gaunt's daughter Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, the two were also fourth cousins once removed.\n\nCatherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers. Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an act that confirmed both Mary's and Elizabeth's line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the war in France and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old Edward came of age.\n\nCatherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married Thomas Seymour, uncle of Edward VI of England, to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, Mary, and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.\n\nMarriage to Henry VIII: 12 July 154328 January 1547 (3 years, 6 months, 16 days); his death at the age of 55.\n\nHenry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King Edward I of England, through more than one ancestor.\n\nThe following family tree of Henry VIII's six wives is the closest lineage of him.\n\n"}

The Moon's surface is a complex mixture of dark areas (the lunar \"maria\", or \"seas\") and lighter areas (the highlands). Many cultures have seen shapes in these dark and light areas that have reminded them of people, animals or objects, often related to their folklore; the most famous are the Man in the Moon in Western folklore and the Moon Rabbit of Asia and the Americas. Other cultures perceive the silhouette of a woman, a frog, a moose, a buffalo, or a dragon (with its head and mouth to the right and body and wings to the left) in the full moon. Alternatively, the vague shape of the overall dark and light regions can resemble a Yin Yang symbol.\n\nThe Man in the Moon is an imaginary figure resembling a human face, head or body, that observers from some cultural backgrounds typically perceive in the bright disc of the full moon.\n\nIn Chinese culture, the rabbit in the moon (a companion of Chang'e) is pounding medicine. Similarly, in Japan and Korea, popular culture sees a rabbit making mochi and tteok, respectively, in the moon.\n\nIn Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica the rabbit is often associated with the moon, for example, Tecciztecatl, the Aztec moon god, was pictured as an anthropomorphic rabbit; there is also a myth involving Quetzalcoatl and the moon rabbit.\n\nIn Elizabethan England, the spots of the Moon were supposed to represent a witch carrying sticks of wood on her back, or an old man with a lantern (which was illustrated by Shakespeare in his comedy \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\"). A more recent Western image is the profile of a coiffed woman wearing a jeweled pendant, the jewel being the crater Tycho, which at full moon is very bright and has bright radiating lines (rays). In New Zealand Māori legend, the moon shows a woman with a local tree, the \"Ngaio\". However, throughout Melanesia and Polynesia, the moon is seen to be a cook over a three-stone fire.\n\nIn Chinese Mythology, Chang'e (various spellings) lives on the moon. She was mentioned in the conversation between Houston Capcom and Apollo 11 crew just before the first moon landing:\n\"The toad was seen by Chinese Taoists as ... the moon, representing Chang-O, the transformed wife of Yi, the excellent archer. ... According to Robert M. DeGraaff, in some representations of the moon-toad, the \"ling chih\" fungus is shown growing out of the creature's forehead.\"\n\nShia Muslims believe that the name of Ali Ibne-Abi Talib (Muhammad's son in law) is written on the moon. This interpretation has roots in several hadith by Muhammad where he compares Ali to the moon and himself to the sun. There are also other esoteric interpretations of this analogy in Islamic philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His name, \"Magnes\", the Latin word for \"magnetite\", has been attributed as the origin of the Latin root that has passed into English, giving its speakers the words \"magnet\", \"magnetism\", the mentioned ore, and related formulations. Other authorities have attributed the word origin to other sources.\n\nAs set out in Pliny's \"Naturalis Historia\" (\"Natural History\"), an early encyclopedia published c. 77 CE – c. 79 CE, and as translated from the Latin in Robert Jacobus Forbes' \"Studies in Ancient Technology\", Pliny wrote the following (attributing the source of his information, in turn, to Nicander of Colophon):\nNicander is our authority that it [magnetite ore] was called Magnes from the man who first discovered it on Mount Ida and he is said to have found it when the nails of his shoes and the ferrule of his staff adhered to it, as he was pasturing his herds.\nThe passage appears at Book XXXVI of \"Naturalis Historia\", covering \"The Natural History of Stones\", at chapter 25 entitled \"The Magnet: Three Remedies\". Although Pliny's description is often cited, the story of Magnes the shepherd is postulated by physicist Gillian Turner to be much older, dating from approximately 900 BCE.\nAny writings Nicander may have made on the subject have since been lost.\n\nWritten in approximately 600 CE, book XVI of \"Etymologiae\" by Isidore of Seville tells the same story as Pliny, but places Magnes in India. This is repeated in Vincent of Beauvais' \"Miroir du Monde\" (c. 1250 CE) and in Thomas Nicols' 1652 work, \"Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones\", wherein he describes Magnes as a \"shepherd of India, who was wont to keep his flocks about those mountains in India, where there was an abundance of lodestones\".\n\nFollowing from Pliny's account, the shepherd's name has been often cited as giving rise to the Latin root word and etymological source of the English word for magnet and the coterie of its related word forms such as \"magnetite\", \"magnet\", \"magnetism\", \"magnesium\", \"manganese\" and others. Other authorities, including the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius (c. 99 BCE – c. 55 BCE), have attributed the etymology of \"magnet\", and progeny, to the name of the Lydian city, Magnesia ad Sipylum (Manisa, Turkey in modern times), where magnetic ore may have first been discovered or recognized. Other ancient locations have been attributed as the origin, including the Greek province Thracian Magnesia, and the Ionian city of Magnesia ad Maeandrum.\n\nThe idea that the legend of Magnes the shepherd could be the origin of \"magnet\", et al., and the legend itself has been criticized. Pliny's story is characterized in Gillian Turner's book \"North Pole, South Pole: The Epic Quest to Solve the Great Mystery of Earth’s Magnetism\" (2011) as \"no doubt embellished by centuries of retelling.\" In the 1896 treatise \"Coil and Current; or the Triumphs of Electricity\", the authors write: 'Magnet' is derived from the legend of Magnes, or from the territory of Magnesia. Pliny states that Magnes, the shepherd, discovered it, and the legend told of him is that while carrying a message over Mount Ida he felt his feet clinging to the earth, to the iron ore which lay thickly upon the hill. Hence the name of the Magnet. But Magnesia was a territory whence this native iron was for hundreds of years exported, and the name \"Magnet\" is, no doubt, due to this place.\n\n"}
{"id": "368048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=368048", "title": "Middle name", "text": "Middle name\n\nIn several cultures, a middle name is a portion of a personal name that is written between the person's given name and their surname. A person may be given a middle name regardless of whether it's necessary to distinguish them from other people with the same given name and surname. In cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, additional names are likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname, and thus called middle names. In English-speaking American culture, that term is often applied (arguably mistakenly) to names occupying that position even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a \"middle name\", and is actually (to mention several types of common cases): \nIn the United States, such names are specifically referred to as middle names; in most other countries, as far as they are given names and not, for example, patronymics, they would simply be regarded as second, third etc. given names. In the U.S., the \"middle name\" is often abbreviated to the middle initial (e.g. Mary Lee Bianchi becomes Mary L. Bianchi, which is usually standard for signatures) or omitted entirely in everyday use (e.g. just Mary Bianchi). An individual may have more than one middle name, or none. In the United Kingdom, for comparison, she would usually be referred to as either Mary Bianchi, M. L. Bianchi or Mary Lee Bianchi, or she may choose Lee Bianchi, and informally there may be familiar shortenings.\n\nIt is debatable how long multiple given names have existed in English-speaking countries, but it is certain that among royalty and aristocracy the practice existed by the late 17th century (and possibly earlier), as exemplified in the name of the Stuart pretender James Francis Edward Stuart (1688–1766).\n\nDespite their relatively long existence in North America, the phrase \"middle name\" was not recorded until 1835, in the periodical \"Harvardiana\".\n\nThe use of multiple middle names has been somewhat impeded recently by the increased use of computer databases that occasionally allow for only a single middle name or more commonly a middle initial in storing personal records, effectively preventing people with multiple middle names from being listed in such databases under their full name. This is worsened by longer compound names, like María del Pilar Pereyra or María de las Nieves García.\n\nThe abbreviation \"N.M.N.\" (no middle name) or \"N.M.I.\" (no middle initial), with or without periods, is sometimes used in formal documents in the United States, where a middle initial or name is expected but the person does not have one. The middle name can also be a maiden name.\n\nSince 1905, \"middle name\" has also developed a figurative usage meaning a notable or outstanding attribute of a person, as in the phrase \"discretion is my middle name.\"\n\nIn countries that primarily speak English—such as Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom—the forename of a relative is sometimes used as one's middle name to honor familial heritage. In many cases in the United States, however, a person's middle name has little or no lineage-related context, and is used instead to honor close family friends or notable public figures.\n\nIn the United States, those who choose to be known primarily by their middle name may abbreviate their first name as an initial, e.g. J. Edgar Hoover (John Edgar Hoover). Others simply omit the first name, like Woodrow Wilson (Thomas Woodrow Wilson). A rare case of an individual being given only an initial as a middle name, with the initial not explicitly standing for anything, was Harry S. Truman. (He once told reporters—apparently at odds with his own practice—that the S should thus not be followed by period.)\n\nMore than two given names are fairly common. In England they are traditionally more common among the \"upper classes\" and \"middle classes\". Examples are J. R. R. Tolkien, W.E.B. Du Bois, George H. W. Bush.\n\nMiddle names can also be used as first names. Major examples are Paul McCartney, Mitt Romney, Dakota Fanning, Elle Fanning, Sylvester Stallone, Jonathan Demme, Riley Keough, Reese Witherspoon, Hayley Orrantia, Brad Pitt, Ashton Kutcher, Meghan Markle, Rihanna, Scott Chandler, Nomar Garciaparra, Bill Mumy, Roger Waters and Jim Acosta.\n\nTraditionally, Chinese names consisted of three characters—the surname, followed by a two-character given name (\"ming\"), which is not separated into a first and middle name in usage. Two-character given names follow a naming tradition in which the first character of the given name (and thus the second character in the three-character full name) indicates the person's generation in his/her family. For example, the Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing dynasty has the given name \"Yinzhen\" (胤禛) while his brothers' names all begin with the character \"Yin\" (胤). His sons' and nephews' given names all begin with the character \"Hong\" (弘). Traditionally, the list of generational names may be decided many generations in advance by the ancestors. In such naming systems, the de facto given name is the last character of a person's full name. Even if that was the case most of the time, sometimes the person's given name is the middle character and not the last. A three-character name is both patriarchal and hierarchical, as it would inform of a person's belonging and rank within a family. During the One-child Policy, there was no need for a generation name as there was only one child in each generation. Many names in Mainland China were shortened to two-characters during this time, and there are many adults with shorter names remnant from this era. This would not be found in Taiwan or Hong Kong.\n\nA fading Chinese tradition is to use a courtesy name, called \"zì\" (字) in place of a male's given name in adulthood. Traditionally \"zì\" is given by one's father upon reaching the age of maturity at 20 years old. This name is intended for use in formal situations and formal writing and confers a status of adulthood and respect. Like the \"ming\", the \"zì\" is composed of two characters which usually reflect the meaning of the \"ming\". Prior to the 20th century, sinicized Koreans, Vietnamese, and Japanese were also referred to by their \"zì\". An alternative courtesy name is the \"hào\" (; Japanese gō; Korean: ho; Vietnamese: hiệu), which usually referred to as the pseudonym. A \"hào\" was usually self-chosen and it was possible to have more than one. It had no connection with the bearer's \"míng\" or \"zì\"; rather it was often a personal choice and may have reflected a personal belief or philosophy. Chinese adults may more frequently use the \"hào\" to refer to themselves. The \"zì\" or \"hào\" can be used independently of the given name and of each other, but the given name is almost always used with the family name in official situations.\n\nSome Chinese Americans move their Chinese given name (transliterated into the Latin alphabet) to the middle name position and use an English first name, e.g. James Chu-yu Soong, Jerry Chih-Yuan Yang, and Michelle Wingshan Kwan. The Chinese given name usually has two characters which are usually combined into a single middle name for better organizational purposes, especially with Cantonese names, such as Bruce Lee's middle name, Junfan. There are also some new immigrants whose Chinese given names are their first names followed by English middle names.\n\nThe practice of taking English and Chinese given names is also common in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. However, rather than placing the Chinese given name between the English given name and the family name, it is commonly placed after the family name in these places. Under such a system, Bruce Junfan Lee would have been Bruce Lee Junfan. This practice is consistent with both the Western convention of putting the given name before the family name and the Chinese convention of putting the given name after the family name.\n\nIn Denmark and Norway, the term middle name refers to names that are originally surnames, but not part of the last name of the name bearer. The term middle name does not refer to additional given names, which are instead referred to as given names. A middle name could be e.g. one's mother's maiden name or the last name of another recent ancestor (for instance a grandparent). One can have several middle names, but it is unusual to have more than one or two. In law, middle names have a separate status. In practice, their status is similar to that of additional given names, and middle names are often omitted in everyday use, just like a person with 3 or 4 given names would only use one of them in most situations. The historical purpose of middle names is to honour some related family or person, a godparent, or even a completely unrelated person, such as a locally or nationally prominent figure. Until the 19th century, it was not unusual to have the last name of a godparent as one's middle name, even when the godparent was not a blood relative. This practice, and the use of middle names in general, however, was mostly limited to the bourgeois class and the nobility, and was seldom seen among common people. In the 20th century, the use of middle names, especially one's mother's maiden name, was more widely adopted, although it is by no means mandatory. There are few set rules for how names are constructed today; people are required to have one given name and one family name, but can have as many additional given names and middle names as they like.\n\nIn the example Carl Viggo Manthey Lange, the names Carl and Viggo are given names, while Manthey is a middle name and Lange is the family name. Manthey is his mother's maiden name. Unless his full name is used, he is correctly referred to as Mr. Lange, not as Mr. Manthey Lange. Carl Viggo Manthey Lange has a name typical of the Norwegian bourgeois class, with both his family name and his middle name being of foreign origin and being recognised surnames. Most Norwegians and Danes of the working class and peasant class used patronymics until the 19th century, when permanent family names became mandatory, first in Denmark in the early 19th century and then in Norway around 1900. A middle name is usually a recognised surname and not a patronymic. One reason middle names have become popular in the 20th century, particularly in Denmark, is that most Danish surnames originated as patronymics and are shared by a large number of people. The use of middle names in modern times serves to differentiate them from other people. For example, Danish politician Lars Løkke Rasmussen has some of the most common given and last names in Denmark (Lars and Rasmussen); his mother's maiden name is the slightly more unusual name Løkke, derived from a small agricultural property, so he uses it as a middle name, which differentiates him from other people named Lars Rasmussen.\n\nIn Sweden, the position is much the same as in Denmark. Middle names were inaugurated in the previous Name Act of 1963, then called \"tilläggsnamn\" (additional name), and are called \"mellannamn\" (middle name) as of the present Name Act of 1983. However, it had previously been more common to join e.g. the last names of both of a child's parents, or for a married woman to join her maiden name and the husband's last name, as a double name with a hyphen; and large portions of the Swedish population have not adapted to the official system to this day, i.e. for almost 50 years. People often use a hyphen between their middle name and last name themselves, and/or are spelled that way by other people and by mass media.\n\nFurthermore, when the term middle name was introduced in Swedish (\"mellannamn\") the word was assumed by many to mean the additional given names (apart from the \"name of address\" (\"tilltalsnamn\")), so since 1983 the word is being used more and more in this, officially, erratic meaning.\n\nOccasionally, Scandinavians choose to use their middle name as their surname in everyday life. So Per Gottfrid Svartholm Warg has Per and Gottfrid as his given names, where Gottfrid, not Per, is his name of address, Svartholm as his middle name and Warg as his last name, but in practice he uses Svartholm as a surname. This usage, however, is unofficial. Historically, a middle name could become part of a double-barreled surname (family name) and hence cease to be a middle name, especially if used for several generations. There are many family names of this kind, which contributes to the confusion about middle names that shall not be hyphenated. Some of these double-barreled surnames are combined with a hyphen, while others are not, so a double surname without a hyphen can sometimes be indistinguishable from a middle name followed by a family name.\n\nIn Scandinavia, there is no limit on how many given names one can have. Given names have never been referred to as middle names, apart from many in Sweden believing so, as mentioned above. The use of more than two or three given names is generally associated with the upper class. The first given name is not necessarily the name of address. For the sake of completeness, Swedish forms often ask people to fill in all their given names and to indicate which one is their \"name of address\" (\"tilltalsnamn\").\n\nTraditional middle names in Vietnamese are \"Văn\" for male names and \"Thị\" for female names. However, modern Vietnamese do not consider these to be attractive names, especially \"Thị\". Therefore, nowadays popular middle names also are popular first names. Middle names play an important role in Vietnamese full names; they could help creating beautiful names when combine with first names, distinguishing people who have the same first name (there are many common last names in Vietnam), and also distinguishing the gender of the names (unisex names are used widely in Vietnam). Hence, Vietnamese rarely abbreviate their middle names.\n\nFor Filipinos, the middle name is usually the maternal surname, which is the maiden surname of a person's mother. The use of the maternal surname as middle name is from American influence, where Filipinos adopted English naming customs, when they once used Spanish naming customs, that used two surnames (paternal and maternal) joined with the particle \"y\" (or \"e\", before \"i\"), which remains in use but became restricted to very formal purposes, police records and legal proceedings. In the Spanish naming system, the middle name corresponds to the maternal surname. The middle name (or the maternal surname) is usually being abbreviated to a middle initial. Thus, a person with the full name \"Juan Santos Macaraig\", with \"Santos\" the middle name in the present order, may become \"Juan S. Macaraig\" with the middle name abbreviated, and \"Juan Macaraig y Santos\" in the Spanish system, such as those used in names on police records, especially those seen on name placards held by a convicted person on official mug shots. The Philippine system, using \"given name-middle name-surname\" order (or \"Christian name-mother's surname-father's surname\") coincidentally follows the Portuguese naming system that uses two surnames, the first being maternal and the second being paternal.\n\nBut, the maternal surname may not be the middle name at some cases. It may be a second given name, like what the term really means, as in \"Jose P. Laurel\", where \"P.\" (a middle initial) corresponds to \"Paciano\".\n\nIn illegitimate children, the middle name is the maiden surname of the mother, and the middle name (maternal surname) of the mother as surname, but the surname become of the father's upon legal and administrative acknowledgement by his/her father. Children of a single father takes no middle name, even when the mother's identity is known. \n\nTo illustrate that, the daughter of an unmarried couple named \"Ana Cristina dela Cruz Manansala\" and \"Jose Maria Panganiban Lozada\", named '\"Maria Cristina'\", will be named \"Maria Cristina Manansala dela Cruz\" (or \"Ma. Cristina M. dela Cruz\"), with Ana Cristina's middle name, \"dela Cruz\", as surname. But once Jose Maria wants to acknowledge her as his child legally and administratively, Maria Cristina will take the surname \"Lozada\", but keep the maternal surmame \"Manansala\" as middle name, thus, \"Maria Cristina Manansala Lozada\" (or \"Ma. Cristina M. Lozada\"). As the daughter of only Jose Maria, Maria Cristina will be rather called \"Maria Cristina Lozada\" or \"Ma. Cristina Lozada\", even when the mother is known.\n\nIn married women, the middle name usually corresponds to the maiden surname, but on professional society, women usually add the husband's surname after their maiden name, keeping the maternal surname. A married woman may decline taking the husband's surname and keep her maiden name as no Philippine law compels women to take her husband's surname. Thus, a woman named \"Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco\" (or \"Ma. Concepcion P. Limchauco\"), once marrying \"Juan Pablo Sanchez Marasigan\" (or \"Juan Pablo S. Marasigan\") may take the name \"Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco-Marasigan\" (or \"Ma. Concepcion P. Limchauco-Marasigan\"), maintaining the maternal surname \"Perez\", \"Maria Concepcion Limchauco Marasigan\" (or \"Ma. Concepcion L. Marasigan\"), taking the maiden surname \"Limchauco\" as middle name and \"Marasigan\" as married surname, or keep her maiden names, remaining \"Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco\" upon marriage.\n\nIn Argentina, most people have a middle name. According to a study, approximately 9 out of 10 Argentines born in 2010 had a middle name given to them. It used to be even more common in the past, as it is an old tradition. It's very common to use the name of a grandparent as middle name. It is termed \"segundo nombre\" (lit. second name). However, its widespread use is slowly shrinking due to the influence of neighboring countries..\n\nActually, most of south-american, especially Hispanic citizens are acquainted with the use of compound given names, such as Maria + (second given name) or Juan + (given name), among others. This is often considered a useful way of distinguishing from similar or identical names considering that Spanish-derived surnames are strikingly common in some cultural regions (e.g. Luis Fernandez can be better distinguished if arranged as Luis Antonio Fernandez, José Luis Fernandez, Luis Eduardo Fernandez, etc.).\n\n\n"}

From this family three Professors of Anatomy at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland were produced, as well as several other doctors and military officers.\n\nThe progenitor of the Munros of Auchinbowie is generally regarded as Alexander Munro of Bearcrofts who served as a major in an infantry regiment and saw action at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. He later took up a career of politics. His ancestry can be traced to Andrew Munro, 4th of Milntown who descends from Hugh Munro, 9th Baron of Foulis (d.1425), an early chief of the Clan Munro of Ross-shire, Scotland.\n\nAlexander Munro of Bearcrofts had seven children:\n\n\nGeorge Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie had three children:\n\n\nAlexander Munro, 2nd of Auchinbowie (d.1742) had nine children: \n\nGeorge Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie had two sons:\n\n\nAlthough George Munro, 3rd of Auchinbowie had male heirs as mentioned above, he sold the Auchinbowie property to a cousin, Alexander Monro (primus) who was the son of John Monro (surgeon), who was in turn a younger brother of George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie. Alexander Monro (primus) was the founder of the Edinburgh Medical School. He was appointed lecturer on Anatomy by the Surgeons' Company at Edinburgh in 1719; two years later he became professor, and in 1725 was admitted to the University. He was a principal promoter and early clinical lecturer in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.

However he was succeeded in his profession by his third son Alexander Monro (secundus) who was Professor of Anatomy in Edinburgh. He took his degree as Doctor of Medicine on 20 October 1775. He then proceeded to his studies abroad. He spent a short time in London, where he attended the lectures of Dr William Hunter. He next visited Paris and on 17 September 1757 entered Leiden University where he formed a friendship with two famous anatomists, Bernhard Siegfried Albinus and Petrus Camper. However his foreign studies were principally prosecuted at Berlin, where he worked under the celebrated Professor Meckel, in whose house he lived. Alexander spent some time in Edinburgh during early 1757 in order to fill the place of his father, who was confined to the house by illness.

Amongst his publications are \"Outlines of the Anatomy of the Human Body\" (1811) in four volumes and \"Elements of Anatomy\" (1825) in two volumes. He was Secretary of the Royal College of Physicians from 1809 to 1819 and President in 1827 and 1828. He was also on the Council of the Wernerian Natural History Society of which he became a member in 1811.

{"id": "1765709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1765709", "title": "Papal coats of arms", "text": "Papal coats of arms\n\nPapal coats of arms are the personal coat of arms of popes of the Catholic Church. These have been a tradition since the Late Middle Ages, and has displayed his own, initially that of his family, and thus not unique to himself alone, but in some cases composed by him with symbols referring to his past or his aspirations. This personal coat of arms coexists with that of the Holy See.\n\nAlthough Pope Boniface VIII (1294-1303), Pope Eugene IV (1431-1447), Pope Adrian VI (1522-1523) and a few others used no crest above their escutcheon, from Pope John XXII (1316-1334) onward the papal tiara began to appear (a custom maintained until Pope Nicholas V) and, from the time of Nicholas V's successor, Pope Callistus III (1455-1458), the tiara combined with the keys of Peter.\n\nEven before the early modern period, a man who did not have a family coat of arms would assume one upon becoming a bishop, as men did when knighted or on achieving some other prominence. Some who already had an episcopal coat of arms altered it on being elected to the papal throne. The last pope who was elected without already being a bishop was Pope Gregory XVI in 1831 and the last who was not even a priest when elected was Pope Leo X in 1513.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century, heraldists also made up fictitious coats of arms for earlier popes, especially of the 11th and 12th centuries. This became more restrained by the end of the 17th century.\n\nPapal coats of arms are traditionally shown with an image of the papal tiara and the keys of Peter as an external ornament of the escutcheon. The tiara is usually set above the escutcheon, while the keys are in saltire, passing behind it (formerly also \"en cimier\", below the tiara and above the shield). In modern times, the dexter and sinister keys are usually shown in gold (or) and silver (argent), respectively. The first depiction of a tiara, still with a single coronet, in connection with papal arms, is on the tomb of Boniface VIII (d. 1303) in the basilica of S. John Lateran.\nBenedict XVI in 2005 deviated from tradition in replacing the tiara with the mitre and pallium (see Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI).\n\nThe two keys have been given the interpretation of representing the power to bind and to loose on earth (silver) and in heaven (gold), in reference to :\nThe gold key signifies that the power reaches to heaven and the silver key that it extends to all the faithful on earth, the interlacing indicating the linking between the two aspects of the power, and the arrangement with the handles of the keys at the base symbolizes that the power is in the hands of the pope.\n\nThe oldest known representation of the crossed keys beneath the papal tiara in the Coats of arms of the Holy See dates from the time of Pope Martin V (1417–1431). His successor Pope Eugene IV (1431–1447) included it in the design of a silver coin.\nMartin V also included the keys in his personal arms (those of the Colonna family); however he did not show them as external ornaments, instead placing them in chief on the shield (this example was followed by Urban V and VIII and Alexander VII; Nicolas V seems to have used just the crossed keys and the tiara in an escutcheon. The placing of the keys above the shield becomes the fashion in the early 16th century, so shown on the tomb of Pius III (d. 1503). Adrian VI (1522/3) placed the keys in saltire behind the shield.\n\nHeraldry developed out of military insignia from the time of the First Crusade. \n\nThe first papal coats of arms appeared when heraldry began to be codified in the 12th to 13th centuries. \nAt first, the popes simply used the secular coat of arms of their family. \nThus, Pope Innocent IV (1243-1254), who was born Sinibaldo Fieschi, presumably used the Fieschi coat of arms, as did Adrian V (Ottobon de Fieschi), the nephew of Innocent IV.\nAccording to Michel Pastoureau, Pope Innocent IV (1243-1254) is likely the first who displayed personal arms, but the first of whom a contemporary coat of arms survives is Pope Boniface VIII (1294-1303).\n\nModern sources show attributed arms of the popes of the second half of the 12th century; thus, editions of the \"Annuario Pontificio\" of the 1960s presented the arms of the popes beginning with Pope Innocent III (1198-1216), and John Woodward gave those of the popes from Pope Lucius II (1144-1145) onward, though he noted that \"it seems probably that many of the early Popes made little if any use of their family arms\".\nThus, Innocent III (Lothaire de Segni, 1160-1216) and Gregory IX (Ugolin de Segni, 1145-1241) may have used the coat of arms of the Counts of Segni.\n\nThe following papal coat of arms should be considered \"traditional\", lacking contemporary attribution. \nFor the popes of noble families, the coats of arms of the family is substituted, and for commoners, the traditional coat of arms as shown in early modern heraldic sources.\n\nNote that some of the images of the coats of arms shown below anachronistically include the external adornments of the papal tiara and the keys of Peter. These ornaments were not in use before the 1450s.\n\nMost popes of the 16th to 18th centuries came from Italian noble families, but there were some exceptions, such as\nSixtus V (1585-1590), who was of low birth.\n\nThe last person elected as pope who was not already an ordained priest or monk was Leo X (Giovanni di Lorenzo de' Medici) in 1513. Thus, throughout the Early Modern period, the elected pope already had a coat of arms: if he did not have a family coat of arms to begin with, he would have adopted one upon being made bishop. Upon his election as pope, he would continue using his pre-existing coat of arms, in some cases with heraldic augmentations. This tradition was continued into the modern period.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "219599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=219599", "title": "Person", "text": "Person\n\nA person is a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness, and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as kinship, ownership of property, or legal responsibility. The defining features of personhood and consequently what makes a person count as a person differ widely among cultures and contexts.\n\nIn addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about personal identity and self: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.\n\nThe common plural of \"person\", \"people\", is often used to refer to an entire nation or ethnic group (as in \"a people\"). The plural \"persons\" is often used in philosophical and legal writing.\n\nIn ancient Rome, the word \"persona\" (Latin) or \"prosopon\" (πρόσωπον; Greek) originally referred to the masks worn by actors on stage. The various masks represented the various \"personae\" in the stage play.\n\nThe concept of person was further developed during the Trinitarian and Christological debates of the 4th and 5th centuries in contrast to the word nature. During the theological debates, some philosophical tools (concepts) were needed so that the debates could be held on common basis to all theological schools. The purpose of the debate was to establish the relation, similarities and differences between the Λóγος/\"Verbum\" and God. The philosophical concept of person arose, taking the word \"prosopon\" (πρόσωπον) from the Greek theatre. Therefore, Christus (the Λóγος/\"Verbum\") and God were defined as different \"persons\". This concept was applied later to the Holy Ghost, the angels and to all human beings.\n\nSince then, a number of important changes to the word's meaning and use have taken place, and attempts have been made to redefine the word with varying degrees of adoption and influence.\n\nPersonhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in philosophy and law, and is closely tied to legal and political concepts of citizenship, equality, and liberty. According to common worldwide general legal practice, only a natural person or legal personality has rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and legal liability.\nPersonhood continues to be a topic of international debate, and has been questioned during the abolition of slavery and the fight for women's rights, in debates about abortion, fetal rights, and in animal rights advocacy.\n\nVarious debates have focused on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities. Historically, the personhood of animals, women, and slaves has been a catalyst of social upheaval. In most societies today, living adult humans are usually considered persons, but depending on the context, theory or definition, the category of \"person\" may be taken to include or not children or such non-human entities as animals, artificial intelligences, or extraterrestrial life, as well as legal entities such as corporations, sovereign states and other polities, or estates in probate.\n\nPersonal identity is the unique identity of persons through time. That is to say, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the \"same\" person, persisting through time. In the modern philosophy of mind, this concept of personal identity is sometimes referred to as the \"diachronic\" problem of personal identity. The \"synchronic\" problem is grounded in the question of what features or traits characterize a given person at one time.\n\nIdentity is an issue for both continental philosophy and analytic philosophy. A key question in continental philosophy is in what sense we can maintain the modern conception of identity, while realizing many of our prior assumptions about the world are incorrect.\n\nProposed solutions to the problem of personal identity include continuity of the physical body, continuity of an immaterial mind or soul, continuity of consciousness or memory, the bundle theory of self, continuity of personality after the death of the physical body, and proposals that there are actually no persons or selves who persist over time at all.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "237504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=237504", "title": "Personal name", "text": "Personal name\n\nA personal name or full name is the set of names by which an individual is known and that can be recited as a word-group, with the understanding that, taken together, they all relate to that one individual. In many cultures, the term is synonymous with the \"birth name\" or \"legal name\" of the individual. The academic study of personal names is called anthroponymy.\n\nIn Western culture, nearly all individuals possess at least one \"given name\" (also known as a \"first name\", \"forename\", or \"Christian name\"), together with a \"surname\" (also known as a \"last name\" or \"family name\")—respectively, the Abraham and Lincoln in Abraham Lincoln—the latter to indicate that the individual belongs to a family, a tribe, or a clan. Where there are two or more given names, typically only one (in English-speaking cultures usually the first) is used in normal speech.\n\nAnother naming convention that is used mainly in the Arabic culture and in different other areas across Africa and Asia is connecting the person's given name with a chain of names, starting with the name of the person's father and then the father's father and so on, usually ending with the family name (tribe or clan name). However, the legal full name of a person usually contains the first three names with the family name at the end, to limit the name in government-issued ID. Also note that the wife's name does not change after marriage, and it follows the naming convention described above.\n\nSome cultures, including Western ones, also add (or once added) patronymics or matronymics. For instance, as a middle name as with Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (whose father's given name was Ilya), or as a last name as with Björk Guðmundsdóttir (whose father was named Guðmundur) or Heiðar Helguson (whose mother was named Helga). Similar concepts are present in Eastern cultures.\n\nHowever, in some areas of the world, many people are known by a single name, and so are said to be mononymous. Still other cultures lack the concept of specific, fixed names designating people, either individually or collectively. Certain isolated tribes, such as the Machiguenga of the Amazon, do not use personal names.\n\nA person's full name usually identifies that person for legal and administrative purposes, although it may not be the name by which the person is commonly known; some people use only a portion of their full name, or are known by titles, nicknames, pseudonyms or other formal or informal designations.\n\nIt is nearly universal for people to have names; the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child declares that a child has the right to a name from birth.\n\nCommon components of names given at birth include:\n\nSome people (called \"anonyms\") choose to be anonymous, that is, to hide their true names, for fear of governmental prosecution or social ridicule of their works or actions. Another method to disguise one's identity is to employ a pseudonym.\n\nFor some people, their name is a single word, known as a mononym. This can be true from birth, or occur later in life. For example, Teller, of the magician duo Penn and Teller, was named Raymond Joseph Teller at birth, but changed his name both legally and socially to be simply \"Teller\". In some official government documents, such as his driver's license, his given name is listed as \"NFN\", an acronym for \"no first name\".\n\nThe Inuit believe that the souls of the namesakes are one, so they traditionally refer to the junior namesakes, not just by the names (\"atiq\"), but also by kinship title, which applies across gender and generation without implications of disrespect or seniority. In Judaism, someone's name is considered intimately connected with his fate, and adding a name (e.g. on the sickbed) may avert a particular danger. Among Ashkenazi Jews it is also considered bad luck to take the name of a living ancestor, as the Angel of Death may mistake the younger person for his namesake (although there is no such custom among Sephardi Jews). Jews may also have a Jewish name for intra-community use and use a different name when engaging with the Gentile world.\n\nChinese children are called diminutive or pejorative names to make them appear worthless to evil spirits. They receive a definitive name as they grow up. Chinese and Japanese emperors receive posthumous names.\n\nIn some Polynesian cultures, the name of a deceased chief becomes taboo. If he is named after a common object or concept, a different word has to be used for it.\n\nDepending on national convention, additional given names (and sometimes titles) are considered part of the name.\n\nThe royalty, nobility, and gentry of Europe traditionally have many names, including phrases for the lands that they own. The French developed the method of putting the term by which the person is referred in small capital letters. It is this habit which transferred to names of the Far East, as seen below. An example is that of Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch Gilbert du Motier, who is known as the Marquis de Lafayette. Notice that he possessed the lands both of Motier and Lafayette.\n\nThe bare place name was used formerly to refer to the person who owned it, rather than the land itself (the word \"Gloucester\" in \"What will Gloucester do?\" meant the Duke of Gloucester). As a development, the bare name of a ship in the Royal Navy meant its captain (e.g., \"Cressy didn't learn from Aboukir\") while the name with an article referred to the ship (e.g., \"The \"Cressy\" is foundering\").\n\nA personal naming system, or anthroponymic system, is a system describing the choice of personal name in a certain society. Personal names consists of one more parts, such as given name, surname and patronymic. Personal naming systems are studied within the field of anthroponymy.\n\nIn contemporary Western societies (except for Iceland, Hungary, and sometimes Flanders, depending on the occasion), the most common naming convention is that a person must have a given name, which is usually gender-specific, followed by the parents' family name. Some given names are bespoke, but most are repeated from earlier generations in the same culture. Many are drawn from mythology, some of which span multiple language areas. This has resulted in related names in different languages (e.g. George, Georg, Jorge), which might be translated or might be maintained as immutable proper nouns.\n\nIn earlier times, Scandinavian countries followed patronymic naming, with people effectively called \"X's son/daughter\"; this is now the case only in Iceland and was recently re-introduced as an option in the Faroe Islands. It is legally possible in Finland as people of Icelandic ethnic naming are specifically named in the name law. When people of this name convert to standards of other cultures, the phrase is often condensed into one word, creating last names like Jacobsen (Jacob's Son). In Kafirstan (now part of Pakistan) \"Children are named as soon as born. The infant is given to the mother to suckle, while a wise woman rapidly recites the family ancestral names; the name pronounced at the instant the baby begins to feed is that by which it is thereafter known.\" \n\nThere is a range of personal naming systems:\n\n\nDifferent cultures have different conventions for personal names. This is a list of articles about particular cultures' naming conventions.\n\nThe order \"given name, family name\" is commonly known as the Western order and is usually used in most European countries and in countries that have cultures predominantly influenced by Western Europe (e.g. North and South America, North, East, Central and West India, Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines).\n\nWithin alphabetic lists and catalogs, however, the family name is generally put first, with the given name(s) following, separated from it by a comma (e.g. Smith, John), representing the \"lexical name order\". This convention is followed by most Western libraries, as well as on many administrative forms.\n\nThe order \"family name, given name\" is commonly known as the Eastern order and is primarily used in East Asia (for example in China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam), as well as in Southeast Asia Cambodia and Southern and North-Eastern parts of India, and also in Hungary (the original homeland of the Hungarians was likely in Asia, at the southern foothills of the Ural Mountains). \nIt is common in popular use also in Austria and Bavaria, as well as in France, Belgium, Greece, Italy and Romania, possibly because of the influence of the bureaucratic use of putting the family name before the given name.\n\nWhen East Asian names are transliterated into the Latin alphabet, some people prefer to convert them to the Western order, while others leave them in the Eastern order but write the family name in capital letters. To avoid confusion, there is a convention in some language communities, e.g. French, to write the family name in all capitals when engaging in formal correspondence or writing for an international audience. In Hungarian, the Eastern order of Japanese names is officially kept and Hungarian transliteration is used (e.g. Mijazaki Hajao), but Western name order is also sometimes used with English transliteration (e.g. Hayao Miyazaki).\n\nChinese people, except for those traveling or living outside of China and areas influenced by China, rarely reverse their Chinese language names to the western naming order (given name, then family name), but some may have non-Chinese given names which may use a different order. Western publications usually preserve the Chinese naming order, with the family name first, followed by the given name. In regard to Japanese names, most foreign publications reverse the names of modern individuals, and most Japanese reverse their own names when creating materials for foreign consumption. In popular journalism publications, western order is used for Japanese names.\n\nJapanese names of contemporary individuals and Hungarian names are usually \"switched\" when individuals who have such names are mentioned in media in Western countries; for example, \"Koizumi Jun'ichirō\" is known as Junichiro Koizumi in English, and Puskás Ferenc is known as Ferenc Puskás. But Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese names are usually left in East Asian order; for instance, Máo Zédōng is known as Mao Zedong in English.\n\nNames of Japanese or Chinese sportspeople generally follow the above conventions. For Japanese examples, see Ichiro Suzuki instead of \"Suzuki Ichirō\" (although he is widely known simply as \"Ichiro\" in both Japan and North America), or Hidetoshi Nakata instead of \"Nakata Hidetoshi\". As for Chinese sportspeople, \"Yáo Míng\" is Yao Ming and \"Liú Xiáng\" is Liu Xiang in the West.\n\nNames of Korean sportspeople may be rendered in East Asian or Western order in Western countries, apparently depending on the sport. For example, names of Korean footballers and athletes are usually left in East Asian order (e.g. Ahn Jung-hwan, Hong Myung-bo, Park Ji-Sung, Sohn Kee-chung, Hwang Young-cho). Baseball players' names are usually changed to Western order; for example Park Chan-Ho is referred to in the West as Chan-ho Park. Golfers' names are also typically switched to Western order; the female golfer Pak Se-ri is known in the West as Se-Ri Pak. Confusion can be avoided by noticing that in all the above cases, the words linked by a hyphen are the given name.\n\nMordvins use two names - a Mordvin name and a Russian name. The Mordvin name is written in the Eastern name order. Usually, the Mordvin surname is the same as the Russian surname, for example Sharonon Sandra (Russian: Alexander Sharonov), but it can be different at times, for example Yovlan Olo (Russian: Vladimir Romashkin).\n\nMongolians use the Eastern naming order (patronymic followed by given name), which is also used there when rendering the names of other East Asians and Hungarians. Russian and other Western names, however, are still written in Western order.\n\nApart from the Linnaean taxonomy, some humans give individual non-human animals and plants names, usually of endearment.\n\nPet names often reflect the owner's view of the animal, and their expectations they have for their companion. It has been argued that giving names allows researchers to view their pets as ontologically different from unnamed laboratory animals with which they work.\n\nThe name given to a pet may refer to its appearance or personality, or be chosen for endearment, or in honor of a favorite celebrity.\n\nMany pet owners give human names to their pets. This has been shown to reflect the owner having a human-like relationship with the pet.\n\nIn some cultures, pets or sporting animals are sometimes given names similar to human names. Other cultures, such as the Chinese, give animals nonhuman names because it would be seen as offensive and disrespectful to the person of the same name.\n\nA study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences claims that humans are not the only animals that use personal names. Researchers from the University of North Carolina Wilmington studying bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay, Florida, found that the dolphins had names for each other. A dolphin chooses its name as an infant.\n\n\n\n"}

The historical web site and ListServ provide for formal historical articles, images, photographs, commentary, and discussion of those items in a process called a \"polybiography\"... the history by many of the many events. The site is designed to be a searchable repository of \"raw material\" for those with an interest in the history of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ultrasonography).\n\nThis Internet based historical archive has been referred to as a \"polybiography\" because it is both biographical and autobiographical; the many individuals involved write the history of the many events discussed. The resulting archive is expected to be similar to an oral history where an editor records and transcribes the various stories into a cohesive narrative. However, the oral history will have a slant due to the selection of participants and how they are edited. The polybiography will avoid a bias or slant from an editor because the participants are self-selected. The stories will be in the unedited words of the individuals who made the history. The primary problem anticipated will be the differences in individuals' writing styles, and a possibly confused organization.\n\nThe polybiography is uniquely adapted to the Internet and would be virtually impossible without the Internet. Without the global connections it would be difficult to locate all the individuals who contributed to the development of historical events. By the use of the Internet anyone who has a story to tell about the developments will be able to add to the history. This will allow those who were assistants to contribute, as well as the luminaries; where as with the traditional oral history, the editor might not locate some relatively minor, relocated participants.\n\nThe concept of the \"polybiography\" was first presented at the Annual Conference 2000 of the American Association of History & Computing in Waco, Texas. The original article was titled \"Poly-autobiography of Diagnostic Medical Sonography\", but during the discussion following the presentation it was suggested that, while the concept was thought to be a unique use of the Internet and WWWeb, the term \"polybiography\" would be more appropriate, more descriptive, and simpler.\n"}
{"id": "36066018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36066018", "title": "Real-name system", "text": "Real-name system\n\nA real-name system is a system in which when a user who wants to register an account on a blog, website or bulletin board system, is required to offer identification credentials including their legal name to the network service centre. One may use an on-line pseudonym, however, the person's real identity would be available if rules or laws are broken.\n\nSouth Korea is the first country to put the real-name system into practice. Since June 28, 2009, thirty-five Korean websites have implemented a name-registration system pursuant to the newly amended Information and Communications Network Act of Korea. It was enacted after the suicide of Choi Jin-sil which was said to be related to malicious comments about her on Internet bulletin boards. The new rule is aimed at minimizing the amount of negative information to make netizens responsible for their behavior on the Internet.\n\nSouth Koreans have been familiar with the real-name system. Since the mid-1990s, doing real property transactions and financial transactions must be performed under a real name following relevant laws. The real-name system in real property transactions and financial transactions is believed to contribute to the sound economic order of the nation.\n\nOn August 23, 2012, however, the Constitutional Court of Korea ruled unanimously that the real-name requirements imposed on big portal service providers by a relevant law is unconstitutional, citing such provision's violation of freedom of speech in cyberspace.\n\nAs a result, the so-called \"Choi Jin-sil Law\", under the deceased celebrity's name, is to be discarded. Until then, websites with more than 100 thousand visitors per day required users to authenticate their identities by entering their ID numbers when they used portals or other sites.\n\nThe Constitutional Court said,\nThe system does not seem to have been beneficial to the public. Despite the enforcement of the system, the number of illegal or malicious postings online has not decreased. Instead, users moved to foreign Websites and the system became discriminatory against domestic operators. It also prevented foreigners who didn’t have a resident registration number here from expressing their opinions online.\n\nAccording to Yonhap News Agency, the public voice started to agree on the abolishment of a name-registration system because of the severe problem caused by information leakage. Now the official response from the administration is that they will supplement the certain regulations of personal information on the Internet.\n\nThe Chinese government stated in December 2011 that microblogging sites should make sure users are registered with their real names. After the announcement of Regulations on the Development and Management of microblogging, Beijing in December 2011, the major microblogging sites like Sina, 163 and Sohu all put real name system into practice in 16 March 2012. The users in Beijing who hadn't provided their real information would be barred from posting and transmitting messages after 16 March 2012.\nThe introduction to real names in modern society originated from state regulations. State governments, in order to monitor and keep track of its citizens, provided citizens with surnames. This allowed them to track property ownership and inheritance, collect taxes, maintain court records, perform police work, conscript soldiers, and control epidemics.\n\nThough the Facebook social networking site does not directly employ the real-name system, the site's online Name Policy indicates the following:\n\"Facebook is a community where people use their real identities. We require everyone to provide their real names, so you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe.\" This means that under Facebook's Name Policy, users are strongly encouraged to provide their real names when creating an account on Facebook. This, according to Facebook, ensures that its users remain safe by knowing who they are connecting and communicating with at all times.\n\nFacebook was first launched at Harvard, where the new social networking site provided a safe, intimate alternative to the other popular social networking sites. According to danah boyd, a social media scholar, \"people provided their name because they saw the site as an extension of campus life.\" Because of this, new users adopted the norms and practices of the early adopters and began to also see Facebook as a secure and private site. Through this early adoption, today, Facebook's astronomical value stems from the quality and quantity of information it has about its users. The social networking site has become an identity service by creating a value proposition based on social norms in which users would naturally share their real names instead of feeling forced to.\n\nThough requiring users to provide their real names such as the ones listed on credit cards, driver's licenses, and student IDs ensures safety for users, using real names could also be harmful. Emil Protalinski, technology journalist for The Next Web, states how many \"Facebook users opt to use pseudonyms to hide from stalkers, abusive exes, and even governments that don't condone free speech.\" For these specific users, using pseudonyms allows for them to still be able to connect with colleagues, friends, and family without having to entirely worry about their safety had they provided Facebook with their real names that others could find more easily. This brings up the issues of privacy for Facebook users. \"People feel as though their privacy has been violated when their agency has been undermined or when information about a particular social context has been obscured in ways that subvert people's ability to make an informed decision about what to reveal.\" Some users may feel uncomfortable with the knowledge that their real names would be publicly displayed and choose, instead, to use a fake name that appears real to Facebook under its Name Policy.\n\nUnlike Facebook, the Twitter social networking site does not require users to enter real names when creating Twitter accounts, and the site is entirely void of the real-name system. According to Twitter's former CEO, Dick Costolo, the social networking site does not care what a user's real name is as long as the site connects users to the information that they care about. Whether the information comes from an account with a real name or one using a pseudonym does not matter. \nYet, Costolo also points out that Twitter is not necessarily in full support of the idea of users having pseudonyms; instead, Twitter is simply \"wedded to people being able to use the service as they see fit.\" Twitter emphasizes care in its services that it provides for users rather than requiring real names. This does not mean, however, that Twitter ignores the issue regarding real identities. Regarding this matter, Twitter is able to verify accounts of prominent Twitter users such as celebrities in order to ensure identity fraud is not being committed on the social networking site.\n\nVernor Vinge's novella \"True Names\" charts the idea of how serious knowing one's identity can be. As such it is also a part of cypherpunk culture.\n"}

Different types of religious names may be in use among clergy of a religion, as well in some cases among the laity.\n\nIn baptism, Catholics are given a Christian name, which should not be \"foreign to Christian sentiment\" and is often the name of a saint. In East Asia, in Africa and elsewhere, the baptismal name is distinct from the traditional-style given name.\n\nIn some countries, it is common to adopt a confirmation name, in addition to the baptismal name.\n\nIn some religious institutes, a new member takes a religious name. In Italian, a religious figure is often referred to by their religious name and by their secular name or their \"\" name. A newly elected Pope also takes on a new name, called his regnal name or papal name.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church converts often take a new name at the time of their reception into the church, either by baptism or chrismation. A person's religious name is always the name of a saint, who then becomes that person's patron saint. When deciding on a name for their child, Orthodox parents will often name the child after a saint whose feast day falls on either the day of the child's birth or the day of its baptism. Traditionally, Orthodox Christians celebrate their \"name day\" (i.e., the feast day of their patron saint), rather than their birthday.\n\nOrthodox monks and nuns are often given a new monastic name at the time of their tonsure (i.e., when they take their monastic vows). A monastic name is usually the name of a prophet or a monastic saint. Sometimes, the monastic name will begin with the same initial as the individual's baptismal name.\n\nConverts to Judaism take a Hebrew name upon conversion. Born Jews generally have a patronymic Hebrew name which is used for religious purposes; this is frequently different from their legal name, especially when the latter is of gentile or non-Hebrew origin.\n\nMany Buddhist sects also practice this, with newly ordained sangha often given new names by their master. Lay Buddhists are also given Dharma names during their refuge ceremony.\n\nMembers of ISKCON and some other Gaudiya Vaishnava organisations are given a \"spiritual name\" by their guru upon initiation. This name ends in \"Das\" or \"Dasa\" for men and \"Dasi\" for women (meaning \"servant\"), and generally begins with the same letter as the devotee's given name.\n\nIn Wicca, a craft name is often used.\n\nIt is usual for a Discordian Episkopos to adopt a faux-mystical and bizarre name for the duration of the Episkoposity; such names are not immutable and are frequently adapted over time. The same is true for the clergy of the related Church of the SubGenius.\n\n"}

Helen McCullough claims that they were selected because they all had distinctive personal styles in a time of homogeneity, and that by aligning them in his commentary with the six major styles of Han Dynasty poetry, Tsurayuki was showing off his knowledge of those sources. Thomas Lammare also believes that Tsurayuki picked these poets to match the six Han styles, and focuses more on how Tsurayuki claimed these styles did not properly align heart (\"kokoro\" 心) and words (\"kotoba\" 言葉).\n\nThe concept of the \"rokkasen\" had a lasting legacy on poetic scholarship both in the pre-modern and modern periods.\n\nIn 1009–1011, Fujiwara no Kintō compiled an expanded list known as the Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry, which came to supplant this list of six. This led to the creation of similar lists based on this pattern, such as the \"Thirty-Six Court Lady Immortals of Poetry,\" and the \"Thirty-Six Heian-period Immortals of Poetry.\"\n\nMany Japanese scholars of the twentieth century conceptualized the history of \"waka\" poetry in the ninth century as a time when it was overshadowed by Chinese poetry in the first part of the century and then returned to prominence by the end of the century. These narratives held that this time was a transitional period between the \"waka\" anthologies \"Man'yōshū\" and \"Kokin wakashū\". When discussing the \"waka\" poetry of this period, some scholars have referred to it as the Rokkasen Period (六歌仙時代 \"rokkasen jidai\"), although there has been disagreement on when this period starts. Most of the scholars agree that it ends with the reign of Emepror Kōkō, but disagree on whether it begins with Emperor Ninmyō or Emperor Montoku. Both Hidehito Nishiyama and Ryōji Shimada conclude that they believe Ninmyō is the better choice for the start of this periodization.\n\nAdditionally, all but one of the Rokkasen, Ōtomo Kuronushi, appear in the famous collection of poetry, \"Hyakunin isshū\".\n\nThirty-Six Immortals of Poetry\n\nKokin Wakashū\n"}

There, they avoided being sent to death camps and survived the war. Schindler expended his personal fortune as an industrialist to save the \"Schindlerjuden\".\n\nTheir story has been depicted in the book \"Schindler's Ark\", by Thomas Keneally, and Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of the novel, \"Schindler's List\".

According to Luke, the only gospel in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.\n\nIn Western Christianity, they are usually referred to as disciples, whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as Apostles. Using the original Greek words, both titles are descriptive, as an \"apostle\" is one sent on a mission (the Greek uses the verb form: \"apesteilen\") whereas a \"disciple\" is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words \"apostle\" and \"disciple\". Although apostles and disciples exist in many extant churches and denominations, the Latter Day Saint movement is the only current one to use Seventy as a title for a priesthood office.\n\nThe passage from Luke 10 reads (in Young's Literal Translation):\n\nThis is the only mention of the group in the Bible. The number is \"seventy\" in some manuscripts of the Alexandrian (such as Codex Sinaiticus) and Caesarean text traditions but \"seventy-two\" in most other Alexandrian and Western texts. It may derive from the seventy nations of Genesis 10 or the many other occurrences of the number seventy in the Bible, or the seventy-two translators of the Septuagint from the Letter of Aristeas. In translating the \"Vulgate\", Jerome selected the reading of seventy-two.\n\nThe \"Gospel of Luke\" is not alone among the synoptic gospels in containing multiple episodes in which Jesus sends out his followers on missions. The first occasion () is closely based on the \"limited commission\" mission in \"Mark\" , which however recounts the sending out of the twelve apostles, rather than seventy, though with similar details. The parallels (also Matthew , , ) suggest a common origin in the hypothesized Q document. Luke also mentions the Great Commission to \"all nations\" () but in less detail than Matthew's account and mentions the Dispersion of the Apostles.\n\nWhat has been said to the seventy (two) in is referred in passing to the Twelve in :\n\nThe feast day commemorating the seventy is known as the \"Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles\" in Eastern Orthodoxy, and is celebrated on January 4. Each of the seventy apostles also has individual commemorations scattered throughout the liturgical year (see Eastern Orthodox Church calendar).\n\nHippolytus of Rome was a disciple of Irenaeus, a disciple of Polycarp, a disciple of Apostle John. Hippolytus's works were considered lost prior to their discovery at a monastery on Mount Athos in 1854. While his major work \"The Refutation of All Heresies\" was readily accepted (once the false attribution to Origen was resolved), his two small works, \"On the Twelve Apostles of Christ\" and \"On the Seventy Apostles of Christ\", are still regarded as dubious, put in the appendix of his works in the voluminous collection of the writings of early church fathers. Here is the complete text of Pseudo-Hippolytus's \"On the Seventy Apostles of Christ\":\n\nThese two belonged to the seventy disciples who were scattered by the offence of the word which Christ spoke, “Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he is not worthy of me.” But the one being induced to return to the Lord by Peter’s instrumentality, and the other by Paul’s, they were honored to preach that Gospel on account of which they also suffered martyrdom, the one being burned, and the other being crucified on an olive tree.\n\nMany of the names included among the seventy are recognizable for their other achievements. The names included in various lists differ slightly. In the lists, Luke is also one of these seventy himself. The following list gives a widely accepted canon. Their names are listed below:\n\n\nMatthias, who would later replace Judas Iscariot as one of the twelve apostles, is also often numbered among the seventy, since John Mark is typically viewed as Mark the Evangelist.\n\nAlso, some lists name a few different disciples than the ones listed above.

William Shockley had in 1956 recruited a group of young PhD graduates with the goal to develop and produce new semiconductor devices. While Shockley had received a Nobel Prize in Physics and was an experienced researcher and teacher, his management of the group was authoritarian and unpopular. This was accentuated by the fact that Shockley's research focus wasn’t proving fruitful. After the demand for Shockley to be replaced was rebuffed, the eight left to form their own company. \n\nShockley described their leaving as a \"betrayal\". The eight who left Shockley Semiconductor were Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Jean Hoerni, Eugene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce and Sheldon Roberts. In August 1957 they reached an agreement with Sherman Fairchild and on September 18, 1957, they formed Fairchild Semiconductor. The newly founded Fairchild Semiconductor soon grew into a leader of the semiconductor industry. In 1960 it became an incubator of Silicon Valley and was directly or indirectly involved in the creation of dozens of corporations including AMD and Intel. These many spin-off companies came to be known as \"Fairchildren\".\n\nIn the winter of 1954–1955, William Shockley, an inventor of the transistor and a visiting professor at Stanford University, decided to establish his own mass production of advanced transistors and Shockley diodes. He found a sponsor in Raytheon, but Raytheon discontinued the project after a month. In August 1955 Shockley turned for advice to the financier Arnold Beckman, the owner of Beckman Instruments. Shockley needed one million dollars. Beckman knew that Shockley had no chance in the business, but believed that Shockley's new inventions would be beneficial for his own company and did not want to give them to his competitors. Accordingly, Beckman agreed to create and fund a laboratory under the condition that its discoveries should be brought to mass production within two years.\n\nThe new department of Beckman Instruments took the name Shockley Semi-Conductor Laboratories (the hyphen was conventional in those years). During 1955 Beckman and Shockley signed the deal, bought licenses on all necessary patents for $25,000, and selected the location in Mountain View, near Palo Alto, California. The place did not prove very successful: Shockley's colleagues at Bell Labs and RCA refused to move to a rural location with no long-distance phone service. The vast majority of semiconductor-related companies and professionals were based on the East Coast, so Shockley posted ads in \"The New York Times\" and the \"New York Herald Tribune\". Early respondents included Sheldon Roberts of Dow Chemical, Robert Noyce of Philco and Jay Last, a former intern of Beckman Instruments. The newspaper campaign brought some three hundred responses, and fifteen people, including Gordon Moore and David Allison, Shockley himself recruited at a meeting of the American Physical Society.\n\nSelection continued throughout 1956. Shockley was a proponent of social technologies (which later led him to eugenics) and asked each candidate to pass a psychological test, followed by an interview.\n\nBlank, Last, Moore, Noyce and Roberts started working in April–May, and Kleiner, Grinich and Hoerni came during the summer. By September 1956, the lab had 32 employees, including Shockley. Each successful candidate had to negotiate his salary with Shockley. Kleiner, Noyce and Roberts settled for $1,000 per month; the less-experienced Last got $675. Hoerni did not bother about his payment. Shockley set his own salary at $2,500 and made all salaries accessible to all employees. Two of Shockley's choices later appeared to be mistakes: William Happ was proven insufficiently competent for the work, and technologist Dean Knapic had forged his university degree and certificate of military service. He later brought Shockley's technologies to competitors.\n\nThe members of the future traitorous eight were aged between 26 (Last) and 33 (Kleiner); six of them held a PhD. Hoerni was an experienced scientist and gifted manager, and, according to Bo Lojek, matched Shockley in intellect. Only Noyce was involved in semiconductor research, and only Grinich had experience in electronics.\n\nThroughout 1956 most members of the lab were assembling and tuning the equipment, and \"pure scientists\" Hoerni and Noyce carried out individual applied research. Shockley refused to hire technical staff, believing that his scientists should be able to handle all technological processes. After resettlement, he focused on fine-tuning Shockley diodes for mass production, and five employees, led by Noyce, continued the work on a field effect transistor for Beckman Instruments. Shockley refused to work on bipolar transistors, which later was proven a strategic mistake. Because the work on Shockley diodes took so much effort the produced devices were commercial failures.\n\nAccording to Noyce and Moore, as well as David Brock and Joel Shurkin, the shift from bipolar transistors to Shockley diodes was unexpected. Shockley initially planned to work on the mass production of diffusion bipolar transistors, but then set up a \"secret project\" on Shockley diodes, and in 1957 stopped all works on bipolar transistors. The reasons for this turn are unknown. According to Beckman's biographer, Shockley regarded his diode as an interesting scientific problem, and chose it, neglecting Beckman's commercial interests.\n\nBo Lojek, based on the archives of Shockley, believes that Shockley Labs never worked on bipolar transistors; that Shockley diodes were Shockley and Beckman's original target, for which Beckman Instruments received military R&D contracts; and that Shockley diodes could have found widespread use in telephony if Shockley had improved their reliability.\n\nHistorians and colleagues generally agree that Shockley was a poor manager and businessman. From early childhood he was prone to outbursts of unprovoked aggression, which were suppressed due to the internal discipline of his past working environment. He also tended to see rivals, even in his own subordinates.\n\nOn November 1, 1956, it was announced that the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics would be awarded to Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain. The related public events of November–December overtired Shockley and took him away from the lab in a time when it had several management problems. Despite the festivities, the atmosphere in the lab was unhealthy.\n\nAlthough Shockley was never diagnosed by psychiatrists, historians characterized Shockley's state of mind in 1956–1957 as paranoia or autism. All phone calls were recorded, and the staff was not allowed to share their results with each other, which was not feasible since they all worked in a small building. Shockley, not trusting his employees, was sending their reports to Bell Labs for double-checking. At some point he sent the entire lab for a lie detector test, though everyone refused.\n\nThe team started losing its members, starting with Jones, a technologist, who left in January 1957 due to a conflict with Grinich and Hoerni. Noyce and Moore then stood on different sides: Moore led the dissidents, whereas Noyce stood behind Shockley and tried to resolve conflicts. Shockley appreciated that and considered Noyce as his sole support in the group.\n\nIn March 1957, Kleiner, who was beyond Shockley's suspicions, asked permission ostensibly to visit an exhibition in Los Angeles. Instead he flew to New York to seek investors for a new company, and his parents, New York residents, assisted him. Kleiner was supported by Blank, Grinich, Last, Roberts, Hoerni and Moore. Arthur Rock and Alfred Coyle from Hayden, Stone & Co. became interested in the offer, believing that trainees of a Nobel laureate were destined to succeed.\n\nAs a last resort, on May 29, 1957 a group led by Moore presented Arnold Beckman with an ultimatum: solve the \"Shockley problem\" or they would leave. Moore suggested finding a professor position for Shockley and replacing him in the lab with a professional manager. Beckman refused, believing that Shockley could still improve the situation, later regretting this decision.\nIn June 1957, Beckman finally put a manager between Shockley and the team, but by then seven key employees had already made their decision. At the last minute they were joined by Noyce. Roberts persuaded him to attend the meeting of the \"California group\", as they called themselves in the agreement with Fairchild. The meeting was held at the Clift Hotel in California and was attended by Rock and Coyle. These ten people became the core of a new company.\n\nFinding investors proved to be difficult. The US electronics industry was concentrated in the east, and the California group preferred to stay near Palo Alto. In August 1957, Rock and Coyle met with the inventor and businessman Sherman Fairchild, founder of Fairchild Aircraft and Fairchild Camera. Fairchild sent Rock to his deputy, Richard Hodgson. Hodgson, risking his reputation, accepted the offer and within a few weeks completed all paperwork. The capital of the new company, Fairchild Semiconductor, was divided into 1,325 shares. Each member of the traitorous eight received 100 shares, 225 shares went to Hayden, Stone & Co and 300 shares remained in reserve. Fairchild provided a loan of $1.38 million. To secure the loan, the traitorous eight gave Fairchild the voting rights on their shares, with the right to buy their shares at a fixed total price of $3 million.\n\nOn September 18, 1957, Blank, Grinich, Kleiner, Last, Moore, Noyce, Roberts and Hoerni resigned from Shockley Labs. They became known as the \"traitorous eight\", though it is not known who coined the term. Shockley could never understand the reasons for this defection. After that time, he never talked to Noyce again, but continued to follow the work of \"The Eight\". He also combed through all records left by The Eight, basing patents, held as Shockley Labs' intellectual property, on any important ideas. (Technically, in accordance with U.S. law, those patents were issued to the respective inventing employees.)\n\nIn 1960, with the help of a new team, Shockley brought his own diode to serial production, but time had been lost, and competitors had already come close to the development of integrated circuits. Beckman sold the unprofitable Shockley Labs to investors from Cleveland. On July 23, 1961, Shockley was seriously injured in a car crash, and after recovery left the company and returned to teaching at Stanford. In 1969, IT&T, the new owners of Shockley Labs moved the company to Florida. When the staff refused to move, the lab ceased to exist.\n\nIn November 1957, The Eight moved out of Grinich's garage into a new, empty building on the border of Palo Alto and Mountain View. Their starting salaries ranged from $13,800 to $15,600 per year. Hodgson, who headed the board of directors, suggested Noyce as the operational manager of the company, but Noyce refused. Fairchild, knowing Noyce's personality, also opposed his leadership. Regardless of the will of Fairchild, Noyce and Moore, who were responsible for the research and production, respectively, became the \"leaders among equals\".\n\nThe group immediately set a clear goal to produce an array of silicon diffusion mesa transistors for digital devices, utilizing the research results of Bell Labs and Shockley Labs. Moore, Hoerni and Last led three teams working on three alternative technologies. The technology of Moore resulted in a higher yield of operational n-p-n transistors, and in July–September 1958, they went into mass production. The release of p-n-p transistors of Hoerni was delayed until early 1959. This created the Moore-Hoerni conflict at Fairchild: Moore ignored the contribution of Hoerni, and Hoerni believed that his work was unfairly treated. However, the Moore transistors formed the prestige of Fairchild Semiconductor – for several years, they beat all the competitors.\n\nIn 1958, Fairchild mesa transistors were considered for the D-17B Minuteman I guidance computer, but they did not meet military standards of reliability. Fairchild already had a solution in the planar technology of Hoerni proposed on December 1, 1957. In the spring of 1958, Hoerni and Last were spending nights on experiments with the first planar transistors. The planar technology later became the second most important event in the history of microelectronics, after the invention of the transistor, but in 1959 it went unnoticed. Fairchild announced the transition from mesa to planar technology in October 1960. However, Moore refused to credit this achievement to Hoerni, and in 1996 even attributing it to unnamed Fairchild engineers.\n\nIn 1959, Sherman Fairchild exercised his right to purchase shares of the members of the traitorous eight. Jay Last recalled (in 2007) that this event happened too early and turned former partners into ordinary employees, destroying the team spirit. In November 1960, Tom Bay, the Vice President of Marketing at Fairchild, accused Last of squandering money and demanded termination of Last's project of developing integrated circuits. Moore refused to help Last, and Noyce declined to discuss the matter. This conflict was the last straw: on January 31, 1961 Last and Hoerni left Fairchild and to head Amelco, the microelectronics branch of Teledyne. Kleiner and Roberts joined them after a few weeks. Blank, Grinich, Moore and Noyce stayed with Fairchild. The traitorous eight split into two groups of four.\n\nIn 1960–1965 Fairchild was the undisputed leader of the semiconductor market, both technologically and in terms of sales. Early 1965 brought the first signs of management problems. In November 1965, the creators of integrated operational amplifiers Bob Widlar and David Talbert left for National Semiconductor. In February 1967, they were followed by five top managers who disagreed with Noyce. Noyce started litigation with shareholders and effectively removed himself from the operational management. In July 1967, the company became unprofitable and lost their leading position in the market to Texas Instruments.\n\nIn March 1968, Moore and Noyce decided to leave Fairchild and again, as nine years prior, turned to Arthur Rock. In the summer of 1968, they founded NM Electronics. Blank, Grinich, Kleiner, Last, Hoerni and Roberts, set aside the past disagreements and financially supported the company of Moore and Noyce. A year later, N-M Electronics bought the trade name rights from the hotel chain Intelco and took the name of Intel. Moore held senior positions at Intel until 1997, when he was named Chairman Emeritus of Intel Corporation. Noyce left Intel in 1987 to lead the non-profit consortium Sematech. He died suddenly in 1990, the first of The Eight.\n\nGrinich left Fairchild in 1968 for a short sabbatical, and then taught at UC Berkeley and Stanford, where he published the first comprehensive textbook on integrated circuits. He later co-founded and ran several companies developing industrial RFID tags.\n\nBlank was the last of The Eight to leave Fairchild, in 1969. He founded the financial firm Xicor specializing in innovative start-ups, and in 2004 sold it for $529 million.\n\nHoerni headed Amelco until the summer of 1963, and, after the conflict with the Teledyne owners, for three years headed Union Carbide Electronics. In July 1967, supported by the watch company Société Suisse pour l'Industrie Horlogère (the predecessor of Swatch Group) founded Intersil, the company that created the market for custom CMOS circuits. The circuits developed by Intersil for Seiko in 1969–1970 contributed to the rise of Japanese electronic watches. Intersil and Intel weren't competitors as Intel released a limited set of templated circuits for computers and sold them initially only in the U.S. market, whereas Intersil focused on custom CMOS circuits with low power consumption and sold them worldwide.\n\nLast remained with Amelco and for twelve years served as Vice President of Technology at Teledyne. In 1982, he founded Hillcrest Press specializing in art books. After leaving Amelco, Roberts led his own business, and in 1973–1987 served as a trustee of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Amelco, after numerous mergers, acquisitions and renaming, became a subsidiary of Microchip Technology.\n\nIn 1972, Kleiner and Tom Perkins from Hewlett-Packard founded the venture capital fund Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which has been involved in the creation and/or funding of Amazon.com, Compaq, Genentech, Intuit, Lotus, Macromedia, Netscape, Sun Microsystems, Symantec and dozens of other companies. Kleiner later wrote that his goal was to geographically spread the venture financing.\n\nIn May 2011, the California Historical Society gave the \"Legends of California Award\" to The Eight. Blank, Last, Moore, and Roberts' son Dave attended the event in San Francisco.\n\nIn research, reporting, and popular lore related to Silicon Valley, the term \"Fairchildren\" has been used to refer to:\n\n\nOne of the first articles to identify Fairchild as the parent of so many spin-offs appeared in \"Innovation Magazine\" in 1969. The spin-off companies, such as AMD, Intel, Intersil and restructured National Semiconductor, were different from those of the east coast and California's electronic companies established in the 1940s and 1950s. \"Old Californians\" like Beckman and Varian Associates did not trust Wall Street and kept control of their companies for decades, whereas the new companies of the 1960s were created for a quick (within 3–5 years) public sale of shares. Their founders built a business strategy based on the expectations of the investment banks. Another characteristic of Silicon Valley was the mobility of managers and professionals among companies. Partly because of Noyce, Silicon Valley developed a culture of openly denying the hierarchical culture of traditional corporations. People remained faithful to each other, but not to the employer or the industry. Fairchild \"alumni\" can be found not only in electronics-related, but also financial and public relations companies.\n\n\n"}
