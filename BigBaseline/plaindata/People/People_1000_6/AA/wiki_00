They were subsequently imprisoned until May 6, 2013, when Berry escaped with her six-year-old daughter and contacted the police. Knight and DeJesus were rescued by responding officers and Castro was arrested within hours.\n\nOn May 8, 2013, Castro was charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. Castro pleaded guilty to 937 criminal counts of rape, kidnapping, and aggravated murder as part of a plea bargain. He was sentenced to life plus 1,000 years in prison without the possibility of parole. One month into his sentence, Castro committed suicide by hanging himself with bedsheets in his prison cell.\n\nAriel Castro was born on July 11, 1960, in Yauco, Puerto Rico, to Pedro Castro and Lillian Rodriguez. When he was a child, his parents divorced. Shortly after the divorce, Castro moved to the mainland with his mother and three siblings. The family first settled in Reading, Pennsylvania, and later moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where Castro's father and several other extended family members were living. Castro had nine siblings. According to Castro's uncle, his family knew the DeJesus family and had lived in the same West Cleveland neighborhood. Castro was a 1979 graduate of Cleveland's Lincoln-West High School.\n\nCastro met his future girlfriend, Grimilda Figueroa, when his family moved into a house across the street from hers in the 1980s. They lived with both sets of parents, but moved into their own home at 2207 Seymour Avenue in 1992. Their home was a two-story, , four-bedroom, one-bathroom house with a unfinished basement built in 1890 and remodeled in 1956. According to Figueroa's sister, Elida Caraballo, when the couple moved into their new home, \"all hell started breaking loose\". Caraballo and her husband Frank claim Castro beat Figueroa, breaking her nose, ribs, and arms. He also threw her down a flight of stairs, cracking her skull. In 1993, Castro was arrested for domestic violence but was not indicted by a grand jury.\n\nFigueroa moved out of the home in 1996 and secured custody of her four children. Police assisted in the move and detained Castro, but did not pursue charges. Castro continued to threaten and attack Figueroa after she left him, according to Caraballo. A 2005 filing by Figueroa in Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court accused Castro of inflicting multiple severe injuries on her and of \"frequently abduct[ing]\" her daughters. A temporary restraining order against Castro was granted, but was dismissed a few months later. Figueroa died in 2012 due to complications from a brain tumor.\n\nBefore his arrest at the age of 52, Castro worked as a bus driver for the Cleveland Metropolitan School District until he was fired for \"bad judgment\", including making an illegal U-turn with children on his bus, using his bus to go grocery shopping, leaving a child on the bus while he went for lunch, and leaving the bus unattended while he took a nap at home. He was earning $18.91 per hour when he was discharged. At the time of his arrest, Castro's home was in foreclosure due to three years (2010–12) of unpaid real estate taxes.\n\nAll of Castro's victims were kidnapped after accepting a ride from Castro. He drove each to his home, lured them inside, took them to the basement, and restrained them. The house at 2207 Seymour Avenue, where they were held, was located in Cleveland's residential Tremont neighborhood, where they had all disappeared. It has since been demolished.\n\nMichelle Knight (born April 23, 1981) disappeared on August 23, 2002, after leaving a cousin's house. She was 21 years old at the time. On the day of her disappearance, she was scheduled to appear in court for a child custody case involving her son, who was in the custody of the state.\n\nFollowing Knight's rescue, police acknowledged that limited resources had been spent on investigating her disappearance, in part because she was an adult. Knight was believed to have run away voluntarily due to anger over losing custody of her son. According to Cleveland Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba, she \"was the focus of very few tips\". Her removal from the National Crime Information Center database fifteen months after she disappeared has been criticized. Cleveland Police and the FBI maintain that her inclusion or exclusion had no bearing on her rescue.\n\nAmanda Marie Berry (born April 22, 1986) disappeared on April 21, 2003, the day before her 17th birthday. She was last heard from when she called her sister to tell her that she was getting a ride home from her job at a Burger King at West 110th Street and Lorain Avenue. The FBI initially considered Berry a runaway until a week after her disappearance, when an unidentified male used her cell phone to call her mother, saying, \"I have Amanda. She's fine and will be coming home in a couple of days\".\n\nBerry was featured in a 2004 segment of Fox's \"America's Most Wanted\" (re-aired in 2005 and 2006), which linked her to Gina DeJesus, who by that point had also gone missing in Cleveland. Berry and DeJesus were profiled on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and \"The Montel Williams Show\", where in 2004 self-proclaimed psychic Sylvia Browne told Berry's mother, Louwana Miller, that her daughter was dead and that she was \"in water\". This pronouncement devastated her mother, causing her to take down pictures and give away Berry's computer. However, Miller continued to search for Berry until her death from heart failure in 2006. After Berry was found alive in 2013, Browne received criticism for the false declaration that Berry was dead.\n\nIn July 2012, Robert Wolford, a prison inmate who previously lived in Tremont, claimed to have information about the location of Berry's body and led police to an empty lot on Cleveland's West Side, where a fruitless search was conducted. Wolford was sentenced in January 2013 to four-and-a-half years in prison for obstruction of justice, making a false report, and making a false alarm.\n\nOn December 25, 2006, Berry gave birth to a daughter at 2207 Seymour Avenue. DNA evidence has confirmed that Castro was the biological father of the child.\n\nGeorgina \"Gina\" Lynn DeJesus (born February 13, 1990) went missing at age 14. She was last seen at a payphone at about 3 p.m. on April 2, 2004, on the way home from her middle school at West 105th Street and Lorain Avenue. DeJesus and her friend, Castro's daughter Arlene, had called Figueroa for permission to have a sleepover at DeJesus's house, but Figueroa replied they could not and the two girls parted ways. Arlene was the last person to see DeJesus before her disappearance.\n\nDeJesus was taken under the impression that she was being dropped off, and trusted Castro because she was friends with his teenage daughter. Because no one witnessed DeJesus's abduction, an AMBER Alert was not issued, which angered DeJesus's father. He said in 2006, \"The Amber Alert should work for any missing child … Whether it's an abduction or a runaway, a child needs to be found. We need to change this law\".\n\nA year after DeJesus' disappearance, the FBI released a composite sketch and description of a male suspect, described as \"Latino, 25 to 35 years of age, , , with green eyes, a goatee and possibly a pencil-thin beard\". According to court records, Castro was , ; he had brown eyes and a goatee.\n\nDeJesus was featured in the aforementioned \"America's Most Wanted\" segment, which linked her to Berry. The disappearances received regular media attention over the years, continuing into 2012, while the families held public vigils. Castro attended at least two of these vigils, reportedly participated in a search party, and tried to get close to the DeJesus family. While a journalism student in 2004, Castro's son Anthony interviewed DeJesus's mother for an article about the disappearances in the \"Plain Press\". Police kept an active investigation open, offering a $25,000 reward for information.\n\nAfter Knight's kidnapping, Castro took her upstairs, tied her hands and feet together, and pulled her up using her hands, feet, and neck. He left her there for three days without food. Prosecutors at Castro's sentencing wrote that diaries kept by the women \"speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of being held like a prisoner of war, of missing the lives they once enjoyed, of emotional abuse, of his threats to kill, of being treated like an animal, of continuous abuse, and of desiring freedom\". The women were kept in locked upstairs bedrooms, where they were forced to use plastic toilets that were \"emptied infrequently\". They were fed one meal a day, and allowed to shower twice a week at most.\n\nKnight told police that Castro had impregnated her at least five times, and had induced miscarriages each time through beatings: hitting with dumbbells, punching, and slamming her against walls. Starvation was also included. Knight's grandmother told reporters that she would require facial reconstruction surgery due to the beatings she endured; she also lost hearing in one ear. At one point, Knight had a pet dog while in captivity, but Castro killed the dog by snapping its neck after it bit him while trying to protect Knight. DeJesus told law enforcement she was raped but did not believe she was ever impregnated.\n\nIn December 2006, Castro allegedly ordered Knight to assist in the birth of Berry's child, which took place in a small inflatable swimming pool, and threatened to kill Knight if the baby did not survive. At one point, the baby stopped breathing, but Knight was able to resuscitate her. Castro occasionally took the child out of the house, including to visit his mother; the girl called Castro \"daddy\" and Castro's mother \"grandmother\". In 2013, he showed one of his adult daughters a picture of the child and said that she was his girlfriend's daughter from another man. He had told others who saw her that she was his granddaughter.\n\nAccording to a statement from Cleveland Police, officers visited Castro's home only once following the kidnappings to discuss an unrelated incident. Castro did not appear to be home at the time and was later interviewed elsewhere. Although neighbors claimed to have called the police about suspicious activity observed at the home, police have said they have no record of any such calls. Castro's son Anthony reported that there were certain areas of the house that were inaccessible due to being locked. He also mentioned an occasion where, three weeks before the women's escape, Castro asked him if Berry would ever be found. Anthony said he told Castro that Berry was likely dead, to which Castro responded: \"Really? You think so?\"\n\nNBC affiliate WKYC reported that during Castro's interrogation, he recalled each of the three abductions in great detail and indicated that they were unplanned crimes of opportunity. According to WKYC's sources, Castro did not have an \"exit plan\" and believed that he would eventually be caught. He referred to himself as \"coldblooded\" and a sex addict. Police found a suicide note in Castro's home in which he allegedly discussed the abductions and wrote that his money, videos and possessions should be given to the kidnapped women if he were caught.\n\nOn May 6, 2013, Berry was finally able to make contact with Castro's neighbors, leading to her escape with her 6-year-old daughter, and the rescue of DeJesus and Knight by authorities. According to police, when Castro left the house that day, Berry realized that he failed to lock the home's \"big inside door\", although the exterior storm door was bolted. She did not attempt to break through the outer door because \"she thought [Castro] was testing her\", according to the police report. Previously, Castro tested the women by leaving the house partially unlocked and exits unsecured. If they attempted to escape, he beat them. Instead, Berry screamed for help when she saw neighbors through the screen. \n\nNeighbor Angel Cordero responded to the screaming but was unable to communicate with Berry, because he spoke little English. Another neighbor, Charles Ramsey, joined Cordero at the house's front door during the rescue. A hole was kicked through the bottom of the storm door, and Berry crawled through, carrying her daughter; Ramsey said Berry told him that she and her child were being kept inside the house against her will. Upon being freed, she went to the house of another Spanish-speaking neighbor and called 9-1-1, saying;\n\nResponding police officers entered Castro's house. As they walked through an upstairs hallway with guns drawn, they announced themselves as Cleveland Police. After peeking out from a slightly opened bedroom door, Knight entered the hallway and leaped into an officer's arms, repeatedly saying, \"You saved me.\" Soon afterward, DeJesus entered the hallway from another room. Knight and DeJesus walked out of the home, and all three women, plus the child, were taken to MetroHealth Medical Center. Berry and DeJesus were released from the hospital the next day. Knight was discharged four days later, on May 10.\n\nCastro was arrested on May 6, 2013. He was charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape on May 8, which carry prison sentences of ten years to life in Ohio. Two of Castro's brothers were also initially taken into custody, but were released on May 9 after police announced that they had no involvement in the kidnappings.\n\nCastro made his first court appearance at the Cleveland Municipal Court on May 9, where bail was set at $2 million per kidnapping charge, adding to a total of $8 million. Additional charges were reported to be pending, including aggravated murder (for intentional induction of miscarriages), attempted murder, assault, a charge for each alleged instance of rape, and a kidnapping charge for each day each captive was allegedly held. On May 14, Castro's attorneys said he would plead \"not guilty\" to all charges if indicted for kidnapping and rape.\n\nA Cuyahoga County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment against Castro on June 7. It contained 329 counts, including two counts of aggravated murder (under different sections of the Ohio criminal code) for his alleged role in the termination of one of the women's pregnancies. The indictments covered only the period from August 2002 to February 2007. The county prosecutor, Timothy J. McGinty, stated that the investigation was ongoing, and that any further findings would be presented to the grand jury. McGinty said that pursuing a death penalty specification would be considered following completion of indictment proceedings.\n\nAfter entering a not guilty plea for Castro on June 12, one of his attorneys, Craig Weintraub, said that although some of the charges against Castro were indisputable, \"it is our hope that we can continue to work toward a resolution to avoid having an unnecessary trial about aggravated murder and the death penalty\". He noted, \"We are very sensitive to the emotional strain and impact that a trial would have on the women, their families and this community\". Castro was found competent to stand trial on July 3.\n\nOn July 12, a Cuyahoga County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment for the remainder of the period after February 2007. It brought the total to 977 counts: 512 counts of kidnapping, 446 of rape, seven of gross sexual imposition, six of felonious assault, three of child endangerment, two of aggravated murder, and one of possession of criminal tools. On July 17, Castro pleaded not guilty to the expanded indictment.\n\nCastro pleaded guilty on July 26 to 937 of the 977 charges against him, including charges of kidnapping, rape, and aggravated murder, as part of a plea bargain which called for consecutive sentences of life in prison plus 1,000 years, all without parole. Under the plea deal, Castro forfeited his right to appeal, and could not profit in any way due to his crimes. He also forfeited his assets, including his home, which prosecutors said would be demolished. Castro was told by Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Russo, \"You will not be getting out. Is that clear?\" to which Castro responded, \"I do understand that, your honor.\" Castro also made comments about his \"addiction to pornography\" and \"sexual problem\", but was cut off by Judge Russo, who said such issues could be discussed at the August 1 sentencing hearing. A law firm representing Berry, DeJesus, and Knight released a statement that the three women were \"relieved by today's plea. They are satisfied by this resolution to the case, and are looking forward to having these legal proceedings draw to a final close in the near future\".\n\nAt the sentencing hearing on August 1, Castro was sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison, plus 1,000 years, all without any possibility of parole. He was also fined $100,000. The court forfeited all of his property and assets to the Cuyahoga County government. Before his sentencing, Castro addressed the court for twenty minutes, in which he said he was \"a good person\" and \"not a monster\", but that he was addicted to sex and pornography, and had \"practiced the art of masturbation\" from a young age. He claimed that he had never beaten or tortured the women, and insisted that \"most\" of the sex he had with them \"was consensual\". He shifted between an apologetic tone and blaming the FBI for failing to catch him, as well as his victims themselves, insisting to the court that when he had sex with them he discovered they were not virgins. He would alternatively shift back into apologetic comments, saying: \"I hope they can find in their hearts to forgive me because we had a lot of harmony going on in that home\".\n\nThe sentencing judge also heard from Knight and family members of Berry and DeJesus. Knight told Castro: \"You took eleven years of my life away. I spent eleven years in hell, now your hell is just beginning. I will overcome all that has happened, but you will face hell for eternity. I will live on, you will die a little every day as you think of the eleven years of atrocities that you inflicted on us... I can forgive you, but I will never forget.\"\n\nOn July 9, 2013, Knight, Berry, and DeJesus broke their public silence for the first time since their rescue by releasing a video statement thanking the public for their support. An attorney for Berry and DeJesus said the women \"still have a strong desire for privacy\" and did not wish to speak to the media about their ordeal. The Cleveland Courage Fund, a bank account set up to help the women in their transition to independent life, had collected approximately $1.05 million at the time of the video's release. Before Berry's disappearance, her grandfather had promised to give her a classic Chevrolet Monte Carlo from the year Berry was born. He kept the car after her kidnapping, in case she was still found alive. After her rescue, Berry called her grandfather, and asked if he still had the car, which he did, although it was in need of restoration from having gone unused. Several automotive shops offered to perform the restoration for free.\n\nIn an interview with \"People\" magazine on the first anniversary of her rescue, Knight discussed some of her ordeals as well as her life leading up to her abduction. Since her rescue, she legally changed her first name to Lily, and began to get several tattoos as her way of coping with the healing process. Knight also revealed that her son was adopted by his foster parents while she was in captivity, and that while she wanted to see him, she does not want to bring him into the ordeal she has had to deal with, and planned to see him after he becomes an adult. Knight planned to open a restaurant, dreamed of getting married — which she did in 2016 — and adopt children. Knight also planned to reunite with Berry and DeJesus in the future, but began focusing on getting her own life back on track. Berry and DeJesus received honorary diplomas from John Marshall High School in 2015.\n\nAs part of the plea bargain, the house where Castro lived, and where he had held the women captive, was demolished on August 7, 2013. Knight was present and handed out yellow balloons, which she said represented missing children, to the gathered crowd. The balloons were released before DeJesus's aunt began the demolition with a swing of a crane.\n\nOn the evening of September 3, 2013, one month into his life sentence, Castro was found hanging with a bed sheet in his detention cell at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient, Ohio. Prison staff performed CPR on Castro before he was taken to the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, where he was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. The following day, Franklin County coroner Dr. Jan Gorniak announced that a preliminary autopsy had found the cause of Castro's death to be suicide by hanging.\n\nOn October 10, 2013, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction released a report that suggested Castro may have died accidentally from auto-erotic asphyxiation rather than suicide. Gorniak rejected the possibility, standing by her ruling of suicide. The report also said two prison guards had falsified logs documenting their observation of Castro hours before he was found dead. Castro was not on suicide watch at the time of his death, but had been subject to routine checks every thirty minutes due to his notoriety.\n\nA consultant's report was released on December 3, and officially concluded that \"all available evidence pointed to suicide, including a shrine-like arrangement of family pictures and a Bible in Castro's cell, an increasing tone of frustration in his prison journal and the reality of spending the rest of his life in prison while subject to constant harassment.\" The Ohio State Highway Patrol also reviewed the case and reached the same conclusion.\n\n\n"}

Although gay sex was partially decriminalised by the Sexual Offences Act 1967, they were all convicted under section 13 of the 1956 Act because more than two men had sex together, which was still illegal. One of the participants (Craig Turner) was also six months under the statutory age of consent for gay sex which was 18 at the time. \n\nUnder the provisions of the 1967 Act, the age of consent for gay sex was different from that of the heterosexual age of consent of 16, and had only been reduced from 21 to 18 by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Equivalent heterosexual behaviour was not a crime.\n\nThe offences only came to light after police seized videos of the men having sex, which they had filmed for their own personal use. All the men were either lovers, ex-boyfriends, or friends of friends.\n\nDuring sentencing on 20 February 1998 Gary Abdie, David Godfrey, Mark Love and Jonathan Moore (all of whom were in their early 20s), and Craig Turner (17 at the time of the offences but 18 when he appeared in court) were given probation and community service orders. The Judge gave Norman Williams a two-year suspended prison sentence and Terry Connell received a nine-month suspended sentence and was ordered to pay £500 towards the cost of the prosecution. Moore (20), Williams (33) and Connell (55) were also required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for the age of consent offences committed with Turner. Estimates of the overall cost of the prosecution were in the region of £500,000.\n\nDespite their convictions, none of them received custodial sentences possibly as a result of a high-profile campaign led by gay human rights group OutRage!. Over 400 letters were presented to the court in support of the men including those from MPs, Bishops and human rights groups. The letters urged the judge not to impose a custodial sentence, with one group, Amnesty International, pledging to declare the men prisoners of conscience should they be imprisoned.\n\nIn 2000, six of the men appealed to the European Court of Human Rights arguing that the prosecutions against them had violated their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights by interfering with 'the right to respect for a private family life' enshrined in article 8 of the Convention. They were subsequently awarded compensation. As Williams was not part of the litigation, he was not deemed eligible by the Home Office for the compensation.\n\nLegislation subsequently introduced by the Labour Government has broadly equalised the treatment of homosexual and heterosexual behaviours in criminal law. The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 equalised the age of consent for gay sex with that of the heterosexual age of consent which is now 16 for both. The Sexual Offences Act 2003, though subject to some controversy, introduced an overhaul in the way sexual offences are dealt with by the police and courts, replacing provisions that date as far back to the 1956 legislation. The offences of gross indecency and buggery have been repealed and sexual activity between more than two men is no longer a crime in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

He had met Lamarque in prison, and through him met Berruyer. Beurruyer's house in Romans-sur-Isère was where Lamarque and the fourth man, Liottard, lived as boarders.\n\nThe gang typically carried out home invasions on remote, rural dwellings, where they tortured householders into revealing the locations of hidden valuables by burning their feet. This form of banditry was not unknown in France; criminals who did this were widely known as \"chauffeurs (heaters).\n\nThe \"Chauffeurs de la Drome\" were responsible for as many as 18 murders between 1905 and 1908. They were able to avoid suspicion by maintaining their legitimate occupations during the day, carrying out attacks at night.\n\nBerruyer was arrested on 22 October 1908 at his house; a search of the house revealed a large cache of stolen items. Liottard and David were arrested soon after but the fourth man, Lamarque, escaped. Their eight-day trial began at Valence, Drôme on 2 July 1909. All four men were convicted and sentenced to death. Armand Fallières, the President of France at the time, was personally opposed to the death penalty, but the strength of public opinion made it impossible for him to accept their pleas for clemency.\n\nThe executions by guillotine of David, Berruyer and Liottard took place at Valence, Drôme, on 22 September 1909 at 6 am, within the space of a few minutes and before a cheering crowd. A number of photographs were taken despite this being against the law; postcards were widely sold, and there were newspaper advertisements for public showings of motion pictures of the executions.\n\nLamarque was captured in 1910. He had been sentenced to death \"in absentia\", but after his capture his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment with hard labour in the penal colony at Devil's Island.\n"}

They are commonly described as having human female form with brown or dark blue skin, backward facing feet, and very long manes of smooth, glossy hair that covers their otherwise naked bodies. They supposedly inhabit the high mountains of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.\n\nThese creatures have nocturnal habits. Also, due to the position of their feet, one can never quite tell from which direction the beings are moving from by looking at their footprints. Some people believe that they bring death, and it is said that one should not look them in the eye, otherwise the person is at risk of being bewitched permanently. Also, the only vocalization made by ciguapas is said to be a kind of whine or chirping.\n\nCiguapas are considered to be magical beings, beautiful in appearance to some, yet horrendous to others. All sources agree that they are wild creatures. They are compared in many cases to mermaids: beautiful yet cruel, and far from innocent. Deceitful and ready to capture the wayward traveler, they are said that they are so beautiful as to lure men into the forest, even though following footprints is misleading, to make love with them only to kill them afterwards. Even today, one can still find inhabitants who confirm having sighted a ciguapa.\n\nLore states that the only way to capture a ciguapa is by tracking them at night, during a full moon, with a black and white polydactylic dog (called \"cinqueño\" dog).\n\nThough many believe that the myth of the ciguapa is of Taino origin, it has been argued that is probably of more recent concoction, being possibly attributed to African beliefs brought to the island by enslaved peoples during the colonial period. More to the point, no known Taino artifacts or lore make reference to any creature even remotely similar to it. Also, the legend may have originated from other myths, as distant as the Guaraní \"Curupí\" or the Hindu Churel, which was described by Rudyard Kipling in \"My Own True Ghost Story\" as having traits amazingly similar to those of the ciguapa. Nonetheless, the Hindu hypothesis may be far-fetched since there is no way to ascertain how this story got to the Dominican Republic during the nineteenth century, when no cultural exchange whatsoever occurred between these nations.\n\nA Dominican film called \"El Mito de la Ciguapa\" (The Myth of the Ciguapa) is set to be produced by Xenda Films.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "221283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221283", "title": "Coat of arms of Sweden", "text": "Coat of arms of Sweden\n\nThe coat of arms of the Kingdom of Sweden () has a lesser and a greater version.\n\nThe usage of the coats of arms is regulated by Swedish Law, Act 1970:498, which states (in unofficial translation) that \"in commercial activities, the coats of arms, the flag or other official insignia of Sweden may not be used in a trademark or other insignias for products or services without proper authorisation. This includes any mark or text referring to the Swedish State which this can give the commercial mark a sign of official endorsement. This includes municipal coats of arms which are registered.\"\n\nAny representation consisting of three crowns ordered two above one are considered to be the lesser coat of arms, and its usage is therefore restricted by law 1970:498.\n\nThe arms of Sweden were first formally codified by law in 1908. This law also formally codifies the differences between the \"greater\" and \"lesser\" arms. The present law prescribing the two arms dates from 1982.\n\nThe greater coat of arms is blazoned in Swedish law as follows:\n\n\"A shield azure, quartered by a cross Or with outbent arms, and an inescutcheon containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House. In the first and fourth fields three open crowns Or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams argent, a lion crowned with an open crown Or armed gules. The inescutcheon is party per pale the arms for the House of Vasa (Bendwise azure, argent and gules, a \"vasa\" Or); and the House of Bernadotte (Azure, issuant from a wavy base a bridge with three arches and two towers embattled argent, in honor point an eagle regardant with wings inverted resting on thunderbolts Or, and in chief the Big Dipper constellation of the same). The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the Order of the Seraphim. Supported by two lions regardant, crowned and with forked tails Or armed gules, standing on a compartment Or. All surrounded by ermine mantling, crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseladorned strings Or.\"\n\nThe greater arms may also be displayed only with the crowned escutcheon. While the arms have undergone significant changes over the years, such as changing the inescutcheon with the ruling dynasty, they are based on arms created by King Karl Knutsson in 1448.\n\nThe escutcheon used in the greater blazon has in total five elements: 4 quarterings on the main escutcheon (two coats of arms duplicated), and three coat of arms incorporated into an escutcheon of pretense. However, Bernadotte never used any stars in the arms of Pontecorvo (neither as Prince of Pontecorvo, nor as King of Sweden and Norway). The stars were introduced as an element in the royal coat of arms in the 19th century, chosen as a symbol of Sweden's eternal existence, as in the poem by Esaias Tegnér:\n\nThis symbol became especially popular through its allusion to the name that had been borne by so many famous Swedish kings. Ursa Major, or as it is called in Swedish, \"Karlavagnen\" (Charles' Wain), adds a Swedish accent to the Bernadotte dynastic coat of arms much in the same way as do the Vasa arms.\n\nThe arms are supported by two lions with forked tails (\"queue fourchée\"), facing away from the shield and crowned with Royal Crowns. For centuries, the lion has been an important element in Swedish heraldry and especially for the State Coat of Arms. The shield may be surmounted by the Collar of the Order of Seraphim, the foremost order in Sweden, and the highest honour the Swedish state can bestow on an individual.\n\nBesides being the official national coat of arms, the greater coat of arms is also the personal coat of arms of the king, and as such he can decree its use as a personal coat of arms by other members of the Royal House, with the alterations and additions decided by him.\n\nBlazon: \"The greater state arms consist of a head shield azure, quartered by a cross or with outbent arms, and an inescutcheon containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House.\n\nIn the first and fourth fields three coronets or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams argent, a lion crowned with an open crown or with armaments gules. The inescutcheon is party per pale the arms for the House of Vasa and the House of Bernadotte. The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the Order of the Seraphim. Supported by two lions regardant or crowned, with parted tails and armaments gules, standing on a postament. All surrounded by hermine mantling crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseled strings or.\"\n\nThe lesser coat of arms is mainly used by the Government of Sweden and subordinate government authorities. As such it may be joined by insignias symbolising the activity of individual government agencies, following approval by the State Board of Heraldry. It is, for instance, embroidered on all Swedish police uniforms and in various coats of arms of the Swedish Armed Forces.\n\nBlazon: \"Azure, with three coronets Or, ordered two above one.\" Crowned with a royal crown. The shield may also be surrounded by the insignias of the Order of the Seraphim.\"\n\n"}

It is one use of a deed poll.\n\nSome organisations, such as government departments issuing passports and driving licences, may not recognise a name change without documentation, such as a deed or statutory declaration. However, an official document is not a legal requirement for a valid name change according to common law.\n\nIn England and Wales, such a deed may be registered in the Central Office of the High Court. Deeds so registered are advertised in the \"London Gazette\". A deed of name change on behalf of a minor must be approved by the Senior Master on behalf of the Master of the Rolls who will take into account the child's best interests. A deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it and the child does not object to it.\n\nRegistration of deeds is regulated by the \"Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994\", SI 1994/604 (as amended)\n. Compared to some other European countries, for example Germany, a name change in the UK is easy and virtually unrestricted regarding choice.\n\nRegistration of a deed of change of name is not a legal requirement in the United Kingdom. A standard legal document, with stock wording, filled in by the person making the deed poll, and signed in presence of a witness, carries sufficient legal authority to be recognised. The witness need not be a solicitor but can be anyone over the age of 18 independent of the person changing their name.\n\nThe procedure, requirements and law surrounding the issue in Northern Ireland are similar to those in England and Wales.\nIn England, Northern Ireland and Wales, a deed of change of name will not change the name on a birth certificate. For instance, when applying for a passport, both the certificate and the deed would need to be presented as documents of identity. In Northern Ireland, for children between the ages of two and eighteen years, only one change of forename(s) and one change of surname may be recorded. In Scotland, it is also possible to record a change of name on the original birth register entry at the General Register Office. However, only one change of forename and three changes of surname are permitted.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, a deed poll of change of name () is obtainable from the Central Office of the Four Courts, Dublin at a cost of €30. Like in the UK, there are very few restrictions on name changes. One is that foreign nationals must also obtain a change of name license from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service. One of Ireland's most noted name changers was the politician Seán Loftus, who repeatedly added middle names referring to his political views so that they would appear on election ballot papers.\n\nIn \"re Parrott, Cox v Parrott\" [1946] Ch 183, Mr Justice Vaisey stated that he did not believe that a deed poll could be used to change a person's Christian name (first name) – that could be done by only an Act of Parliament. Deeds that change a person's first name can be registered by the applicant in the Enrolment Books of the Senior Courts of England and Wales, which is located within the Royal Courts of Justice on Strand, London, and they are usually endorsed \"Notwithstanding the decision of Mr Justice Vaisey in \"re Parrott, Cox v Parrott\", the applicant wishes the enrolment to proceed\".\n\n"}
{"id": "9591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9591", "title": "E. E. Cummings", "text": "E. E. Cummings\n\nEdward Estlin \"E. E.\" Cummings (October 14, 1894 – September 3, 1962), often styled as e e cummings, as he is attributed in many of his published works, was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright. He wrote approximately 2,900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays.\n\nCummings is associated with modernist free-form poetry. Much of his work has original syntax and uses lower case spellings for poetic expression. His use of lower case extended to rendering even the personal pronoun \"I\" as \"i\", as in the phrase \"i shall go\". Cummings was politically neutral much of his life until the rise of the Cold War when he became a Republican and a supporter of Joseph McCarthy. He taught briefly at Harvard University in the 1950s, before his death in 1962.\n\nEdward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Edward Cummings and the former Rebecca Haswell Clarke, a well-known Unitarian couple in the city. His father was a professor at Harvard University and later became nationally known as the minister of South Congregational Church (Unitarian) in Boston, Massachusetts. His mother, who loved to spend time with her children, played games with Cummings and his sister, Elizabeth. From an early age, Cummings' parents supported his creative gifts. Cummings wrote poems and also drew as a child, and he often played outdoors with the many other children who lived in his neighborhood. He grew up in the company of such family friends as the philosophers William James and Josiah Royce. Many of Cummings' summers were spent on Silver Lake in Madison, New Hampshire, where his father had built two houses along the eastern shore. The family ultimately purchased the nearby Joy Farm where Cummings had his primary summer residence.\n\nHe expressed transcendental leanings his entire life. As he matured, Cummings moved to an \"I, Thou\" relationship with God. His journals are replete with references to \"le bon Dieu\", as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as \"Bon Dieu! may I some day do something truly great. amen.\"). Cummings \"also prayed for strength to be his essential self ('may I be I is the only prayer—not may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong'), and for relief of spirit in times of depression ('almighty God! I thank thee for my soul; & may I never die spiritually into a mere mind through disease of loneliness').\"\n\nCummings wanted to be a poet from childhood and wrote poetry daily from age 8 to 22, exploring assorted forms. He graduated from Harvard University with a Bachelor of Arts degree \"magna cum laude\" and Phi Beta Kappa in 1915 and received a Master of Arts degree from the university in 1916. In his studies at Harvard, he developed an interest in modern poetry, which ignored conventional grammar and syntax, while aiming for a dynamic use of language. Upon graduating, he worked for a book dealer.\nIn 1917, with the First World War ongoing in Europe, Cummings enlisted in the Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps. On the boat to France, he met William Slater Brown. They became fast friends. Due to an administrative mix-up, Cummings and Brown were not assigned to an ambulance unit for five weeks, during which time the two of them explored Paris. He fell in love with the city, to which he would return throughout his life.\n\nDuring their service in the ambulance corps, the two young writers sent letters home that drew the attention of the military censors. They were known to prefer the company of French soldiers over fellow ambulance drivers. The two openly expressed anti-war views; Cummings spoke of his lack of hatred for the Germans. On September 21, 1917, five months after starting his belated assignment, Cummings and William Slater Brown were arrested by the French military on suspicion of espionage and undesirable activities. They were held for three and a half months in a military detention camp at the \"Dépôt de Triage\", in La Ferté-Macé, Orne, Normandy.\n\nThey were imprisoned with other detainees in a large room. Cummings' father failed to obtain his son's release through diplomatic channels, and in December 1917 he wrote a letter to President Woodrow Wilson. Cummings was released on December 19, 1917, and Brown was released two months later. Cummings used his prison experience as the basis for his novel, \"The Enormous Room\" (1922), about which F. Scott Fitzgerald said, \"Of all the work by young men who have sprung up since 1920 one book survives—\"The Enormous Room\" by e e cummings... Those few who cause books to live have not been able to endure the thought of its mortality.\" \n\nCummings returned to the United States on New Year's Day 1918. Later in 1918 he was drafted into the army. He served in the 12th Division at Camp Devens, Massachusetts, until November 1918.\n\nCummings returned to Paris in 1921 and had lived there for two years before returning to New York. His collection \"Tulips and Chimneys\" was published in 1923 and his inventive use of grammar and syntax is evident. The book was heavily cut by his editor. \"XLI Poems\" was published in 1925. With these collections, Cummings made his reputation as an avant garde poet.\n\nDuring the rest of the 1920s and 1930s, Cummings returned to Paris a number of times, and traveled throughout Europe, meeting, among others, artist Pablo Picasso. In 1931 Cummings traveled to the Soviet Union, recounting his experiences in \"Eimi\", published two years later. During these years Cummings also traveled to Northern Africa and Mexico. He worked as an essayist and portrait artist for \"Vanity Fair\" magazine (1924–1927).\n\nIn 1926, Cummings' parents were in a car crash; only his mother survived, although she was severely injured. Cummings later described the crash in the following passage from his \"i: six nonlectures\" series given at Harvard (as part of the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures) in 1952 and 1953:\nA locomotive cut the car in half, killing my father instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, as if trying to discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six-year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.\nHis father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, who entered a new period in his artistic life. He began to focus on more important aspects of life in his poetry. He started this new period by paying homage to his father in the poem \"my father moved through dooms of love\".\n\nIn the 1930s Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs was Cummings' publisher; he had started the Golden Eagle Press after working as a typographer and publisher.\n\nIn 1952, his alma mater, Harvard University, awarded Cummings an honorary seat as a guest professor. The Charles Eliot Norton Lectures he gave in 1952 and 1955 were later collected as \"i: six nonlectures\".\nCummings spent the last decade of his life traveling, fulfilling speaking engagements, and spending time at his summer home, Joy Farm, in Silver Lake, New Hampshire. He died of a stroke on September 3, 1962, at the age of 67 in North Conway, New Hampshire at the Memorial Hospital. Cummings was buried at Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston, Massachusetts. At the time of his death, Cummings was recognized as the second most read author in the United States, behind Robert Frost. Even after his death in 1962, his work is continuing to be published along with a few of these poems: \n\n\nCummings' papers are held at the Houghton Library at Harvard University and the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nCummings was married briefly twice, first to Elaine Orr, then to Anne Minnerly Barton. His longest relationship lasted more than three decades, a common-law marriage to Marion Morehouse.\n\nCummings' first marriage, to Elaine Orr, began as a love affair in 1918 while she was still married to Scofield Thayer, one of Cummings' friends from Harvard. During this time he wrote a good deal of his erotic poetry. After divorcing Thayer, Elaine married Cummings on March 19, 1924. The couple had a daughter together out of wedlock. However, the couple separated after two months of marriage and divorced less than nine months later.\n\nCummings married his second wife Anne Minnerly Barton on May 1, 1929, and they separated three years later in 1932. That same year, Anne obtained a Mexican divorce; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934. Anne died in 1970 aged 72.\n\nIn 1934, after his separation from his second wife, Cummings met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer. Although it is not clear whether the two were ever formally married, Morehouse lived with Cummings in a common-law marriage until his death in 1962. She died on May 18, 1969, while living at 4 Patchin Place, Greenwich Village, New York City, where Cummings had resided since September 1924.\n\nAccording to his testimony in \"EIMI\", Cummings had little interest in politics until his trip to the Soviet Union in 1931, after which he shifted rightward on many political and social issues. Despite his radical and bohemian public image, he was a Republican, and later, an ardent supporter of Joseph McCarthy.\n\nDespite Cummings' familiarity with avant-garde styles (likely affected by the \"Calligrammes\" of French poet Apollinaire, according to a contemporary observation), much of his work is quite traditional. Many of his poems are sonnets, albeit often with a modern twist. He occasionally used the blues form and acrostics. Cummings' poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and to the world. His poems are also often rife with satire.\n\nWhile his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the Romantic tradition, Cummings' work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of syntax, or way of arranging individual words into larger phrases and sentences. Many of his most striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones.\n\nAs well as being influenced by notable modernists, including Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound, Cummings in his early work drew upon the imagist experiments of Amy Lowell. Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to Dada and Surrealism, which he reflected in his work. He began to rely on symbolism and allegory, where he once had used simile and metaphor. In his later work, he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem, choosing to use a symbol instead. Due to this, his later poetry is \"frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier.\" Cummings also liked to incorporate imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.\n\nWhile some of his poetry is free verse (with no concern for rhyme or meter), many have a recognizable sonnet structure of 14 lines, with an intricate rhyme scheme. A number of his poems feature a typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, often making little sense until read aloud, at which point the meaning and emotion become clear. Cummings, who was also a painter, understood the importance of presentation, and used typography to \"paint a picture\" with some of his poems.\n\nThe seeds of Cummings' unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:\n\nFollowing his autobiographical novel, \"The Enormous Room\", Cummings' first published work was a collection of poems titled \"Tulips and Chimneys\" (1923). This work was the public's first encounter with his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.\n\nSome of Cummings' most famous poems do not involve much, if any, odd typography or punctuation, but still carry his unmistakable style, particularly in unusual and impressionistic word order.\n\nCummings' work often does not proceed in accordance with the conventional combinatorial rules that generate typical English sentences (for example, \"they sowed their isn't\"). In addition, a number of Cummings' poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words, as in \"in Just\" which features words such as \"mud-luscious\", \"puddle-wonderful\", and \"eddieandbill.\" This poem is part of a sequence of poems titled \"Chansons Innocentes\"; it has many references comparing the \"balloonman\" to Pan, the mythical creature that is half-goat and half-man. Literary critic R.P. Blackmur has commented that this use of language is \"frequently unintelligible because [Cummings] disregards the historical accumulation of meaning in words in favour of merely private and personal associations.\"\n\nMany of Cummings' poems are satirical and address social issues but have an equal or even stronger bias toward romanticism: time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth.\n\nCummings also wrote children's books and novels. A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip \"Krazy Kat\".\n\nCummings is known for controversial subject matter, as he wrote numerous erotic poems. He also sometimes included ethnic slurs in his writing. For instance, in his 1950 collection \"Xaipe: Seventy-One Poems\", Cummings published two poems containing words that caused outrage in some quarters.\n\n</poem>\n\nand\n\n<poem>\n</poem>\n\nCummings biographer Catherine Reef notes of the controversy:\n\nFriends begged Cummings to reconsider publishing these poems, and the book's editor pleaded with him to withdraw them, but he insisted that they stay. All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. \"America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky' & Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square- head') is to blame for 'kike,'\" he said.\nWilliam Carlos Williams spoke out in his defense.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. \"HIM\", a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the Provincetown Players in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are \"Him\", a playwright, portrayed by William Johnstone, and \"Me\", his girlfriend, portrayed by Erin O'Brien-Moore.\n\nCummings said of the unorthodox play:\nRelax and give the play a chance to strut its stuff—relax, stop wondering what it is all 'about'—like many strange and familiar things, Life included, this play isn't 'about,' it simply is. . . . Don't try to enjoy it, let it try to enjoy you. \"\n\n\"Anthropos, or the Future of Art\" is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology \"Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium\". The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three \"infrahumans\", or inferior beings. The word \"anthropos\" is the Greek word for \"man\", in the sense of \"mankind\".\n\n\"Tom, A Ballet\" is a ballet based on \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". The ballet is detailed in a \"synopsis\" as well as descriptions of four \"episodes\", which were published by Cummings in 1935. It has never been performed.\n\n\"\" was probably Cummings' most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine, \"Wake\". The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus' family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus' faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.\n\nCummings' publishers and others have often echoed the unconventional orthography in his poetry by writing his name in lowercase and without periods (full stops), but normal orthography for his name (uppercase and periods) is supported by scholarship and preferred by publishers today. Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.\n\nThe use of lowercase for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to \"E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer\" by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes Cummings \"had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case.\" According to Cummings' widow, however, this is incorrect. She wrote to Friedman: \"You should not have allowed H. Moore to make such a stupid & childish statement about Cummings & his signature.\" On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on. One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions that Cummings signed his name in all lowercase, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use. Additionally, the \"Chicago Manual of Style\", which prescribes favoring non-standard capitalizion of names in accordance with the bearer's strongly stated preference, notes \"E. E. Cummings can be safely capitalized; it was one of his publishers, not he himself, who lowercased his name.\"\n\nIn 1943, modern dancer and choreographer Jean Erdman presented \"The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell\" with a commissioned score by John Cage and a spoken text from the title poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the Arts Club of Chicago. Erdman also choreographed \"Twenty Poems\" (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings' poems for eight dancers and one actor, with a commissioned score by Teiji Ito. It was performed in the round at the Circle in the Square Theatre in Greenwich Village.\n\nNumerous composers have set Cummings' poems to music:\n\nDuring his lifetime, Cummings received numerous awards in recognition of his work, including:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47449480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47449480", "title": "Human–animal hybrid", "text": "Human–animal hybrid\n\nTerms human–animal hybrid and animal–human hybrid refer to an entity that incorporates elements from both humans and non-human animals.\n\nFor thousands of years, these hybrids have been one of the most common themes in storytelling about animals throughout the world. The lack of a strong divide between humanity and animal nature in multiple traditional and ancient cultures has provided the underlying historical context for the popularity of tales where humans and animals have mingling relationships, such as in which one turns into the other or in which some mixed being goes through a journey. Interspecies friendships within the animal kingdom, as well as between humans and their pets, additionally provides an underlying root for the popularity of such beings.\n\nIn various mythologies throughout history, many particularly famous hybrids have existed, including as a part of Egyptian and Indian spirituality. The entities have also been characters in fictional media more recently in history such as in H. G. Wells' work \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\", adapted into the popular 1932 film \"Island of Lost Souls\". In legendary terms, the hybrids have played varying roles from that of trickster and/or villain to serving as divine heroes in very different contexts, depending on the given culture.\n\nFor example, Pan is a deity in Greek mythology that rules over and symbolizes the untamed wild, being worshiped by hunters, fishermen, and shepherds in particular. The mischievous yet cheerful character is a Satyr who has the hindquarters, legs, and horns of a goat while otherwise being essentially human in appearance, with stories of his encounters with different gods, humans, and others being retold for centuries on after the days of early Greece by groups such as the Delphian Society. Specifically, the human-animal hybrid has appeared in acclaimed works of art by figures such as Francis Bacon. Additional famous mythological hybrids include the Egyptian god of death, named Anubis, and the fox-like Japanese beings that are called Kitsune.\n\nWhen looked at scientifically, outside of a fictional and/or mythical context, the real-life creation of human-animal hybrids has served as a subject of legal, moral, and technological debate in the context of recent advances in genetic engineering. Defined by the magazine \"H+\" as \"genetic alterations that are blendings [sic] of animal and human forms\", such hybrids may be referred by other names occasionally such as \"para-humans\". They may additionally may be called \"humanized animals\". Technically speaking, they are also related to \"cybrids\" (cytoplasmic hybrids), with \"cybrid\" cells featuring foreign human nuclei inside of them being a topic of interest. Possibly, a real-world human-animal hybrid may be an entity formed from either a human egg fertilized by a nonhuman sperm or a nonhuman egg fertilized by a human sperm. While at first being a concept in the likes of legends and thought experiments, the first stable human-animal chimeras (not hybrids but related) to actually exist were first created by Shanghai Second Medical University scientists in 2003, the result of having fused human cells with rabbit eggs. As well, a U.S. patent has notably been granted for a mouse chimera with a human immune system.\n\nIn terms of scientific ethics, restrictions on the creation of human–animal hybrids have proved a controversial matter in multiple countries. While the state of Arizona banned the practice altogether in 2010, a proposal on the subject that sparked some interest in the United States Senate from 2011 to 2012 ended up going nowhere. Although the two concepts are not strictly related, discussions of experimentation into blended human and animal creatures has paralleled the discussions around embryonic stem-cell research (the 'stem cell controversy'). The creation of genetically modified organisms for a multitude of purposes has taken place in the modern world for decades, examples being specifically designed foodstuffs made to have features such as higher crop yields through better disease resistance.\n\nDespite the legal and moral controversy over the possible real-life making of such beings, then President George W. Bush even speaking on the subject in his 2006 State of the Union, the concept of humanoid creatures with hybrid characteristics from animals, played in a dramatic and sensationalized fashion, has continued to be a popular element of fictional media in the digital age. Examples include \"Splice\", a 2009 movie about experimental genetic research, and \"The Evil Within\", a survival horror video game released in 2014 in which the protagonist fights grotesque hybrid creatures among other enemies.\n\nBeings displaying a mixture of human and animal traits while also having a similarly blended appearance have played a vast and varied role in multiple traditions around the world. Artist and scholar Pietro Gaietto has written that \"representations of human-animal hybrids always have their origins in religion\". In \"successive traditions they may change in meaning but they still remain within spiritual culture\", Gaietto has argued, when looking back in an evolution-minded point of view. The beings show up in both Greek and Roman mythology, with various elements of ancient Egyptian society ebbing and flowing into those cultures in particular. Prominent examples in ancient Egyptian religion, featuring some of the earliest such hybrid beings, include the canine-like god of death known as Anubis and the lion-like Sphinx. Other instances of these types of characters include figures within both Chinese and Japanese mythology. The observation of interspecies friendships within the animal kingdom, as well as the bonds existing between humans and their pets, have been a source of the appeal in such stories.\n\nA prominent hybrid figure that's internationally known is the mythological Greek figure of Pan. A deity that rules over and symbolizes the untamed wild, he helps express the inherent beauty of the natural world as the Greeks saw things. He specifically received reverence by ancient hunters, fishermen, shepherds, and other groups with a close connection to nature. Pan is a Satyr who possesses the hindquarters, legs, and horns of a goat while otherwise being essentially human in appearance; stories of his encounters with different gods, humans, and others have been a part of popular culture in several different cultures for many years. The human-animal hybrid has appeared in acclaimed works of art by figures such as Francis Bacon, also being mentioned in poetic pieces such as in John Fletcher's writings.\n\nIn Chinese mythology, the figure of Chu Pa-chieh undergoes a personal journey in which he gives up wickedness for virtue. After causing a disturbance in heaven from his licentious actions, he is exiled to Earth. By mistake, he enters the womb of a sow and ends up being born as a half-man/half-pig entity. With the head and ears of a pig coupled with a human body, his already animal-like sense of selfishness from his past life remains. Killing and eating his mother as well as devouring his brothers, he makes his way to a mountain hideout, spending his days preying on unwary travelers unlucky enough to cross his path. However, the exhortations of the kind goddess Kuan Yin, journeying in China, persuade him to seek a nobler path, and his life's journey and the side of goodness proceeds on such that he even is ordained a priest by the goddess herself. Remarking on the character's role in the religious novel \"Journey to the West\", where the being first appears, professor Victor H. Mair has commented that \"[p]ig-human hybrids represent descent and the grotesque, a capitulation to the basest appetites\" rather than \"self-improvement\".\n\nSeveral hybrid entities have long played a major role in Japanese media and in traditional beliefs within the country. For example, a warrior god known as Amida received worship as a part of Japanese mythology for many years; he possessed a generally humanoid appearance while having a canine-like head. However, the god's devotional popularity fell in about the middle of the 19th century. A Tanuki resembles a raccoon or badger, but its shape-shifting talents allow it to turn into humans for the purposes of trickery, such as impersonating Buddhist monks. The fox-like creatures known as Kitsune also possess similar powers, and stories abound of them tricking human men into marriage by turning into seductive women.\n\nOther examples include characters in ancient Anatolia and Mesopotamia. The latter region has had the tradition of a malevolent human-animal hybrid deity in Pazuzu, the demon featuring a humanoid shape yet having grotesque features such as sharp talons. The character picked up revived attention when an interpretation of it appeared in William Peter Blatty's 1971 novel \"The Exorcist\" and the Academy Award winning 1973 film adaption of the same name, with the demon possessing the body of an innocent young girl. The movie, regarded as one of the greatest horror films of all time, has a prologue in which co-protagonist Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) visits an archaeological dig in Iraq and ominously discovers an old statue of the monstrous being.\n\nMany prominent pieces of children's literature over the past two centuries have featured humanized animal characters, often as protagonists in the stories. In the opinion of popular educator Lucy Sprague Mitchell, the appeal of such mythical and fantastic beings comes from how children desire \"direct\" language \"told in terms of images— visual, auditory, tactile, muscle images\". Another author has remarked that an \"animal costume\" provides \"a way to emphasize or even exaggerate a particular characteristic\". The anthropomorphic characters in the seminal works by English writer Beatrix Potter in particular live an ambiguous situation, having human dress yet displaying many instinctive animal traits. Writing on the popularity of Peter Rabbit, a later author commented that in \"balancing humanized domesticity against wild rabbit foraging, Potter subverted parental authority and its built in hypocrisy\" in Potter's child-centered books. Writer Lisa Fraustino has cited on the subject R.M. Lockley's tongue-in-cheek observation: \"Rabbits are so human. Or is it the other way around— humans are so rabbit?\"\n\nWriter H. G. Wells created his famous work \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\", featuring a mixture of horror and science fiction elements, to promote the anti-vivisection cause as a part of his long-time advocacy for animal rights. Wells' story describes a man stuck on an island ruled over by the titular Dr. Moreau, a morally depraved scientist who has created several human-animal hybrids even by combining parts of other animals. The story has been adapted into film several times, with varying success. The most acclaimed version is the 1932 black-and-white treatment called \"Island of Lost Souls\".\n\nWells himself wrote that \"this story was the response of an imaginative mind to the reminder that humanity is but animal rough-hewn to a reasonable shape and in perpetual internal conflict between instinct and injunction,\" with the scandals surrounding Oscar Wilde being the impetus for the English writer's treatment of themes such as ethics and psychology. Challenging the Victorian era viewpoints of its time, the 1896 work presents a complex situation in which enhancing animals into hybrids involves both terrifying violence and pain as well as appears essentially futile, given the power of raw instinct. A pessimistic view towards the ability of human civilization to live by law-abiding, moral standards for long thus follows.\nThe 1986 horror film \"The Fly\" features a deformed and monstrous human-animal hybrid, played by actor Jeff Goldblum. His character, scientist Seth Brundle, undergoes a teleportation experiment that goes awry and fuses him at a fundamental genetic level with a common fly caught besides him. Brundle experiences drastic mutations as a result that horrify him. Movie critic Gerardo Valero has written that the famous horror work, \"released at the dawn of the AIDS epidemic\", \"was seen by many as a metaphor for the disease\" while also playing on bodily fears about dismemberment and coming apart that human beings inherently share.\n\nThe science fiction film \"Splice\", released 2009, shows scientists mixing together human and animal DNA in the hopes of advancing medical research at the pharmaceutical company that they work at. Calamitous results occur.\n\nThe H.P. Lovecraft inspired movie \"Dagon\", released in 2001, additionally features grotesque hybrid beings. In terms of comic books, examples of fictional human-animal hybrids include the characters in Charles Burns' \"Black Hole\" series. In those comics, a set of teenagers in a 1970s era town become afflicted by a bizarre disease; the sexually transmitted affliction mutates them into monstrous forms.\n\nMultiple video games have featured human-animal hybrids as enemies for the protagonist(s) to defeat, including powerful boss characters. For instance, the 2014 survival horror release \"The Evil Within\" includes grotesque hybrid beings, looking like the undead, attacking main character Detective Sebastian Castellanos. With partners Joseph Oda and Julie Kidman, the protagonist attempts investigate a multiple homicide at a mental hospital yet discovers a mysterious figure who turns the world around them into a living nightmare, Castellanos having to find the truth about the criminal psychopath.\n\nHeroic character examples of human-animal anthropomorphic characters include the two protagonists of the 2002 movie \"The Cat Returns\" (Japanese title: 猫の恩返し), with the animated film featuring a young girl (named \"Haru\") being transformed against her will into a feline-human hybrid and fighting a villainous king of the cats with the help of a dashing male cat companion (known as the \"Baron\") at her side. The English language version of the film features Anne Hathaway and Cary Elwes in the main roles, respectively. The critically acclaimed movie, with a score of 89% from Rotten Tomatoes, was directed by Hiroyuki Morita. In one notable moment, the once-again human Haru confesses to having romantic feelings for the Baron, who responds in an ambiguous manner before leaving (vowing to be there for her again when needed).\n\nBroadly speaking, a hybrid being has one cell line throughout its entire body and came originally from a mix of entities, with different species involved to make a new genetic combination. For instance, a liger has a lion father and a tigress mother, such a creature only existing in captivity. Such hybridization has frequently caused difficult health problems that caregivers for the captive animals struggle with.\n\nA chimera is not the same thing as a hybrid because it is a being composed of two or more genetically distinct cell lines in one entity. The entity does not exist as a member of a separate species but has differing elements inside of it. An animal that has experienced an organ transplant or related surgery involving tissues from a different species is an example.\n\nThroughout past human evolution, hybridization occurred in many different instances, such as cross-breeding between Neanderthals and ancient versions of what are now modern humans. Some scientists have believed that particular genes of the Neanderthal may have been key to ancient humans' adapting to the harsh climates they faced when they left Africa. However, mixing between species in the wild both now and through natural history have generally resulted in sterile offspring, thus being a kind of dead end in reproductive terms.\n\nFor much of modern history, the creation of genetically modified organisms in general was a topic rooted in fiction rather than practical research. This has changed significantly over the past few decades such that a number of plants and animals are commonly subject to genetic engineering for commercial purposes. For example, as of 2013 about 85% of the corn grown in the US as well as about 90% of its canola crops have been genetically modified. As well, many Americans that have had cardiovascular surgery have had heart valves initially from pigs used in their procedures.\n\nIssues relating to possible human-animal hybrids outside of a fictional, historical, or mythic context but as real, engineered beings received major international attention in 2003, after some Chinese scientists at the Shanghai Second Medical University managed to successfully fuse human cells with rabbit eggs. The embryos formed reportedly were the first stable human-animal chimeras in existence. Research in similar areas continued into 2004 and 2005, with the topic picking up coverage from publications such as \"National Geographic News\". The National Academy of Sciences soon began to look into the ethical questions involved. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office additionally stirred interest into the topic by granting a patent request for a genetically modified mouse with a human immune system. Scientists announced in 2017 that they successfully created the first human-animal chimeric embryo. The embryo consisted mostly pig cells and some human cells. Scientists stated that they hope to use this technology to address the shortage of donor organs.\n\nAdvances in genetic engineering have generally caused a large amount of debates and discussion in the fields related to bioethics, and research relating to the hypothetical creation of human-animal hybrids in the future has been no exception. The technical analyses of intermingling human-based and animal-based genetic material are ongoing; the ethical, moral, and legal issues arising from actual research using chimeras (rather than hybrids per se) at the moment also touch more speculative concerns as well. While laws against the creation of hybrid beings have been proposed in U.S. states and in the U.S. Congress, several scientists have argued that legal barriers might go too far and prohibit medically beneficial studies into human modification. Although the two topics are not strictly related, the debates involving the creation of human-animal hybrids have paralleled that of the debates around the stem-cell research controversy.\n\nThe question of what line exists between a 'human' being and a 'non-human' being has been a difficult one for many researchers to answer. While animals having one percent or less of their cells originally coming from humans may clearly appear to be in the same boat as other animals, no consensus exists on how to think about beings in a genetic middle ground that have something like an even mix. \"I don't think anyone knows in terms of crude percentages how to differentiate between humans and nonhumans,\" U.S. patent office official John Doll has stated. Critics of increased government restrictions include scientists such as Dr. Douglas Kniss, head of the Laboratory of PeriNatal Research at Ohio State University, who has remarked that formal laws aren't the best option since the \"notion of animal–human hybrids is very complex.\" He's also argued that their creation is inherently \"not the kind of thing we support\" in his kind of research since scientists should \"want to respect human life\". \"There are chimeras out there that serve very valuable purposes in medical research, such as mice that make human antibodies,\" Michael Werner, the chief of policy for the Biotechnology Industry Organization, has commented.\n\nIn contrast, notable socio-economic theorist Jeremy Rifkin has expressed opposition to research that creates beings crossing species boundaries, arguing that it interferes with the fundamental 'right to exist' possessed by each animal species. \"One doesn't have to be religious or into animal rights to think this doesn't make sense,\" he has argued when expressing support for anti-chimera and anti-hybrid legislation. As well, William Cheshire, associate professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic's Florida branch, has called the issue \"unexplored biologic territory\" and advocated for a \"moral threshold of human neural development\" to restrict the destroying a human embryo to obtain cell material and/or the creation of an organism that's partly human and partly animal.\" He has said, \"We must be cautious not to violate the integrity of humanity or of animal life over which we have a stewardship responsibility\".\n\nIn the U.S., efforts into creating a hybrid entity appeared to be legal when the topic first came up. The developmental biologist Stuart Newman, a professor at New York Medical College in Valhalla, N.Y., applied for a patent on a human-animal chimera in 1997 as a challenge to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the U.S. Congress, motivated by his moral and scientific opposition to the notion that living things can be patented at all. Prior legal precedent had established that genetically engineered entities in general could be patented, even if they were based on beings occurring in nature.\n\nAfter a seven-year process, Newman's patent finally received a flat rejection. The legal process had created a paper trail of arguments, giving Newman what he considered a victory. \"The Washington Post\" ran an article on the controversy that stated that it had raised \"profound questions about the differences-- and similarities-- between humans and other animals, and the limits of treating animals as property.\" President George W. Bush brought up the topic in his 2006 State of the Union Address, in which he called for the prohibition of \"human cloning in all its forms\", \"creating or implanting embryos for experiments\", \"creating \"human-animal hybrids\"\", and also \"buying, selling, or patenting human embryos\". He argued, \"A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners and that recognize the matchless value of every life.\" He also stated that humanity \"should never be discarded, devalued or put up for sale.\"\n\nA 2005 appropriations bill passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Bush contained specific wording forbidding any patents on humans or human embryos. In terms of outright bans on hybrid research in the first place, a measure came up in the 110th Congress entitled the \"Human-Animal Hybrid Prohibition Act of 2008\". Politician Chris Smith (R, NJ-4) introduced it on April 24, 2008. The text of the proposed act stated that \"human dignity and the integrity of the human species are compromised\" if such hybrids exist and set up a punishment of imprisonment for up to ten years as well as a fine of over one million dollars. Though attracting support from many co-sponsors such as then Representatives Mary Fallin, Duncan Hunter, Joseph R. Pitts, and Rick Renzi among others, the Act failed to get through Congress.\n\nA related proposal had come up in the U.S. Senate the prior year, the \"Human–Animal Hybrid Prohibition Act of 2007\", and it also had failed. That effort was proposed by then Senator Sam Brownback (R, KS) on November 15, 2007. Featuring the same language as the later measure in the House, its bipartisan group of cosponsors included then Senators Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint, and Mary Landrieu.\n\nA localized measure designed to ban the creation of hybrid entities came up in the state of Arizona in 2010. The proposal was signed into law by then Governor Jan Brewer. Its sponsor stated that it was needed to clarify important \"ethical boundaries\" in research.\n\n"}
{"id": "4318352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4318352", "title": "Husband", "text": "Husband\n\nA husband is a male in a marital relationship. The rights and obligations of a husband regarding his spouse and others, and his status in the community and in law, vary between cultures and have varied over time.\n\nIn monogamous cultures, there are only two parties to a marriage. This is enforced by legal codes that outlaw two (bigamy) or more (polygamy) female spouses. Similarly, polyandry, marriage of one female partner with more than one male partner at the same time is not permitted. In polygamous and polyandrous cultures, there may be more than two parties to a marriage.\n\nIn marriages where both spouses are men, both may be referred to as husband.\n\nIn heterosexual marriages, the husband was traditionally regarded as the head of the household and was expected to be the sole provider or breadwinner, a role that is still maintained in some cultures (sometimes described as paternalistic).\n\nThe term continues to be applied to such a man who has separated from his spouse and ceases to be applied to him only when his marriage has come to an end following a legally recognized divorce or the death of his spouse. On the death of his spouse, a husband is referred to as a widower; after a divorce a man may be referred to as the \"ex-husband\" of his former spouse.\n\nIn today's society a husband is not necessarily considered the breadwinner of the family, especially if his spouse has a more financially rewarding occupation or career. In such cases, it is not uncommon for a husband to be considered a stay-at-home father if the married couple have children.\n\nThe term \"husband\" refers to Middle English \"huseband\", from Old English \"hūsbōnda\", from Old Norse \"hūsbōndi\" (\"hūs\", \"house\" + \"bōndi\", \"būandi\", present participle of \"būa\", \"to dwell\", so, etymologically, \"a householder\").\n\nAt the conclusion of a valid wedding, the marrying parties acquire the status of married person and, while the marriage persists, a man is called a husband. In heterosexual marriages the woman is called a wife; in same-sex marriages between males, each male is called a husband; between females, each is called a wife. Regardless of gender, a married person is the spouse of the other party to the marriage.\n\nAlthough \"husband\" is a close term to groom, the latter is a male participant in a wedding ceremony, while a husband is a married man after the wedding and for the duration of the marriage. The term husband refers to the institutionalized role of the married male, while the term father refers to the male in context of his offspring, a state which may or may not indicate that a marriage ceremony has taken place.\n\nIn some cases of heterosexual marriage, before the marriage, he or his family may have received a dowry, or have had to pay a bride price, or both were exchanged. The dowry not only supported the establishment of a household, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, he had to return the dowry to the wife or her family. For the time of the marriage, they were made inalienable by the husband. He might leave his wife (or wives), then widow (or widows), a dower (often a third or a half of his estate) to support her as dowager.\n\n\"Husband\" further refers to the institutionalized form in relation to the spouse and offspring, unlike father, a term that puts a man into the context of his children. Also compare the similar husbandry, which in the 14th century referred to the care of the household, but today means the \"control or judicious use of resources\", conservation, and in agriculture, the cultivation of plants and animals, and the science about its profession.\n\nAs an external symbol of the fact that they are married, each spouse commonly wears a wedding ring on the ring finger; whether this is on the left or right hand depends on the country's tradition.\n\nIn premodern heterosexual unions (ancient Roman, medieval, and early modern history), a husband was obliged to protect and support not only his wife and children, but servants and animals of his domain. The father (as the \"patron\") was awarded with much authority, differing from that of his wife (in these cultures, no polygamy existed).\n\nIn the Middle Ages and Early Modern European history, it was unusual to marry out of love, but then doing so became an influential ideal. During this period, a husband in a heterosexual marriage had more opportunities in society than his wife, who was not recognized as legally independent.\n\nIn contemporary secularized Western culture, the rights of the spouses have been made equal. The civil marriage generally forces the wealthier spouse \"breadwinner\" to provide alimony to the former spouse, even after separation and also after a divorce (see also Law and divorce around the world).\n\nThe legal status of marriage allows each spouse to speak on the other's behalf when one is incapacitated (e.g., in a coma); a husband is also responsible for his spouse's child(ren) in states where he is automatically assumed to be the biological father.\n\nIn Islamic marital jurisprudence, husbands are considered protectors of the household and their wives. As protector, the husband has various rights and obligations that he is expected to fulfill and thus is offered opportunities different from that of his wife or wives, not only in legal and economical affairs of the family but within the family as well. As in most cases in Islam law and culture, everything is being related to the Qur'an.\n\nMany Muslims may agree on a perfectly equal relationship. Islam is the only major religion that puts a cap on polygamy, limiting the number of a man's wives to four—provided the husband can do justice to all of them. Although some religions, such as Catholicism for instance, puts a cap on polygamy all together, or even serial monogamy, allowing one spouse until death does them apart, not even accepting divorce. According to the teachings of Islam a Muslim man should have a valid reason and have to get permission from his existing wife (without any force) if he requires to marry again. Islam vehemently abhors any intimate relationship outside the bond of marriage.\n\nThere is no external sign to show his status as a husband, unless he adopted the tradition of wearing a wedding ring.\n\nA Hindu husband traditionally takes his wife to his home. He is expected to provide for her and to prove his abilities to do so. The marriage in Hinduism is a relationship for Seven births (सात जन्मों का रिश्ता). Before 1951 there was no divorce allowed in Hindu marriage. In past before 1750CE equal rights were given to both men and women and the same was extended in marriage as well.\n\nIn modern times once again after 1951, equal rights for women through society and law jurisdiction is given. In Hinduism, based on the different regions, marriage process is observed differently with the same Saat Pheras around agni kund (light pyre) to be taken to become a husband and wife.\n\nThe Encyclopædia Britannica mentions that \"In Hindu law, the male members of a joint family, together with their wives, widows, and children, are entitled to support out of the joint property.\"\n\nChina's family laws were changed by the Communist revolution; and in 1950, the People's Republic of China enacted a comprehensive marriage law including provisions giving the spouses equal rights with regard to ownership and management of marital property.\n\nIn Christianity, according to the Bible, a husband in a heterosexual marriage has a number of honors:\n\nIn Japan, before enactment of the Meiji Civil Code of 1898, all of the woman's property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand.\n\nAlthough there is generally an expectation for a spouse not to have sexual relations with anyone other than his spouse(s), historically, in most cultures, this expectation was not as strong as in the case of wives, a situation which was evident in legal codes which prohibited adultery, with male adultery often being criminalized only if \"aggravating\" circumstances existed, such as if he brought his mistress in the conjugal home, or if there was public scandal. The double standard was also evident in divorce laws of many countries, such as the UK or Australia, which differentiated between female adultery, which was a ground of adultery by itself, and male adultery, which was a ground only under certain circumstances. This double standard continues to be seen today in many parts of the world. For instance, in the Philippines, a wife can be charged with the crime of a\"dultery\" (for merely having one act of sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband), while a husband can only be charged with the related crime of c\"oncubinage\", which is more loosely defined (it requires either keeping the mistress in the family home, or cohabiting with her, or having sexual relations under scandalous circumstances).\n\nA breach of this expectation of fidelity is commonly referred to as adultery or extramarital sex. Historically, adultery has been considered a serious offense, sometimes a crime. Even if that is not so, it may still have legal consequences, particularly a divorce. Adultery may be a factor to consider in a property settlement, it may affect the status of children, the custody of children, etc.\n\n"}
{"id": "12204754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12204754", "title": "Jane and Michael Stern", "text": "Jane and Michael Stern\n\nJane Grossman Stern and Michael Stern (both born 1946) are American writers who specialize in books about travel, food, and popular culture. They are best known for their \"Roadfood\" books, website, and magazine columns, in which they find road food restaurants serving classic American regional specialties and review them. Starting their hunt for regional American food in the early 1970s they were the first food writers to regard this food as being as worthy to report on as the haute cuisine of other nations. \n\nSince the Sterns began documenting regional American food in the 1970s many other writers and television personalities have used their pioneering work as inspiration. In addition to their early work with regional American food the Sterns' book \"Square Meals\" (Knopf 1985) put \"comfort foods\" like mac and cheese, meatloaf, and mashed potatoes on the culinary map. \"Square Meals\" did an audacious reverse spin on the tricked up and precious nouvelle cuisine that was beloved by food critics at that time. \n\nJane Grossman grew up in New York City, where she attended the Walden School and received a BFA in graphic design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Michael Stern grew up in Winnetka, Illinois, and graduated from the University of Michigan in 1968. They met as graduate students in art at Yale University and their first date, at Pepe's Pizza in New Haven, had a food focus. The couple married in 1970. The following year, Jane earned an MFA in painting from Yale and Michael changed schools and earned an MFA from Columbia University in film. Neither found work in their fields of study.\n\nAfter a short stint of producing documentaries for WNBC, a teaching job at Hunter College and another at Wesleyan University they began work on the book that eventually became the first \"Roadfood\". The book was conceived as a book on \"truck-stop dining,\" funded with an advance from a publisher. The Sterns set out in their car to travel through the United States and eat up to 12 meals daily at diners and local cafes. The resulting first edition of \"Roadfood\" was published in 1977; the most recent edition was released in 2017.\n\nIn addition to their food writing, the Sterns have written books on American popular culture, including \"The New York Times\" bestselling \"Elvis World\" (1987) and \"The Encyclopaedia of Bad Taste\" (1990). In all, they have written over 30 books. They were staff writers for \"Gourmet\" magazine for 18 years, have written for \"The New Yorker\", \"The Atlantic Monthly\", and are now contributing editors at \"Saveur\". \n\nThey are regular guests on American Public Media's public radio program, \"The Splendid Table\". They have won numerous awards, including James Beard awards, and were inducted into Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America in 1992. The Sterns founded Roadfood.com; the site was sold to Fexy Media in 2016. After the sale, the Sterns remained in charge of editorial content of their website.\n\nIn 2003, Jane Stern published \"Ambulance Girl: How I Saved Myself by Becoming an EMT\", a memoir in which she described suffering from severe clinical depression when she was in her early 50s and overcame her depression by training and working as an emergency medical technician in Connecticut. In 2005 the book was made into a television movie, \"Ambulance Girl\", for which actress Kathy Bates was nominated for an Emmy Award. The Sterns wrote a joint memoir, \"Two for the Road: Our Love Affair With American Food\", in 2006. \n\nThe couple divorced in 2008; they still write as a team. She now lives in Ridgefield, Connecticut; he and his present wife, Linda, reside in Aiken, South Carolina. \n\nIn 2011 the former couple published \"The Lexicon of Real American Food\", and Jane Stern published a book on her little known but long-standing career as a tarot card reader. \n\n\n"}

He was defeated by Tudhaliya I and Arnuwanda I. He then attacked Arnuwanda's restive vassal Madduwatta at Zippasla. He had a daughter, who married Madduwatta.\n\nAnother Kupanta-Kurunta was born in the 1330s or 1320s BC at Mira in western Anatolia, in one of the princely families. His father joined a coup against king Mašḫuiluwa. The Hittite king Suppiluliuma I married Mašḫuiluwa to his daughter Muwatti and reinstalled him. Kupanta-Kurunta's father apparently died or was exiled soon after. Mašḫuiluwa then asked Suppiluliuma's successor Mursili II if he could adopt Kupanta-Kurunta as a son.\n\nMira remained a Hittite ally against Uhha-Ziti of Arzawa; but two years after Mursili's eclipse (which would mean 1310 BC) Mira rebelled under influence from \"Great-House-Father\" (probably an adventurer from Masa). Mursili quashed this rebellion, transferred Mašḫuiluwa to a priesthood in Hittite territory, and installed Kupanta-Kurunta as king.\n\nIn the early 13th century BC, Muwatalli II signed a treaty with Alaksandu of Wilusa. In it, he informed Alaksandu that he viewed Kupanta-Kurunta as the son of Muwatti and so a member of the Hittite royal family.\n\nKupanta-Kurunta is possibly the recipient of the Milawata letter.\n\nKupanta-Kurunta apparently supported Hattusili III over Hattusili's nephew Urhi-Tessup, \"Mursili III\". After Hattusili attained the kingdom, Kupanta-Kurunta received a letter from Pharaoh Rameses II which was copied to Hattusili. In it, the Pharaoh reassured Kupanta-Kurunta that Egypt remained a full ally of Hatti and entertained no plans to aid Urhi-Tessup in any further adventures.\n"}
{"id": "3646582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3646582", "title": "Legal name", "text": "Legal name\n\nLegal name is the name that identifies a person for legal, administrative and other official purposes. A person's first legal name generally is the name of the person that was given for the purpose of registration of the birth and which then appears on a birth certificate (see \"birth name\"), but may change subsequently. Most jurisdictions require the use of a legal name for all legal and administrative purposes, and some jurisdictions permit or require a name change to be recorded at marriage. The legal name may need to be used on various government issued documents (e.g., a court order). The term is also used when an individual changes his/her first or full name, typically after reaching a certain legal age (usually eighteen or over, though it can be as low as fourteen in several European nations).\n\nA person's legal name typically is the same as his/her personal name, comprising a given name and a family name. The order varies according to culture and country. There are also country-by-country differences on changes of legal names by marriage. (See \"married name\".)\n\nMost countries require by law the registration of a name for newborn children, and some can refuse registration of \"undesirable\" names. In 1991, a Swedish couple refused to give their newborn a legal name, in protest of existing naming laws. In 1996, they were fined for not registering a name for their child for five years, after they unsuccessfully tried to register the child's name as Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116, and then as \"A\".\n\nThe \"Civil Code of Quebec\" states that \"Every person exercises his civil rights under the name assigned to him and stated in his act of birth,\" and spouses retain their legal names upon marriage. They can be changed, upon registration, only under prescribed conditions, and only where the person is a Canadian citizen who has been domiciled in Québec for at least one year.\n\nIn Germany, names are regulated to a large extent. Apart from possibly adopting the partner's name upon marriage, German citizens may only change their name for a recognised important reason. Among other reasons, a change of names is permitted when the name can give rise to confusion, ridicule, unusual orthographic difficulties, or stigmatization. In certain situations, children's last names may also be changed to their natural, foster or adoptive parent's last name. Transgender people may change their first names. Foreign names in writing systems that are not based on Latin are transliterated according to rules which may conflict with the system of transcribing or transliterating names that is used in the country of origin. Former titles of nobility became integrated into the last names in 1919 but continue to be adapted according to gender and other circumstances.\n\nIn the UK, businesses that trade under names other than those of the owner or a corporate entity must display the name of owner and an address at which documents may be served, or the name and registered number of the corporate body and its registered address. The requirements apply to sole traders and partnerships, but there are special provisions for large partnerships where listing all partners would be onerous. \n\nThe information must be shown on any trading premises where the public have access to trade and in documents such as order forms, receipts and, as of January 2007, corporate websites (to be extended later in 2007 to sole trader websites).\n\nIn strict English law, if there is such a thing as a \"legal\" surname, it is easily changed. In the words of \"A dictionary of American and English law\", \"Any one may take on himself whatever surname or as many surnames as he pleases, without statutory licence\". This does not always seem to have applied to names given in baptism. As noted by Sir Edward Coke in \"Institutes of the Lawes of England\", \"a man may have divers names at divers times, but not divers Christian names.\" But in modern practice all names are freely changeable.\n\nChanges of name are usually effected through deed poll, optionally enrolled either at the High Court of Justice or at the College of Arms, with a notice recorded in \"The London Gazette\". Changes may also be made by means of a Royal License obtained through the College of Arms, with similar notice. These enrolment, licence and notice procedures are useful for having the new name appear in official documents.\n\nScots Law allows anyone who wishes to do so to change their forename(s) or surname and such changes may be recorded in the official register held by the National Records of Scotland. Technically the Registrar General makes a correction to the entry. A correction can be recorded where a birth has been registered in Scotland, or where a person is the subject in Scotland of an entry in the Adopted Children Register, the Parental Order Register or the Gender Recognition Register. The above formalities are not necessary where a spouse/partner assumes the other spouse/partner's surname upon marriage or civil partnership, or reverts back to their original name upon separation, divorce or dissolution of the civil partnership.\n\nOnly one change of name is allowed in the register where a person has not yet reached the age of 16, and afterwards only one change of forename and three changes of surname may be granted during a person's lifetime, provided that at least five years have passed between changes of surname. Name changes may also be recorded where:\n\n\nAnyone born or adopted in Northern Ireland is able to change their name with the General Register Office of Northern Ireland in the following circumstances:\n\n\nA deed poll can also be used in Northern Ireland for this purpose.\n\nMost states in the United States follow the common law which permits name changing for non-fraudulent purposes. This is actually the most common method, since most women who marry do not petition a court under the statutorily prescribed method, but simply use a new name (typically the husband's, a custom which started under the theory of coverture where a woman lost her identity and most rights when she married). \n\nMost state courts have held that a legally assumed name (i.e., for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name and usable as their true name, though assumed names are often not considered the person's technically true name.\n\nThe legal name of a business is the name under which the business conducts its operations.\n"}

{"id": "1702660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1702660", "title": "List of wives of King Henry VIII", "text": "List of wives of King Henry VIII\n\nIn legal terms, King Henry VIII of England had only three wives, because three of his putative marriages were annulled. Unlike a divorce, where a married couple chooses to end their union, annulments essentially declare that a true marriage never took place. However, in common parlance, the so-called wives of Henry VIII were the six queens consort wedded to Henry between 1509 and his death in 1547.\n\nThe six women who were married to Henry VIII were, in chronological order:\n\nHenry's first marriage lasted nearly 24 years; the five that followed less than 10 years combined.\n\nA common mnemonic device to remember the fates of Henry's consorts is \"Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived\". There are also two rhymes:\n\nand\n\nIt is often noted that Catherine Parr \"survived him.\" In fact, Anne of Cleves also survived the king, and was the last of his queens to die. Of the six queens, Katherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, and Jane Seymour each gave Henry one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children would eventually ascend to the throne: King Edward VI, Queen Mary I, and Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nCatherine Howard and Anne Boleyn, the two of Henry's queens who were beheaded, were first cousins. Several of Henry's wives worked in at least one of his other wives' service, typically as ladies-in-waiting: Anne Boleyn worked in Catherine of Aragon's service, Jane Seymour worked in Catherine of Aragon's and Anne Boleyn's, and Catherine Howard worked in Anne of Cleves's.\n\nHenry and at least four of his wives (Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, and Catherine Parr) were portrayed in opera.\n\nKatherine of Aragon (16 December 14857 January 1536; ) was Henry's first wife. Although her name is sometimes spelled \"Catherine\", Katherine of Aragon spelled and signed her name with a \"K,\" which was the accepted spelling in England. After the death of Arthur, her first husband and Henry's brother, a papal dispensation was obtained to enable her to marry Henry, though the marriage did not take place until after he came to the throne in 1509. Prospects were looking good when Katherine became pregnant in 1510, just 4 months after their marriage, but the girl was stillborn. Katherine became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to a boy, Henry, Duke of Cornwall, who died almost two months later. In 1513, Katherine gave birth to a stillborn boy, and gave birth to a boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally, Katherine bore him a healthy daughter in 1516, Mary. It took her two years to conceive again. This pregnancy ended in a short-lived girl. It is said that Henry truly loved Katherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times in declarations, etc.\n\nHenry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an annulment on the grounds that his marriage was invalid because Katherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21) to justify his stance: \"If a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.” \nHenry had begun an affair with Anne Boleyn, who is said to have refused to become his mistress (Henry had already consummated an affair then dismissed Anne's sister, Mary Boleyn, and most historians believe that Anne wanted to avoid the same treatment). Despite the pope's refusal, Henry separated from Katherine in 1531. In the face of the Pope's continuing refusal to annul his marriage to Katherine, Henry ordered the highest church official in England, Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, to convene a court to rule on the status of his marriage to Katherine. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer ruled the marriage to Katherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows, probably in late January 1533). This led to the break from the Roman Catholic Church and the later establishment of the Church of England.\nShakespeare called Katherine \"The Queen of Earthly Queens.\"\n\nMarriage to Henry VIII: 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 (23 years, 11 months, 19 days); marriage annulled.\n\nAnne Boleyn (c.1501/150719 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of Elizabeth I. Henry's marriage to Anne, and her subsequent execution, made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that was the start of the English Reformation. The daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), Anne was of nobler birth than Jane Seymour, Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired, with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a lady-in-waiting to Queen Claude of France.\n\nAnne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her in 1526 and she refused to become his mistress, as her sister, Mary Boleyn, had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife, Catherine of Aragon, so he could marry Anne. Evidence of intimacy between the King and Anne is found in a love letter written by the King, in which he expressed admiration for her \"pretty duckies\" (breasts). When it became clear that Pope Clement VII was unlikely to give the king an annulment, the breaking of the power of the Roman Catholic Church in England began.\n\nHenry had Thomas Wolsey dismissed from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain, Thomas Cranmer, appointed Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service. She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service, which took place in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of excommunication against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the Church of England was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.\nAnne was crowned Queen Consort of England on 1 June 1533. Later that year, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Henry's second daughter, Elizabeth. When Anne failed to quickly produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, the King grew tired of her, annulled their marriage, and a plot was hatched by Thomas Cromwell to execute her.\n\nAlthough the evidence against her was unconvincing, Anne was beheaded on charges of adultery, incest, and high treason on 19 May 1536. Following her daughter Elizabeth's coronation as queen, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of John Foxe. Over the centuries, Anne has inspired or been mentioned in numerous artistic and cultural works.\n\nMarriage to Henry VIII: 28 May 153317 May 1536 (2 years, 11 months, 19 days); annulled, then beheaded.\n\nJane Seymour (c.roughly 150824 October 1537) was Henry's third wife. She served Catherine of Aragon and was one of Anne Boleyn's ladies-in-waiting. It is strongly believed that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 10–11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Finally, a year later, Jane gave birth to a healthy, legitimate male heir, Edward, but she died twelve days later, presumably because of post-natal complications. This apparently caused her husband genuine grief, as she was the only queen to receive a proper Queen's burial; when the King died in 1547, he was buried next to her.\n\nMarriage to Henry VIII: 30 May 153624 October 1537 (1 year, 4 months, 24 days); death from complications of childbirth.\n\nAnne of Cleves (22 September 151516 July 1557) was Henry's fourth wife, for only six months in 1540, from 6 January to 9 July. Anne of Cleves was a German princess. It has been stated that Henry referred to her as \"A Flanders Mare\", which may or may not be true; nevertheless, the label has stuck with Anne. Her pre-contract of marriage with Francis I, Duke of Lorraine, was cited as grounds for an annulment. Anne agreed to this, claiming that the marriage had not been consummated, and because she hadn't resisted the annulment, was given a generous settlement, including Hever Castle, former home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns. She was given the name \"The King's Sister\", and became a friend to him and his children until his death. She outlived both the King and his last two wives, making her the last of the six wives to die.\n\nMarriage to Henry VIII: 6 January 15409 July 1540 (6 months, 3 days); annulled.\n\nCatherine Howard (c.152113 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540–1542, sometimes known as \"the rose without a\nthorn\". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with Thomas Culpeper on 1 November 1541.\n\nMarriage to Henry VIII: 28 July 154023 November 1541 (1 year, 3 months, 26 days); beheaded.\n\nCatherine Parr (15125 September 1548), also spelled Kateryn, was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, 1543–1547. She was the daughter of Sir Thomas Parr of Kendal and his wife Maud Green. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of John of Gaunt, son of King Edward III. Through John of Gaunt's daughter Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, the two were also fourth cousins once removed.\n\nCatherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers. Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an act that confirmed both Mary's and Elizabeth's line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the war in France and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old Edward came of age.\n\nCatherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married Thomas Seymour, uncle of Edward VI of England, to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, Mary, and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.\n\nMarriage to Henry VIII: 12 July 154328 January 1547 (3 years, 6 months, 16 days); his death at the age of 55.\n\nHenry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King Edward I of England, through more than one ancestor.\n\nThe following family tree of Henry VIII's six wives is the closest lineage of him.\n\n"}

Many of them were originally part of The Dead End Kids, and several of them later became members of The East Side Kids and The Bowery Boys.\n\nThe urban drama \"Dead End\" became both a successful play and a hit movie, featuring six young actors playing streetwise guttersnipes: Billy Halop, Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Gabriel Dell, Bobby Jordan, and Bernard Punsly. The troupe became known as The Dead End Kids and starred in a series of features for Warner Brothers.\n\nIn 1938, Universal borrowed the Dead End Kids (except Gorcey and Jordan) for a juvenile-delinquency drama called \"Little Tough Guy\". Universal adopted this as a brand name, and turned the film into a series of 'Little Tough Guys' features. The studio filled out the cast with David Gorcey (Leo's younger brother) and Hally Chester. \n\nThe next three films did not include any of the original Dead End Kids. \"Little Tough Guys in Society\" (1939) was more of a lightweight comedy, while the next two, \"Newsboys' Home\" and \"Code of the Streets\" (1939), were more dramatic. Jackie Cooper starred in \"Newsboys' Home\", but was not a member of the team. Only David Gorcey and Hally Chester remained from the first film, \"Little Tough Guy\". This was the beginning of the members of the team changing on almost a film-to-film basis. Eleven actors drifted in and out of the series, including Frankie Thomas, Charles Duncan (who was originally hired to play Leo Gorcey's role in the play \"Dead End\"), and Billy Benedict. \n\nWhen Warners released Bobby Jordan from his contract, Universal quickly signed him to join the rest of gang. Now, with five of the original six Dead End Kids on the payroll, Universal revised the billing to read \"The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys\". In total, the Little Tough Guys made 12 feature films, and three 12-chapter serials. Leading player Halop joined the armed forces and was replaced by Jordan for the final film in the series, \"Keep 'Em Slugging\", released in 1943.\n\nShemp Howard of the Three Stooges appeared in \"Give Us Wings\", \"Hit The Road\" and \"Keep 'Em Slugging\". Huntz Hall cited Howard as a major influence when his later \"Bowery Boys\" series shifted to all-out slapstick comedy.\n\nThere was still a market for these tough-teen films, and most of the Little Tough Guys principals wound up at Monogram Pictures as The East Side Kids and The Bowery Boys.\n\n\n\n"}

The Moon's surface is a complex mixture of dark areas (the lunar \"maria\", or \"seas\") and lighter areas (the highlands). Many cultures have seen shapes in these dark and light areas that have reminded them of people, animals or objects, often related to their folklore; the most famous are the Man in the Moon in Western folklore and the Moon Rabbit of Asia and the Americas. Other cultures perceive the silhouette of a woman, a frog, a moose, a buffalo, or a dragon (with its head and mouth to the right and body and wings to the left) in the full moon. Alternatively, the vague shape of the overall dark and light regions can resemble a Yin Yang symbol.\n\nThe Man in the Moon is an imaginary figure resembling a human face, head or body, that observers from some cultural backgrounds typically perceive in the bright disc of the full moon.\n\nIn Chinese culture, the rabbit in the moon (a companion of Chang'e) is pounding medicine. Similarly, in Japan and Korea, popular culture sees a rabbit making mochi and tteok, respectively, in the moon.\n\nIn Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica the rabbit is often associated with the moon, for example, Tecciztecatl, the Aztec moon god, was pictured as an anthropomorphic rabbit; there is also a myth involving Quetzalcoatl and the moon rabbit.\n\nIn Elizabethan England, the spots of the Moon were supposed to represent a witch carrying sticks of wood on her back, or an old man with a lantern (which was illustrated by Shakespeare in his comedy \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\"). A more recent Western image is the profile of a coiffed woman wearing a jeweled pendant, the jewel being the crater Tycho, which at full moon is very bright and has bright radiating lines (rays). In New Zealand Māori legend, the moon shows a woman with a local tree, the \"Ngaio\". However, throughout Melanesia and Polynesia, the moon is seen to be a cook over a three-stone fire.\n\nIn Chinese Mythology, Chang'e (various spellings) lives on the moon. She was mentioned in the conversation between Houston Capcom and Apollo 11 crew just before the first moon landing:\n\"The toad was seen by Chinese Taoists as ... the moon, representing Chang-O, the transformed wife of Yi, the excellent archer. ... According to Robert M. DeGraaff, in some representations of the moon-toad, the \"ling chih\" fungus is shown growing out of the creature's forehead.\"\n\nShia Muslims believe that the name of Ali Ibne-Abi Talib (Muhammad's son in law) is written on the moon. This interpretation has roots in several hadith by Muhammad where he compares Ali to the moon and himself to the sun. There are also other esoteric interpretations of this analogy in Islamic philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "368048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=368048", "title": "Middle name", "text": "Middle name\n\nIn several cultures, a middle name is a portion of a personal name that is written between the person's given name and their surname. A person may be given a middle name regardless of whether it's necessary to distinguish them from other people with the same given name and surname. In cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, additional names are likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname, and thus called middle names. In English-speaking American culture, that term is often applied (arguably mistakenly) to names occupying that position even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a \"middle name\", and is actually (to mention several types of common cases): \nIn the United States, such names are specifically referred to as middle names; in most other countries, as far as they are given names and not, for example, patronymics, they would simply be regarded as second, third etc. given names. In the U.S., the \"middle name\" is often abbreviated to the middle initial (e.g. Mary Lee Bianchi becomes Mary L. Bianchi, which is usually standard for signatures) or omitted entirely in everyday use (e.g. just Mary Bianchi). An individual may have more than one middle name, or none. In the United Kingdom, for comparison, she would usually be referred to as either Mary Bianchi, M. L. Bianchi or Mary Lee Bianchi, or she may choose Lee Bianchi, and informally there may be familiar shortenings.\n\nIt is debatable how long multiple given names have existed in English-speaking countries, but it is certain that among royalty and aristocracy the practice existed by the late 17th century (and possibly earlier), as exemplified in the name of the Stuart pretender James Francis Edward Stuart (1688–1766).\n\nDespite their relatively long existence in North America, the phrase \"middle name\" was not recorded until 1835, in the periodical \"Harvardiana\".\n\nThe use of multiple middle names has been somewhat impeded recently by the increased use of computer databases that occasionally allow for only a single middle name or more commonly a middle initial in storing personal records, effectively preventing people with multiple middle names from being listed in such databases under their full name. This is worsened by longer compound names, like María del Pilar Pereyra or María de las Nieves García.\n\nThe abbreviation \"N.M.N.\" (no middle name) or \"N.M.I.\" (no middle initial), with or without periods, is sometimes used in formal documents in the United States, where a middle initial or name is expected but the person does not have one. The middle name can also be a maiden name.\n\nSince 1905, \"middle name\" has also developed a figurative usage meaning a notable or outstanding attribute of a person, as in the phrase \"discretion is my middle name.\"\n\nIn countries that primarily speak English—such as Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom—the forename of a relative is sometimes used as one's middle name to honor familial heritage. In many cases in the United States, however, a person's middle name has little or no lineage-related context, and is used instead to honor close family friends or notable public figures.\n\nIn the United States, those who choose to be known primarily by their middle name may abbreviate their first name as an initial, e.g. J. Edgar Hoover (John Edgar Hoover). Others simply omit the first name, like Woodrow Wilson (Thomas Woodrow Wilson). A rare case of an individual being given only an initial as a middle name, with the initial not explicitly standing for anything, was Harry S. Truman. (He once told reporters—apparently at odds with his own practice—that the S should thus not be followed by period.)\n\nMore than two given names are fairly common. In England they are traditionally more common among the \"upper classes\" and \"middle classes\". Examples are J. R. R. Tolkien, W.E.B. Du Bois, George H. W. Bush.\n\nMiddle names can also be used as first names. Major examples are Paul McCartney, Mitt Romney, Dakota Fanning, Elle Fanning, Sylvester Stallone, Jonathan Demme, Riley Keough, Reese Witherspoon, Hayley Orrantia, Brad Pitt, Ashton Kutcher, Meghan Markle, Rihanna, Scott Chandler, Nomar Garciaparra, Bill Mumy, Roger Waters and Jim Acosta.\n\nTraditionally, Chinese names consisted of three characters—the surname, followed by a two-character given name (\"ming\"), which is not separated into a first and middle name in usage. Two-character given names follow a naming tradition in which the first character of the given name (and thus the second character in the three-character full name) indicates the person's generation in his/her family. For example, the Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing dynasty has the given name \"Yinzhen\" (胤禛) while his brothers' names all begin with the character \"Yin\" (胤). His sons' and nephews' given names all begin with the character \"Hong\" (弘). Traditionally, the list of generational names may be decided many generations in advance by the ancestors. In such naming systems, the de facto given name is the last character of a person's full name. Even if that was the case most of the time, sometimes the person's given name is the middle character and not the last. A three-character name is both patriarchal and hierarchical, as it would inform of a person's belonging and rank within a family. During the One-child Policy, there was no need for a generation name as there was only one child in each generation. Many names in Mainland China were shortened to two-characters during this time, and there are many adults with shorter names remnant from this era. This would not be found in Taiwan or Hong Kong.\n\nA fading Chinese tradition is to use a courtesy name, called \"zì\" (字) in place of a male's given name in adulthood. Traditionally \"zì\" is given by one's father upon reaching the age of maturity at 20 years old. This name is intended for use in formal situations and formal writing and confers a status of adulthood and respect. Like the \"ming\", the \"zì\" is composed of two characters which usually reflect the meaning of the \"ming\". Prior to the 20th century, sinicized Koreans, Vietnamese, and Japanese were also referred to by their \"zì\". An alternative courtesy name is the \"hào\" (; Japanese gō; Korean: ho; Vietnamese: hiệu), which usually referred to as the pseudonym. A \"hào\" was usually self-chosen and it was possible to have more than one. It had no connection with the bearer's \"míng\" or \"zì\"; rather it was often a personal choice and may have reflected a personal belief or philosophy. Chinese adults may more frequently use the \"hào\" to refer to themselves. The \"zì\" or \"hào\" can be used independently of the given name and of each other, but the given name is almost always used with the family name in official situations.\n\nSome Chinese Americans move their Chinese given name (transliterated into the Latin alphabet) to the middle name position and use an English first name, e.g. James Chu-yu Soong, Jerry Chih-Yuan Yang, and Michelle Wingshan Kwan. The Chinese given name usually has two characters which are usually combined into a single middle name for better organizational purposes, especially with Cantonese names, such as Bruce Lee's middle name, Junfan. There are also some new immigrants whose Chinese given names are their first names followed by English middle names.\n\nThe practice of taking English and Chinese given names is also common in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. However, rather than placing the Chinese given name between the English given name and the family name, it is commonly placed after the family name in these places. Under such a system, Bruce Junfan Lee would have been Bruce Lee Junfan. This practice is consistent with both the Western convention of putting the given name before the family name and the Chinese convention of putting the given name after the family name.\n\nIn Denmark and Norway, the term middle name refers to names that are originally surnames, but not part of the last name of the name bearer. The term middle name does not refer to additional given names, which are instead referred to as given names. A middle name could be e.g. one's mother's maiden name or the last name of another recent ancestor (for instance a grandparent). One can have several middle names, but it is unusual to have more than one or two. In law, middle names have a separate status. In practice, their status is similar to that of additional given names, and middle names are often omitted in everyday use, just like a person with 3 or 4 given names would only use one of them in most situations. The historical purpose of middle names is to honour some related family or person, a godparent, or even a completely unrelated person, such as a locally or nationally prominent figure. Until the 19th century, it was not unusual to have the last name of a godparent as one's middle name, even when the godparent was not a blood relative. This practice, and the use of middle names in general, however, was mostly limited to the bourgeois class and the nobility, and was seldom seen among common people. In the 20th century, the use of middle names, especially one's mother's maiden name, was more widely adopted, although it is by no means mandatory. There are few set rules for how names are constructed today; people are required to have one given name and one family name, but can have as many additional given names and middle names as they like.\n\nIn the example Carl Viggo Manthey Lange, the names Carl and Viggo are given names, while Manthey is a middle name and Lange is the family name. Manthey is his mother's maiden name. Unless his full name is used, he is correctly referred to as Mr. Lange, not as Mr. Manthey Lange. Carl Viggo Manthey Lange has a name typical of the Norwegian bourgeois class, with both his family name and his middle name being of foreign origin and being recognised surnames. Most Norwegians and Danes of the working class and peasant class used patronymics until the 19th century, when permanent family names became mandatory, first in Denmark in the early 19th century and then in Norway around 1900. A middle name is usually a recognised surname and not a patronymic. One reason middle names have become popular in the 20th century, particularly in Denmark, is that most Danish surnames originated as patronymics and are shared by a large number of people. The use of middle names in modern times serves to differentiate them from other people. For example, Danish politician Lars Løkke Rasmussen has some of the most common given and last names in Denmark (Lars and Rasmussen); his mother's maiden name is the slightly more unusual name Løkke, derived from a small agricultural property, so he uses it as a middle name, which differentiates him from other people named Lars Rasmussen.\n\nIn Sweden, the position is much the same as in Denmark. Middle names were inaugurated in the previous Name Act of 1963, then called \"tilläggsnamn\" (additional name), and are called \"mellannamn\" (middle name) as of the present Name Act of 1983. However, it had previously been more common to join e.g. the last names of both of a child's parents, or for a married woman to join her maiden name and the husband's last name, as a double name with a hyphen; and large portions of the Swedish population have not adapted to the official system to this day, i.e. for almost 50 years. People often use a hyphen between their middle name and last name themselves, and/or are spelled that way by other people and by mass media.\n\nFurthermore, when the term middle name was introduced in Swedish (\"mellannamn\") the word was assumed by many to mean the additional given names (apart from the \"name of address\" (\"tilltalsnamn\")), so since 1983 the word is being used more and more in this, officially, erratic meaning.\n\nOccasionally, Scandinavians choose to use their middle name as their surname in everyday life. So Per Gottfrid Svartholm Warg has Per and Gottfrid as his given names, where Gottfrid, not Per, is his name of address, Svartholm as his middle name and Warg as his last name, but in practice he uses Svartholm as a surname. This usage, however, is unofficial. Historically, a middle name could become part of a double-barreled surname (family name) and hence cease to be a middle name, especially if used for several generations. There are many family names of this kind, which contributes to the confusion about middle names that shall not be hyphenated. Some of these double-barreled surnames are combined with a hyphen, while others are not, so a double surname without a hyphen can sometimes be indistinguishable from a middle name followed by a family name.\n\nIn Scandinavia, there is no limit on how many given names one can have. Given names have never been referred to as middle names, apart from many in Sweden believing so, as mentioned above. The use of more than two or three given names is generally associated with the upper class. The first given name is not necessarily the name of address. For the sake of completeness, Swedish forms often ask people to fill in all their given names and to indicate which one is their \"name of address\" (\"tilltalsnamn\").\n\nTraditional middle names in Vietnamese are \"Văn\" for male names and \"Thị\" for female names. However, modern Vietnamese do not consider these to be attractive names, especially \"Thị\". Therefore, nowadays popular middle names also are popular first names. Middle names play an important role in Vietnamese full names; they could help creating beautiful names when combine with first names, distinguishing people who have the same first name (there are many common last names in Vietnam), and also distinguishing the gender of the names (unisex names are used widely in Vietnam). Hence, Vietnamese rarely abbreviate their middle names.\n\nFor Filipinos, the middle name is usually the maternal surname, which is the maiden surname of a person's mother. The use of the maternal surname as middle name is from American influence, where Filipinos adopted English naming customs, when they once used Spanish naming customs, that used two surnames (paternal and maternal) joined with the particle \"y\" (or \"e\", before \"i\"), which remains in use but became restricted to very formal purposes, police records and legal proceedings. In the Spanish naming system, the middle name corresponds to the maternal surname. The middle name (or the maternal surname) is usually being abbreviated to a middle initial. Thus, a person with the full name \"Juan Santos Macaraig\", with \"Santos\" the middle name in the present order, may become \"Juan S. Macaraig\" with the middle name abbreviated, and \"Juan Macaraig y Santos\" in the Spanish system, such as those used in names on police records, especially those seen on name placards held by a convicted person on official mug shots. The Philippine system, using \"given name-middle name-surname\" order (or \"Christian name-mother's surname-father's surname\") coincidentally follows the Portuguese naming system that uses two surnames, the first being maternal and the second being paternal.\n\nBut, the maternal surname may not be the middle name at some cases. It may be a second given name, like what the term really means, as in \"Jose P. Laurel\", where \"P.\" (a middle initial) corresponds to \"Paciano\".\n\nIn illegitimate children, the middle name is the maiden surname of the mother, and the middle name (maternal surname) of the mother as surname, but the surname become of the father's upon legal and administrative acknowledgement by his/her father. Children of a single father takes no middle name, even when the mother's identity is known. \n\nTo illustrate that, the daughter of an unmarried couple named \"Ana Cristina dela Cruz Manansala\" and \"Jose Maria Panganiban Lozada\", named '\"Maria Cristina'\", will be named \"Maria Cristina Manansala dela Cruz\" (or \"Ma. Cristina M. dela Cruz\"), with Ana Cristina's middle name, \"dela Cruz\", as surname. But once Jose Maria wants to acknowledge her as his child legally and administratively, Maria Cristina will take the surname \"Lozada\", but keep the maternal surmame \"Manansala\" as middle name, thus, \"Maria Cristina Manansala Lozada\" (or \"Ma. Cristina M. Lozada\"). As the daughter of only Jose Maria, Maria Cristina will be rather called \"Maria Cristina Lozada\" or \"Ma. Cristina Lozada\", even when the mother is known.\n\nIn married women, the middle name usually corresponds to the maiden surname, but on professional society, women usually add the husband's surname after their maiden name, keeping the maternal surname. A married woman may decline taking the husband's surname and keep her maiden name as no Philippine law compels women to take her husband's surname. Thus, a woman named \"Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco\" (or \"Ma. Concepcion P. Limchauco\"), once marrying \"Juan Pablo Sanchez Marasigan\" (or \"Juan Pablo S. Marasigan\") may take the name \"Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco-Marasigan\" (or \"Ma. Concepcion P. Limchauco-Marasigan\"), maintaining the maternal surname \"Perez\", \"Maria Concepcion Limchauco Marasigan\" (or \"Ma. Concepcion L. Marasigan\"), taking the maiden surname \"Limchauco\" as middle name and \"Marasigan\" as married surname, or keep her maiden names, remaining \"Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco\" upon marriage.\n\nIn Argentina, most people have a middle name. According to a study, approximately 9 out of 10 Argentines born in 2010 had a middle name given to them. It used to be even more common in the past, as it is an old tradition. It's very common to use the name of a grandparent as middle name. It is termed \"segundo nombre\" (lit. second name). However, its widespread use is slowly shrinking due to the influence of neighboring countries..\n\nActually, most of south-american, especially Hispanic citizens are acquainted with the use of compound given names, such as Maria + (second given name) or Juan + (given name), among others. This is often considered a useful way of distinguishing from similar or identical names considering that Spanish-derived surnames are strikingly common in some cultural regions (e.g. Luis Fernandez can be better distinguished if arranged as Luis Antonio Fernandez, José Luis Fernandez, Luis Eduardo Fernandez, etc.).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15210141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15210141", "title": "Mohan (legendary)", "text": "Mohan (legendary)\n\nThe Muan, Moan or Mohan (moo-ahn), sometimes also known as Poira is a name applied to several mythological or otherwise supernatural creatures in South and Central American folklore. The most common and widespread use of the term is to refer to the souls of the dead and the indigenous ancestors of old. The word is also used for shamans or witch doctors in some Colombian indigenous cultures (such as the s).\n\nVarious different legends exist about the Mohan, with many of them emerging from Colombia. In Colombia, Mohan can also mean a forest or barren land kind of supernatural being associated with natural forces such as the great rivers and the mysteries lying within the forests, beyond human reach and comprehension. In some legends, it is a satyr-like being who steals and rapes young women and lives in a cave-like grotto in the bottom of the great jungle rivers where he keeps his female captives. In others, it is depicted as the spirit of an old Indian, brawny and stout, with a terrifying grin and stare, with larger than human stature and proportions, who steals fishermen's bait, catch or nets, and has the power to change shape into a cat-like beast. Other legends describe the Mohan as a \"big-headed Indian, with short legs and fish fins on his back, and very brown.\" He is portrayed as an extremely hairy being with a very treacherous personality who dwells in the backwaters and is feared by many people. He also causes mischief for young girls who come to wash clothes in the water. The Mohan is also known as an avatar whose form shamans are able to adopt. One myth tells of how a shaman became an alligator in order to be close to the girls who played in the river. The shaman was not able to fully transform back into a human, and became an alligator with a human head. The Poira, whose name is interchangeable with the Mohan, is described by others as an Indian warlock who lives on the in Tolima, Colombia. The Poira is also believed to be a small, naked invisible boy or adult who can also appear formless or as a black bear.\n\n"}
{"id": "58589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58589", "title": "Name change", "text": "Name change\n\nName change generally refers to the legal act by a person of adopting a new name different from their name at birth, marriage or adoption.\n\nThe procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, common law jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while civil law jurisdictions are more restrictive.\n\nA pseudonym is a name that differs from the original or true name and does not require legal sanction. It is generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but can also be done for personal, social or ideological reasons.\n\n\nIn the United States, state laws regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes (changing the name at will), including \"Lindon v. First National Bank\".\n\nUsually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change. Although the states (except Louisiana) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a court order is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a state court), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change. It is necessary to plead that the name change is not for a fraudulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a lien or debt or for defaming someone else.\n\nApplicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited judicial discretion to grant or deny a change of name, usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or immoral purposes.\nIn 2004, a Missouri man succeeded in changing his name to They. The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (\"Application of Dengler\", 1979); the North Dakota Supreme Court had denied the same request several years before (\"Petition of Dengler\", 1976).\n\nIn nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a racial slur, a threat, or an obscenity.\n\nSome examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:\n\nUnder the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more Americanized names. During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a federal court. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of law enforcement. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a federal court naturalizes an applicant.\n\nTo maintain a person's identity, it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.\n\nThe \"open and notorious\" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an assumed name. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, secretary of state, or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under pseudonyms; such a right is protected under case law pursuant to United States Constitution.\n\nA common law name (i.e. one assumed for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name. In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method, unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.\n\nIn California the \"usage method\" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name. Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively. Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.\n\nSpecifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 and Family Code § 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 (a) reads, \"Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name.\" Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code § 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)\n\nMany universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a \"preferred name\" instead of one's legal name. This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and student ID cards. It provides a \"transitional\"\nname change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.\n\nA legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the Social Security Administration, Bureau of Consular Affairs (for passports), the Federal Communications Commission, the Selective Service System and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.\n\nAlthough state requirements differ, it is generally recommended to first register a new name with the Social Security office as some state motor-vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes; Arizona is one of these states.\n\nMost states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time. For example, South Carolina, and Wyoming require a name change be registered with their office within ten days. Illinois, Texas and Vermont require it be registered within 30 days, while North Carolina allows up to 60 days. New York requires visiting a local motor vehicle office to change the name on all records and documents, but without a definite deadline to do so. The fees for registering a new name vary from state to state. The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.\n\nMany states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (\"e.g.\", intellectual property rights) of others.\n\nIn the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.\n\nIn theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their passport, driving licence, tax and National Insurance records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that \"documentary evidence\" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as birth, marriage and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are \"matters of fact\", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.\n\nDocumentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, decree absolute, civil partnership certificate, statutory declaration or deed of change of name. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.\n\nPeople whose births are registered in England and Wales may have their deed poll enrolled at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. See also College of Arms#Change of names.\n\nFrom the mediaeval age to the 19th century, the era of family dynasties, name changes were frequently demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, of members of the gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by marriage settlements, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's dowry her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private Act of Parliament or by obtaining a Royal Licence. A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname \"in addition to\" his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the \"double-barrelled\", even the \"triple-barrelled\" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy \"squirearchy\" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.\n\nWell known examples are:\n\nPeople whose births are registered in Scotland (or who were adopted in Scotland) can change their name in the same way as people from the rest of the United Kingdom. However they can optionally apply to the Registrar General for Scotland to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated.\n\nIndividuals may legally change their name through the state and territory governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled \"Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages\". Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate) and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.\n\nInstitutions such as banks, the Passports Office and transport authorities require proof of identity, so people who change their names need to have proof of the change.\n\nIf a person's birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person's birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued birth certificate if born in Australia and/or \"Change of Name Certificate\". These certificates are recognised secure identity documents and can be verified electronically through the Attorney-general of Australia's Document Verification Service.\nIn Canada a person can informally call themselves whatever they want. In all provinces except Quebec, when someone gets married they can change their last name without legally changing their name by using their Marriage Certificate as verification of the name change. It is almost impossible for married women in Québec to take their husbands' names.\nLike the United States, the requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. Except for Ontario, British Columbia and New Brunswick, Canadians must be 18 to change their names and have lived in the province they are changing it in for at least 3 months to a year, depending on province. (In British Columbia, Canadians must be 19 to change their names, in Ontario and New Brunswick 16.) People younger than the province's age of majority can change their names if they have their guardians' consent, are legally married, or have a common law marriage. To change a name, a Name Change application must be submitted to either the Ministry of Government Services, Court of justice or Registrar of civil status. A document such as a birth certificate must be submitted. A statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious. In Canada, a name cannot cause confusion, be used for misrepresentation or fraud and in most cases the name change is announced in newspapers. There is a fee involved and it ranges from $10 to $185 depending on the territory or province. British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba need fingerprints to be submitted before one changes their name.\n\nIt is a common practice for ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong to adopt a western-style English name in addition to their transliterated Chinese name. As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their legal English name is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.\n\nHowever, the Immigration Department which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll. Only one application of this kind is allowed for each applicant; any application for subsequent change(s) must be made with a deed poll.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, a person earns their name by \"use and repute\". For most purposes it is enough to simply use the desired name and ask others to call you by that name. For some administrative purposes, such as changing a name on a driving licence or legally changing gender, a deed of change of name must be registered with the Four Courts.\n\nFrom September 1995, New Zealanders can change their name by making a statutory declaration and, if approved, the new name is registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriages section of the Department of Internal Affairs (Identity Services). Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by deed poll.\n\nIn general, unlike in common law countries, names cannot be changed at will in civil law jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of personal identification numbers, that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.\n\nIn Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: \"Arrêté royal\", Dutch: \"Koninklijk besluit\") for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:\n\nAccording to the Brazilian Civil Code and the Public Registries Act, the name registered after birth is definitive and immutable. However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: \n\nIn India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.\n\nAlthough it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.\n\n2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order. Administrative Order No. 1 Series of 2001, implemented the law. It authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change the first name or nickname in the civil register without need of a judicial order.\n\nIn case of controversial and substantial changes, Philippines jurisprudence requires full-blown court lawsuit, that must include the local civil registrar in the petition, since RA 9048 and Rule 108 (Cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court do not allow the change of sex in a birth certificate.\n\nThe only landmark case in the Philippines on name and legal sex change is the Jeff Cagandahan case. The Supreme Court of the Philippines Justice Leonardo Quisumbing on September 12, 2008, allowed Cagandahan, 27, who has congenital adrenal hyperplasia, to change his birth certificate name from Jennifer to Jeff, and his legal gender from female to male.\n\nAlthough as in other jurisdictions residents of Quebec may informally use whatever name they want, procedures for formal name change are very strict as Quebec (unlike the rest of Canada) operates under a civil law system. The decision must be authorized by the Director of Civil Status, and requires a valid reason for changing the name, including long-term use of the new name (in the Montreuil case cited below, the Quebec appeals court has considered five years' use to be a sufficient reason), difficulty of use due to spelling or pronunciation, or bearing a name that another person has made infamous.\n\nOnly a judge may authorize a name change for a child for reasons of abandonment, deprivation of parental authority, or change in filiation such as adoption.\n\nThis has occasionally led to controversy. A lawyer named Micheline Montreuil, a non-operative transgender woman, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the director of civil status refused to permit the change on the grounds that a legal male could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed sex reassignment surgery, which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeal ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name. (Montreuil was initially prevented from changing her name despite this ruling on the grounds that she had not established general use, as normally required for a name change; the Quebec appeals court finally authorized the change on November 7, 2002.)\n\nThe Director of Civil Status will amend a Quebec birth certificate if a name change certificate is issued by another province. Some have used that loophole by temporarily moving to one of Canada's other provinces, which follow the more permissive common-law rules, in order to get the legal documents.\n\nSouth Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil Roman Dutch law, mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in South Africa are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.\n\nA person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the Department of Home Affairs. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a \"good and sufficient reason\" for the change.\n\nA married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)\n\nSouth Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.\n\nThe surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.\n\nIn Switzerland, a name change requires the approval of the respective Cantonal government, if there are important reasons (\"wichtige Gründe\" / \"justes motifs\") for the change, according to article 30 of the Swiss Civil Code. When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. According to the case law of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.\n\nIn Taiwan, the government strictly regulates when one's surname, given name or both may or may not be changed, under the Name Act (姓名條例) since 1953 with 10 articles, totally amended into 14 articles in 2001, and the (姓名條例施行細則).\n\nLegally permitted reasons to change one's given name are:\n\nAdherents of various religions change their name upon conversion or confirmation. The name adopted may not have any legal status but will represent their adopted religious beliefs.\n\n\n\nThere is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called Shudhikaran (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become Hindu may be optionally given a new Dharma (religious) name, which is usually based on Sanskrit or Indian name such as names based on Hindu deities.\n\nThe last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After examining multiple sites in what is now the Municipality of Infanta, they eventually settled on a site near the Bantilan River, where the discovery of a huge Yam root convinced them that the site was ideal for settlement. This eventually became the site of the settlement which European colonizers would call \"Binangonan de Lampon,\" which in turn would evolve into the Municipality of Infanta.\n"}
{"id": "35307882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35307882", "title": "Patrial name", "text": "Patrial name\n\nA patrial name or geographical surname is a surname or second cognomen given to person deriving from a toponym, the name for a geographical place. It was particularly common in ancient Greece and Rome.\nThe lack of a family surname and use of a geographical cognomen as a surname may the sign of a lower class, such as courtesans when signing a contract. With medieval writers, Christian, Jewish and Muslim, whose works circulated around many countries, geographical cognomens sometimes served to distinguish better than \"son of,\" \"ben\" or \"ibn.\" \n\nRoman Military commanders often took a second cognomen, an agnomen, recalling a victorious campaign: Africanus, Asiaticus, Macedonicus, Numantinus. These may be inherited as in the case of Augustus who inherited the cognomen Thurinus.\n\nExamples in formation of patrial names include:\n\n1. definite article and noun - using a demonym (also called gentile name or gentilic, from Latin \"nomen gentile\" or \"gentilicium\")\n\n2. unclear: indefinite noun / adjectival forms\n3. adjectives - a common Latin method for making a toponymic adjective is to add -[i]ensis\n\n4. genitive \"of\" constructions\n\nIn examples 1 through 3, where the noun or adjective has case declension the partial name will typically decline in accordance with normal noun or adjective rules. For example, in \"Giraldi Cambrensis opera\" - \"the works of [genitive] Gerald of Wales\" - \"Giraldus\" declines to \"Giraldi\" (the genitive form of Gerald) and \"cambrensis\" (nominative adjective) declines to \"cambrensis\" (genitive adjective, but the same as nominative in this example). The declension is normally not followed when citing Latin patrial names in English, \"of Giraldus Cambrensis,\" but may cause confusion when trying to identify the nominative spellings of patrial names from Latin or Greek sources.\n\nModern era examples in Europe are generally limited to nicknames, or deliberate choices of a birthplace as a penname or stagename or change of name by deed poll:\n"}
{"id": "3488351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3488351", "title": "People", "text": "People\n\nA people is a plurality of persons considered as a whole, as is the case with an ethnic group or nation. Collectively, for example, the contemporary Frisians and Danes are two related Germanic peoples, while various Middle Eastern ethnic groups are often linguistically categorized as Semitic peoples.\n\nVarious states govern, or claim to govern, in the name of \"the people\". Both the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire used the Latin term \"Senatus Populusque Romanus\", (the Senate and People of Rome). This term was fixed to Roman legionary standards, and even after the Roman Emperors achieved a state of total personal autarchy, they continued to wield their power in the name of the Senate and People of Rome.\n\nA People's Republic is typically a Marxist or socialist one-party state that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a dictatorship. Populism is another umbrella term for various political tendencies that claim to represent the people, usually with an implication that they serve the \"common people\" instead of the elite.\n\nChapter One, Article One of the Charter of the United Nations states that peoples have the right to self-determination.\n\nIn criminal law, in certain jurisdictions, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of \"the People\". Several U.S. states, including California, Illinois, and New York, use this style. Citations outside the jurisdictions in question usually substitute the name of the state for the words \"the People\" in the case captions. Four states — Massachusetts, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky — refer to themselves as \"the Commonwealth\" in case captions and legal process. Other states, such as Indiana, typically refer to themselves as \"the State\" in case captions and legal process. Outside the United States, criminal trials in Ireland and the Philippines are prosecuted in the name of the people of their respective states.\n\nThe political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the sovereign; thus, in these U.S. states, the \"people\" are judged to be the sovereign, even as in the United Kingdom and other dependencies of the British Crown, criminal prosecutions are typically brought in the name of the Crown. \"The people\" identifies the entire body of the citizens of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes.\n\n"}

{"id": "30933488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30933488", "title": "Prophets and messengers in Islam", "text": "Prophets and messengers in Islam\n\nProphets in Islam () include \"messengers\" (\"rasul\", pl. \"rusul\"), bringers of a divine revelation via an angel (Arabic: , malāʾikah); and \"prophets\" (\"nabī\", pl. \"anbiyāʼ\"), lawbringers that Muslims believe were sent by God to every person, bringing God's message in a language they can understand. Knowledge of the Islamic prophets is one of the six articles of the Islamic faith, and specifically mentioned in the Quran.\n\nMuslims believe that the first prophet was also the first human being, Adam (ادم), created by Allah (الله). Many of the revelations delivered by the 48 prophets in Judaism and many prophets of Christianity are mentioned as such in the Quran but usually in slightly different forms. For example, the Jewish Elisha is called Eliyas, Job is Ayyub, Jesus is Isa, etc. The Torah given to Moses (Musa) is called \"Tawrat\", the Psalms given to David (Dawud) is the \"Zabur\", the Gospel given to Jesus is \"Injil\".\n\nUnique to Islam is Muhammad (Muhammad ibn ʿAbdullāh), who Muslims believe is the \"Seal of the Prophets\" (\"Khatam an-Nabiyyin\", i.e. the last prophet); and the Quran, revealed to Muhammad but not written down by him, which Muslims believe is unique among divine revelations as the only correct one protected by God from distortion or corruption, destined to remain in its true form until the Last Day. Muslims believe Muhammad to be the last prophet, although after the prophets there are still saints (though some modern schools, such as Salafism and Wahhabism, reject the theory of sainthood).\n\nIn Muslim belief, every prophet in Islam preached the same main Islamic beliefs, the Oneness of God, worshipping of that one God, avoidance of idolatry and sin, and the belief in the Day of Resurrection or the Day of Judgement and life after death. Each came to preach Islam at different times in history and some told of the coming of the final \"Islamic prophet and messenger\" of God, who would be named \"Ahmed and Muhammad\". \n\nThis narrative is found in \"Chapter of the Ranks\", Qur'an, 61:6 as Allah asked Jesus to remind the Children of Israel but they accused him of the prophecy:\n\nوَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ يَـٰبَنِى إِسْرَٰعِيلَ إِنِّى رَسُولُ ٱللهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَىَّ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرىٰةِ وَمُبَشِّرًا بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِى مِن بَعْدِى ٱسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتِ قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبينٌ \n\n\"wa-idh qāla ‘Īsā ’b·nu Maryama: \"yā Banī Israā‘īla innī Rasūlu ’llāhi ilay-kum muṣaddiqal li-mā bayna yadayya mina ’t-Tawraāti wa-mubash·shiram bi-Rasūlin ya’tī mim ba‘dī ’s·mu-huū Aḥmadu, fa-lammā jaā’a-hum bi’l-bayyināti, qālū \"hādhā siḥrum mubīn!\"\"\n\nIn Arabic and Hebrew, the term \"nabī\" (Arabic plural form: أَنْبِيَاء \"anbiyāʼ\") means \"prophet\". Forms of this noun occur 75 times in the Quran. The term \"nubuwwah\" (Arabic: نُبُوَّة meaning \"prophethood\") occurs five times in the Quran. The terms \"rasūl\" (Arabic plural: رُسُل \"rusul\") and \"mursal\" (ِArabic singular: مُرْسَل \"mursal\"; plural: مُرْسَلُون \"mursalūn\") denote \"messenger with law given/ received by GOD\" and occur more than 300 times. The term for a prophetic \"message\" (ِArabic singular: رِسَالَة \"risālah\"; plural: رِسَالَات \"risālāt\"), appears in the Quran in ten instances.\n\nThe Syriac form of \"rasūl Allāh\" (literally: \"messenger of God\"), \"s̲h̲eliḥeh d-allāhā\", occurs frequently in the apocryphal \"Acts of St. Thomas\". The corresponding verb for \"s̲h̲eliḥeh\"—\"s̲h̲alaḥ\", occurs in connection with the prophets in the Hebrew Bible.\n\nThe words \"prophet\" (Arabic: ) and \"messenger\" (Arabic: ) appear several times in the Old Testament and the New Testament.\n\nThe following table shows these words in different languages:\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the word \"nabi\" (\"spokesperson, prophet\") occurs more commonly, and the Hebrew word \"mal'akh\" (\"messenger\") refers to Angels in Judaism. According to Judaism, Haggai, Zaqariah, and Malachi were the last prophets, all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year Babylonian exile. With them, the authentic period of \"Nevuah\" (\"prophecy\") died, and nowadays only the \"Bath Kol\" (בת קול, lit. \"daughter of a voice\", \"voice of God\") exists (Sanhedrin 11a).\n\nIn the New Testament, however, the word \"messenger\" becomes more frequent, sometimes in association with the concept of a prophet. \"Messenger\" may refer to Jesus, to his Apostles and to John the Baptist. But the last book of the Old Testament, the Book of Malachi, speaks of a messenger that Christian commentators interpret as a reference to the future prophet John the Baptist (Yahya).\n\nIn Muslim belief, every Islamic prophet preached Islam. The beliefs of charity, prayer, pilgrimage, worship of God and fasting are believed to have been taught by every prophet who has ever lived. The Quran itself calls Islam the \"religion of Abraham\" (Ibrahim) and refers to Jacob (Yaqub) and the Twelve Tribes of Israel as being Muslim.\n\nThe Quran says\nIslam teaches that prophets were \"protected from sin\" by God, so unlike lesser human beings they cannot commit a sin. The Quran speaks of the \"Islamic prophets\" as being the greatest human beings of all time. A prophet, in the Muslim sense of the term, is a person whom God specially chose to teach the faith of Islam. Some were called to prophesy late in life, in Muhammad's case at the age of 40. Others, such as John the Baptist, were called to prophesy while still at a young age and Jesus prophesied while still in his cradle. \n\nThe Quran verse 4:69 lists various virtuous groups of human beings, among whom prophets (including messengers) occupy the highest rank. Verse 4:69 reads:\n\nBiblical stories retold in the Quran in the Arabic language (e.g., Job, Moses, Joseph (Yusuf) etc.) certainly differ from the Jewish Hebrew Bible, the Greek Old Testament and the Greek New Testament, in that the Quran always demonstrates that it is \"God's practice\" (\"sunnat Allah\") to make faith triumph finally over the forces of evil and adversity. \"We have made the evil ones friends to those without faith.\" \"Assuredly God will defend those who believe.\" Thus the Islamic Isa did not die on the cross like the Christian thought about Jesus, but deceived his enemies and ascended to heaven.\n\nThe prophets and messengers \"share no divine attributes\", and possess \"no knowledge or power\" other than that granted to them by God.\n\nMuslims believe that many prophets existed, including many not mentioned in the Quran. The Quran states: \"There is a Messenger for every community\" The \"hadith\" reports that the Prophet Muhammad said that there were approximately 124,000 prophets and 313 messengers (\"a good number\"). According to scholars such as Ibn Kathir and Shu'ayb al-Arna'oot the narration is weak, if not fabricated.\n\nMost mainstream Sunni scholars agree that prophets were males only. Still, some like Ibn Hazm, Qartubi, Ibn Hajir, and al Ash‘ari thought that the verses that mention angels speaking to Mary are proofs of her prophethood. Also, Ibn Hajir interprets the Hadith \"Many among men attained perfection but among women none attained the perfection except Mary, the daughter of `Imran; and Asiya, the wife of Pharaoh.\" He said perfection is prophethood, hence his claim that Mary and Asiya were prophets.\n\nThe revealed books are the records which Muslims believe were dictated by God to various Islamic prophets throughout the history of mankind, all these books promulgated the code and laws of Islam. The belief in all the revealed books is an article of faith in Islam and Muslims must believe in all the scriptures to be a Muslim. Muslims believe the Quran, the final holy scripture, was sent because all the previous holy books had been either corrupted or lost. Nonetheless, Islam speaks of respecting all the previous scriptures, even in their current forms.\n\nThe Quran mentions some Islamic scriptures by name, which came before the Quran:\n\nThe Quran mentions various divinely-bestowed gifts given to various prophets. These may be interpreted as books or forms of celestial knowledge. Although all prophets are believed by Muslims to have been immensely gifted, special mention of \"wisdom\" or \"knowledge\" for a particular prophet is understood to mean that some secret knowledge was revealed to him. The Quran mentions that Abraham prayed for wisdom and later received it. It also mentions that Joseph and Moses both attained wisdom when they reached full age; David received wisdom with kingship, after slaying Goliath; Lot (Lut received wisdom whilst prophesying in Sodom and Gomorrah; John the Baptist received wisdom while still a mere youth; and Jesus received wisdom and was vouchsafed the Gospel.\n\nAll messengers mentioned in the Quran are also prophets, but not all prophets are messengers.\n\nTo believe in God's messengers (Rusul) means to be convinced that God sent men as guides to fellow human beings and jinn (khalq) to guide them to the truth.\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Community does not believe that messengers and prophets are different individuals. They interpret the Quranic words \"warner\" (\"nadhir\"), \"prophet\", and \"messenger\" as referring to different roles that the same divinely appointed individuals perform. Ahmadiyya distinguish only between law-bearing prophets and non-law-bearing ones. They believe that although law-bearing prophethood ended with Muhammad, non-law-bearing prophethood subordinate to Muhammad continues. The Ahmadiyya Community recognizes Mirza Ghulam Ahmad also known as Mirza Qadiani (1835–1908) as such a “prophet” of gods and the promised Messiah and Imam Mahdi of the latter days. The Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement rejects his status as a prophet, instead considering him to be a renewer of the faith. However, all other Muslims and their scholars argue and firmly establish that the Ahmadiyya community are not even Muslim due to the fact their beliefs violate the Muslim belief in Muhammad as the \"Seal of the Prophets\" (Khatam an-Nabiyyin).\n\nThe Quran mentions 25 prophets by name but also tells that God (Allah) sent many other prophets and messengers, to all the different nations that have existed on Earth. Many verses in the Qur'an discuss this:\n\n\nNumerous other people have been mentioned by scholars in the Hadith, exegesis, commentary. These people include:\n\n\n"}

She cared for the infants at her den, a cave known as the Lupercal, until they were discovered by a shepherd, Faustulus. Romulus would later become the founder and first king of Rome. The image of the she-wolf suckling the twins has been a symbol of Rome since ancient times and is one of the most recognizable icons of ancient mythology.\n\nThere is evidence that the wolf held a special place in the world of the ancient inhabitants of Italy. One legend claims that the Hirpini people were so-called because, when they set out to found their first colony, they were led to its location by a wolf (from the Sabine word for wolf: \"hirpus\"). The tale of the Lupercal is central to that of the twins, and probably predates theirs. To the Roman god Mars the wolf is a sacred animal. There is an ongoing debate about a connection to the ancient Roman festival of the Lupercalia.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Apollo's mother Leto is reported to have given birth to him as a she-wolf, to evade Hera.\n\nThe 3 \"canonical\" versions of the myth--those of Livy, Plutarch and Dionysius of Halicarnassus--all draw heavily on Quintus Fabius Pictor. He is considered one of Rome's earliest historians and his now lost work describes the she-wolf and her episode with the twins. The twins were abandoned at the order of Amulius. Some tales claim that they were to be left along the riverbank, others that they were to be cast into the water. The servant charged with the task either thought better of it, or could not get close enough to do the deed because of the flooding. Instead, he left them in the standing water that had formed at the foot of Palatine Hill. The twins were found either after their basket had been left at the foot of the fig tree, or came to rest there after floating in the water. In each case, the she-wolf rescued them and gently cared for them in or near the Lupercal. Later, they were discovered by local shepherds.\n\nDionysius reports that rains had raised the water level such that when Amulius' servant arrived at the appointed spot (around a dozen miles from Alba Longa), they left the twins in the floodwaters because they couldn't go any further. The basket they were in floated along until the waters receded and it struck a stone, tossing them out into the mud. The she-wolf arrived and lowered her teats to the crying babes and licked them clean of the mud.\n\nAfter a shepherd happened upon the scene in the course of tending his flock, he ran to tell his companions, and a group gathered to witness the remarkable sight. The twins were clinging to her as she was their true mother. The she-wolf was nonplussed when the men began making a ruckus to scare her off. She withdrew into a cave that was sacred to the Greek colonists who had formerly lived in the area and held an altar to the nature god Pan.\n\nLivy claims that the servants of Amulius dropped the twins in the standing water out of simple laziness. The fig tree just happened to be the first spot they came to and they figured the twins would drown no matter what. The twins cried in their basket until the waters receded and left them back on land. The she-wolf arrived from the hills looking for a drink of water when she heard their cries.\n\nThe servant was too afraid of the torrential waters to fully carry out the king's orders, according to Plutarch. After being left on the bank, the waters rose further and swept the twins away. It gently carried them along and then dropped them at the fig tree.\n\nThe three relay accounts wherein the term \"lupa\" refers not to a she-wolf, but is a slang word for prostitute. Plutarch tells two other stories not involving the she-wolf or abandonment. In one, the twins are fathered by Hercules after he wins a dice game. Their mother is the unwitting \"prize\". In another, the twins are switched at birth by their grandfather for a different pair of infants and secreted out of the city to be raised by shepherds and later, educated in nearby Gabii.\n\nThe \"Bolsena Mirror\" features a depiction of the she-wolf and the twins surrounded by human and animal figures. Differences in interpretation have precluded virtually any consensus regarding many of its features. This includes its age. However, it is consistent with other such mirrors, made as bridal gifts, in 4th century BC Euritria, perhaps circa 330-340. The famous Capitoline Wolf may be of Etruscan or Old Latin origin. But, a discovery during its restoration in 2000 and radiocarbon dating has cast doubt on an ancient origin. A stele from Bologna, dated to between 350-400 BC, depicts an animal, possibly a wolf, nursing a single infant. By 269 BC, the silver didrachm is the earliest depiction of the complete icon, with the characteristic \"turning of the she-wolf's head\" backward and downward at the twins.\n\nThe distinctive imagery of the she-wolf and the twins made it more recognizable than other symbols of the city, such as Roma, the patron deity of the city, or the Roman eagle. That was useful as the Roman world expanded and symbols of Rome became more important in maintaining unity. By the 1st century AD, the she-wolf was common in both Rome and the provinces. She and the twins were featured on the elaborate Ara Pacis, built in honor of Augustus and dedicated to Pax, the goddess of peace.\n\nCoins with their depiction were minted and widely circulated. They were also produced in Roman Colonies as a way to express their own \"Roman-ness\". They have been found on personal items such as swords, buckles, lamps and statuettes as well as monuments, mosaic floors and funerary stones that date from the 1st through the 3rd centuries AD.\n\nThe Franks Casket, an ornately carved, Anglo-Saxon chest from the 8th–9th century, probably crafted in a monastery in Northern France, features the she-wolf and twins, along with a Runic account of the lupercal. Other Anglo-Saxon artifacts and coins from the same period also feature them. The Byzantines continued to use the image, and coins attributed to them have been found in various locations in central Asia at sites located in modern Tadjikistan and Uzbekistan along with an 8th-century Sogdian painted mural with a she-wolf, head turned back and down, suckling two infants.\n\nThe Italian football clubs A.S. Roma and S.S. Robur Siena use the imagery in their respective team logos.\n\nThe Fascist government of Benito Mussolini made use of the she-wolf while in power.\n\nThe Sienese have a traditional tale that the city was founded by Senius and Aschius, another pair of twins who were also suckled by a she-wolf. They were the sons of Remus and fled Rome after his death at the hands of their uncle Romulus. The legend cannot be attested to prior to the Renaissance. However, depictions of a she-wolf and twins are common in the city and some can be dated earlier.\nThe she-wolf and twins appeared on what may have been the earliest silver coin ever minted in Rome.\nThe Lupercalia was a very ancient festival even during Roman times. Roman historians speculated as to its origins. It may be associated with the god Lupercus, the god of shepherds and protector of flocks. Some historians link it to the she-wolf and the Lupercal.\n\n"}
{"id": "914436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=914436", "title": "Shield-maiden", "text": "Shield-maiden\n\nA shield-maiden (), in Scandinavian folklore and mythology was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in sagas such as \"Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks\" and in \"Gesta Danorum\". Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other Germanic peoples: Goths, Cimbri, and Marcomanni. The mythical valkyries may have been based on the shield-maidens.\n\nThe historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including Neil Price, argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.\n\nThere are few historic attestations that Viking Age women took part in warfare, but the Byzantine historian John Skylitzes records that women fought in battle when Sviatoslav I of Kiev attacked the Byzantines in Bulgaria in 971. When the Varangians (not to be confused with the Byzantine Varangian Guard) had suffered a devastating defeat in the Siege of Dorostolon, the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.\n\nWhen Leif Erikson's pregnant half-sister Freydís Eiríksdóttir was in Vinland, she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking Skrælings. The fight is recounted in the \"Greenland saga\", though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.\n\nSaxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the Danes at the Battle of Brávellir in the year 750:\nExamples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include Brynhildr in the \"Vǫlsunga saga\", Hervor in \"Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks\", the Brynhildr of the \"Bósa saga ok Herrauðs\", the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in \"Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar\" and Princess Hed, Visna and Veborg in \"Gesta Danorum\".\n\nTwo shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the \"Hervarar saga\". The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword Tyrfing from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider. She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking Huns. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield. Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.\n\nBrynhildr of the \"Vǫlsunga saga\", along with her rival in love, Guðrún Gjúkadóttir, provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas. Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior. When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother Gunnarr instead of Sigurðr, the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:\nBrynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her. Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.\n\nGuðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, \"Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires.\" In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.\n\nGraves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted. Norse immigrant graves in England and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons. In a tie-in special to the TV series \"Vikings\" Neil Price showed that a 10th Century Birka-burial excavated in the 1970s containing a large number of weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström. In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female; the so called Birka female Viking warrior, but others including respected scholar of the Vikings, Judith Jesch says that conclusion is premature. \n\nWhile women warriors are a staple of fantasy, they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include Éowyn in J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" and Thorgil in Nancy Farmer's \"The Sea of Trolls\" trilogy.\n\nIn the 2013 TV series \"Vikings\", the legendary Viking shield-maiden Lagertha, played by Katheryn Winnick, is a principal character.\n\n"}
{"id": "397721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=397721", "title": "The Famous Five (Canada)", "text": "The Famous Five (Canada)\n\nThe Famous Five, or The Valiant Five, () were five Alberta women who asked the Supreme Court of Canada to answer the question, \"Does the word 'Persons' in Section 24 of the British North America Act, 1867, include female persons?\" in the case \"Edwards v Canada.\" The five women, Emily Murphy, Irene Marryat Parlby, Nellie Mooney McClung, Louise Crummy McKinney and Henrietta Muir Edwards, created a petition to ask this question. They fought to have women legally considered persons so that women could be appointed to the Senate. The petition was filed on August 27, 1927, and on April 24, 1928, Canada's Supreme Court summarized its unanimous decision that women are not such \"persons\".\n\nThe last line of the judgement reads, \"Understood to mean 'Are women eligible for appointment to the Senate of Canada,' the question is answered in the negative.\" This judgement was overturned by the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on October 18, 1929. This case came to be known as the \"Persons Case\". Although Canadian women (those who were British/Canadian citizens) had the vote in many provinces and in federal elections by 1929, the case was part of a continent-wide drive for political equality, coming seven years after discrimination against women's voting rights was prohibited in the United States through the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and thus had important ramifications.\n\nSome saw this as \"radical change\"; others saw it as a restoration of the original framing of the English constitutional documents, including the 1689 Bill of Rights, which uses only the term \"person\", not the term \"man\" (or \"woman\" for that matter).\n\nSome others have interpreted the Privy Council rule as causing a change in the Canadian judicial approach to the Canadian constitution, an approach that has come to be known as the \"living tree doctrine\".\n\nThe famous five women were:\n\n\nEmily Murphy stood out in the famous five, bringing them to a victory in 1929. Emily was appointed to the office of Magistrate of the Edmonton Juvenile Court in 1916 and later became the magistrate of the newly created Women's Court. At the time, no woman had held such a position and many men objected.\n\nDuring her career as a writer, Murphy used the pen name \"Janey Canuck\". In 1922, she wrote \"The Black Candle\" which detailed her beliefs on race and drug use in Canada and strongly influenced the drug policy of the day. Murphy came from a privileged background in which white women were protected from many topics.\n\nIn 1916, Irene Parlby was elected as the first president of the United Farm Women of Alberta and in 1921, was elected to the Alberta legislature and received a cabinet post in the United Farmers of Alberta government, becoming the second woman in the British Empire to hold ministerial rank. She served as cabinet minister until the downfall of the government in 1935. Parlby worked with the Red Cross during World War I and later served on the Board of Governors of the University of Alberta.\n\nNellie McClung's jobs in her lifetime included teacher, author, public speaker, temperance activist, internationally known women's rights activist, and politician {Warne, Literature as Pulpit]. In 1918, she was a member of the Dominion War Council and the only woman representative at the League of Nations. She represented Canada at the Ecumenical Council of the Methodist church in 1921 and was the first woman on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Board of the Governors. In 1921, McClung was elected to the Alberta legislature as an MLA in Edmonton for the Liberal Party. She served one term, not being re-elected in 1926. She was a member of the Political Equality League of Manitoba, and she played the leading role in the Mock Parliament held on January 29, 1914, at the Walker Theatre in Winnipeg, which humorously discussed Votes for Men.\n\nLouise McKinney became one of the first two women elected to a legislature in the British Empire, and the first to take her seat. She was a founder of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in Alberta and the West – she served as the organization's vice-president for more than 22 years beginning in 1906 – and regularly attended World Meetings of the WCTU. She signed the appeal to the Privy Council in 1929. In 1931, she became president of the Canadian Union, Woman's Christian Temperance Union. McKinney was also named to be Commissioner for the first General Council of the United Church of Canada, and was the only woman to sign the Basis of Union.\n\nHenrietta Muir Edwards, author and researcher on women's topics, held an influence within the National Council of Women and held chairmanship of the Committee in Law in the National Council of Women for more than 35 years. She was also a Red Cross leader during the war years. Edwards was the secretary of the National Subcommittee which focused on thrift and economy in Canadian homes.\n\nNone of the five became senators; the first female senator was Quebecer Cairine Reay Wilson, appointed four months after the ruling. Nearly 80 years later, on October 8, 2009, the Senate voted to make the five the first \"honorary senators\". The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women.\n\nSome might well question the overall significance of the decision, noting that by the 1920s the Senate of Canada was a largely powerless body. The more powerful House of Commons of Canada had elected its first female member (Agnes Macphail) in 1921, well before the Persons Case. However, the precedent did establish the principle that women could hold any political office in Canada. Moreover, the Five clearly did devote their energies to increasing women's participation on legislative bodies with greater power: three had been members of the Alberta legislature. The controversy surrounding the women has made commemoration difficult. The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children.\n\nOpinions on the Famous Five vary considerably. Many laud them as trailblazers for women. Others are disturbed by the opinions of some of the women on other issues, such as opposition to non-white immigration and their successful campaigns to have eugenics legislation introduced in Canadian provinces, which resulted in the sterilization of thousands of those deemed \"mentally deficient\" or \"insane\" in Alberta and elsewhere. Emily Murphy was not shy with her opinions and her outspoken nature had a tendency to give her a negative reputation. She wrote letters of her opinions to police chiefs, government officials, social service agencies and judicial officials about the extent of drug traffic and possible cures. Nellie McClung was known as the most memorable and popular of the famous five. Her causes included women's right to vote, prohibition, women in the church and women in public life. Henrietta Muir Edwards was described as \"tenacious\" with her work with prohibition.\n\nThe five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children. Emily Murphy dealt with single mothers and issues of child support, child welfare, and adoption by lobbying for women's rights. Nellie McClung favoured free medical and dental treatment for school children as well as mothers' allowances and better property rights for women. She was open to divorce and birth control but opposed the sale and use of liquor. Louise McKinney believed strongly in the \"evils of alcohol\" and pushed to enact prohibition measures. She advocated excluding cigarettes from parcels sent to soldiers in World War I in 1917. She supported reasonable measures for social welfare and health as well as introducing bills intended to make prohibition more effective, to improve the lot of immigrants and bring better security to widows. She was responsible for the introduction of a motion which led to the Dower Act. Irene Parlby in her position as cabinet minister in Alberta pursued these goals expressed by McKinney. Henrietta Edwards worked with property law and sought to protect women and children.\n\nThe Famous Five have been commemorated with individual and group plaques in the foyer and antechamber of Canada's Senate, and two identical sculptures by Canadian artist Barbara Paterson, one on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, the other at the Olympic Plaza in Calgary. The sculpture on Parliament Hill was unveiled on October 18, 2000, in a public ceremony that included French and English singers, Inuit dancers, and speeches by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson and Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. A sculpture of the Famous Five by sculptor Helen Granger Young stands on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg. Commissioned by the Nellie McClung Foundation, it was unveiled at a ceremony on June 18, 2010.\n\nThe City of Edmonton has named one park in its River Valley Parks System after each of the \"Famous Five\".\n\nMurphy had many accomplishments, such as becoming the first president of the Federated Women's Institute of Canada, vice-president of National Council of Women of Canada, president of Canadian Women's Press Club, director of the Canadian Council of Child Welfare, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Child Protection, first president of the Women's Canadian Club of Edmonton and vice-president of the Social Service Council of Canada. Emily Murphy also received many honours for her life's work including being decorated by King George V to be a Lady of Grace of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem.\n\nIrene Parlby was honoured in 1935 at spring convocation at the University of Alberta with an honorary LL.D. degree. Tributes in honour of Henrietta Edwards can be found on a plaque in the Senate Chamber in Ottawa and another in the post office in Fort Macleod. Nellie McClung spoke in Calgary after Edwards' passing and spoke of Edwards, \"who for 40 years was convener of laws for the National Council of Women\" should not be forgotten.\n\nAlong with Thérèse Casgrain, the Five were commemorated in the 2001 Journey Series of Canada's fifty-dollar bill. In December 2011, the Bank of Canada announced that the Famous Five would not appear on the redesigned $50 Frontier Series banknote that it issued in 2012.\n\nThe achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women. To honour the Five and continue to involve women in leadership roles in Canada, Frances Wright and others established the non-profit Famous Five Foundation on October 18, 1996, the 70th anniversary of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council's decision.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6609618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6609618", "title": "Winamac", "text": "Winamac\n\nWinamac was the name of a number of Potawatomi leaders and warriors beginning in the late 17th century. The name derives from a man named Wilamet, a Native American from an eastern tribe who in 1681 was appointed to serve as a liaison between New France and the natives of the Lake Michigan region. Wilamet was adopted by the Potawatomis, and his name, which meant \"Catfish\" in his native Eastern Algonquian language, was soon transformed into \"Winamac\", which means the same thing in the Potawatomi language. The Potawatomi version of the name has been spelled in a variety of ways, including Winnemac, Winamek, and Winnemeg.\n\nThe Winamac name became associated with prominent members of the Fish clan of the Potawatomi tribe. In 1701, Winamac or Wilamet was a chief of the Potawatomi villages along the St. Joseph River in what is now the U.S. state of Michigan. This man or another of the same name was an ally of New France who helped negotiate an end to the Fox Wars in the 1730s. Two other Winamacs were prominent during the War of 1812. One was active opponent of the United States, while the other was a U.S. ally. These two Winamacs have often been confused with each other.\n\nIn 1681, a group of Native Americans from several Algonquian tribes of New England accompanied French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle on an expedition to the west. One of these Natives, Wilamet (or Ouilamette or Wilamek), was appointed by La Salle to serve as a laison between New France and the natives of the Lake Michigan region. Wilamet was adopted by the Potawatomis, and his name, which meant \"Catfish\" in his native Eastern Algonquian language, was eventually transformed into \"Winamac\", which means the same thing in the Potawatomi language. Before long, he was recognized by the French as the \"chief\" of the Potawatomi villages along the St. Joseph River in what is now the U.S. state of Michigan.\n\nWilamet was therefore not a traditional Potawatomi leader (or \"okama\"), but was instead a \"chief\" appointed by the French. French-appointed chiefs were a common feature of the Franco-Indian alliance. According to historian Richard White, \"as the French singled out certain leaders to be the channels by which French power entered the villages, they created a new kind of chief which can best be distinguished as an alliance chief\".\n\nWilamet helped La Salle promote French policies while countering Iroquois influence in the Lake Michigan region. In 1694, a man named Ouilamek, probably the same Wilamet, led 30 Potawatomis in an expedition under Cadillac against the Iroquois. In 1701, Wilamet and Onanghisse (or Onangizes), another prominent Potawatomi alliance chief, represented the Potawatomis at the great Treaty of Montreal, which ended the war with the Iroquois.\n\nDuring the Fox Wars (1712–1733), a Wilamek was a leader of the Fish clan of the St. Joseph Potawatomis. Historian David Edmunds portrays this man as the same one who had attended the 1701 treaty, although Richard White writes that a Wilamek of this era was of a man of Sauk and Meskwaki (Fox) parentage who had married into the Potawatomi tribe. In 1719, Wilamek traveled to Montreal with a group of Meskwaki leaders in an effort to make peace. The following year, his son was captured by the Meskwakis, but he was later released.\n\nDuring the War of 1812 era, the Potawatomis, like other tribes, were divided over whether to oppose the expansion of the United States or to seek peaceful accommodation. Two men named Winamac were prominent in this era. One was an active opponent of the United States, while the other became a U.S. ally. These two men have often been confused with each other. American historians have often distinguished them by referring to the \"anti-American\" or \"hostile\" Winamek and the \"pro-American\" or \"friendly\" Winamek.\n\nThe \"anti-American\" Winamac was a Potawatomi leader who first appears in the historical record in 1810. That year, while returning from an unsuccessful raid against the Osages, Winamac's party stole horses from some white Illinois settlers. The settlers pursued the raiders, and the Potawatomis attacked, killing four men. Governor Ninian Edwards demanded that the Potawatomis surrender the raiders, but chief Gomo informed U.S. officials that the raiders had gone to Prophetstown in Indiana, headquarters of the anti-American resistance movement led by the Shawnee Prophet and his brother Tecumseh. Along with chiefs Shabbona and Waubonsie, Winamac led the Potawatomi contingent against the Americans at the Battle of Tippecanoe at Prophetstown in 1811.\n\nWinamac began the organization for the 1812 siege of Fort Wayne. Late in August, Winamac called together a war party from northern Indiana and Michigan. First attempting to convince Captain Rhea of their friendly intent, they sought entry to the post. Rebuffed, on August 28, 1812 the warriors killed a clerk who left the post for the Ohio. What followed were occasional firing of outbuildings and shots aimed at any and all movement seen from the outside. On September 4, Winamac approached under a flag of truce. Making no offer, Winamac found the fort susceptible to attack. The next day, two soldiers were killed outside the fort. Late in the afternoon, Winamac approached the fort with a small delegation and sought admittance to see the commander. Inside, they were heavily guarded, ending their ploy to kill the commander and attack from inside. The following day, September 6, saw the greatest action in the siege, but without help, the fort could not be taken. On September 11, a relief column under Governor Harrison arrived from Piqua and the siege ended.\n\nAfter the siege of Fort Wayne, Winamac served as a scout under British Indian agent Matthew Elliott. On November 22, 1812, Winamac was with a scouting party that captured several Indians, including Shawnee chief Logan (Spemica Lawba), a U.S. ally. Winamac was killed in an exchange of gunfire when Logan and his companions escaped; Logan died later from his wounds.\n\nThe \"pro-American\" Winamek was a chief from the Tippecanoe Potawatomi on the Wabash. Beginning in 1807 he and Five Medals and Topinabee continued to ask the American government for agricultural help. The equipment that was sent was never used, as only these chiefs were interested in agriculture, not their people. In 1807, President Monroe wanted to acquire more Indian land. A council was called at Fort Wayne in September. Winamac led the Potawatomi delegation. When the other chiefs and the Miami refused to negotiate land cessions, it was Winamac who persuaded first the Miami and then the Potawatomi to agree to the cession. When were agreed to, none were lands of the Potawatomi. Winamac and the Potawatomi received a generous share of the payment for these lands. The months following the treaty found Winamac at Detroit settling disputes for the lands in northwest Ohio. Because of the Fort Wayne Treaty, discontent was growing and the number of warriors at Prophetstown was increasing. Winamac provide information to Governor Harrison on the plans and activities at Prophetstown. Harrison invited the Prophet to Washington and in June, Tecumseh led a delegation to Vincennes to meet with Harrison. Here, Tecumseh denounced Winamac as a 'black dog' for supporting the American interests.\n\nThrough the winter of 1811-1812, Potawatomi raids were launched against settlements in southern Indiana and Illinois. To end the destruction, councils where held at Cahokia and Vincennes. Winamac and Five Medals assured the agents that the few anti-American warriors were not representative of the Potawatomi. Because of the influence of the pro-British chiefs, Winamac and Five Medals refused a trip to Washington. Tecumseh the Shawnee spoke at the council blaming Winamac and Five Medals for not controlling their warriors. When Gov. Harrison marched north to Prophetstown on the Tippecanoe in November 1811, Winamac marched with him. When they were a short march from Prophetstown, Winamac went ahead to talk with the Prophet. Winamac returned south to meet Harrison, but was on the far side of the Wabash and passed him by. On the night of November 6, Gov. Harrison encamped for the night, planning on entering Prophetstown the next day. When the sun rose, the confederacy had surrounded the troops. The Potawatomi were led by Shabbona with Waubansee and Winamac (2nd another chief among the Potawatomi). The defeat of the Indian confederacy scattered the tribes to their home villages. The dispersal of the Indian confederacy did not end the raids among the settlements. Tension was so bad, even Winamac was warned to stay out of the settlements. His unfailing support of the Americans would not protect him from harm.\n\nWhen the war between the United States and England was known, Winamac continued to support the Americans and led a delegation to the Lake Peoria villages seeking the warriors accused of raiding the settlements. He was ridiculed by the Potawatomi warriors and left unsuccessful. It was Winamac who carried William Hulls orders from Detroit to Fort Dearborn (Chicago) to evacuate, an attack was eminent. Winamac told Commander Heald that they must leave that day to save themselves, this was on August 9. On August 13, an escort of 13 Miami Indians arrived. On August 15, Mad Sturgeon and Blackbird led the Potawatomi ambush of 500+ warriors against the 62 soldiers and 27 civilians in the dunes of Lake Michigan. Fifty-three of the Americans died that day. Fifteen of the Indians died. Fort Dearborn fell on August 15, 1812 to an ambush, then Mackinac. These were followed by the siege of Detroit, which surrendered to the British on August 16.\n\nIn September 1817, Winamac and Metea represented the eastern Potawatomis at the treaty of Fort Meigs, in which they sold lands in Ohio and south central Michigan to the United States. Winamac died in 1821.\n\n\n"}

It was one of many witch trials in the early modern period, but scholar Barbara Rosen claims it \"attracted probably more notice than any other in the sixteenth century\".\n\nThe trials of the witches occurred during the sixteenth century at Warboys in Huntingdonshire. The first allegations were made in November 1589 by Jane Throckmorton, the 10-year-old daughter of Robert Throckmorton the Squire of Warboys when she started suffering from fits (see Initial Allegations below). She accused the 76-year-old Alice Samuel of being the cause; this was echoed by Jane’s four sisters and some household servants who began exhibiting similar symptoms. When Alice Samuel was brought forward to the children, they became more ill and had the urge to scratch her.\n\nRobert Throckmorton was a close friend of Sir Henry Cromwell, one of the wealthiest commoners in England and the grandfather of Oliver Cromwell. In March 1590, Lady Cromwell came to Warboys to visit. At the Throckmorton house, she interviewed Alice Samuel and what came after the interview served to confirm the suspicions the Throckmortons had. Lady Cromwell was tormented by Alice Samuel in her dreams, and after some time she became ill and died (buried 1592). This was enough proof to put Alice Samuel through a trial that would find her and the rest of her family guilty.\n\nThe first allegations declaring Alice as a practitioner of witchcraft were made in November 1589. Following this, there were a total of twelve maid-servants of the Throckmorton household (in addition to the five daughters) who experienced fits and the torment of Alice Samuell’s witchcraft. Jane’s fits were described as such: \"Sometimes she would neese [sneeze] very loud and thick for the space of half an hour together; and evidently as one in a great trance and sound lay quietly as long, soon after would begin to swell and heave up her belly so as none was able to bend her or keep her down, sometime thee would shake one leg and no other part of her, as if the palsie had been in it, sometimes the other, presently she would shake one of her arms and then the other, and soon after her head, as if she had been infected with the running palsie\".\n\nJane's mother and grandmother were by the child’s side while other neighbors came to see her. When Alice Samuel came in, the child proclaimed: \"Grandmother look where the old witch sitteth (pointing to Samuell) did you ever see one more like a witch than she is: Take off her black thrumbed [shaggy or fringed] cap, for I cannot abide to look on her\". Jane's mother thought nothing of this at first, thinking her child was sleep deprived and sick. However, because Jane continued to get worse, her parents sent her urine to Doctor Barrow of Cambridge, who sent medicine to Jane three separate times thinking it would heal her. It did not. After the third time, the Doctor inquired whether there were any signs of sorcery or witchcraft involved that the parents could see. Jane’s urine was then sent to a family acquaintance, Master Butler, for examination and he sent back the same remedies that Doctor Barrow had sent. Exactly a month later, on the same day almost to the hour, two more of Master Throckmorton’s daughters fell sick to the same illness that was afflicting Jane.\n\nThese daughters, two to three years older than Jane, cried out: \"Take her away, look where she standeth here before us in a black thrumbed cap it is she that hath bewitched us and she will kill us if you do not take her away\".\n\nThe parents were then worried, but could not understand why any such harm would come to them, for they had only moved into the town the \"Michaelmas before\" (September 29, 1588). Their youngest daughter, nine years old, fell sick less than a month later. Soon after this, the oldest daughter, fifteen years old, fell sick. She was sickest out of the five. Both cried out against Alice Samuell. Their eldest sister, having been the strongest, strived with the spirit, and was grievously tortured not being able to overcome it. This caused her to \"(neefe), screech and groan very fearfully, sometimes it would heave up her belly and bounce up her body with such violence that she was not kept upon her bed\". When sitting in a chair, her fits often caused her to break that chair.\n\nThe daughters could not see, hear or feel while in these fits. They accused Mother Samuell, asking for her to be taken away. These fits would sometimes last for half a day and happened up to six or seven times a day. They believed that God freed them of this sorcery and afterwards, the sisters remembered nothing of what they had been saying.\n\nIn March 1590, Lady Cromwell and Alice had a discussion regarding the accusations made against Alice. During this conversation, Lady Cromwell reportedly grabbed a pair of scissors and cut a lock of hair off Alice, and gave it to Mrs. Throckmorton to burn (a folk remedy believed to weaken a witch's power). That night, Lady Cromwell had nightmares, became ill and later died in 1592.\n\nFollowing the death of Lady Cromwell, a local parson convinced Alice to admit to witchcraft, which she retracted the very next day. However, she confessed again when she was brought before the Bishop of Lincoln, and taken to Huntingdon where she was imprisoned with her daughter and husband. The family was tried in April 1593 for the murder by witchcraft of Lady Cromwell. Alice’s words to Lady Cromwell (\"Madam, why do you use me thus? I never did you any harm as yet\") were used against her at the trial, and all three were found guilty and eventually hanged.\n\nThe jailer and his wife examined the corpses.\nHistorian Jim Kermode argues that the discovery of a witches' mark (also known as a \"devil's mark\") was important legal proof at this period in England. \"[I]t gradually became accepted that the mark, with women, most commonly took the form of a teat-like growth in the pudenda\".\n\nThis tale of the jailer's postmortem examination has been widely quoted in modern scholarship, for example with reference to the animal/human divide, the \"sado-erotic fascination of the witches' teat\", and particularly in feminist interpretations of the Early Modern witch trials. It is also cited by writers such as Lynn Picknett.\n\nThe scholar George Kittredge (1860–1941) called the Warboys trial \"the most momentous witch-trial that had ever occurred in England\", partially because it had \"demonstrably produced a deep and lasting impression on the class that made laws\". He makes a case that the Warboys trial influenced the passage of the Witchcraft Act of 1604.\n\nFollowing the hangings, Robert Throckmorton left Warboys hastily, his wife allegedly dying shortly before his departure.\n\n\n"}
