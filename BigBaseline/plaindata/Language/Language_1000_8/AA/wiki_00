The \"AO\" language was presented at the First international exhibition of interplanetary machines and mechanisms (dedicated to the 10th anniversary of the Russian Revolution and the 70th anniversary of the birth of Tsiolkovsky) in Moscow, 1927 as a language for interplanetary travels. The declared goal of Gordin was to construct a language which would be non-\"fetishizing\", non-\"sociomorphic\", non-gender based and non-classist. The design of the language was inspired by the Russian Futuristic poetry, brothers Gordins' pan-anarchist philosophy and early Tsiolkovsky's remarks on possible cosmic messaging (which were in accord with later Freudenthal's insights).\n\nAn integral part of the SETI project in general is research in the field of the construction of messages for extraterrestrial intelligence, possibly to be transmitted into space from Earth. As far as such messages are based on linguistic principles, the research can be considered to belong to astrolinguistics. The first proposal in this field was put forward by the mathematician Hans Freudenthal at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, in 1960 – around the time of the first SETI effort at Greenbank in the US. Freudenthal conceived a complete Lingua Cosmica. His book \"LINCOS: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse\" seems at first sight non-linguistic, because mathematical concepts are the core of the language. The concepts are, however, introduced in conversations between persons (\"Homo sapiens\"), de facto by linguistic means. This is witnessed by the innovative examples presented. The book set a landmark in astrolinguistics. This was witnessed by Bruno Bassi's review years later. Bassi noted: “LINCOS is there. In spite of its somewhat ephimeral 'cosmic intercourse' purpose it remains a fascinating linguistic and educational construction, deserving existence as another Toy of Man's Designing”.\n\nThe concept astrolinguistics in scientific research was coined as such, also with a view towards message construction for ETI, in 2013 in the monograph \"Astrolinguistics: Design of a Linguistic System for Interstellar Communication Based on Logic\", written by the astronomer and computer scientist Alexander Ollongren, University of Leiden, The Netherlands. This book presents a new Lingua Cosmica totally different from Freudenthal's design. It describes the way the logic of situations in human societies can be formulated in the lingua, also named LINCOS. This astrolinguistic system, also designed for use in interstellar communication, is based on modern constructive logic – which assures that all expressions are verifiable. At a deeper, more fundamental level, however, astrolinguistics is concerned with the question whether linguistic universalia can be identified which are potentially useful in communication across interstellar distances between intelligence species. In the view of the new LINCOS these might be certain logic descriptions of specific situations and relations (possibly in an Aristotelian sense). Kadri Tinn's (Astronomy for Humans) review of Ollongren's book recognised that aspect – she wrote:\n\n\n"}

Delany in which the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis (that language influences thought and perception) plays an important part. It was joint winner of the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1967 (with \"Flowers for Algernon\") and was also nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1967.\n\nDelany hoped to have \"Babel-17\" originally published as a single volume with the novella \"Empire Star\", but this did not happen until a 2001 reprint.\n\nDuring an interstellar war one side develops a language, \"Babel-17\", that can be used as a weapon. Learning it turns one into an unwilling traitor as it alters perception and thought. The change is made more dangerous by the language's seductive enhancement of other abilities. This is discovered by the beautiful star-ship captain, linguist, poet, and telepath Rydra Wong. She is recruited by her government to discover how the enemy are infiltrating and sabotaging strategic sites. Initially Babel-17 is thought to be a code used by enemy agents. Rydra Wong realizes it is a language and during her journey, has a traitor on the ship. Rydra later finds herself becoming the traitor as she learns more about Babel-17. She is rescued by her dedicated crew, figures out the danger, and neutralizes its effects.\n\nThe novel deals with several issues related to the peculiarities of language, how conditions of life shape the formation of words and meaning, and how the words themselves can shape the actions of people.\n\nThe language portrayed at the center of \"Babel-17\" contains interesting linguistic features including the absence of a pronoun or any other construction for \"I\". The heroine finds her perceptions (and even her physical abilities) altered once she has learned Babel-17. In this Delany's novel influenced a generation of writers: \"Native Tongue\" by Suzette Haden Elgin, \"The Dispossessed\" by Ursula K. Le Guin, \"Embassytown\" by China Miéville, \"In Luna Bore Coda\" by Joshua Nilles, and, more evidently, the short story \"Story of Your Life\" by Ted Chiang. It also resembles a few preceding science fiction novels which deal with how languages shape the political and cultural stratum of societies, such as \"The Languages of Pao\" by Jack Vance or \"Anthem\" by Ayn Rand, and language as a weapon was adapted as a plot device in Neal Stephenson's \"Snow Crash\".\n\nIn 2014, the work \"Babel-17\" was told in tandem with a partial biography of Samuel R. Delany's early years in the form of a play \"The Motion of Light in Water\", based on a 1988 autobiography with the same title, produced by Elbow Room, an Australian theatre company directed by Marcel Dorney.\n\n"}

Its precise meaning has varied by location and over time.\n\nThe word \"Bannwald\" is a combination of \"Bann\" (English \"ban\") and \"Wald\" (English \"forest\" or \"wood\"). \"Bann\" has many historical meanings in German, one of which refers to an area controlled by and set aside for the use of a landowner in medieval times (comparable to the forests subject to the royal ban in Anglo-Saxon England). A \"Bannwald\" was a forest where a nobleman had the prerogative to make use of it and the creatures in it. A royal ban forest existed at Dreieich (from the heathen worship of three oaks) for a very long period, and its charter was one of the most primitive. The (obsolete) French literal equivalent (also: \"banbois\") is still the toponym of local forests in areas which once were part of the former Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIn modern times, the term \"Bannwald\" is, in a certain sense, an archaic word which has been revived as a specific term for forests under various types of protection.\n\nThe term is generally used with a rather broad meaning:\n\nDepending on the respective forest act, there may be an overlapping or difference in meaning between the terms \"banned forest\" and \"protection forest\".\n\nSilvicultural use is still permitted and in the case of protection forests it is even welcome (except in Baden-Württemberg). However, it is prohibited in the core zones of nature reserves. \"Forestal exclusion zones\" (temporarily restricted forest areas) subject to hunting prohibitions or restrictions, or temporary \"hunting grounds\" or \"game preserves\" (areas closed during a hunting season or breeding and upbringing season) are not classified as banned forests.\n\nThe term \"Bann\" dates back to the Middle Ages. At that time a \"Bannwald\" referred to a forest area where the respective territorial lord had the exclusive right to use the forest (\"forest privilege\"). Originally this applied only to hunting (\"hunting privilege\") and fishing, however, later it was extended to the complete use of the forest. In the mountain valleys of Switzerland banned forests had the function to protect against avalanches and also to provide sufficient timber for fencing torrents. Corresponding decrees from the 14th century deal with protection against avalanches, rockfalls and flooding. The concept of \"Bannwald\" plays an important part in Ludwig Ganghofer's novel \"Die Martinsklause\" in which a tyrannical administrator in Berchtesgaden claims excessive privileges.\n\n→ \"see also: \"\n\nIn Baden-Württemberg, there are \"Bannwälder Totalreservate\", fully protected reserves where any use is strictly prohibited by law. In other federal states of Germany such \"total reserves\" are known under different names. Due to their structural diversity in living trees and dry wood banned forests are refugia for many endangered species of animals, plants, and mushrooms.\n\nIn Bavaria \"forest and its existence and size is extremely essential in particular in densely populated and sparsely wooded areas and consequently its size and structure must be preserved as it is of extraordinary importance for the climate, water resources or for air purification\" and may be classified as banned forest.\"\n\nIn Hesse a \"Bannwald\" is a forest which because of its location, size and extraordinary importance for hydrological balance, climate and air purification has to be preserved and may be cut only in exceptional cases.\n\nIn Austria, a \"Bannwald\" is a stricter form of a protection forest.\n\nThe Swiss Forestry Act of 1874 uses the term, Schutzwald (protection forest), rather than \"Bannwald\".\n\n\n\n"}

However, as part of the literary evidence of Kusana period, the word \"Chanchala\", like \"Dhavani\" and \"Rodini\", indicates the nature or action of Mother goddess. In the Bhagavad Gita(Sloka VI.26):\nthe word Chanchala used in the first line refers to the restless and the unsteady mind that wanders away.\n\nDasam Granth, which like the Guru Granth Sahib is an important book of Sikhism, it is not composed in ragas (its first composition dates 1684 A.D.) tells us that \"Chanchala\" is the name a \"chhand\" or metre of sixteen syllables having \"ragan\", \"jagan\", \"ragan\", \"jagan\" and \"laghu\" consecutively in each quarter, this metre is also known as \"Chitra\", \"Biraj and \"Brahmrupak\", and has been used twice in \"Choubis Autar\".\n\n\"Chanchala\", meaning, 'the fickle-fortune', is one of the many names of Lakshmi. There is no mention of \"Lakshmi\" in the Rig Veda. Sri of the Rig Veda is deified as a personified being in the Yajurveda, and in the Atharvaveda (I.18) she is prayed to secure prosperity. \"Jatavedas Agni\" is repeatedly asked to make the goddess come to the votary; the epithet \"anapagamini\" reflects the \"chanchala\" i.e. fleet or fickle aspect of the goddess. \"Lakshmi\" or \"Chanchala\" as the mobile one associates only with the rich and the dynamic, no matter what their caste, creed or colour. Because \"Lakshmi\" is \"chanchala\" i.e. quick on her feet, to make her \"achala\" i.e. 'immobile', she needs to be worshipped quietly so that she does not get distracted.\n\nIn Yoga, \"vritti\" indicates the contents of mental awareness that are disturbances in the medium of consciousness. The \"vrittis\" of the \"gunas\" are ever-active and swift, the \"gunas\" serve as parts of \"buddhi\", their habitual conduct is fickle, restless, tremulous (\"chanchala\") activity, which activity can be controlled through \"Abhyasa\", \"Vairagya\" and \"Ishvarapranidhana\". \"Sri Narada Pancharatnam\" (Sloka VIII.15) tells us that \"Chanchala\" is the \"nadi\" which along with \"Medhya\" resides in the \"Visuddha Chakra\" on the throat.\n"}

Thus \"Socrates is a philosopher\" consists of \"Socrates\", which signifies the Object \"Socrates\", and \"is a philosopher\", which signifies the Concept of \"being a philosopher\".\n\nThis was a considerable departure from the traditional term logic, in which every proposition (i.e. sentence) consisted of two general terms joined by the copula \"is\".\n\nThe distinction was of fundamental importance to the development of logic and mathematics. Frege's distinction helped to clarify the notions of a set, of the membership relation between element and set, and of empty and infinite sets. However, Frege's conception of a class (in his terminology an extension of a concept) differs from the current iterative conception of a set.\n\nFrege's distinction leads to the famous difficulty or \"awkwardness of language\" that some expressions which purport to signify a concept — Frege's example is \"the concept \"horse\"\" — are grammatically expressions that by his criterion signify an Object. Thus \"the concept \"horse\" is not a concept, whereas the city of Berlin is a city\".\n\nAnthony Kenny sought to justify the distinction, other philosophers such as Hartley Slater and Crispin Wright have argued that the distinguished category of \"entity\" cannot be associated with predication in the way that individual objects are associated with the use of singular terms.\n"}

Among the earlier examples is St. Augustine's \"Confessions\", perhaps the first autobiography of Western Europe. In it, he not only recounted the events of his life, he wrestled with their meaning and significance, as in a passage where he tried to fathom why he had stolen pears with friends, not to eat but to throw away.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau turned it to a secular purpose in his \"Confessions\".\n\nFrom this meaning evolved the meaning of writing that reveals more of the writer's motivations, particularly the darker reactions, and the events that are normally kept secret.\n\nFictionally, the confessional story is a story written, in the first person, about emotionally fraught and morally charged situations in which a fictional character is caught. These stories may be anything from thinly veiled recounting of the writer's life to completely fictional works.\n\nWith the advent of the magazine \"True Story\" in 1919 and the imitations of it, the confessional (or romance) magazine was created, containing such stories. Such confessions magazines were chiefly aimed at an audience of working-class women. Their formula has been characterized as \"sin-suffer-repent\": The heroine violates standards of behavior, suffers as a consequence, learns her lesson and resolves to live in light of it, not embittered by her pain.\n\n"}

{"id": "39104546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39104546", "title": "Evolutionary psychology of language", "text": "Evolutionary psychology of language\n\nEvolutionary psychology of language is the study of the evolutionary history of language as a psychological faculty within the discipline of evolutionary psychology. It makes the assumption that language is the result of a Darwinian adaptation.\n\nThere are many competing theories of how language might have evolved, if indeed it is an evolutionary adaptation. They stem from the belief that language development could result from an adaptation, an exaptation, or a by-product. Genetics also influence the study of the evolution of language. It has been speculated that the FOXP2 gene may be what gives humans the ability to develop grammar and syntax.\n\nIn the debate surrounding the evolutionary psychology of language, three sides emerge: those who believe in language as an adaptation, those who believe it is a by-product of another adaptation, and those who believe it is an exaptation.\n\nScientist and psychologists Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom argue that language as a mental faculty shares many likenesses with the complex organs of the body which suggests that, like these organs, language has evolved as an adaptation, since this is the only known mechanism by which such complex organs can develop. The complexity of the mechanisms, the faculty of language and the ability to learn language provides a comparative resource between the psychological evolved traits and the physical evolved traits.\n\nPinker, though he mostly agrees with Noam Chomsky, a linguist and cognitive scientist, in arguing that the fact that children can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction, but Pinker and Bloom argue that the organic nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin.\n\nNoam Chomsky spearheaded the debate on the faculty of language as a cognitive by-product, or spandrel. As a linguist, rather than an evolutionary biologist, his theoretical emphasis was on the infinite capacity of speech and speaking: there are a fixed number of words, but there is an infinite combination of the words. His analysis from this considers that the ability of our cognition to perceive infinite possibilities, or create infinite possibilities, helped give way to the extreme complexity found in our language. Both Chomsky and Gould argue that the complexity of the brain is in itself an adaptation, and language arises from such complexities.\nOn the issue of whether language is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a by product, evolutionary biologist W. Tecumseh Fitch, following Stephen J. Gould, argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation. He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptationist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether \"Language has evolved as an adaptation\" as being misleading.\nHe argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system. A similar argument is made by Terrence Deacon who in \"The Symbolic Species\" argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use symbolic communication is integrated in all other cognitive processes.\n\nExaptations, like adaptations, are fitness-enhancing characteristics, but, according to Stephen Jay Gould, their purposes were appropriated as the species evolved. This can be for one of two reasons: either the trait’s original function was no longer necessary so the trait took on a new purpose or a trait that does not arise for a certain purpose, but later becomes important. Typically exaptations have a specific shape and design which becomes the space for a new function. The foundation of this argument comes from the low-lying position of the larynx in humans. Other mammals have this same positioning of the larynx, but no other species has acquired language. This leads exaptationists to see an evolved modification away from its original purpose.\n\nResearch has shown that “genetic constraints” on language evolution could have caused a “specialized” and “species-specific language module. It is through this module that there are many specified “domain-specific linguistic properties,” such as syntax and agreement. Adaptationists believe that language genes “coevolved with human language itself for the purpose of communication.” This view suggests that the genes that are involved with language would only have coevolved in a very stable linguist environment. This shows that language could not have evolved in a rapidly changing environment because that type of environment would not have been stable enough for natural selection. Without natural selection, the genes would not have coevolved with the ability for language, and instead, would have come from “cultural conventions.” The adaptationist belief that genes coevolved with language also suggests that there are no “arbitrary properties of language.” This is because they would have coevolved with language through natural selection.\nThe Baldwin effect provides a possible explanation for how language characteristics that are learned over time could become encoded in genes. He suggested, like Darwin did, that organisms that can adapt a trait faster have a “selective advantage.” As generations pass, less environmental stimuli is needed for organisms of the species to develop that trait. Eventually no environmental stimuli are needed and it is at this point that the trait has become “genetically encoded.”\n\nThe genetic and cognitive components of language have long been under speculation, only recently have linguists been able to point out a gene that may possibly explain how language works. Evolutionary psychologists hold that the FOXP2 gene may well be associated with the evolution of human language. In the 1980s, psycholinguist Myrna Gopnik identified a dominant gene that causes language impairment in the KE family of Britain. The KE family has a mutation in the FOXP2, that makes them suffer from a speech and language disorder. It has been argued that the FOXP2 gene is the grammar gene, which is what allows humans the ability to form proper syntax and make our communication of higher quality. Children that grow up in a stable environment are able to develop highly proficient language without any instruction. Individuals with a mutation to their FOXP2 gene have trouble mastering complex sentences, and shows signs of developmental verbal dyspraxia.\n\nThis gene most likely evolved in the hominin line after the hominin and the chimpanzee lines split; this accounts for the fact that humans are the only ones able to learn and understand grammar. Humans have a unique allele of this gene, which has otherwise been closely conserved through most of mammalian evolutionary history. This unique allele seems to have first appeared between 100 and 200 thousand years ago, and it is now all but universal in humans. This suggests that speech evolved late in overall spectrum of human evolution.\n\nIn the world there are nearly 7000 languages, there is great amount of variation and this variation is thought to have come about through cultural differentiation. There are four factors that are thought to be the reason as to why there is language variation between cultures: founder effects, drift, hybridization and adaptation. With the vast amounts of lands available different tribes began to form and to claim their territory, in order to differentiate themselves many of these groups made changes to their language and this how the evolution of languages began. There also tended to be drifts in the population a certain group would get lost and be isolated from the rest of the group, this group would lose touch with the other groups and before they knew there had been mutations in their language and a whole new language had been formed.\n\nHybridization also played a big role in the language evolution, one group would come in contact with another tribe and they would pick up words and sounds from each other eventually leading to the formation of a new language. Adaptation would also play a role in the evolution of language differentiation, the environment and the circumstances were constantly changing therefore the groups had to adapt to the environment and their language had to adapt to it as well, it is all about maximizing fitness.\n\nAtkinson theorized that language may have originated in Africa since African languages have a greater variation of speech sounds than other languages. Those sounds are seen as the root for the other languages that exist across the world.\n\nResearch indicates that nonhuman animals (e.g., apes, dolphins, and songbirds) show evidence of language. Comparative studies of the sensory-motor system reveal that speech is not special to humans: nonhuman primates can discriminate between two different spoken languages. Anatomical aspects of humans, particularly the descended larynx, has been believed to be unique to humans' capacity to speak. However, further research revealed that several other mammals have a descended larynx beside humans, which indicates that a descended larynx must not be the only anatomical feature needed for speech production.\nVocal imitation is not uniquely human as well. Songbirds seem to acquire species-specific songs by imitating. Because nonhuman primates do not have a descended larynx, they lack vocal imitative capacity, which is why studies involving these primates have taught them nonverbal means of communication, e.g., sign language.\n\nKoko and Nim Chimpsky are two apes that have successfully learned to use sign language, but not to the extent that a human being can. Nim is a chimpanzee that was taken in by a family in the 1970s and was raised as if he were a human child. Nim was able to master 150 signs, which were limited but useful. Koko was a gorilla that was taken in by a Berkley student. She was able to master 600 signs for generative communication. Koko and Nim were not able to develop speech due to the fact that they lack the larynx which is what distinguishes humans from other animals and allows them to speak.\n\n"}

It produces raw, often unusable material, but helps writers overcome blocks of apathy and self-criticism. It is used mainly by prose writers and writing teachers. Some writers use the technique to collect initial thoughts and ideas on a topic, often as a preliminary to formal writing. Free writing is not the same as automatic writing.\n\nUnlike brainstorming where ideas are simply listed, in freewriting one writes sentences to form a paragraph about whatever comes to mind.\n\nDorothea Brande was an early proponent of freewriting. In her book \"Becoming a Writer\" (1934), she advises readers to sit and write for 30 minutes every morning, as fast as they can.\n\nPeter Elbow advanced freewriting in his book \"Writing Without Teachers\" (1975), and it has been popularized by Julia Cameron through her book \"The Artist's Way\" (1992).\n\nThe technique involves continuous writing, usually for a predetermined period of time (often five to fifteen minutes). The writer writes without regard to spelling, grammar, etc., and makes no corrections. If the writer reaches a point where they can't think of anything to write, it is presumed they will \"write\" that they can't think of anything or repeat words, until they find another line of thought. The writer freely strays off topic, letting thoughts lead where they may. At times, a writer may also do a focused freewrite, letting a chosen topic structure their thoughts. Expanding from this topic, the thoughts may stray to make connections and create more abstract views on the topic. This technique helps a writer explore a particular subject before putting ideas into a more basic context.\n\nFreewriting is often done on a daily basis as a part of the writer's daily routine. Also, students in many writing courses are assigned to do such daily writing exercises.\n\nThe writing does not have to be done with pen and paper. A technique known as Freeblogging combines blogging with free-writing with the rules changed so that the writer does not stop typing for long periods of time. The end result may or may not be shared with the public.\n\nFree writing is based on a presumption that, while everybody has something to say and the ability to say it, the mental wellspring may be blocked by apathy, self-criticism, resentment, anxiety about deadlines, fear of failure or censure, or other forms of resistance. The accepted rules of free-writing enable a writer to build up enough momentum to blast past blocks into uninhibited flow, the concept outlined by writing teachers such as Louise Dunlap, Peter Elbow, and Natalie Goldberg.\n\nFree-writing is all about loosening and limbering the thought process, not about a product or a performance for a student or a writer.\n\nOften free-writing workshops focus on self-expression, and are sometimes even used in teaching to elementary school children. There is no common consensus on the acceptance of this technique.\n\n, often referred as Natalie Goldberg's first four rules of writing:\n\nGoldberg's rules appear to be based on those developed by Jack Kerouac, whom she cites several times. Kerouac developed 30 \"rules\" in his Belief & Technique for Modern Prose. While Kerouac's \"rules\" are elliptical and even cryptic for beginning writers, they are more comprehensive than Goldberg's for those who have practised prose writing for some time. Kerouac supplemented these with his Essentials of Spontaneous Prose, and together they form the basis of his prose writing method, a form of narrative stream of consciousness. Kerouac himself cites the \"trance writing\" of William Butler Yeats as a precursor of his own practice.\n\nGoldberg's rules, which are infused with the study and practice of Zen Buddhism, make the process of free writing more accessible for a beginner and are perhaps less extreme than those of Kerouac, although they are still tinged with an element of mysticism.\n\n"}

{"id": "1596101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1596101", "title": "Grammelot", "text": "Grammelot\n\nGrammelot (or gromalot) is a style of language used in satirical theatre, a gibberish with macaronic and onomatopoeic elements, used in association with mime and mimicry. The satirical use of such a format may date back to the 16th century commedia dell'arte; the group of cognate terms appears to belong to the 20th century.\n\nIn an essay entitled “L’art du grommelot” (Le Figaro, April 20, 2006), French scholar Claude Duneton suggests the word (not the technique) – in its French form, \"grommelot\" – has its origins in the \"commedia dell’arte\"-derived Italian theatre of the early part of the sixteenth century. Duneton studied briefly with Léon Chancerel (1886–1965), who was a major figure in this branch of theatre. Chancerel in fact uses the word in his book, \"Le théâtre et la jeunesse\" (Paris: Bourrellier 1946:47). Others, such as theatre scholar John Rudlin in \"Commedia dell'arte: An Actor's Handbook\" (London: Routledge 1994:60), suggest this origin as well.\n\nWhile the historical origin of the term is unclear, it has been particularly popularized by the Nobel-winning Italian playwright Dario Fo. His 1969 show \"Mistero Buffo\" (\"Comic Mystery Play\") was a satirical touring performance involving sketches based on mediaeval sources, told in Fo's own grammelots constructed from archaic Po Valley dialects and phonemes from modern languages (he has coined separate Italian, French and American grammelots). In his Nobel lecture, Fo referred to the 16th-century Italian playwright Ruzzante's invention of a similar language based on Italian dialects, Latin, Spanish, German and onomatopoeic sounds.\n\nAnother notable modern Italian exponent is the Milan actor/writer Gianni Ferrario. Voice actor Carlo Bonomi, also from Milan, used grammelot to voice Osvaldo Cavandoli's cartoon La Linea and many years later, outside of Italy, Otmar Gutmann's Pingu. Mainstream comics have also used Grammelot-like language: for instance, Stanley Unwin. The Canadian circus and entertainment troupe Cirque du Soleil uses in its routines similar forms of language; journalists often term them \"Cirquish\", but Cirque du Soleil's own staff use the word \"Grommelot\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6437266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6437266", "title": "Howdy", "text": "Howdy\n\nHowdy is an informal greeting, originally a shortened form of the greeting \"How do ye?\" It was first recorded as part of the South England dialect in 1563/87.\n\nLiterature from that period includes the use of \"How-do, how-do\" and \"How\" as a greeting used by the Scottish when addressing Anglo settlers in greeting. The double form of the idiom is still found in parts of the American Southwest as \"Howdy, howdy\". Without regard to etymological beginnings, the word is used as a greeting such as \"Hello\" and not, normally, as an enquiry. As a result, it's not followed by a question mark. Punctuating \"Howdy\" commonly follows these rules:\n(i) If \"Howdy\" is used as a complete sentence, it's followed by an exclamation mark.\n(ii) If \"Howdy\" is the first word in a sentence, it's followed by a comma.\n\nIn the rural Southwestern United States, \"Howdy\" is a colloquial contraction of the formal greeting of \"How do you do?\", and as such is considered a formal and acceptable greeting for residents of that region of the world. \"Howdy\" is also the official greeting of Texas A&M University, though the two are not always automatically associated.\n\nThe word became recently popular in other areas of the world as it is the default greeting from the dashboard of WordPress, a very popular content management system. The probable reason for using \"Howdy\" (instead of \"Welcome\" or \"Hello\") in the dashboard is because Matt Mullenweg, one of the main developers of WordPress, was born and raised in Texas.\n\nThe phrase \"boy howdy\" is a development of the greeting which adds the exclamation \"boy\" to form an interjection which indicates an emphatic affirmation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19001725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19001725", "title": "I-message", "text": "I-message\n\nIn interpersonal communication, an I-message or I-statement is an assertion about the feelings, beliefs, values etc. of the person speaking, generally expressed as a sentence beginning with the word \"I\", and is contrasted with a \"you-message\" or \"you-statement\", which often begins with the word \"you\" and focuses on the person spoken to. Thomas Gordon coined the term \"I message\" in the 1960s while doing play therapy with children. He added the concept to his book for parents, \"P.E.T.: Parent Effectiveness Training\" (1970).\n\nI-messages are often used with the intent to be assertive without putting the listener on the defensive. They are also used to take ownership for one's feelings rather than implying that they are caused by another person. An example of this would be to say: \"I really am getting backed up on my work since I don't have the financial report yet\", rather than: \"you didn't finish the financial report on time!\" (The latter is an example of a \"you-statement\").\n\nI-messages or I-statements can also be used in constructive criticism. For instance, one might say, \"I had to read that section of your paper three times before I understood it\", rather than, \"This section is worded in a really confusing way\", or \"You need to learn how to word a paper more clearly.\" The former comment leaves open the possibility that the fault lies with the giver of the criticism. According to the Conflict Resolution Network, I-statements are a dispute resolution conversation opener that can be used to state how one sees things and how one would like things to be, without using inflaming language\n\nWhile the underlying rationale and approach to I-messages is similar in various systems, there are both three-part and four-part models for constructing I-messages. A three-part model is proposed by the University of Tennessee Family & Consumer Sciences for improving communication with children:\n\nAccording to Hope E. Morrow, a common pitfall in I-statement construction is using phrases like \"I feel that...\" or \"I like that...\" which typically express an opinion or judgment. Morrow favors following \"I feel...\" with a feeling such as \"sad\", \"angry\", etc. \n\nGordon advises that to use an I-message successfully, there should be congruence between the words one is using and one's affect, tone of voice, facial expression and body language. Gordon also describes a 3-part I-message, called a \"confrontive\" I-message, with the following parts:\nHe describes the I-message as an appeal for help from the other person, and states that the other person is more likely to respond positively when the message is presented in that way.\n\nIf an \"I\" message contains \"you-messages\", it can be problematic in conflict situations. For example: \"I feel..., when you..., and I want you to...\" This can put the receiver of the statement on the defensive. In a dispute, use of a phrase that begins with \"I want\" may encourage the parties to engage in positional problem solving. This may make conflicts more difficult to resolve. An \"interest-based\" approach to conflict resolution suggests using statements that reflect why the individual wants something.\n\nThe goals of an \"I\" message in an interest-based approach:\n\nThe Ohio Commission on Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management summarized this approach as follows: \"A sender of a message can use a statement that begins with 'I' and expresses the sender's feelings, identifies the unwanted behavior, and indicates a willingness to resolve the dispute, without using 'you' statements or engaging in positional problem solving.\n\nThe Commission proposed a four-part I-message:\n\nMarital stability and relationship analysis researcher John Gottman notes that although I-statements are less likely than You-statements to be critical and to make the listener defensive, \"you can also buck this general rule and come up with 'I' statements like 'I think you are selfish' that are hardly gentle. So the point is not to start talking to your spouse in some stilted psychobabble. Just keep in mind that if your words focus on how \"you're\" feeling rather than on accusing your spouse, your discussion will be far more successful.\"\n\nI-statements have been found to offer a tremendous benefit to clients – patients. I-statements encourage growth and maturation. They are beneficial when employed with an individual struggling with self-defeating thoughts and mindset.\n\nThe therapeutic model varies on its take on the use of I-statements. I-statements are designed to rid the myths from the reality of life. I-statements are further productive in challenging one's innermost feelings. Dr. Asa Don Brown, author with the Canadian Counseling and Psychotherapy Association stated that \"Self-talk reflects your innermost feelings.\" If they reflect your \"inner most\" feelings, then understanding those feelings are necessary in overcoming one's negative perceptions and worldviews, according to Dr. Brown.\n\nI-statements are capable of influencing one's path and design in life. According to Girlshealth.gov, \"An I-statement is a sentence that begins with the word \"I.\" It helps the... (individual) take responsibility for their feelings instead of saying they are caused by the other person. This can help keep relationships open and honest between people when there is a conflict.\" \n\nI statements are important for clarifying one's position, contribution, and desires around a situation, event, and/or life perspective. According to family psychology movement, I-statements are necessary for establishing a healthy relationship and an appropriate level of intimacy.\n\nI-statements help the individual avoid blame, turning blame into personal responsibility. Personal responsibility is key to learning to use I-statements. Without personal responsibility, I-statements are null in their intention.\n\nGordon states, \"Although I-messages are more likely to influence others to change than You-messages, still it is a fact that being confronted with the prospect of having to change is often disturbing to the changee.\" A quick shift by the sender of the I-message to an active listening posture can achieve several important functions in this situation, according to Gordon. He states that in Leader Effectiveness Training courses, this is called \"shifting gears\", and states that the person might shift back to an I-message later in the conversation.\n\nA book about mentoring states that communications specialists find that I-messages are a less threatening way to confront someone one wants to influence, and suggests a three-part I-message: a neutral description of planned behaviour, consequences of the behaviour, and the emotions of the speaker about the situation.\n\nA manual for health care workers calls I-messages an \"important skill\", but emphasizes that use of an I-message does not guarantee that the other person will respond in a helpful way. It presents an I-message as a way that one can take responsibility for one's own feelings and express them without blaming someone else. A manual for social workers presents I-messages as a technique with the purpose of improving the effectiveness of communication.\n\nA study in Hong Kong of children's reactions to messages from their mothers found that children are most receptive to I-messages that reveal distress, and most antagonistic towards critical you-messages. A study with university students as subjects did not find differences in emotional reactions to I-messages and you-messages for negative emotions, but did find differences in reactions for positive emotions.\n\nA study of self-reported emotional reactions to I-statements and you-statements by adolescents found that accusatory you-statements evoked greater anger and a greater inclination for antagonistic response than assertive I-statements.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6427405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6427405", "title": "Indeterminacy (philosophy)", "text": "Indeterminacy (philosophy)\n\nIndeterminacy, in philosophy, can refer both to common scientific and mathematical concepts of uncertainty and their implications and to another kind of indeterminacy deriving from the nature of definition or meaning. It is related to deconstructionism and to Nietzsche's criticism of the Kantian noumenon.\n\nThe problem of indeterminacy arises when one observes the eventual circularity of virtually every possible definition. It is easy to find loops of definition in any dictionary, because this seems to be the only way that certain concepts, and generally very important ones such as that of existence, can be defined in the English language. A definition is a collection of other words, and in any finite dictionary if one continues to follow the trail of words in search of the precise meaning of any given term, one will inevitably encounter this linguistic indeterminacy.\n\nPhilosophers and scientists generally try to eliminate indeterminate terms from their arguments, since any indeterminate thing is unquantifiable and untestable; similarly, any hypothesis which consists of a statement of the properties of something unquantifiable or indefinable cannot be falsified and thus cannot be said to be supported by evidence that does not falsify it. This is related to Popper's discussions of falsifiability in his works on the scientific method. The quantifiability of data collected during an experiment is central to the scientific method, since reliable conclusions can only be drawn from replicable experiments, and since in order to establish observer agreement scientists must be able to quantify experimental evidence.\n\nImmanuel Kant unwittingly proposed one answer to this question in his Critique of Pure Reason by stating that there must \"exist\" a \"thing in itself\" – a thing which is the cause of phenomena, but not a phenomenon itself. But, so to speak, \"approximations\" of \"things in themselves\" crop up in many models of empirical phenomena. Singularities in physics, such as gravitational singularities, \"certain aspects of which\" (e.g., their unquantifiability) can seem \"almost\" to mirror various \"aspects\" of the proposed \"thing in itself\", are generally eliminated (or attempts are made at eliminating them) in newer, more precise models of the universe. Definitions of various psychiatric disorders stem, according to philosophers who draw on the work of Michel Foucault, from a belief that something unobservable and indescribable is fundamentally \"wrong\" with the mind of whoever suffers from such a disorder. Proponents of Foucault's treatment of the concept of insanity would assert that one need only try to quantify various characteristics of such disorders as presented in today's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (e.g., delusion, one of the diagnostic criteria which must be exhibited by a patient if he or she is to be considered schizophrenic) in order to discover that the field of study known as abnormal psychology relies upon indeterminate concepts in defining virtually each \"mental disorder\" it describes. The quality that makes a belief a delusion is indeterminate to the extent to which it is unquantifiable; arguments that delusion is determined by popular sentiment (i.e., \"almost no-one believes that he or she is made of cheese, and thus that belief is a delusion\") would lead to the conclusion that, for example, Alfred Wegener's assertion of continental drift was a delusion since it was dismissed for decades after it was made.\n\nRelevant criticism of Kant's original formulation of the \"thing in itself\" can be found in the works of Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, who argued against what he held to be the indeterminate nature of such concepts as the Platonic idea, the subject, the Kantian noumenon, the opposition of \"appearance\" to \"reality\", etc. Nietzsche concisely argued against Kant's noumenon in his \"On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense\" as follows:\n\nIn his \"Beyond Good and Evil\", Nietzsche argues against the \"misleading significance of words\" and its production of a \"thing in itself\":\n\nFurthermore, Nietzsche argued against such singularities as the atom in the scientific models of his day in \"The Will to Power\":\n\nThe concept of something that is unapproachable but always further-approximable has led to a rejection by philosophers like Nietzsche of the concept of exact equality in general in favor of that of approximate similarity:\n\nIf one states an equation between two things, one states, in effect, that they are the same thing. It can be argued that this cannot possibly be true, since one will then consider the properties which the two sides of the equation share – that which makes them \"equal\" – but one also can, and does, consider them as two separate concepts. Even in a mathematical statement as simple as \"x=x\", one encounters fundamental differences between the two \"x\"es under consideration: firstly, that there are two distinct \"x\"es, in that they neither occupy the same space on this page nor in one's own mind. There would otherwise be only one \"x\". Secondly, that if two things were absolutely equal in every possible respect, then there would necessarily be no reason to consider their equality. Nothing could lead anyone to consider the possibility or impossibility of their equality if there were no properties \"not\" shared between \"them\", since there would necessarily be no relationship between them whatsoever. Thirdly, and most importantly, if two things were equal in every possible respect they would necessarily not be two things, but the very same thing, since there would be no difference to separate them.\n\nIn examples as odd as this, the differences between two approximately equal things may be very small indeed, and it is certainly true that they are quite irrelevant to most discussions. Acceptance of the reflexive property illustrated above has led to useful mathematical discoveries which have influenced the life of anyone reading this article on a computer. But in an examination of the possibility of the determinacy of any possible concept, differences like this are supremely relevant since that quality which could possibly make two separate things \"equal\" seems to be indeterminate.\n\nSee:\n\nIndeterminacy was discussed in one of Jacques Derrida's early works \"Plato's Pharmacy\" (1969), a reading of Plato's \"Phaedrus\" and \"Phaedo\". Plato writes of a fictionalized conversation between Socrates and a student, in which Socrates tries to convince the student that writing is inferior to speech. Socrates uses the Egyptian myth of Thoth's creation of writing to illustrate his point. As the story goes, Thoth presents his invention to the god-king of Upper Egypt for judgment. Upon its presentation, Thoth offers script as a \"pharmakon\" for the Egyptian people. The Greek word pharmakon poses a quandary for translators: it is both a remedy and a poison. In the proffering of a pharmakon, Thoth presents it as its true meaning: a harm and benefit. The god-king, however, refuses the invention. Through various reasonings, he determines the pharmakon of writing to be a bad thing for the Egyptian people. The pharmakon, the undecidable, has been returned decided. The problem, as Derrida reasons, is this: since the word pharmakon, in the original Greek, means both a remedy and a poison, it cannot be determined as fully remedy or fully poison. Amon rejected writing as fully poison in Socrates' retelling of the tale, thus shutting out the other possibilities.\n\nThe philosopher Michel Foucault wrote about the existence of such problems of precise definition in the very concept of insanity itself – a \"very\" rough approximation of his argument can be found in the late social commentator and journalist Hunter S. Thompson's book, \"Kingdom of Fear\":\n\n\"The only difference between the Sane and the Insane, is IN and yet within this world, the Sane have the power to have the Insane locked up.\"\n\nAnother summary of Foucault's original argument against the indeterminacy of the concept of insanity in his \"Madness and Civilization\" can be found in the following excerpt from the \"Literature, Arts, and Medicine Database\":\n\n\"Central to this is the notion of confinement as a meaningful exercise. Foucault's history explains how the mad came first to be confined; how they became identified as confined due to moral and economic factors that determined those who ought to be confined; how they became perceived as dangerous through their confinement, partly by way of atavistic identification with the lepers whose place they had come to occupy; how they were 'liberated' by Pinel and Tuke, but in their liberation remained confined, both physically in asylums and in the designation of being mad; and how this confinement subsequently became enacted in the figure of the psychiatrist, whose practice is 'a certain moral tactic contemporary with the end of the eighteenth century, preserved in the rites of the asylum life, and overlaid by the myths of positivism.' Science and medicine, notably, come in at the later stages, as practices 'elaborated once this division' between the mad and the sane has been made (ix).\"\n\nIn \"The Archaeology of Knowledge\", Foucault addresses indeterminacy directly by discussing the origin of the meaning of concepts:\n\n\"Foucault directs his analysis toward the 'statement', the basic unit of discourse that he believes has been ignored up to this point. 'Statement' is the English translation from French énoncé (that which is enunciated or expressed), which has a peculiar meaning for Foucault. 'Énoncé' for Foucault means that which makes propositions, utterances, or speech acts meaningful. In this understanding, statements themselves are not propositions, utterances, or speech acts. Rather, statements create a network of rules establishing what is meaningful, and it is these rules that are the preconditions for propositions, utterances, or speech acts to have meaning. Statements are also 'events'. Depending on whether or not they comply with the rules of meaning, a grammatically correct sentence may still lack meaning and inversely, an incorrect sentence may still be meaningful. Statements depend on the conditions in which they emerge and exist within a field of discourse. It is huge collections of statements, called discursive formations, toward which Foucault aims his analysis.\nRather than looking for a deeper meaning underneath discourse or looking for the source of meaning in some transcendental subject, Foucault analyzes the conditions of existence for meaning. In order to show the principles of meaning production in various discursive formations he details how truth claims emerge during various epochs on the basis of what was actually said and written during these periods of time.\"\n\nThe difference described by Foucault between the sane and the insane does have observable and very real effects on millions of people daily and can be characterized in terms of those effects, but it can also serve to illustrate a particular effect of the indeterminacy of definition: i.e., that insofar as the general public tends not to characterize or define insanity in very precise terms, it tends, according to Foucault, unnecessarily and arbitrarily to confine some of its members on an irrational basis. The less-precisely such states as \"insanity\" and \"criminality\" are defined in a society, the more likely that society is to fail to continue over time to describe the same behaviors as characteristic of those states (or, alternately, to characterize such states in terms of the same behaviors).\n\nSteve Hoenisch asserts in his article \"Interpretation and Indeterminacy in Discourse Analysis\" that \"[T]he exact meaning of a speaker's utterance in a contextualized exchange is often indeterminate. Within the context of the analysis of the teacher-pupil exchange, I will argue for the superiority of interactional linguistics over speech act theory because it reduces the indeterminacy and yields a more principled interpretation[...]\".\n\nRichard Dawkins, the man who coined the term meme in the 1970s, described the concept of faith in his documentary, \"Root of All Evil?\", as \"the process of non-thinking\". In the documentary, he used Bertrand Russell's analogy between a teapot orbiting the sun (something that cannot be observed because the brightness of the sun would obscure it even from the best telescope's view) and the object of one's faith (in this particular case, God) to explain that a highly indeterminate idea can self-replicate freely: \"Everybody in the society had faith in the teapot. Stories of the teapot had been handed down for generations as part of the tradition of society. There are holy books about the teapot.\"\n\nIn \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\", Daniel Dennett argues against the existence of determinate meaning (in this case, of the subjective experience of vision for frogs) via an explanation of their indeterminacy in the chapter entitled \"The Evolution of Meanings\", in the section \"The Quest for Real Meanings\":\n\n\"Unless there were 'meaningless' or 'indeterminate' variation in the triggering conditions of the various frogs' eyes, there could be no raw material [...] for selection for a \"new\" purpose to act upon. The indeterminacy that Fodor (and others) see as a flaw [...] is actually a prediction for such evolution [of \"purpose\"]. The idea that there must be \"something determinate\" that the frog's eye really means – some possibly unknowable proposition in froggish that expresses \"exactly\" what the frog's eye is telling the frog's brain – is just essentialism applied to meaning (or function). Meaning, like function on which it so directly depends, is not something determinate at its birth. [...]\"\n\nDennet argues, controversially, against qualia in \"Consciousness Explained\". Qualia are attacked from several directions at once: he maintains they do not exist (or that they are too ill-defined to play any role in science, or that they are really something else, i.e. behavioral dispositions). They cannot simultaneously have all the properties\nattributed to them by philosophers—incorrigible, ineffable, private, directly accessible and so on. The multiple drafts theory is leveraged to show that facts about qualia are not definite. Critics object that one's own qualia are subjectively quite clear and distinct to \"oneself\".\n\nThe self-replicating nature of memes is a partial explanation of the recurrence of indeterminacies in language and thought. The wide influences of Platonism and Kantianism in Western philosophy can arguably be partially attributed to the indeterminacies of some of their most fundamental concepts (namely, the Idea and the Noumenon, respectively).\n\nFor a given meme to exhibit replication and heritability – that is, for it to be able to make an \"imperfect copy\" of itself which is more likely to share any given trait with its \"parent\" meme than with some random member of the general \"population\" of memes – it must in some way be mutable, since memetic replication occurs by means of human conceptual imitation rather than via the discrete molecular processes that govern genetic replication. (If a statement were to generate copies of itself \"that didn't meaningfully differ from it\", that process of copying would more accurately be described as \"duplication\" than as \"replication\", and it would be incorrect to term these statements \"memes\"; the same would be true if the \"child\" statements did \"not\" noticeably inherit a substantial proportion of their traits from their \"parent\" statements.)\nIn other words, if a meme is defined roughly (and somewhat arbitrarily) as a statement (or as a collection of statements, like Foucault's \"discursive formations\") that inherits \"some\", but not \"all\", of its properties (or elements of its definition) from its \"parent\" memes and which self-replicates, then indeterminacy of definition could be seen as \"advantageous\" to memetic replication, since an absolute rigidity of definition would preclude memetic adaptation.\n\nIt is important to note that indeterminacy in linguistics can arguably partially be defeated by the fact that languages are always changing. However, what the entire language and its collected changes continue to reflect is sometimes still considered to be indeterminate.\n\nPersons of faith argue that faith \"is the basis of all knowledge\". The Wikipedia article on faith states that \"one must assume, believe, or have \"faith\" in the credibility of a person, place, thing, or idea in order to have a basis for knowledge.\" In this way the object of one's faith is similar to Kant's noumenon.\n\nThis would seem to attempt to make direct use of the indeterminacy of the object of one's faith as evidential support of its existence: if the object of one's faith were to be proven to exist (i.e., if it were no longer of indeterminate definition, or if it were no longer unquantifiable, etc.), then faith in that object would no longer be necessary; arguments from authority such as those mentioned above wouldn't either; all that would be needed to prove its existence would be scientific evidence. Thus, if faith is to be considered as a reliable basis for knowledge, persons of faith would seem, in effect, to assert that indeterminacy is not only necessary, but good (see Nassim Taleb).\n\nScience generally attempts to eliminate vague definitions, causally inert entities, and indeterminate properties, via further observation, experimentation, characterization, and explanation. Occam's razor tends to eliminate causally inert entities from functioning models of quantifiable phenomena, but some quantitative models, such as quantum mechanics, actually imply certain indeterminacies, such as the relative indeterminacy of quantum particles' positions to the precision with which their momenta can be measured (and vice versa). (See Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle.)\n\nOne ardent supporter of the possibility of a final unifying theory (and thus, arguably, of the possibility of the end of some current indeterminacies) in physics, Steven Weinberg, stated in an interview with PBS that:\n\n\"Sometimes [...] people say that surely there's no final theory because, after all, every time we've made a step toward unification or toward simplification we always find more and more complexity there. That just means we haven't found it yet. Physicists never thought they had the final theory.\"\n\nThe Wikipedia article on the possibility of such a \"theory of everything\" notes that\n\n\"Other possibilities which may frustrate the explanatory capacity of a TOE may include sensitivity to the boundary conditions of the universe, or the existence of mathematical chaos in its solutions, making its predictions precise, but useless.\"\n\nChaos theory argues that precise prediction of the behavior of complex systems becomes impossible because of the observer's inability to gather all necessary data.\n\nAs yet, it seems entirely possible that there shall never be any \"final theory\" of all phenomena, and that, rather, explanations may instead breed more and more complex and exact explanations of the new phenomena uncovered by current experimentation. In this argument, the \"indeterminacy\" or \"thing in itself\" is the \"final explanation\" that will never be reached; this can be compared to the concept of the limit in calculus, in that quantities may approach, but never reach, a given limit in certain situations.\n\nProponents of a deterministic universe have criticised various applications of the concept of indeterminacy in the sciences; for instance, Einstein once stated that \"God does not play dice\" in a succinct (but now unpopular) argument against the theory of quantum indeterminacy, which states that the actions of particles of extremely low mass or energy are unpredictable because an observer's interaction with them changes either their positions or momenta. (The \"dice\" in Einstein's metaphor refer to the \"probabilities\" that these particles will behave in particular ways, which is how quantum mechanics addressed the problem.)\n\nAt first it might seem that a criticism could be made from a biological standpoint in that an indeterminate idea would \"seem\" not to be beneficial to the species that holds it. A strong counterargument, however, is that not all traits exhibited by living organisms will be seen in the long term as evolutionarily advantageous, given that extinctions occur regularly and that phenotypic traits have often died out altogether – in other words, an indeterminate meme may in the long term demonstrate its evolutionary value to the species that produced it in \"either\" direction; humans are, as yet, the only species known to make use of such concepts.\nIt might also be argued that conceptual vagueness is an inevitability, given the limited capacity of the human nervous systems. We just do not have enough neurons to maintain separate concepts for \"dog with 1,000,000 hairs\", \"dog with 1,000,001 hairs\" and so on. But conceptual vagueness is not metaphysical indeterminacy.\n\nUncertainty and indeterminacy are words for essentially the same concept in both quantum mechanics. Unquantifiability, and undefinability (or indefinability), can also sometimes be synonymous with indeterminacy. In science, indeterminacy can sometimes be interchangeable with unprovability or unpredictability. Also, anything entirely inobservable can be said to be indeterminate in that it cannot be precisely characterized.\n"}

Media literacy, a study that emerged around the 1970s, traditionally focuses on the analysis and the delivery of information through various forms of media. Nowadays, the study of information literacy has been extended to include the study of media literacy in many countries like the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The term \"information and media literacy\" is used by UNESCO to differentiate the combined study from the existing study of information literacy. It is also referred to as information and communication technologies (ICT) in the United States. Educators such as Gregory Ulmer have also defined the field as electracy.\n\nIML is a combination of information literacy and media literacy. The purpose of being information and media literate is to engage in a digital society; one needs to be able to understand, inquire, create, communicate and think critically. It is important to effectively access, organize, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a variety of forms. The transformative nature of IML includes creative works and creating new knowledge; to publish and collaborate responsibly requires ethical, cultural and social understanding.\n\nThe IML learning capacities prepare students to be 21st century literate. According to Jeff Wilhelm (2000), \"technology has everything to do with literacy. And being able to use the latest electronic technologies has everything to do with being literate.\" He supports his argument with J. David Bolter's statement that \"if our students are not reading and composing with various electronic technologies, then they are illiterate. They are not just unprepared for the future; they are illiterate right now, in our current time and context\".\n\nWilhelm's statement is supported by the 2005 Wired World Phase II (YCWW II) survey conducted by the Media Awareness Network of Canada on 5000 Grade 4 – 11 students. The key findings of the survey were:\n\nMarc Prensky (2001) uses the term \"digital native\" to describe people who have been brought up in a digital world. The Internet has been a pervasive element of young people's home lives. 94% of kids reported that they had Internet access at home, and a significant majority (61%) had a high-speed connection.\n\nBy the time kids reach Grade 11, half of them (51 percent) have their own Internet-connected computer, separate and apart from the family computer. The survey also showed that young Canadians are now among the most wired in the world. Contrary to the earlier stereotype of the isolated and awkward computer nerd, today's wired kid is a social kid.\n\nIn general, many students are better networked through the use of technology than most teachers and parents, who may not understand the abilities of technology. Students are no longer limited to desktop computera. They may use mobile technologies to graph mathematical problems, research a question for social studies, text message an expert for information, or send homework to a drop box. Students are accessing information by using MSN, personal Web pages, Weblogs and social networking sites.\n\nMany teachers continue the tradition of teaching of the past 50 years. Traditionally teachers have been the experts sharing their knowledge with children. Technology, and the learning tools it provides access to, forces us to change to being facilitators of learning. We have to change the stereotype of teacher as the expert who delivers information, and students as consumers of information, in order to meet the needs of digital students. Teachers not only need to learn to speak digital, but also to embrace the language of digital natives.\n\nLanguage is generally defined as a system used to communicate in which symbols convey information. Digital natives can communicate fluently with digital devices and convey information in a way that was impossible without digital devices. People born prior to 1988 are sometimes referred to as \"digital immigrants.\" They experience difficulty programming simple devices like a VCR. Digital immigrants do not start pushing buttons to make things work.\n\nLearning a language is best done early in a child's development.\n\nIn acquiring a second language, Hyltenstam (1992) found that around the age of 6 and 7 seemed to be a cut-off point for bilinguals to achieve native-like proficiency. After that age, second language learners could get near-native-like-ness but their language would, while consisting of very few actual errors, have enough errors that would set them apart from the first language group.\n\nKindergarten and grades 1 and 2 are critical to student success as digital natives because not all students have a \"digital\"-rich childhood. Students learning technological skills before Grade 3 can become equivalently bilingual. \"Language-minority students who cannot read and write proficiently in English cannot participate fully in American schools, workplaces, or society. They face limited job opportunities and earning power.\" Speaking \"digital\" is as important as being literate in order to participate fully in North American society and opportunities.\n\nMany students are considered illiterate in media and information for various reasons. They may not see the value of media and information literacy in the 21st-century classroom. Others are not aware of the emergence of the new form of information. Educators need to introduce IML to these students to help them become media and information literate. Very little changes will be made if the educators are not supporting information and media literacy in their own classrooms.\n\nPerformance standards, the foundation to support them, and tools to implement them are readily available. Success will come when there is full implementation and equitable access are established. Shared vision and goals that focus on strategic actions with measurable results are also necessary.\n\nWhen the staff and community, working together, identify and clarify their values, beliefs, assumptions, and perceptions about what they want children to know and be able to do, an important next step will be to discover which of these values and expectations will be achieved. Using the capacity tools to assess IML will allow students, staff and the community to reflect on how well students are meeting learning needs as related to technology.\n\nThe IML Performance standards allow data collection and analysis to evidence that student-learning needs are being met. After assessing student IML, three questions can be asked:\n\n\nTeachers can use classroom assessment for learning to identify areas that might need increased focus and support. Students can use classroom assessment to set learning goals for themselves.\n\nThis integration of technology across the curriculum is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as technical communication tools. In addition, recent learning pedagogy recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology. International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) has been developing a standard IML curriculum for the US and other countries by implementing the National Educational Technology Standards.\n\nIn the UK, IML has been promoted among educators through an information literacy website developed by several organizations that have been involved in the field.\n\nIML is included in the Partnership for the 21st Century program sponsored by the US Department of Education. Special mandates have been provided to Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Individual school districts, such as the Clarkstown Central School District, have also developed their own information literacy curriculum. ISTE has also produced the National Educational Technology Standards for Students, Teachers and Administrators.\n\nIn British Columbia, Canada, the Ministry of Education has de-listed the Information Technology K to 7 IRP as a stand-alone course. It is still expected that all the prescribed learning outcomes continue to be integrated.\n\nThis integration of technology across the curriculum is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as technical communication tools. In addition, recent learning pedagogy recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology. Unfortunately, there has been no clear direction to implement IML.\n\nThe BC Ministry of Education published the Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI in 2005. These standards provide performance standards expectations for Grade 5 to 10; however, they do not provide guidance for other grades, and the expectation for a Grade 5 and Grade 10 student are the same.\n\nIn the Arab region, media and information literacy was largely ignored up until 2011, when the Media Studies Program at the American University of Beirut, the Open Society Foundations and the Arab-US Association for Communication Educators (AUSACE) launched a regional conference themed \"New Directions: Digital and Media Literacy\". The conference attracted significant attention from Arab universities and scholars, who discussed obstacles and needs to advance media literacy in the Arab region, including developing curricula in Arabic, training faculty and promoting the field. \n\nFollowing up on that recommendation, the Media Studies Program at AUB and the Open Society Foundations in collaboration with the Salzburg Academy on Media and Global Change launched in 2013 the first regional initiative to develop, vitalize, and advance media literacy education in the Arab region. The Media and Digital Literacy Academy of Beirut (MDLAB) offered an annual two-week summer training program in addition to working year-round to develop media literacy curricula and programs. The academy is conducted in Arabic and English and brings pioneering international instructors and professionals to teach advanced digital and media literacy concepts to young Arab academics and graduate students from various fields. MDLAB hopes that the participating Arab academics will carry what they learned to their countries and institutions and offers free curricular material in Arabic and English, including media literacy syllabi, lectures, exercises, lesson plans, and multi-media material, to assist and encourage the integration of digital and media literacy into Arab university and school curricula. \n\nIn recognition of MDLAB's accomplishments in advancing media literacy education in the Arab region, the founder of MDLAB received the 2015 UNESCO-UNAOC International Media and Information Literacy Award. \n\nPrior to 2013, only two Arab universities offered media literacy courses: the American University of Beirut (AUB) and the American University of Sharjah (AUS). Three years after the launch of MDLAB, over two dozen Arab universities incorporated media literacy education into their curricula, both as stand-alone courses or as modules injected into their existing media courses. Among the universities who have full-fledged media literacy courses (as of 2015) are Lebanese American University (Lebanon), Birzeit University (Palestine), University of Balamand (Lebanon), Damascus University (Syria), Rafik Hariri University (Lebanon), Notre Dame University (Lebanon), Ahram Canadian University (Egypt), American University of Beirut (Lebanon), American University of Sharjah (UAE), and Al Azm University (Lebanon). The first Arab school to adopt media literacy as part of its strategic plan is the International College (IC) in Lebanon. Efforts to introduce media literacy to the region's other universities and schools continues with the help of other international organizations, such as UNESCO, UNAOC, AREACORE, DAAD, and OSF.\n\nIn Singapore and Hong Kong, information literacy or information technology was listed as a formal curriculum.\n\nOne barrier to learning to read is the lack of books, while a barrier to learning IML is the lack of technology access. Highlighting the value of IML helps to identify existing barriers within school infrastructure, staff development, and support systems. While there is a continued need to work on the foundations to provide a sustainable and equitable access, the biggest obstacle is school climate.\n\nMarc Prensky identifies one barrier as teachers viewing digital devices as distractions: \"Let's admit the real reason that we ban cell phones is that, given the opportunity to use them, students would vote with their attention, just as adults would 'vote with their feet' by leaving the room when a presentation is not compelling.\"\n\nThe mindset of banning new technology, and fearing the bad things that can happen, can affect educational decisions. The decision to ban digital devices impacts students for the rest of their lives.\n\nAny tool that is used poorly or incorrectly can be unsafe. Safety lessons are mandatory in industrial technology and science. Yet safety or ethical lessons are not mandatory to use technology.\n\nNot all decisions in schools are measured by common ground beliefs. One school district in Ontario banned digital devices from their schools. Local schools have been looking at doing the same. These kinds of reactions are often about immediate actions and not about teaching, learning or creating solutions. Many barriers to IML exist.\n\n"}

{"id": "14511671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14511671", "title": "Interpretation (logic)", "text": "Interpretation (logic)\n\nAn interpretation is an assignment of meaning to the symbols of a formal language. Many formal languages used in mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics.\n\nThe most commonly studied formal logics are propositional logic, predicate logic and their modal analogs, and for these there are standard ways of presenting an interpretation. In these contexts an interpretation is a function that provides the extension of symbols and strings of symbols of an object language. For example, an interpretation function could take the predicate \"T\" (for \"tall\") and assign it the extension {\"a\"} (for \"Abraham Lincoln\"). Note that all our interpretation does is assign the extension {a} to the non-logical constant \"T\", and does not make a claim about whether \"T\" is to stand for tall and 'a' for Abraham Lincoln. Nor does logical interpretation have anything to say about logical connectives like 'and', 'or' and 'not'. Though \"we\" may take these symbols to stand for certain things or concepts, this is not determined by the interpretation function.\n\nAn interpretation often (but not always) provides a way to determine the truth values of sentences in a language. If a given interpretation assigns the value True to a sentence or theory, the interpretation is called a model of that sentence or theory.\n\nA formal language consists of a possibly infinite set of \"sentences\" (variously called \"words\" or \"formulas\") built from a fixed set of \"letters\" or \"symbols\". The inventory from which these letters are taken is called the \"alphabet\" over which the language is defined. To distinguish the strings of symbols that are in a formal language from arbitrary strings of symbols, the former are sometimes called \"well-formed formulæ\" (wff). The essential feature of a formal language is that its syntax can be defined without reference to interpretation. For example, we can determine that (\"P\" or \"Q\") is a well-formed formula even without knowing whether it is true or false.\n\nA formal language formula_1 can be defined with the\nalphabet formula_2, and with a word being in formula_1 if it begins with formula_4 and is composed solely of the symbols formula_4 and formula_6.\n\nA possible interpretation of formula_1 could assign the decimal digit '1' to formula_4 and '0' to formula_6. Then formula_10 would denote 101 under this interpretation of formula_1.\n\nIn the specific cases of propositional logic and predicate logic, the formal languages considered have alphabets that are divided into two sets: the logical symbols (logical constants) and the non-logical symbols. The idea behind this terminology is that \"logical\" symbols have the same meaning regardless of the subject matter being studied, while \"non-logical\" symbols change in meaning depending on the area of investigation.\n\nLogical constants are always given the same meaning by every interpretation of the standard kind, so that only the meanings of the non-logical symbols are changed. Logical constants include quantifier symbols ∀ (\"all\") and ∃ (\"some\"), symbols for logical connectives ∧ (\"and\"), ∨ (\"or\"), ¬ (\"not\"), parentheses and other grouping symbols, and (in many treatments) the equality symbol =.\n\nMany of the commonly studied interpretations associate each sentence in a formal language with a single truth value, either True or False. These interpretations are called \"truth functional\"; they include the usual interpretations of propositional and first-order logic. The sentences that are made true by a particular assignment are said to be \"satisfied\" by that assignment.\n\nNo sentence can be made both true and false by the same interpretation, but it is possible that the truth value of the same sentence can be different under different interpretations. A sentence is \"consistent\" if it is true under at least one interpretation; otherwise it is \"inconsistent\". A sentence φ is said to be \"logically valid\" if it is satisfied by every interpretation (if φ is satisfied by every interpretation that satisfies ψ then φ is said to be a \"logical consequence\" of ψ).\n\nSome of the logical symbols of a language (other than quantifiers) are truth-functional connectives that represent truth functions — functions that take truth values as arguments and return truth values as outputs (in other words, these are operations on truth values of sentences).\n\nThe truth-functional connectives enable compound sentences to be built up from simpler sentences. In this way, the truth value of the compound sentence is defined as a certain truth function of the truth values of the simpler sentences. The connectives are usually taken to be logical constants, meaning that the meaning of the connectives is always the same, independent of what interpretations are given to the other symbols in a formula.\n\nThis is how we define logical connectives in propositional logic:\n\nSo under a given interpretation of all the sentence letters Φ and Ψ (i.e., after assigning a truth-value to each sentence letter), we can determine the truth-values of all formulas that have them as constituents, as a function of the logical connectives. The following table shows how this kind of thing looks. The first two columns show the truth-values of the sentence letters as determined by the four possible interpretations. The other columns show the truth-values of formulas built from these sentence letters, with truth-values determined recursively.\n\nNow it is easier to see what makes a formula logically valid. Take the formula \"F\": (Φ ∨ ¬Φ). If our interpretation function makes Φ True, then ¬Φ is made False by the negation connective. Since the disjunct Φ of \"F\" is True under that interpretation, \"F\" is True. Now the only other possible interpretation of Φ makes it False, and if so, ¬Φ is made True by the negation function. That would make \"F\" True again, since one of \"F\"s disjuncts, ¬Φ, would be true under this interpretation. Since these two interpretations for \"F\" are the only possible logical interpretations, and since \"F\" comes out True for both, we say that it is logically valid or tautologous.\n\nAn \"interpretation of a theory\" is the relationship between a theory and some subject matter when there is a many-to-one correspondence between certain elementary statements of the theory, and certain statements related to the subject matter. If every elementary statement in the theory has a correspondent it is called a \"full interpretation\", otherwise it is called a \"partial interpretation\".\n\nThe formal language for propositional logic consists of formulas built up from propositional symbols (also called sentential symbols, sentential variables, and propositional variables) and logical connectives. The only non-logical symbols in a formal language for propositional logic are the propositional symbols, which are often denoted by capital letters. To make the formal language precise, a specific set of propositional symbols must be fixed.\n\nThe standard kind of interpretation in this setting is a function that maps each propositional symbol to one of the truth values true and false. This function is known as a \"truth assignment\" or \"valuation\" function. In many presentations, it is literally a truth value that is assigned, but some presentations assign truthbearers instead.\n\nFor a language with \"n\" distinct propositional variables there are 2 distinct possible interpretations. For any particular variable \"a\", for example, there are 2=2 possible interpretations: 1) \"a\" is assigned T, or 2) \"a\" is assigned F. For the pair \"a\", \"b\" there are 2=4 possible interpretations: 1) both are assigned T, 2) both are assigned F, 3) \"a\" is assigned T and \"b\" is assigned F, or 4) \"a\" is assigned F and \"b\" is assigned T.\n\nGiven any truth assignment for a set of propositional symbols, there is a unique extension to an interpretation for all the propositional formulas built up from those variables. This extended interpretation is defined inductively, using the truth-table definitions of the logical connectives discussed above.\n\nUnlike propositional logic, where every language is the same apart from a choice of a different set of propositional variables, there are many different first-order languages. Each first-order language is defined by a signature. The signature consists of a set of non-logical symbols and an identification of each of these symbols as a constant symbol, a function symbol, or a predicate symbol. In the case of function and predicate symbols, a natural number arity is also assigned. The alphabet for the formal language consists of logical constants, the equality relation symbol =, all the symbols from the signature, and an additional infinite set of symbols known as variables.\n\nFor example, in the language of rings, there are constant symbols 0 and 1, two binary function symbols + and ·, and no binary relation symbols. (Here the equality relation is taken as a logical constant.)\n\nAgain, we might define a first-order language L, as consisting of individual symbols a, b, and c; predicate symbols F, G, H, I and J; variables x, y, z; no function letters; no sentential symbols.\n\nGiven a signature σ, the corresponding formal language is known as the set of σ-formulas. Each σ-formula is built up out of atomic formulas by means of logical connectives; atomic formulas are built from terms using predicate symbols. The formal definition of the set of σ-formulas proceeds in the other direction: first, terms are assembled from the constant and function symbols together with the variables. Then, terms can be combined into an atomic formula using a predicate symbol (relation symbol) from the signature or the special predicate symbol \"=\" for equality (see the section \"Interpreting equality\" below). Finally, the formulas of the language are assembled from atomic formulas using the logical connectives and quantifiers.\n\nTo ascribe meaning to all sentences of a first-order language, the following information is needed.\nAn object carrying this information is known as a structure ( signature σ), or σ-structure, or \"L\"-structure, or as a \"model\".\n\nThe information specified in the interpretation provides enough information to give a truth value to any atomic formula, after each of its free variables, if any, has been replaced by an element of the domain. The truth value of an arbitrary sentence is then defined inductively using the T-schema, which is a definition of first-order semantics developed by Alfred Tarski. The T-schema interprets the logical connectives using truth tables, as discussed above. Thus, for example, is satisfied if and only if both φ and ψ are satisfied.\n\nThis leaves the issue of how to interpret formulas of the form and . The domain of discourse forms the range for these quantifiers. The idea is that the sentence is true under an interpretation exactly when every substitution instance of φ(\"x\"), where \"x\" is replaced by some element of the domain, is satisfied. The formula is satisfied if there is at least one element \"d\" of the domain such that φ(\"d\") is satisfied.\n\nStrictly speaking, a substitution instance such as the formula φ(\"d\") mentioned above is not a formula in the original formal language of φ, because \"d\" is an element of the domain. There are two ways of handling this technical issue. The first is to pass to a larger language in which each element of the domain is named by a constant symbol. The second is to add to the interpretation a function that assigns each variable to an element of the domain. Then the T-schema can quantify over variations of the original interpretation in which this variable assignment function is changed, instead of quantifying over substitution instances.\n\nSome authors also admit propositional variables in first-order logic, which must then also be interpreted. A propositional variable can stand on its own as an atomic formula. The interpretation of a propositional variable is one of the two truth values \"true\" and \"false.\"\n\nBecause the first-order interpretations described here are defined in set theory, they do not associate each predicate symbol with a property(or relation), but rather with the extension of that property (or relation). In other words, these first-order interpretations are extensional not intensional.\n\nAn example of interpretation formula_12 of the language L described above is as follows.\n\nIn the interpretation formula_12 of L:\n\nAs stated above, a first-order interpretation is usually required to specify a nonempty set as the domain of discourse. The reason for this requirement is to guarantee that equivalences such as\nwhere \"x\" is not a free variable of φ, are logically valid. This equivalence holds in every interpretation with a nonempty domain, but does not always hold when empty domains are permitted. For example, the equivalence\nfails in any structure with an empty domain. Thus the proof theory of first-order logic becomes more complicated when empty structures are permitted. However, the gain in allowing them is negligible, as both the intended interpretations and the interesting interpretations of the theories people study have non-empty domains.\n\nEmpty relations do not cause any problem for first-order interpretations, because there is no similar notion of passing a relation symbol across a logical connective, enlarging its scope in the process. Thus it is acceptable for relation symbols to be interpreted as being identically false. However, the interpretation of a function symbol must always assign a well-defined and total function to the symbol.\n\nThe equality relation is often treated specially in first order logic and other predicate logics. There are two general approaches.\n\nThe first approach is to treat equality as no different than any other binary relation. In this case, if an equality symbol is included in the signature, it is usually necessary to add various axioms about equality to axiom systems (for example, the substitution axiom saying that if \"a\" = \"b\" and \"R\"(\"a\") holds then \"R\"(\"b\") holds as well). This approach to equality is most useful when studying signatures that do not include the equality relation, such as the signature for set theory or the signature for second-order arithmetic in which there is only an equality relation for numbers, but not an equality relation for set of numbers.\n\nThe second approach is to treat the equality relation symbol as a logical constant that must be interpreted by the real equality relation in any interpretation. An interpretation that interprets equality this way is known as a \"normal model\", so this second approach is the same as only studying interpretations that happen to be normal models. The advantage of this approach is that the axioms related to equality are automatically satisfied by every normal model, and so they do not need to be explicitly included in first-order theories when equality is treated this way. This second approach is sometimes called \"first order logic with equality\", but many authors adopt it for the general study of first-order logic without comment.\n\nThere are a few other reasons to restrict study of first-order logic to normal models. First, it is known that any first-order interpretation in which equality is interpreted by an equivalence relation and satisfies the substitution axioms for equality can be cut down to an elementarily equivalent interpretation on a subset of the original domain. Thus there is little additional generality in studying non-normal models. Second, if non-normal models are considered, then every consistent theory has an infinite model; this affects the statements of results such as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, which are usually stated under the assumption that only normal models are considered.\n\nA generalization of first order logic considers languages with more than one \"sort\" of variables. The idea is different sorts of variables represent different types of objects. Every sort of variable can be quantified; thus an interpretation for a many-sorted language has a separate domain for each of the sorts of variables to range over (there is an infinite collection of variables of each of the different sorts). Function and relation symbols, in addition to having arities, are specified so that each of their arguments must come from a certain sort.\n\nOne example of many-sorted logic is for planar Euclidean geometry. There are two sorts; points and lines. There is an equality relation symbol for points, an equality relation symbol for lines, and a binary incidence relation \"E\" which takes one point variable and one line variable. The intended interpretation of this language has the point variables range over all points on the Euclidean plane, the line variable range over all lines on the plane, and the incidence relation \"E\"(\"p\",\"l\") holds if and only if point \"p\" is on line \"l\".\n\nA formal language for higher-order predicate logic looks much the same as a formal language for first-order logic. The difference is that there are now many different types of variables. Some variables correspond to elements of the domain, as in first-order logic. Other variables correspond to objects of higher type: subsets of the domain, functions from the domain, functions that take a subset of the domain and return a function from the domain to subsets of the domain, etc. All of these types of variables can be quantified.\n\nThere are two kinds of interpretations commonly employed for higher-order logic. \"Full semantics\" require that, once the domain of discourse is satisfied, the higher-order variables range over all possible elements of the correct type (all subsets of the domain, all functions from the domain to itself, etc.). Thus the specification of a full interpretation is the same as the specification of a first-order interpretation. \"Henkin semantics\", which are essentially multi-sorted first-order semantics, require the interpretation to specify a separate domain for each type of higher-order variable to range over. Thus an interpretation in Henkin semantics includes a domain \"D\", a collection of subsets of \"D\", a collection of functions from \"D\" to \"D\", etc. The relationship between these two semantics is an important topic in higher order logic.\n\nThe interpretations of propositional logic and predicate logic described above are not the only possible interpretations. In particular, there are other types of interpretations that are used in the study of non-classical logic (such as intuitionistic logic), and in the study of modal logic.\n\nInterpretations used to study non-classical logic include topological models, Boolean-valued models, and Kripke models. Modal logic is also studied using Kripke models.\n\nMany formal languages are associated with a particular interpretation that is used to motivate them. For example, the first-order signature for set theory includes only one binary relation, ∈, which is intended to represent set membership, and the domain of discourse in a first-order theory of the natural numbers is intended to be the set of natural numbers.\n\nThe intended interpretation is called the \"standard model\" (a term introduced by Abraham Robinson in 1960). In the context of Peano arithmetic, it consists of the natural numbers with their ordinary arithmetical operations. All models that are isomorphic to the one just given are also called standard; these models all satisfy the Peano axioms. There are also non-standard models of the (first-order version of the) Peano axioms, which contain elements not correlated with any natural number.\n\nWhile the intended interpretation can have no explicit indication in the strictly formal syntactical rules, it naturally affects the choice of the formation and transformation rules of the syntactical system. For example, primitive signs must permit expression of the concepts to be modeled; sentential formulas are chosen so that their counterparts in the intended interpretation are meaningful declarative sentences; primitive sentences need to come out as true sentences in the interpretation; rules of inference must be such that, if the sentence formula_16 is directly derivable from a sentence formula_17, then formula_18 turns out to be a true sentence, with meaning implication, as usual. These requirements ensure that all provable sentences also come out to be true.\n\nMost formal systems have many more models than they were intended to have (the existence of non-standard models is an example). When we speak about 'models' in empirical sciences, we mean, if we want reality to be a model of our science, to speak about an \"intended model\". A model in the empirical sciences is an \"intended factually-true descriptive interpretation\" (or in other contexts: a non-intended arbitrary interpretation used to clarify such an intended factually-true descriptive interpretation.) All models are interpretations that have the same domain of discourse as the intended one, but other assignments for non-logical constants.\n\nGiven a simple formal system (we shall call this one formula_19) whose alphabet α consists only of three symbols formula_20 and whose formation rule for formulas is:\n\nThe single axiom schema of formula_19 is:\n\nA formal proof can be constructed as follows:\n\nIn this example the theorem produced \" formula_30 \" can be interpreted as meaning \"One plus three equals four.\" A different interpretation would be to read it backwards as \"Four minus three equals one.\"\n\nThere are other uses of the term \"interpretation\" that are commonly used, which do not refer to the assignment of meanings to formal languages.\n\nIn model theory, a structure \"A\" is said to interpret a structure \"B\" if there is a definable subset \"D\" of \"A\", and definable relations and functions on \"D\", such that \"B\" is isomorphic to the structure with domain \"D\" and these functions and relations. In some settings, it is not the domain \"D\" that is used, but rather \"D\" modulo an equivalence relation definable in \"A\". For additional information, see Interpretation (model theory).\n\nA theory \"T\" is said to interpret another theory \"S\" if there is a finite extension by definitions \"T\"′ of \"T\" such that \"S\" is contained in \"T\"′.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "333528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333528", "title": "Japanese language and computers", "text": "Japanese language and computers\n\nIn relation to the Japanese language and computers many adaptation issues arise, some unique to Japanese and others common to languages which have a very large number of characters. The number of characters needed in order to write English is very small, and thus it is possible to use only one byte to encode one English character. However, the number of characters in Japanese is much more than 256, and hence Japanese cannot be encoded using only one byte, and Japanese is thus encoded using two or more bytes, in a so-called \"double byte\" or \"multi-byte\" encoding. Some problems relate to transliteration and romanization, some to character encoding, and some to the input of Japanese text.\n\nThere are several standard methods to encode Japanese characters for use on a computer, including JIS, Shift-JIS, EUC, and Unicode. While mapping the set of kana is a simple matter, kanji has proven more difficult. Despite efforts, none of the encoding schemes have become the de facto standard, and multiple encoding standards are still in use today.\n\nFor example, most Japanese emails are in ISO-2022-JP (\"JIS encoding\") and web pages in Shift-JIS and yet mobile phones in Japan usually use some form of Extended Unix Code. If a program fails to determine the encoding scheme employed, it can cause and thus unreadable text on computers.\n\nThe first encoding to become widely used was JIS X 0201, which is a single-byte encoding that only covers standard 7-bit ASCII characters with half-width katakana extensions. This was widely used in systems that were neither powerful enough nor had the storage to handle kanji (including old embedded equipment such as cash registers). This means that only katakana, not kanji, was supported using this technique. Some embedded displays still have this limitation.\n\nThe development of kanji encodings was the beginning of the split. Shift JIS supports kanji and was developed to be completely backward compatible with JIS X 0201, and thus is in much embedded electronic equipment. \n\nHowever, Shift JIS has the unfortunate property that it often breaks any parser (software that reads the coded text) that is not specifically designed to handle it. For example, a text search method can get false hits if it is not designed for Shift JIS. EUC, on the other hand, is handled much better by parsers that have been written for 7-bit ASCII (and thus EUC encodings are used on UNIX, where much of the file-handling code was historically only written for English encodings). But EUC is not backwards compatible with JIS X 0201, the first main Japanese encoding. Further complications arise because the original Internet e-mail standards only support 7-bit transfer protocols. Thus (\"ISO-2022-JP\", often simply called JIS encoding) was developed for sending and receiving e-mails.\n\nIn character set standards such as JIS, not all required characters are included, so gaiji ( \"external characters\") are sometimes used to supplement the character set. Gaiji may come in the form of external font packs, where normal characters have been replaced with new characters, or the new characters have been added to unused character positions. However, gaiji are not practical in Internet environments since the font set must be transferred with text to use the gaiji. As a result, such characters are written with similar or simpler characters in place, or the text may need to be encoded using a larger character set (such as Unicode) that supports the required character.\n\nUnicode was intended to solve all encoding problems over all languages. The UTF-8 encoding used to encode Unicode in web pages does not have the disadvantages that Shift-JIS has. Unicode is supported by international software, and it eliminates the need for gaiji. There are still controversies, however. For Japanese, the kanji characters have been unified with Chinese; that is, a character considered to be the same in both Japanese and Chinese is given a single number, even if the appearance is actually somewhat different, with the precise appearance left to the use of a locale-appropriate font. This process, called Han unification, has caused controversy. The previous encodings in Japan, Taiwan Area, Mainland China and Korea have only handled one language and Unicode should handle all. The handling of Kanji/Chinese have however been designed by a committee composed of representatives from all four countries/areas. Unicode is slowly growing because it is better supported by software from outside Japan, but still (as of 2011) most web pages in Japanese use Shift-JIS. The Japanese Wikipedia uses Unicode.\n\nWritten Japanese uses several different scripts: kanji (Chinese characters), 2 sets of \"kana\" (phonetic syllabaries) and roman letters. While kana and roman letters can be typed directly into a computer, entering kanji is a more complicated process as there are far more kanji than there are keys on most keyboards. To input kanji on modern computers, the reading of kanji is usually entered first, then an input method editor (IME), also sometimes known as a front-end processor, shows a list of candidate kanji that are a phonetic match, and allows the user to choose the correct kanji. More-advanced IMEs work not by word but by phrase, thus increasing the likelihood of getting the desired characters as the first option presented. Kanji readings inputs can be either via romanization (\"rōmaji nyūryoku,\" ) or direct kana input (\"kana nyūryoku,\" ). Romaji input is more common on PCs and other full-size keyboards (although direct input is also widely supported), whereas direct kana input is typically used on mobile phones and similar devices – each of the 10 digits (1–9,0) corresponds to one of the 10 columns in the gojūon table of kana, and multiple presses select the row.\n\nThere are two main systems for the romanization of Japanese, known as \"Kunrei-shiki\" and \"Hepburn\"; in practice, \"keyboard romaji\" (also known as \"wāpuro rōmaji\" or \"word processor romaji\") generally allows a loose combination of both. IME implementations may even handle keys for letters unused in any romanization scheme, such as \"L\", converting them to the most appropriate equivalent. With kana input, each key on the keyboard directly corresponds to one kana. The JIS keyboard system is the national standard, but there are alternatives, like the thumb-shift keyboard, commonly used among professional typists.\n\nJapanese can be written in two directions. \"Yokogaki\" style writes left-to-right, top-to-bottom, as with English. \"Tategaki\" style writes first top-to-bottom, and then moves right-to-left.\n\nAt present, handling of downward text is incomplete. For example, HTML has no support for \"tategaki\" and Japanese users must use HTML tables to simulate it. However, CSS level 3 includes a property \"writing-mode\" which can render \"tategaki\" when given the value \"vertical-rl\" (i.e. top to bottom, right to left). Word processors and DTP software have more complete support for it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16158579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16158579", "title": "Language policy in Latvia", "text": "Language policy in Latvia\n\nArticles 4 and 114 of the Constitution of Latvia form the foundation for language policy in Latvia, declaring Latvian to be the official state language and affirming the rights of ethnic minorities to preserve and develop their languages. Latgalian and the Livonian language, in addition to Latvian, are considered indigenous and all other languages foreign, including Russian (the first language for more than one third of the population). Other significant minority foreign languages include Belarusian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Polish, and Romani.\n\nThe preamble to the State Language Law includes as its goals \"the integration of national minorities into Latvian society while respecting their right to use their mother tongue or any other language; [and] the increase of the influence of the Latvian language in the cultural environment of Latvia by promoting a faster integration of society.\"\n\nThe official language (\"valsts valoda\", literally \"state language\") in Latvia is Latvian; this status has been explicitly defined since 1988. In 1992, amendments to the 1989 Law on Languages strengthened the position of Latvian. All other languages, except the extinct Livonian language, are defined as foreign languages in Section 5 of the State Language Law of 1999.\n\nSince 1998, the official status of the Latvian language has been written into the Constitution (Article 4); and since 2002, MPs have been asked to promise to strengthen Latvian as the only official language in order to take their seats (Article 18). In the Constitution's chapter on human rights, rights to get answers from authorities in Latvian are specified since 2002 (Article 104). The current State Language Law was not amended since its adoption in 1999 (as at 2017).\n\nIn 1995, Latvia signed, and in 2005 ratified the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. When ratifying it, the Latvian Saeima (Parliament) made two declarations (worded as reservations) limiting the implementation of Articles 10 and 11. As at 2008, Latvia did not plan to sign the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.\n\nLanguage policy is implemented by a number of institutions: the State Language Commission (under the President) prepares proposals in this field; the State Language Centre (under the Ministry of Justice) executes control, imposes fines for administrative violations and translates documents of international significance, the Latvian Language Agency (under the Ministry of Education and Science) provides consultations and opportunities for learning the Latvian language, analyses the language situation.\n\nSince the State Language Law came into force in 2000, submitting documents to government (local included) and state public enterprises is allowed in Latvian only, except in cases specially defined in the law (emergency services, foreign residents etc.), according to Section 10. From 1992–2000, authorities had to accept documents in Russian, German and English, too, and were allowed to answer in the language of application.\n\nBefore the losses of the Latvian government in the cases \"Podkolzina v. Latvia\" (ECHR) and \"Ignatāne v. Latvia\" (UN HRC), a certain level of command in Latvian was asked for eligibility to Parliament and local councils. In practice, this had led to re-examinations of various candidates, at least sometimes unexpected, which prevented Ignatāne and Podkolzina (representatives of the Equal Rights party in the 1997 local and 1998 parliamentary elections) from participation. As of 2011, candidates do not need to prove language proficiency, but elected members of Saeima and local councilors can be deprived of mandate for insufficient command of Latvian.\n\nNames and surnames in Latvian-issued documents are formed in Latvianized form, according to Section 19. These provisions were subject in ECHR cases \"Kuhareca v. Latvia\" and \"Mencena v. Latvia\" (both declared inadmissible in 2004), since the Latvian Constitutional Court had found them constitutional in 2001. An analogous application was submitted to UN HRC in 2007 and won by the applicant on grounds of privacy (\"Raihman v. Latvia\").\n\nToponyms are formed in Latvian language only (on the Livonian coast - in Livonian as well), according to Section 18 of the State Language Law.\n\nThe Electronic Mass Media Law orders to use only Latvian language in the first channels of public radio and television, and basically Latvian language in their second channels (Section 66).\nThe government of Latvia in its policy documents refers to Latvia as a (democratic) nation state, constructing societal integration on the basis of the Latvian language, while respecting the diversity of languages. Unity block, comprising most of the governing coalition as of 2011, also describes Latvia as a nation state. The idea of the nation state, where \"language = nation\", is seen as the core and main engine of the language policy of the Latvian state. Critics draw parallels between measures of the Latvian government and the assimilation of linguistic minorities in various countries.\n\nOne critic, James Hughes, Reader in Comparative Politics at the London School of Economics and Political Science, has pointed out that Russian-speakers in Latvia constitute one of the largest linguistic minorities in Europe, therefore he considers Latvia's language laws to be denying Russophones their language rights, and thus they are contrary to international practice in the field of minority rights. Nataliya Pulina in \"Moskovskiye Novosti\" asserts that Latvia's Russophones are by percentage actually the largest linguistic minority in the EU whose language has no official status. Regarding the demographic arguments for Russian language rights in Latvia, the BBC's Angus Roxburgh reported in 2005:\nAmong the political parties, ForHRUL offers in its programme to grant co-official status to Russian, Latgalian and possibly others languages in municipalities where these are native for more than 20% of population. In a draft of its political programme, HC offers to grant co-official status to Latgalian and Russian in printed media, public sphere and education (for Russian, in communication with authorities, as well), stressing its support for the sole state language. Both these parties are in permanent opposition on the state level.\n\nOn the other hand, TB/LNNK, a member of governing coalition between 2006 and 2010, is demanding that Latvian be made the sole language of instruction, even in minority schools.\n\nAccording to research conducted by the Baltic Institute of Social Sciences in 2004, the majority (77%) of ethnic Latvians opposed (56%) or mostly opposed (21%) granting Russian status as a second official language, while the majority (87%) of Russians supported (59%) or mostly supported (28%) such status, while a majority (75%) of other ethnicities also supported (40%) or rather supported (35%) such status.\n\nThe Law on Electronic Media prescribes that national and regional electronic media need to broadcast at least 65 % in Latvian language (section 32). Besides, films aired in any channel should be dubbed in Latvian or to have original soundtrack and Latvian subtitles; TV broadcasts in languages other than Latvian, except news, live events, language learning broadcasts and retranslated content, must be subtitled in Latvian.(Section 28). The same concerns films shown in cinemas, according to Section 17 of State Language Law. Until a judgement of the Constitutional Court upon request of 24 ForHRUL MPs (delivered in 2003), broadcasting in minority languages was limited for private TV and radio (originally within 30%, since 1998 within 25%).\n\nAccording to Section 6 of State Language Law, levels of skills in Latvian are defined for various professions, which concern legitimate public interest. Totally, there are six levels and two lists of professions (longer for public sector and shorter for private sector), classified by needed level. For those who didn't get education in Latvian and aren't disabled, an examination is needed to define their skills in Latvian, to work in these professions. Those who fail to show needed level during inspections, can be fined. Labour market shows high demand for skills in Latvian, Russian and English languages.\n\nAccording to Section 11 of State Language Law, organizers of public events have to provide in Latvian information, which concerns legitimate public interest (defined in Section 2 — public safety, health care \"et cetera\"). The same affects posters, billboards and signboards, according to Section 21. Previously, according to the Law of languages as amended in 1992 (Section 5), organizers of any public event had to provide translation into Latvian in their conferences. An exemption had existed for organizations of ethnic minorities and religious organizations; 1997 Law on Meetings, Processions and Pickets has foreseen free choice of language in meetings, pickets and processions, too (Section 19).\n\nSince the beginning of the 1990s, some Polish language schools were created besides the existing schools with Latvian and Russian language of instruction. Certain schools (e.g., Riga Dubnov Jewish Secondary school, founded in 1989, and Riga Ukrainian Secondary School, founded in 1991, which had originally used Ukrainian as language of instruction, but switched to Latvian in 1993/1994) now include in their curriculum lessons in respective minority languages. The number of Russian schools is decreasing, partly due to natural demographic decline and partly due to emigration, as the following table demonstrates, with some schools with apparent viability closed. \nAs at 2007, there was also increasing number of minority children attending Latvian-language schools.\n\nAccording to Education law, as adopted in 1998, the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Forms 10-12) had to be only Latvian since 2004. This has mostly affected Russian schools, some existing in Latvia without interruption since at least 1789. After wide protests in 2003 and 2004, the law was amended allowing to teach up to 40% of curricula in minority languages (Transition Rules) and allowing orphans to continue their education not only in Latvian, but also in the language he or she began it (Section 56).\n\nIn 2005, one judgment of the Constitutional Court (upon request of ForHRUL, NHP and LSP MPs) has declared unconstitutional the ban of public co-funding for private minority schools, another has declared the proportion \"60+:40\" constitutional.\n\nAccording to the same 1998 Education Law, the tertiary education in public colleges and universities has to be in Latvian only since 1999 (it had to be basically in Latvian since the second year, according to 1992 Law on Languages, Section 11). In fact, there still exist programmes with education in English for foreigners (Riga Technical University) or according to special laws (Riga Graduate School of Law). There is a demand for tertiary education in Russian, too: it is used, for example, at the Baltic International Academy.\n\nIn 2018, President Raimonds Vejonis promulgated the bill banning use of Russian as the language of instruction also at private universities in Latvia. The Latvian parliament passed the legislation on June 21.\n\nIn the medieval Livonian Confederation, Latin and German were the dominant languages of education and administration. German kept this position under subsequent periods of rule by Poland, Sweden and, initially, under the Russian Empire. German was the language of instruction in the first institution of tertiary education on the territory of Latvia (Riga Polytechnicum, founded in 1862). In Latgale, the Polish language gained some influence, beginning from the 16th century.\n\nFrom the mid-19th century, Latvian started to rise in influence. At the end of the 19th century, tsar Alexander III instigated a policy of Russification in non-Russian areas of the Empire. As a result, language of administration, that of Riga Polytechnicum and most schools was changed from German to Russian, and some German toponyms in eastern Latvia were Russianized (e.g., Dünaburg became Dvinsk). After the 1905 revolution, possibilities for schooling in Latvian increased.\n\nThe pro-Bolshevik revolutionary soviet, Iskolat, declared on 4 January 1918 that Latvian should be the primary language of administration on the territory of Latvia.\n\nUnder the short-lived Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic in 1919, Latgalian enjoyed co-equal status with both Latvian and Russian as an official language of administration.\n\nThe Republic of Latvia (founded in 1918) was initially liberal in its language policy: while Latvianizing toponyms (e.g., Dvinsk became Daugavpils), it also allowed Russian and German languages to be used in Parliament along Latvian, acknowledged minorities' rights to learn in schools in their mother tongues and, despite switching public tertiary education to Latvian, did not forbid private post-secondary education in minority languages. State had acknowledged public use of Latgalian. After the 1934 Ulmanis coup d'état the policy changed, and many minority high schools were closed. Particularly hard hit were the Belarusian primary schools, all but 5 of which were closed. Belarusian schoolteachers and other intellectuals in Latvia were suspected of having a pro-Soviet agenda harmful to national security.\n\nDuring World War II, Latvia's German community was mostly moved to Germany, and the Jewish community was destroyed (hit first by the Stalinist deportations in 1941, then by the Holocaust). Due to that, these groups' respective schools disappeared.\n\nIn the postwar Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, the proportion of Latvian-speaking population decreased due to large losses in World War II and mass deportation, while the Russian-speaking population increased due to the presence of military forces and mass immigration of labour to implement the Soviet Union's industrialization policy (still, due to low birth rate, the population of Latvia had grown by 27.4% between 1959 and 1989 censuses, while that of the whole USSR — by 36.8%). Consequently, the use of Russian increased and it started to dominate in the areas integrated on a federal level (state security, railway etc.). As concerns tertiary education, in some faculties, the language of instruction was only Latvian, in some, only Russian; in some there were two language \"streams\". Under Stalinism, Polish schools were closed and after Arvīds Pelše's 1959 victory over the \"national communists\" (Eduards Berklavs \"et al.\"), the last Latgalian newspaper was closed.\n\nLatvian was declared the state language of the Latvian SSR by a decree of the republican Supreme Soviet on 6 October 1988. Nevertheless, citizens could still choose to communicate with state authorities in Russian, and all correspondence with the USSR's federal bodies was to be in Russian.\n\nIn the first post-Soviet census in 2000, 1,311,093 persons in Latvia reported Latvian as their mother tongue, representing the vast majority of the estimated 1.5 million Latvian speakers worldwide.\n\nIn the year 2000, Livonian was a moribund language spoken by some 35 people, of whom only 10 were fluent. In the first decade of the 21st century, it was estimated that Livonian was the native tongue of 4 people in Latvia, all of whom were older than 70.\nGrizelda Kristiņa, the last native speaker of Livonian, died on June 2, 2013.\n\nLatvia's current territory is a close approximation to the range of Latvian habitation since the Latvian people emerged. As such, Latvian and Livonian are native only to Latvia.\n\nIn the 2000 census, 891,451 respondents listed Russian as their mother tongue, representing 37.5% of the total population, whereas Latvian was recorded as the mother tongue for 58.2%. Latvian was spoken as a second language by 20.8% of the population, and 43.7% spoke Russian as a second language. At that time, in age groups up to 10–14 years, a greater proportion of Russians could speak Latvian than ethnic Latvians could speak Russian. In age groups over 15 years, however, more Latvians expressed proficiency in Russian than vice versa. In total, 71% of ethnic Latvians said they could speak Russian, and 52% of Russians could speak Latvian.\n\nOf all districts and cities in Latvia, the highest command of Latvian was in Talsi District (98.8%), while the lowest was in Daugavpils (41.4%). In Daugavpils was also the highest percentage of people speaking Russian (95.7%), and in Kuldīga District the lowest (57.6%). There was a similar breakdown with regards to mother tongue: 94.6% in Talsi District and for 11.6% in Daugavpils for Latvian, 80.4% in Daugavpils and for 3.0% in Talsi District for Russian.\n\nIn the previous 1989 census, conducted while Latvia was still part of the USSR, Latvian was reported as the native language for 52.0% of the population, Russian for 42.1%; 62.4% of population could speak Latvian, and 81.6% could speak Russian.\n\nIt should be noted that Latgalian was not considered a language separate from Latvian in any census, whether during the Soviet period, or since the restoration of independence. Therefore, no specific data on the number of its native speakers were available until the 2011 census. Then, 8.8. % of the population indicated they use Latgalian, described as a variety of Latvian.\nOther than native speakers of Latvian and Russian, the numbers of speakers of different mother tongues recorded in the 2000 census were:\n\nIn 1999, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe High Commissioner on National Minorities found Latvia's new language law to be \"essentially in conformity with Latvia's international obligations and commitments\". In 2000, he stated that the government regulations were \"essentially in conformity with both the Law and Latvia's international obligations\", but that \"specific matters will have to be reviewed upon Latvia's anticipated ratification of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities\". The ratification took place in 2005.\n\nInternational organizations have recommended to Latvia on various occasions to:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22625115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22625115", "title": "Mirror theory", "text": "Mirror theory\n\nIn theoretical linguistics, mirror theory refers to a particular approach to the architecture of the language organ developed by Michael Brody, who claims his theory to be purely representational (unlike most of the current generative theories that are either derivational or combining derivation and representation).\n\nThere are several important respects in which mirror theory is different from more traditional theories of phrase structure in generative linguistics such as X-bar theory or bare phrase structure. The first principle, called \"mirror\", states that the syntactic relation 'X complement of Y' is identical to an inverse-order morphological relation 'X specifier of Y'. Thus, the notions of 'syntactic' and 'morphological' specifiers and complements are crucial for the linearisation of syntactic structure and its mapping to the morphological component.\n\nWhen the structure is pronounced, it linearises in the following order: specifiers precede heads, and heads precede their complements. So when a sentence like that in the diagram below is pronounced, 'John' precedes the V-v-T chain, which in turn precedes 'Mary', the latter being the specifier of V. However, English is a VO language, which means that the morphological word 'loves' associated with the V-v-T chain is spelled in v, deriving the correct word order.\n\nAdger, D., Harbour, D., and Watkins, L. \"Mirrors and Microparameters: Phrase Structure beyond Free Word Order\" \n\nBrody, M. \"Mirror Theory\"\n\nSimilar to mirror theory is the Mirror Principle of the Distributed Morphology framework that deals primarily with issues of affix ordering. In the model of Distributed Morphology, the underlying assumption is such that all morphemes in a morphologically complex word are effectually \"leaves\" on a syntactic tree. These syntactic \"leaves\" undergo operations that lead to the build-up of words, meaning that word-formation is subject to the same principles that govern the syntactic build-up of sentences. The mirror principle surmises that a complex word is generated in a derivation with the root of a given word merging lower than all subsequent suffixes that attach to that word. These suffixes immediately c-command the root word and are ordered in accordance with the principle of semantic scope; morphemes that have scope over other parts of a words. To generate the proper linear structure, Left-Head Movement is applied recursively to include the morphemes that c-command a given root.\n\nEmpirical arguments for the Mirror Principle are provided by Baker's (1985) account for the distribution of a number of valence changing operations in Mohawk, showing that the linear order of morphemes is related to the syntactic hierarchy in that morphemes are linearized in a reverse order to how they appear in a syntactic structure. His findings are summarized in \"The Mirror Generalization\", which states: Morphological derivations must directly reflect syntactic derivations (and vice versa).The generalization is observed in Baker's (1988) account for applicatives and passives in Chichewa:\n\nMbidzi zi-na-perek-a mpiringidzo kwa mtsikana\n\nzebra SP-PST-hand-ASP crowbar to girl\n\n\"The zebras handed the crowbar to the girl.\"\n\nMbidzi zi-na-perek-er-a mpiringidzo mtsikana\n\nzebra SP-PST-hand-APPL-ASP crowbar girl\n\n\"The zebras handed the girl the crowbar.\"\n\nMpiringidzo u-na-perek-edw-a kwa mtsikana ndi mbidzi\n\ncrowbar SP-PST-hand-PASS-ASP to girl by zebras\n\n\"The crowbar was handed to the girl by the zebras.\"\n\nMtsikana a-na-perek-er-edw-a mpiringidzo ndi mbidzi\n\ngirl SP-PST-hand-APPL-PASS-ASP crowbar by zebras\n\n\"The girl was handed the crowbar by the zebras.\"\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Mtskikana a-na-perek-edw-er-a mpiringidzo ndi mbidzi\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>girl SP-PST-hand-PASS-APPL-ASP crowbar by zebras\n\nThe above examples attest the ordering of the applicative morpheme and the passive morpheme in Chichewa. In this language, applicatives may be passivized, however, passives can not be made into applicatives. Applying the Mirror Principle to this set of data, we assume that in the underlying deep structure of the syntax, all affixes that occur to the right of the lexical root \"perek\" are projected above this root in the syntax. These affixes are then adjoined to the lexical root via head-movement.\n\nNumerous observations in languages are also available, apart from the mirror principle. Yupik, for example, is able to account for affix order appealing entirely to semantic scope. However, semantic scope and the mirror principle are not mutually exclusive ways to account for affix ordering\n\nChallenges to the Mirror Principle have been offered in analyses of the morpheme orders of Navajo and Cupeño by Harley (2009).\n"}
{"id": "4804623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4804623", "title": "Mythical origins of language", "text": "Mythical origins of language\n\nThere have been many accounts of the origin of language in the world's mythologies and other stories pertaining to the origin of language, the development of language and the reasons behind the diversity in languages today.\n\nThese myths have similarities, recurring themes, and differences, having been passed down through oral tradition. Some myths go further than just storytelling and are religious, with some even having a literal interpretation even today. Recurring themes in the myths of language dispersal are floods and catastrophes. Many stories tell of a great deluge or flood which caused the peoples of the Earth to scatter over the face of the planet. Punishment by a god or gods for perceived wrongdoing on the part of man is another recurring theme.\n\nMyths regarding the origins of language and languages are generally subsumed or footnoted into larger creation myths, although there are differences. Some tales say a creator endowed language from the beginning, others count language among later gifts, or curses.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible attributes the origin of language per se to humans, with Adam being asked to name the creatures that God had created.\n\nOne of the most well known examples in the West is the Tower of Babel passage from Genesis. \nIt tells of God punishing humanity for arrogance and disobedience by means of the confusion of tongues.\n\nThis became the standard account in the European Middle Ages, reflected in medieval literature such as the tale of Fénius Farsaid.\n\nVāc is the Hindu goddess of speech, or \"speech personified\". As \"brahman\" \"sacred utterance\", she has a cosmological role as the \"Mother of the Vedas\".\nShe is presented as the consort of Prajapati, who is likewise presented as the origin of the Veda.\nShe became conflated with Sarasvati in later Hindu mythology.\n\nIn common with the mythology of many other civilizations and cultures which tell of a Great Flood, certain Native American tribes tell of a deluge which came over the Earth. After the water subsides, various explanations are given for the new diversity in speech.\n\nThe Aztecs' story maintains that only a man, Coxcox, and a woman, Xochiquetzal, survive, having floated on a piece of bark. They found themselves on land and begot many children who were at first born unable to speak, but subsequently, upon the arrival of a dove were endowed with language, although each one was given a different speech such that they could not understand one another.\n\nA similar flood is described by the Kaska people from North America, however, like with the story of Babel, the people were now \"widely scattered over the world\". The narrator of the story adds that this explains the many different centres of population, the many tribes and the many languages, \"Before the flood, there was but one centre; for all the people lived together in one country, and spoke one language.\"\n\nAn Iroquois story tells of the god Taryenyawagon (\"Holder of the Heavens\") guiding his people on a journey and directing them to settle in different places whence their languages changed.\n\nA Salishan myth tells how an argument led to the divergence of languages. Two people were arguing whether the high-pitched humming noise that accompanies ducks in flight is from air passing through the beak or from the flapping of wings. The argument is not settled by the chief, who then calls a council of all the leading people from nearby villages. This council breaks down in argument when nobody can agree, and eventually the dispute leads to a split where some people move far away. Over time they slowly began to speak differently, and eventually other languages were formed.\n\nIn the mythology of the Yuki, indigenous people of California, a creator, accompanied by Coyote creates language as he creates the tribes in various localities. He lays sticks which will transform into people upon daybreak.\n\nThe Ticuna people of the Upper Amazon tell that all the peoples were once a single tribe, speaking the same language until two hummingbird eggs were eaten, it is not told by whom. Subsequently the tribe split into groups and dispersed far and wide.\n\nIn Ancient Greece there was a myth which told that for ages men had lived without law under the rule of Zeus and speaking one language, gifted to them by the god and goddess of ingenuity, Philarios and Philarion. The god Hermes brought diversity in speech and along with it separation into nations and discord ensued. Zeus then resigned his position, yielding it to the first king of men, Phoroneus.\n\nIn Norse mythology, the faculty of speech is a gift from the third son of Borr, Vé, who gave also hearing and sight.\n\nThe Wa-Sania, a Bantu people of East African origin have a tale that in the beginning, the peoples of the earth knew only one language, but during a severe famine, a madness struck the people, causing them to wander in all directions, jabbering strange words, and this is how different languages came about.\n\nA god who speaks all languages is a theme in African mythology, two examples being Eshu of the Yoruba, a trickster who is a messenger of the gods. Eshu has a parallel in Legba from the Fon people of Benin. Another Yoruba god who speaks all the languages of the world is Orunmila, the god of divination.\n\nA group of people on the island of Hao in Polynesia tell a very similar story to the Tower of Babel, speaking of a God who, \"in anger chased the builders away, broke down the building, and changed their language, so that they spoke diverse tongues\".\n\nIn South Australia, a people of Encounter Bay tell a story of how diversity in language came about from cannibalism:\n\nAnother group of Australian Aboriginal people, the Gunwinggu, tell of a goddess in dreamtime giving each of her children a language of their own to play with.\n\nThe traditional beliefs of the indigenous inhabitants of the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal describe language as being given by the god Pūluga to the first man and woman at their union following a great deluge. The language given was called \"bojig-yâb-\", which is the language spoken to this day, according to their belief, by the tribe inhabiting the south and south-eastern portion of middle Andaman. This language is described by the inhabitants as the \"mother tongue\" from which all other dialects have been made.\n\nTheir beliefs hold that even before the death of the first man,\n\nThus explaining the diversity of language.\n\n\n"}

A common English example would be \"la la la\", \"na na na\" or \"da da da\".\n\nNon-lexical vocables are used in yodeling, Blackfoot music and other Native American music, Pygmy music, the music of the Maldives, Irish music, and Highland Scots music. Vocables frequently act as formal markers, indicating the beginning and end of phrases, sections or songs themselves, and also as onomatopoeic references, cueing devices, and other purposes.\n\nThe Blackfoot, like other Plains Indians, use the consonants \"h\", \"y\", \"w\", and vowels. They avoid \"n\", \"c\" (\"ts\") and other consonants. \"i\" and \"e\" tend slightly to be higher pitches, \"a\", \"o\", and \"u\" lower ones.\n\nThe AIM Song has its origins in the Plains; as such, it holds similar characteristics to Blackfoot song. It is intended as an intertribal song, so the use of non-lexical vocables prevents bias to one particular language.\n\nOther traditional musical forms employing non-lexical vocables include:\n\nScat singing is a type of voice instrumental music. A scat is vocalized using wordless vocables and syllables (e.g. \"bippity-bippity-doo-wop-razzamatazz-skoobie-doobie-shoobity-bee-bop-a-lula-shabazz\") as employed by jazz singers. Scat singing gives singers the ability to sing improvised melodies and rhythms, to create the equivalent of an instrumental solo using their voice. Scatman John (John Paul Larkin) renewed interest in the genre briefly during the mid-90s.\n\nVocal improviser Bobby McFerrin’s performances at major concert halls worldwide show that “wordless singing has traveled far from the concepts demonstrated by Louis Armstrong, Gladys Bentley, Cab Calloway, Anita O’Day, and Leo Watson”.\n\nAnother method of scat singing is practiced by guitarists who scat along with their solos note for note. Notable practitioners include George Benson, Sheldon Reynolds, and Rik Emmett.\n\nNon-lexical vocables that take on percussive roles:\n\n\nThe song \"Swinging the Alphabet\" is sung by The Three Stooges in their short film \"Violent Is the Word for Curly\" (1938). It is the only full-length song performed by the Stooges in their short films, and the only time they mimed to their own pre-recorded soundtrack. The lyrics use each letter of the alphabet to make a nonsense verse of the song:\n\nThe song \"Mairzy Doats\" (1943) used blurred lyrics that sound non-lexical:\nHowever, the lyrics of the bridge provide a clue:\n\nExamples of popular music employing non-lexical vocables include:\n\nJack Black uses non-lexical vocables whilst singing as Tenacious D\n\nVan Morrison employed scat in his performances.\n\nScat singing influenced the development of doo-wop and hip hop. It was popular enough in doo-wop that Barry Mann and Gerry Goffin made it the subject of a 1961 song, Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)\". It has also appeared in various genres of rock music. Jim Morrison of The Doors sings a chorus of slow scat on the song \"Cars Hiss By My Window\", trying to replicate a harmonica solo he had heard, as well as on the song \"Roadhouse Blues\"; scat singing also notably opens the B-side of Joe Walsh's 1973 album \"The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get\" with the song \"Meadow\". The technique was employed in the song \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" by Pink Floyd, as well as the R&B song \"Rubber Biscuit\" by The Chips (also as by The Blues Brothers). The list of scat singers includes such greats as Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, Cab Calloway, Scatman Crothers, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Sammy Davis Jr., Mel Tormé, Tony Bennett, Cleo Laine, Roger Miller, Aretha Franklin, Van Morrison, and the Pointer Sisters.\n\nScatting also makes appearances in newer genres, including industrial music, in the chorus of Ministry's 1991 song \"\"; nu metal music, in the band Korn (whose lead singer Jonathan Davis has incorporated scat singing into songs such as \"Twist\", \"Ball Tongue\", \"Freak on a Leash\", \"B.B.K.\", \"Beat it Upright\", \"Liar\", and \"Rotting in Vain\"); and the heavy metal subgenre of death metal, where scat singing is used by John Tardy of the band Obituary. Jack Black incorporates scat into several Tenacious D songs, most notably: \"Tribute\", \"Cosmic Shame\", \"Classico,\" \"Jesus Ranch,\" Low Hangin' Fruit,\" and \"Bowie\". Singer JoJo performs ad-libbed scats on the track \"Yes or No\". Other modern examples include \"Under Pressure\" by Queen (band), \"Rag Doll\" by Aerosmith, \"Under My Voodoo\" by Sublime, \"No! Don't Shoot\" by Foxy Shazam, \"Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz\" by Mr. Bungle, \"In My Bed\" by Amy Winehouse, and \"Stuck in the Middle\" by Mika. Scatman John combined scat and early-1990s electronic dance music.\n\nExamples by popular non-anglophone singers using such techniques include \"Bla Bla Bla\" by Gigi D'Agostino, \"Eena Mina Dika\" in the Bollywood film \"Aasha\", Eduard Khil's \"I Am Glad, Cause I'm Finally Returning Back Home\" (known as \"Trololo\") sung entirely without lyrics, \"Fuzao\" by Faye Wong, \"Lagu Lagu\" by Sa Dingding and \"Din Daa Daa\" by George Kranz.\n\nDue to the wide-ranging vocal styles used in popular music, occasionally songs have been mistakenly categorized as having non-lexical vocables, when in fact the singers are performing actual lyrics rendered partially (or completely) unintelligible to the ear of some (but not all) listeners. Two famous 1960s examples are \"Louie Louie\" as recorded by The Kingsmen and \"Wooly Bully\" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs.\n\nA signature of some Disney musical films is their songs' use of nonsense words, the longest and most famous of which is from \"Mary Poppins\", entitled \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\". A close second is \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" from \"Song of the South\", which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

It is distinct from personal multilingualism, the capacity of a person to speak several languages.\n\nAfghanistan uses Dari (or Afghan Persian) and Pashto as official languages. Many citizens are bilingual. These two languages account for 85% of Afghanis' native tongues.\n\nIn Belarus, Russian is far more common than Belarusian, and Section 17 of the Constitution designates both as official languages.\n\nThe official languages of Burundi are the local Kirundi language as well as the colonial French.\n\nCameroon is extremely diverse linguistically and uses English and French as official languages.\n\nIn Canada English and French have special legal status over other languages in Canada’s courts, parliament and administration. \nAt the provincial level, New Brunswick is the only official bilingual province, while Quebec is the only province where French is the sole official language. The remaining provinces have English as the only official language. In practice, all provinces, including Quebec, offer some bilingual services and some education in both official languages up to the high school level. English and French are official languages in all three territories (because they are federally administered). In addition, Inuktitut is also an official language in Nunavut, and nine aboriginal languages have official status in the Northwest Territories.\n\nOut of 120 languages spoken in the Central African Republic, French and the Ngbandi-based creole Sango are official.\n\nCitizens of Chad speak over 120 languages, and the standardized Chadian Arabic serves as the lingua franca with colonial language French also being official.\n\n\nIsland nation of Cyprus has had Greek and Turkish as its languages since the 1960 Constitution (Article 3, section 1).

{"id": "22973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22973", "title": "Pig Latin", "text": "Pig Latin\n\nPig Latin is a language game or argot in which words in English are altered, usually by adding a fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial consonant or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable to create such a suffix. For example, Wikipedia would become Ikipediaway (taking the 'W' and 'ay' to create a suffix). The objective is to conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer; Pig Latin is simply a form of argot or jargon unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.\n\nEarly mentions of pig Latin or hog Latin describe what we would today call dog Latin, a type of parody Latin. Examples of this predate even Shakespeare, whose 1598 play, \"Love's Labour's Lost\", includes a reference to dog Latin:\n\nAn 1866 article describes a \"hog latin\" that has some similarities to current Pig Latin. The article says, \"He adds as many new letters as the boys in their 'hog latin,' which is made use of to mystify eavesdroppers. A boy asking a friend to go with him says, 'Wig-ge you-ge go-ge wig-ge me-ge?' The other, replying in the negative, says, 'No-ge, I-ge wo-ge.' \". This is similar to Língua do Pê.\n\nAnother early mention of the name was in \"Putnam's Magazine\" in May 1869 \"I had plenty of ammunition in reserve, to say nothing, Tom, of our pig Latin. 'Hoggibus, Piggibus et shotam damnabile grunto,' and all that sort of thing,\" although the jargon is dog Latin.\n\n\"The Atlantic\" January 1895 also included a mention of the subject: \"They all spoke a queer jargon which they themselves had invented. It was something like the well-known 'pig Latin' that all sorts of children like to play with.\"\n\nThe modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 Columbia Records album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named Arthur Fields. The song, called Pig Latin Love, is followed by the subtitle \"I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\". The Three Stooges used it on multiple occasions, most notably \"Tassels in the Air\", a 1938 short where Moe Howard attempts to teach Curley Howard how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, \"Three Little Pigskins\", Larry Fine attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given. A few months prior in 1934, in the \"Our Gang\" short film \"Washee Ironee\", Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin. Ginger Rogers sang a verse of We're in the Money in pig Latin in an elaborate Busby Berkeley production number in the film Gold Diggers of 1933, (). The film, the third highest grossing of that year, was inducted into the National Film Registry and that song included in the all time top 100 movie songs by the American Film Institute. Merle Travis ends his song \"When My Baby Double Talks To Me\" with the phrase, \"What a aybybay\", where the last word is Pig Latin for \"baby\".\n\nA 1947 newspaper question and answer column describes the pig Latin as we understand it today. It describes moving the first letter to the end of a word and then adding \"ay\".\n\nTwo Pig Latin words that have entered into mainstream American English are \"\" or \"icksnay\", the Pig Latin version of \"\" (itself a borrowing of German \"nichts\"), which is used as a general negative; and \", Pig Latin for \", meaning \"go away\" or \"get out of here\".\n\nFor words that begin with consonant sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, \"ay\" is added, as in the following examples:\n\nWhen words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound), the whole sound is added to the end when speaking or writing.\n\nFor words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds \"way\" or \"yay\" to the end (or just \"ay\"). Examples are:\n\nAn alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster. This usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a more unique variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words. Examples are:\n\nSentence structure remains the same as it would in English. Pronunciation of some words may be a little difficult for beginners, but people can easily understand Pig Latin with practice.\n\nPig Latin is mainly used in fun. It is also used by children or young adults to hide conversation from older people. For example, a conversation between two people in the presence of an unwanted other may consist of: \"ehay isay eryvay illysay\" = \"he is very silly\".\n\nIn the German-speaking area, varieties of Pig Latin include Kedelkloppersprook, which originated around Hamburg harbour, and Mattenenglisch that was used in the \"Matte\", the traditional working-class neighborhood of Bern. Though Mattenenglisch has fallen out of use since the mid-20th century, it is still cultivated by voluntary associations. A characteristic of the Mattenenglisch Pig Latin is the complete substitution of the first vowel by \"i\", in addition to the usual moving of the initial consonant cluster and the adding of \"ee\".\n\nThe Swedish equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspråket (\"Fig language\" – see Language game § List of common language games).\n\nThe Finnish Pig Latin is called Kontinkieli (\"container language\"). After each word you add the word kontti \"container\", then switch the first syllables, So every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example,\"wikipedia\" --> \"wikipedia kontti\" --> \"kokipedia wintti\". So converting the sentence \"I love you\" (\"Minä rakastan sinua\") would result in \"konä mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti\".\n\nAnother equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the Slavic-speaking parts of the Balkans. It is called \"Šatra\" (/sha-tra/)or \"Šatrovački\" (/shatro-vachki/) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the Balkan slang name for marijuana (trava - meaning \"grass\") turns to \"vutra\"; the Balkan slang name for cocaine (belo - meaning \"white\") turns to lobe, a pistol (pištolj) turns to štoljpi, bro (brate) turns to tebra. In the past few years it has become widely used between teenage immigrants in former Yugoslavian countries.\n\nIn Italian, the \"alfabeto farfallino\" uses a similar encoding.\n\nFrench has the \"loucherbem\" (or \"louchébem\", or \"largonji\") coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (\"boucher\" in French). In \"loucherbem\", the leading consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word (as in Pig Latin) and replaced by an \"L\", and then a suffix is added at the end of the word (-\"oche\", -\"em\", -\"oque\", etc., depending on the word). Example: \"combien\" (how much) = \"lombienquès\". Similar coded languages are \"verlan\" and \"langue de feu\" (see . A few louchébem words have become usual French words: \"fou\" (crazy) = \"loufoque\", \"portefeuille\" (wallet) = \"larfeuille\", \"en douce\" (on the quiet) = \"en loucedé\". Also similar is the widely used French argot \"verlan\", in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a word into syllables and reversing the syllables.\n\nVerlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers. This language has served as a language bridge between many of these migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened within just a few decades.\n\nHere is an example of some French words that have been Verlanned and their English meaning:\n\n\n\n"}

The argument was central to philosophical discussion in the second half of the 20th century. \n\nIn the \"Investigations\" Wittgenstein does not present his arguments in a succinct and linear fashion; instead, he describes particular uses of language, and prompts the reader to contemplate the implications of those uses. As a result, there is considerable dispute about both the nature of the argument and its implications. Indeed, it has become common to talk of private language \"arguments\".\n\nHistorians of philosophy see precursors of the private language argument in a variety of sources, notably in the work of Gottlob Frege and John Locke. Locke is also a prominent exponent of the view targeted by the argument, since he proposed in his \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" that the referent of a word is the \"idea\" it stands for.\n\nThe private language argument is of central importance to debates about the nature of language. One compelling theory about language is that language maps words to ideas, concepts or representations in each person's mind. On this account, the concepts in one's head are distinct from the concepts in other's head. But I can match my concepts to a word in our common language, and then speak the word. You then match the word to a concept in your mind. So our concepts in effect form a private language which we translate into our common language and so share. This account is found for example in \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\", and more recently in Jerry Fodor's language of thought theory.\n\nWittgenstein argues, in his later work, that this account of private language is inconsistent. If the idea of a private language is inconsistent, then a logical conclusion would be that all language serves a social function. This would have profound implications for other areas of philosophical and psychological study. For example, if one cannot have a private language, it might not make any sense to talk of private experiences or of private mental states.\n\nThe argument is found in part one of the \"Philosophical investigations\". This part consists of a series of \"remarks\" numbered sequentially. The core of the argument is generally thought to be presented in §256 and onward, though the idea is first introduced in §243.\n\nIf someone were to behave as if they understood a language of which no-one else can make sense, we might call this an example of a private language. It is not sufficient here, however, for the language to simply be one that has not yet been translated. In order to count as a \"private language\" in Wittgenstein's sense, it must be in principle incapable of translation into an ordinary language – if for example it were to describe those inner experiences supposed to be inaccessible to others. The private language being considered is not simply a language \"in fact\" understood by one person, but a language that \"in principle\" can only be understood by one person. So the last speaker of a dying language would not be speaking a private language, since the language remains in principle learnable. A private language must be unlearnable and untranslatable, and yet it must appear that the speaker is able to make sense of it.\n\nWittgenstein sets up a thought experiment in which someone is imagined to associate some recurrent sensation with a symbol by writing S in their calendar when the sensation occurs. Such a case would be a private language in the Wittgensteinian sense. Furthermore, it is presupposed that \"S\" cannot be defined using other terms, for example \"the feeling I get when the manometer rises\"; for to do so would be to give S a place in our public language, in which case S could not be a statement in a private language.\n\nIt might be supposed that one might use \"a kind of ostensive definition\" for S, by focusing on the sensation and on the symbol. Early in \"The Investigations\", Wittgenstein attacks the usefulness of ostensive definition. He considers the example of someone pointing to two nuts while saying \"This is called \"two\"\". How does it come about that the listener associates this with the \"number\" of items, rather than the type of nut, their colour, or even a compass direction? One conclusion of this is that to participate in an ostensive definition presupposes an understanding of the process and context involved, of the form of life. Another is that \"an ostensive definition can be variously interpreted in \"every\" case\".\n\nIn the case of the sensation S Wittgenstein argues that there is no criterion for the correctness of such an ostensive definition, since whatever \"seems\" right will \"be\" right, 'And that only means that here we can't talk about \"right\".' The exact reason for the rejection of private language has been contentious. One interpretation, which has been called \"memory scepticism\", has it that one might \"remember\" the sensation wrongly, and that as a result one might misuse the term S . The other, called \"meaning scepticism\", has it that one can never be sure of the \"meaning\" of a term defined in this way.\n\nOne common interpretation is that the possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore one does not have any firm \"criterion\" for using S in each case. So, for example, I might one day focus on \"that\" sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but the next day, I have no criteria for knowing that the sensation I have \"now\" is the same as the one yesterday, except for my memory; and since my memory might fail me, I have no firm criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now is indeed S.\n\nHowever, memory scepticism has been criticized as applying to public language, also. If one person can misremember, it is entirely possible that several people can misremember. So memory scepticism could be applied with equal effect to ostensive definitions given in a public language. For example, Jim and Jenny might one day decide to call some particular tree T; but the next day \"both\" misremember which tree it was they named. If they were depending entirely on their memory, and had not written down the location of the tree, or told anyone else, then they would appear to be with the same difficulties as the individual who defined S ostensively. And so, if this is the case, the argument presented against private language would apply equally to public language.\n\nThis interpretation (and the criticism of Wittgenstein that arises from it) is based on a complete misreading, however, because Wittgenstein's argument has nothing to do with the fallibility of human memory, but rather concerns the \"intelligibility\" of remembering something for which there is no external criterion of correctness. It is not that we will not, in fact, remember the sensation correctly, but rather that it makes no sense to talk about our memory being either correct or incorrect in this case. The point, as Diego Marconi puts it, is not so much that private language is \"a game at which we can't win, it is a game we can't lose\".\n\nWittgenstein makes this clear in section 258: \"A definition surely serves to establish the meaning of a sign.—Well, that is done precisely by the concentrating of my attention; for in this way I impress on myself the connexion between the sign and the sensation.—But \"I impress it on myself\" can only mean: this process brings it about that I remember the connexion right in the future. But in the present case, I have no criterion of correctness.\" This absence of any criterion of correctness is not a problem because it makes it more difficult for the private linguist to remember his sensation correctly; it is a problem because it undermines the intelligibility of such a concept as remembering the sensation, whether correctly or incorrectly.\n\nWittgenstein explains this unintelligibility with a series of analogies. For example, in section 265 he observes the pointlessness of a dictionary that exists only in the imagination. Since the idea of a dictionary is to justify the translation of one word by another, and thus constitute the reference of justification for such a translation, all this is lost the moment we talk of a dictionary in the imagination; for “justification consists in appealing to something independent\". Hence, to appeal to a private ostensive definition as the standard of correct use of a term would be \"as if someone were to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure himself that what it said was true.\"\n\nAnother interpretation, found for example in the account presented by Anthony Kenny has it that the problem with a private ostensive definition is not just that it might be misremembered, but that such a definition cannot lead to a meaningful statement.\n\nLet us first consider a case of ostensive definition in a public language. Jim and Jenny might one day decide to call some particular tree T; but the next day misremember which tree it was they named. In this ordinary language case, it makes sense to ask questions such as \"is this the tree we named T yesterday?\" and make statements such as \"This is not the tree we named T yesterday\". So one can appeal to other parts of the form of life, perhaps arguing: \"this is the only Oak in the forest; T was an oak; therefore this is T\".\n\nAn everyday ostensive definition is embedded in a public language, and so in the form of life in which that language occurs. Participation in a public form of life enables correction to occur. That is, in the case of a public language there are other ways to check the use of a term that has been ostensively defined. We can \"justify\" our use of the new name T by making the ostensive definition more or less explicit.\n\nBut this is not the case with S. Recall that because S is part of a private language, it is not possible to provide an explicit definition of S. The only \"possible\" definition is the private, ostensive one of associating S with \"that\" feeling. But this is the \"very thing being questioned\". \"Imagine someone saying: 'But I know how tall I am!' and laying his hand on top of his head to prove it.\"\n\nA recurrent theme in Wittgenstein's work is that for some term or utterance to have a sense, it must be conceivable that it be doubted. For Wittgenstein, tautologies do not have sense, do not say anything, and so do not admit of doubt. But furthermore, if any other sort of utterance does not admit of doubt, it must be senseless. Rush Rhees, in his notes on lectures given by Wittgenstein, while discussing the reality of physical objects, has him say:\n\nWe get something similar when we write a tautology like \"p → p\". We formulate such expressions to get something in which there is no doubt – even though the sense has vanished with the doubt.\n\nAs Kenny put it, \"Even to think \"falsely\" that something is S, I must know the meaning of S; and this is what Wittgenstein argues is impossible in the private language.\" Because there is no way to check the meaning (or use) of S \"apart from\" that private ostensive act of definition, it is not possible to \"know\" what S means. The sense has vanished with the doubt.\n\nWittgenstein uses the further analogy of the left hand giving the right hand money. The physical act might take place, but the transaction could not count as a gift. Similarly, one might say S while focusing on a sensation, but no act of naming has occurred.\n\nThe beetle-in-a-box is a famous thought experiment that Wittgenstein introduces in the context of his investigation of pains.\n\nPains occupy a distinct and vital place in the philosophy of mind for several reasons. One is that pains seem to collapse the appearance/reality distinction. If an object appears to you to be red it might not be so in reality, but if you seem to yourself to be in pain you must be so: there can be no case here of seeming at all. At the same time, one cannot feel another person’s pain, but only infer it from their behavior and their reports of it.\n\nIf we accept pains as special qualia known absolutely but exclusively by the solitary minds that perceive them, this may be taken to ground a Cartesian view of the self and consciousness. Our consciousness, of pains anyway, would seem unassailable. Against this, one might acknowledge the absolute fact of one's own pain, but claim skepticism about the existence of anyone else's pains. Alternatively, one might take a behaviorist line and claim that our pains are merely neurological stimulations accompanied by a disposition to behave.\n\nWittgenstein invites readers to imagine a community in which the individuals each have a box containing a \"beetle\". \"No one can look into anyone else's box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at \"his\" beetle.\"\n\nIf the \"beetle\" had a use in the language of these people, it could not be as the name of something – because it is entirely possible that each person had something completely different in their box, or even that the thing in the box constantly changed, or that each box was in fact empty. The content of the box is irrelevant to whatever language game it is used in.\n\nBy analogy, it does not matter that one cannot experience another's subjective sensations. Unless talk of such subjective experience is learned through public experience the actual content is irrelevant; all we can discuss is what is available in our public language.\n\nBy offering the \"beetle\" as an analogy to pains, Wittgenstein suggests that the case of pains is not really amenable to the uses philosophers would make of it. \"That is to say: if we construe the grammar of the expression of sensation on the model of 'object and designation,\" the object drops out of consideration as irrelevant.\"\n\nIt is common to describe language use in terms of the rules that one follows, and Wittgenstein considers rules in some detail. He famously suggests that any act can be made out to follow from a given rule. He does this in setting up a dilemma:\nThis was our paradox: no course of action could be determined by a rule, because every course of action can be made out to accord with the rule. The answer was: if everything can be made out to accord with the rule, then it can also be made out to conflict with it. And there would be neither accord nor conflict here.\nOne can give an explanation of why one followed a particular rule in a particular case. But any explanation for rule following behaviour cannot be given in terms of following a rule, without involving circularity. One can say something like \"She did X because of the rule R\" but if you say \"She followed R because of the rule R\" one can then ask \"but why did she follow rule R?\" and so potentially become involved in a regression. Explanation must have an end.\nHis conclusion: What this shows is that there is a way of grasping a rule which is \"not\" an \"interpretation\", but which is exhibited in what we call \"obeying the rule\" and \"going against it\" in actual cases.\n\nSo following a rule is a practice. And furthermore, since one can think one is following a rule and yet be mistaken, \"thinking\" one is following a rule is not the same as following it. Therefore, following a rule cannot be a private activity.\n\nIn 1982 Saul Kripke published a new and innovative account of the argument in his book \"Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language\". Kripke takes the paradox discussed in §201 to be the central problem of the \"Philosophical Investigations\". He develops the paradox into a Grue-like problem, arguing that it similarly results in skepticism, but about \"meaning\" rather than about \"induction\". He proposes a new form of addition, which he calls \"quus\", which is identical with \"plus\" in all cases except those in which either of the numbers to be added is greater than 57, thus:\n\nformula_1\n\nHe then asks if anyone could know that previously when I thought I had meant \"plus\", I had not meant \"quus\". He claims that his argument shows that \"Each new application we make is a leap in the dark; any present intention could be interpreted to accord with anything we may choose to do. So there can be neither accord nor conflict\".\n\nKripke's account is considered by some commentators to be unfaithful to Wittgenstein, and as a result has been referred to as \"Kripkenstein\". Even Kripke himself suspected that many aspects of the account were inconsistent with Wittgenstein's original intent, leading him to urge that the book \"should be thought of as expounding neither 'Wittgenstein's' argument nor 'Kripke's': rather Wittgenstein's argument as it struck Kripke, as it presented a problem for him.\"\n\n\"Remarks in Part I of \"Investigations\" are preceded by the symbol \"§\".

{"id": "34357381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34357381", "title": "Speech acquisition", "text": "Speech acquisition\n\nSpeech acquisition focuses on the development of spoken language by a child. Speech consists of an organized set of sounds or phonemes that are used to convey meaning while language is an arbitrary association of symbols used according to prescribed rules to convey meaning.\nWhile grammatical and syntactic learning can be seen as a part of language acquisition, speech acquisition focuses on the development of speech perception and speech production over the first years of a child's lifetime. There are several models to explain the norms of speech sound or phoneme acquisition in children.\n\nSensory learning concerning acoustic speech signals already starts during pregnancy. Hepper and Shahidullah (1992) described the progression of fetal response to different pure tone frequencies. They suggested fetuses respond to 500 Hertz (Hz) at 19 weeks gestation, 250 Hz and 500 Hz at 27 weeks gestation and finally respond to 250, 500, 1000, 3000 Hz between 33 and 35 weeks gestation. Lanky and Williams (2005) suggested that fetuses could respond to pure tone stimuli of 500 Hz as early as 16 weeks.\n\nThe newborn is already capable of discerning many phonetic contrasts. This capability may be innate. \nSpeech perception becomes language-specific for vowels at around 6 months, for sound combinations at around 9 months and for language-specific consonants at around 11 months.\n\nIt is also important that a newborn is already capable of detecting typical word stress patterns around the age of 8 months.\n\nAs an infant grows into a child their ability to discriminate between speech sounds should increase. Rvachew (2007) described three developmental stages in which a child recognizes or discerns adult-like, phonological and articulatory representations of sounds.In the first stage, the child is generally unaware of phonological contrast and can produce sounds that are acoustically and perceptually similar. In the second stage the child is aware of phonological contrasts and can produce acoustically different variations imperceptible to adult listeners. Finally, in the third stage, children become aware of phonological contrasts and produce different sounds that are perceptually and acoustically accurate to an adult production.\n\nIt is suggested that a child's perceptual capabilities continue to develop for many years. Hazan and Barrett (2000) suggest that this development can cotton into late childhood; 6 to 12 year old children showed increasing mastery of discriminating synthesized differences in place, manner, and voicing of speech sounds with out yet achieving adult-like accuracy in their own production.\n\nInfants are born with the ability to vocalize, most notably through crying. As they grow and develop, infants add more sounds to their inventory. \nThere are two primary typologies of infant vocalizations. Typology 1: Stark Assessment of Early Vocal Development consists of 5 phases. \n\nTypology 2: Oller's typology of infant phonations consists primarily of 2 phases with several substages. The 2 primary phases include Non-speech-like vocalizations and Speech-like vocalizations. Non-speech-like vocalizations include a. vegetative sounds such as burping and b. fixed vocal signals like crying or laughing. Speech-like vocalizations consist of a. quasi-vowels, b. primitive articulation, c. expansion stage and d. canonical babbling.\n\nKnowing when a speech sound should be accurately produced helps parents and professionals determine when child may have an articulation disorder. There have been two traditional methods used to compare a child's articulation of speech sounds to chronological age. The first is comparing the number of correct responses on a standardized articulation test with the normative data for a given age on the same test. This allows evaluators to see how well a child is producing sounds compared to their same aged peers. The second method consists of comparing an individual sound a child produces with developmental norms for that individual sound. The second method can be difficult when considering the differing normative data and other factors that affect typical speech development. \nMany norms are based on age expectations in which a majority of children of a certain age are accurately producing a sound (75% or 90% depending on the study). Using the results from Sander (1972), Templin (1957), and Wellman, Case, Mengert, & Bradbury, (1931), the American Speech-Language Hearing Association suggests the following: Sounds mastered by age 3 include /p, m, h, n, w, b/; by age 4 /k, g, d, f, y/; by age 6 /t, ŋ, r, l/; by age 7 /tʃ, ʃ, j, θ/. and by age 8 /s, z, v, ð, ʒ/.\n\nShriberg (1993) proposed a model for speech sound acquisition known as the Early, Middle, and Late 8 based on 64 children with speech delays ages 3 to 6 years. Shriberg proposed that there were three stages of phoneme development. Using a profile of \"consonant mastery\" he developed the following:\n\n\n\n\n"}

McLuhan proposes that a medium itself, not the content it carries, should be the focus of study. He said that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not only by the content delivered over the medium, but also by the characteristics of the medium itself.\n\nMcLuhan frequently punned on the word \"message\", changing it to \"mass age\", \"mess age\", and \"massage\"; a later book, \"The Medium Is the Massage\" was originally to be titled \"The Medium is the Message\", but McLuhan preferred the new title, which is said to have been a printing error.\n\nConcerning the title, McLuhan wrote \"The title “The Medium Is the Massage\" is a teaser—a way of getting attention. There’s a wonderful sign hanging in a Toronto junkyard which reads, “Help Beautify Junkyards. Throw Something Lovely Away Today.” This is a very effective way of getting people to notice a lot of things. And so the title is intended to draw attention to the fact that a medium is not something neutral—it does something to people. It takes hold of them. It rubs them off, it massages them and bumps them around, chiropractically, as it were, and the general roughing up that any new society gets from a medium, especially a new medium, is what is intended in that title.\"\n\nFor McLuhan, it was the medium itself that shaped and controlled \"the scale and form of human association and action\". Taking the movie as an example, he argued that the way this medium played with conceptions of speed and time transformed \"the world of sequence and connections into the world of creative configuration and structure.\" Therefore, the message of the movie medium is this transition from \"lineal connections\" to \"configurations\".\n\nExtending the argument for understanding the medium as the message itself, he proposed that the \"content of any medium is always another medium\" – thus, speech is the content of writing, writing is the content of print, and print itself is the content of the telegraph.\n\nMcLuhan understood \"medium\" in a broad sense. He identified the light bulb as a clear demonstration of the concept of \"the medium is the message\". A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that \"a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence.\"\n\nLikewise, the message of a newscast about a heinous crime may be less about the individual news story itself — the content — and more about the change in public attitude towards crime that the newscast engenders by the fact that such crimes are in effect being brought into the home to watch over dinner.\n\nHence in \"Understanding Media\", McLuhan describes the \"content\" of a medium as a juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind. This means that people tend to focus on the obvious, which is the content, to provide us valuable information, but in the process, we largely miss the structural changes in our affairs that are introduced subtly, or over long periods of time. As society's values, norms, and ways of doing things change because of the technology, it is then we realize the social implications of the medium. These range from cultural or religious issues and historical precedents, through interplay with existing conditions, to the secondary or tertiary effects in a cascade of interactions that we are not aware of.\n\nOn the subject of art history, McLuhan interpreted Cubism as announcing clearly that the medium is the message. For him, Cubist art required \"instant sensory awareness of the whole\" rather than perspective alone. In other words, with Cubism one could not ask what the artwork was about (content), but rather consider it in its entirety.\n\n\n"}

Nearly all infants exhibit a swallowing pattern involving tongue protrusion, but by six months of age most lose this reflex allowing for the ingestion of solid foods.\n\nSince 1958, the term \"tongue thrust\" has been described and discussed in speech and dental publications by many writers. Many school-age children have tongue thrust. For example, according to recent literature, as many as 67–95 percent of children 5–8 years old exhibit tongue thrust, which may be associated with or contributing to an orthodontic or speech problem. Up to the age of four, there is a possibility that the child will outgrow tongue thrust. However, if the tongue thrust swallowing pattern is retained beyond that age, it may be strengthened.\n\nFactors that can contribute to tongue thrusting include macroglossia (enlarged tongue), thumb sucking, large tonsils, hereditary factors, ankyloglossia (tongue tie), and certain types of artificial nipples used in feeding infants, also allergies or nasal congestion can cause the tongue to lie low in the mouth because of breathing obstruction and finally contributing to tongue thrusting. In addition, it is also seen after prolonged therapy by levodopa in Parkinsonism, also it occurs as extra pyramidal side effect (Acute muscular dystonia) after use of Neuroleptics (Anti-Psychotics). \n\nTongue thrust is normal in infants until approximately the age of six months. The loss of this normal infant behavior is one of the signs that the baby is ready to begin eating baby food.\n\nTongue thrusting can adversely affect the teeth and mouth. A person swallows from 1,200 to 2,000 times every 24 hours with about four pounds (1.8 kg) of pressure each time. If a person suffers from tongue thrusting, this continuous pressure tends to force the teeth out of alignment. Many people who tongue thrust have open bites; the force of the tongue against the teeth is an important factor in contributing to \"bad bite\" (malocclusion). Many orthodontists have completed dental treatment with what appeared to be good results, only to discover that the case relapsed because of the patient's tongue thrust. If the tongue is allowed to continue its pushing action against the teeth, it will continue to push the teeth forward and reverse the orthodontic work.\n\nSpeech is not frequently affected by the tongue thrust swallowing pattern. The \"S\" sound (lisping) is the one most affected. The lateral lisp (air forced on the side of the tongue rather than forward) shows dramatic improvement when the tongue thrust is corrected. However, lisping and tongue thrust are not always associated.\n\nTreatment for uncontrolled tongue thrust requires habit retraining in conjunction with a dental appliance.\n\n\n"}

It does not concern books, films, public speeches, and other forms of communications not constituting commercial activity. However, the law mandates the use of the French language in all broadcast audiovisual programs, with exceptions for musical works and \"original version\" films. Broadcast musical works are subject to quota rules under a related law whereby a minimum percentage of the songs on radio and television must be in the French language. \n\nThe law takes its common name from Jacques Toubon, who was Minister of Culture when it was passed, and who proposed the law to the National Assembly of France. A nickname is \"Loi Allgood\" – \"Allgood\" is a morpheme-for-morpheme translation of \"Toubon\" into English (\"All Good\" being a translation of \"Tout bon\") – as the law can largely be considered to have been enacted in reaction to the increasing usage of English in advertisements and other areas in France. As the law sought to strengthen French as the dominant language within the countries and her territories, the law also ‘came under considerable attack from the European Commission which regarded its provisions as particularly offensive to the concept of free competition across national borders.’ \n\nOne broad provision of the law applying to workplaces is that \"any document that contains obligations for the employee or provisions whose knowledge is necessary for the performance of one's work must be written in French.\" Among other things, this means that computer software developed outside France must have its user interface and instruction manuals translated into French to be legally used by companies in France. The law includes an exception that \"these provisions do not apply to documents coming from abroad\", but this exception has been interpreted narrowly by the appellate courts. For example, in 2006 a French subsidiary of a US company was given a hefty fine for delivering certain highly technical documents and software interfaces to its employees in the English language only, and this was upheld by the appellate court.\n\nAnother broad provision of the law is that it makes it mandatory for commercial advertisements and public announcements to be given in French. This does not rule out advertisements made in a foreign language: it is sufficient to provide a translation in a footnote. This was justified as a measure for the protection of the consumer. Additionally, product packaging must be in French, though, again, translation in multiple languages can be provided.\n\nA similar restriction—though implemented by primary legislation regulations and not as application of the Loi Toubon—applies to product labeling: product labels should be intelligible and in French, though additional languages may be present. Some linguistic restrictions on product labeling were found to be incompatible with European law, particularly the directives concerning the freedom of movement of goods within the European Union. The French government then issued interpretation notes and amended regulations in order to comply.\n\nIn another provision, the law specifies obligations for public legal persons (government administrations, et al.), mandating the use of French in publications, or at least in summaries of publications. In France, it is a constitutional requirement that the public should be informed of the action of the government. Since the official language of France is French, it follows that the French public should be able to get official information in French.\n\nUnder the Toubon law, schools that do not use French as the medium of instruction are ineligible for government funding. This excludes the Breton language schools of Brittany.\n\nOther restrictions concern the use of French in academic conferences. These are largely ignored by many public institutions, especially in the \"hard\" scientific fields. The original restrictions on colloquia also applied to private bodies, but that was found unconstitutional prior to enactment, on grounds that they violated freedom of speech, and the final form of the law was modified accordingly.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, soon after the Toubon Law came into force, two French lobbying groups—the \"Association pour la Défense de la Langue Française\" and the \"L'Avenir de la Langue Française\"—filed a complaint against Georgia Tech Lorraine, the Metz campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology. At the time of the complaint, all classes at this Lorraine school were conducted in English, and all course descriptions on its French Internet web site were in English only. The complaint invoked the Toubon Law to demand that the school's web site must be in French because the web site was effectively a commercial advertisement for the school's courses. Although the case was dismissed by the court on a minor legal technicality, and the lobbying groups chose to drop the matter, the school was moved to offer its French website in the French language in addition to English, although classes continued to be in English only.\n\nIn 2006, the French subsidiary of the US company General Electric Medical Systems was fined €500,000 plus an ongoing fine of €20,000 per day for not complying with the Toubon law.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40313", "title": "Universal grammar", "text": "Universal grammar\n\nUniversal grammar (UG) in linguistics, is the theory of the genetic component of the language faculty, usually credited to Noam Chomsky. The basic postulate of UG is that a certain set of structural rules are innate to humans, independent of sensory experience. With more linguistic stimuli received in the course of psychological development, children then adopt specific syntactic rules that conform to UG. It is sometimes known as \"mental grammar\", and stands contrasted with other \"grammars\", e.g. prescriptive, descriptive and pedagogical. The advocates of this theory emphasize and partially rely on the poverty of the stimulus (POS) argument and the existence of some universal properties of natural human languages. However, the latter has not been firmly established, as some linguists have argued languages are so diverse that such universality is rare. It is a matter of empirical investigation to determine precisely what properties are universal and what linguistic capacities are innate.\n\nThe theory of universal grammar proposes that if human beings are brought up under normal conditions (not those of extreme sensory deprivation), then they will always develop language with certain properties (e.g., distinguishing nouns from verbs, or distinguishing function words from content words). The theory proposes that there is an innate, genetically determined language faculty that knows these rules, making it easier and faster for children to learn to speak than it otherwise would be. This faculty does not know the vocabulary of any particular language (so words and their meanings must be learned), and there remain several parameters which can vary freely among languages (such as whether adjectives come before or after nouns) which must also be learned.\n\nAs Chomsky puts it, \"Evidently, development of language in the individual must involve three factors: (1) genetic endowment, which sets limits on the attainable languages, thereby making language acquisition possible; (2) external data, converted to the experience that selects one or another language within a narrow range; (3) principles not specific to the Faculty of Language.\"\n\nOccasionally, aspects of universal grammar seem describable in terms of general details regarding cognition. For example, if a predisposition to categorize events and objects as different classes of things is part of human cognition, and directly results in nouns and verbs showing up in all languages, then it could be assumed that rather than this aspect of universal grammar being specific to language, it is more generally a part of human cognition. To distinguish properties of languages that can be traced to other facts regarding cognition from properties of languages that cannot, the abbreviation UG* can be used. UG is the term often used by Chomsky for those aspects of the human brain which cause language to be the way that it is (i.e. are universal grammar in the sense used here) but here for discussion, it is used for those aspects which are furthermore specific to language (thus UG, as Chomsky uses it, is just an abbreviation for universal grammar, but UG* as used here is a subset of universal grammar).\n\nIn the same article, Chomsky casts the theme of a larger research program in terms of the following question: \"How little can be attributed to UG while still accounting for the variety of 'I-languages' attained, relying on third factor principles?\" (I-languages meaning internal languages, the brain states that correspond to knowing how to speak and understand a particular language, and third factor principles meaning (3) in the previous quote).\n\nChomsky has speculated that UG might be extremely simple and abstract, for example only a mechanism for combining symbols in a particular way, which he calls \"merge\". The following quote shows that Chomsky does not use the term \"UG\" in the narrow sense UG* suggested above:\n\n\"The conclusion that merge falls within UG holds whether such recursive generation is unique to FL (faculty of language) or is\nappropriated from other systems.\"\n\nIn other words, merge is seen as part of UG because it causes language to be the way it is, universal, and is not part of the environment or general properties independent of genetics and environment. Merge is part of universal grammar whether it is specific to language, or whether, as Chomsky suggests, it is also used for an example in mathematical thinking.\n\nThe distinction is important because there is a long history of argument about UG*, whereas most people working on language agree that there is universal grammar. Many people assume that Chomsky means UG* when he writes UG (and in some cases he might actually mean UG* [though not in the passage quoted above]).\n\nSome students of universal grammar study a variety of grammars to extract generalizations called linguistic universals, often in the form of \"If X holds true, then Y occurs.\" These have been extended to a variety of traits, such as the phonemes found in languages, the word orders which languages choose, and the reasons why children exhibit certain linguistic behaviors.\n\nLater linguists who have influenced this theory include Chomsky and Richard Montague, developing their version of this theory as they considered issues of the argument from poverty of the stimulus to arise from the constructivist approach to linguistic theory. The application of the idea of universal grammar to the study of second language acquisition (SLA) is represented mainly in the work of McGill linguist Lydia White.\n\nSyntacticians generally hold that there are parametric points of variation between languages, although heated debate occurs over whether UG constraints are essentially universal due to being \"hard-wired\" (Chomsky's principles and parameters approach), a logical consequence of a specific syntactic architecture (the generalized phrase structure approach) or the result of functional constraints on communication (the functionalist approach).\n\nIn an article titled, \"The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?\" Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch present the three leading hypotheses for how language evolved and brought humans to the point where they have a universal grammar.\n\nThe first hypothesis states that the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLb) is strictly homologous to animal communication.\nThis means that homologous aspects of the faculty of language exist in non-human animals.\n\nThe second hypothesis states that the FLb is a derived, uniquely human, adaptation for language. This hypothesis holds that individual traits were subject to natural selection and came to be specialized for humans.\n\nThe third hypothesis states that only the faculty of language in the narrow sense (FLn) is unique to humans. It holds that while mechanisms of the FLb are present in both human and non-human animals, the computational mechanism of recursion is recently evolved solely in humans. This is the hypothesis which most closely aligns to the typical theory of universal grammar championed by Chomsky.\n\nThe idea of a universal grammar can be traced back to Roger Bacon's observations in his \"Overview of Grammar\" and \"Greek Grammar\" that all languages are built upon a common grammar, even though it may undergo incidental variations; and the 13th century speculative grammarians who, following Bacon, postulated universal rules underlying all grammars. The concept of a universal grammar or language was at the core of the 17th century projects for philosophical languages. There is a Scottish school of universal grammarians from the 18th century, as distinguished from the philosophical language project, which included authors such as James Beattie, Hugh Blair, James Burnett, James Harris, and Adam Smith. The article on grammar in the first edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" (1771) contains an extensive section titled \"Of Universal Grammar\".\n\nThe idea rose to prominence and influence, in modern linguistics with theories from Chomsky and Montague in the 1950s–1970s, as part of the \"linguistics wars\".\n\nDuring the early 20th century, in contrast, language was usually understood from a behaviourist perspective, suggesting that language acquisition, like any other kind of learning, could be explained by a succession of trials, errors, and rewards for success. In other words, children learned their mother tongue by simple imitation, through listening and repeating what adults said. For example, when a child says \"milk\" and the mother will smile and give her some as a result, the child will find this outcome rewarding, thus enhancing the child's language development.\n\nChomsky argued that the human brain contains a limited set of constraints for organizing language. This implies in turn that all languages have a common structural basis: the set of rules known as \"universal grammar\".\n\nSpeakers proficient in a language know which expressions are acceptable in their language and which are unacceptable. The key puzzle is how speakers come to know these restrictions of their language, since expressions that violate those restrictions are not present in the input, indicated as such. Chomsky argued that this poverty of stimulus means that Skinner's behaviourist perspective cannot explain language acquisition. The absence of negative evidence—evidence that an expression is part of a class of ungrammatical sentences in a given language—is the core of his argument. For example, in English, an interrogative pronoun like \"what\" cannot be related to a predicate within a relative clause:\n\nSuch expressions are not available to language learners: they are, by hypothesis, ungrammatical. Speakers of the local language do not use them, or note them as unacceptable to language learners. Universal grammar offers an explanation for the presence of the poverty of the stimulus, by making certain restrictions into universal characteristics of human languages. Language learners are consequently never tempted to generalize in an illicit fashion.\n\nThe presence of creole languages is sometimes cited as further support for this theory, especially by Bickerton's controversial language bioprogram theory. Creoles are languages that develop and form when disparate societies come together and are forced to devise a new system of communication. The system used by the original speakers is typically an inconsistent mix of vocabulary items, known as a pidgin. As these speakers' children begin to acquire their first language, they use the pidgin input to effectively create their own original language, known as a creole. Unlike pidgins, creoles have native speakers (those with acquisition from early childhood) and make use of a full, systematic grammar.\n\nAccording to Bickerton, the idea of universal grammar is supported by creole languages because certain features are shared by virtually all in the category. For example, their default point of reference in time (expressed by bare verb stems) is not the present moment, but the past. Using pre-verbal auxiliaries, they uniformly express tense, aspect, and mood. Negative concord occurs, but it affects the verbal subject (as opposed to the object, as it does in languages like Spanish). Another similarity among creoles can be seen in the fact that questions are created simply by changing the intonation of a declarative sentence, not its word order or content.\n\nHowever, extensive work by Carla Hudson-Kam and Elissa Newport suggests that creole languages may not support a universal grammar at all. In a series of experiments, Hudson-Kam and Newport looked at how children and adults learn artificial grammars. They found that children tend to ignore minor variations in the input when those variations are infrequent, and reproduce only the most frequent forms. In doing so, they tend to standardize the language that they hear around them. Hudson-Kam and Newport hypothesize that in a pidgin-development situation (and in the real-life situation of a deaf child whose parents are or were disfluent signers), children systematize the language they hear, based on the probability and frequency of forms, and not that which has been suggested on the basis of a universal grammar. Further, it seems to follow that creoles would share features with the languages from which they are derived, and thus look similar in terms of grammar.\n\nMany researchers of universal grammar argue against a concept of relexification, which says that a language replaces its lexicon almost entirely with that of another. This goes against universalist ideas of a universal grammar, which has an innate grammar.\n\nGeoffrey Sampson maintains that universal grammar theories are not falsifiable and are therefore pseudoscientific. He argues that the grammatical \"rules\" linguists posit are simply post-hoc observations about existing languages, rather than predictions about what is possible in a language. Similarly, Jeffrey Elman argues that the unlearnability of languages assumed by universal grammar is based on a too-strict, \"worst-case\" model of grammar, that is not in keeping with any actual grammar. In keeping with these points, James Hurford argues that the postulate of a language acquisition device (LAD) essentially amounts to the trivial claim that languages are learnt by humans, and thus, that the LAD is less a theory than an explanandum looking for theories.\n\nMorten H. Christiansen and Nick Chater have argued that the relatively fast-changing nature of language would prevent the slower-changing genetic structures from ever catching up, undermining the possibility of a genetically hard-wired universal grammar. Instead of an innate universal grammar, they claim, \"apparently arbitrary aspects of linguistic structure may result from general learning and processing biases deriving from the structure of thought processes, perceptuo-motor factors, cognitive limitations, and pragmatics\".\n\nHinzen summarizes the most common criticisms of universal grammar:\n\nIn addition, it has been suggested that people learn about probabilistic patterns of word distributions in their language, rather than hard and fast rules (see Distributional hypothesis). For example, children overgeneralize the past tense marker \"ed\" and conjugate irregular verbs incorrectly, producing forms like \"goed\" and \"eated\" and correct these errors over time. It has also been proposed that the poverty of the stimulus problem can be largely avoided, if it is assumed that children employ \"similarity-based generalization\" strategies in language learning, generalizing about the usage of new words from similar words that they already know how to use.\n\nLanguage acquisition researcher Michael Ramscar has suggested that when children erroneously expect an ungrammatical form that then never occurs, the repeated failure of expectation serves as a form of implicit negative feedback that allows them to correct their errors over time such as how children correct grammar generalizations like \"goed\" to \"went\" through repetitive failure. This implies that word learning is a probabilistic, error-driven process, rather than a process of fast mapping, as many nativists assume.\n\nIn the domain of field research, the Pirahã language is claimed to be a counterexample to the basic tenets of universal grammar. This research has been led by Daniel Everett. Among other things, this language is alleged to lack all evidence for recursion, including embedded clauses, as well as quantifiers and colour terms. According to the writings of Everett, the Pirahã showed these linguistic shortcomings not because they were simple-minded, but because their culture—which emphasized concrete matters in the present and also lacked creation myths and traditions of art making—did not necessitate it. Some other linguists have argued, however, that some of these properties have been misanalyzed, and that others are actually expected under current theories of universal grammar. Other linguists have attempted to reassess Pirahã to see if it did indeed use recursion. In a corpus analysis of the Pirahã language, linguists failed to disprove Everett's arguments against universal grammar and the lack of recursion in Pirahã. However, they also stated that there was \"no strong evidence for the lack of recursion either\" and they provided \"suggestive evidence that Pirahã may have sentences with recursive\nstructures\".\n\nDaniel Everett has gone as far as claiming that universal grammar does not exist. In his words, \"universal grammar doesn't seem to work, there doesn't seem to be much evidence for [it]. And what can we put in its place? A complex interplay of factors, of which culture, the values human beings share, plays a major role in structuring the way that we talk and the things that we talk about.\" Michael Tomasello, a developmental psychologist, also supports this claim, arguing that \"although many aspects of human linguistic competence have indeed evolved biologically, specific grammatical principles and constructions have not. And universals in the grammatical structure of different languages have come from more general processes and constraints of human cognition, communication, and vocal-auditory processing, operating during the conventionalization and transmission of the particular grammatical constructions of particular linguistic communities.\"\n\n"}

In its strongest, unqualified form, the principle of wholistic reference is the proposition that each and every proposition, regardless how limited the referents of its non-logical or content terms, refers to the whole of its universe of discourse. According to this principle every proposition of number theory, even an equational proposition such as 5 + 7 = 12, refers not only to the individual numbers that it happens to mention but to the whole universe of numbers. The relation verb ‘refers’ is being used in its broad sense (loosely “is about”) and not as a synonym for ‘names’ in the sense of “is a name of”.\n\nGeorge Boole (1815–1864) introduced this principle into modern logic: Even though he changed from a monistic fixed-universe framework in his 1840s writings to a pluralistic multiple-universe framework in 1854, he never wavered in his frank avowal of the principle of wholistic reference. Indeed, he took it as an essential accompaniment to his theory of concept formation and proposition formation. For Boole, the essential first step in the process of conceiving of a proposition preliminary to making a judgement of its truth or falsity – or even using it in a deduction, however hypothetically – was to conceive of the universe of discourse. See Boole 1854/2003, xxi, 27, 42, 43. One statement of his principle is in the sentence immediately following his definition of universe of discourse, which is his first use of the expression 'universe of discourse' and probably the first in the history of the English language. See the next section.\n\nSimilar views, perhaps not similarly motivated, are found in later logicians, including Gottlob Frege (1848–1925). Some recent formulations of standard one-sorted first-order logic seem to be in accord with a form of it, if they do not actually imply the principle itself.\n"}
