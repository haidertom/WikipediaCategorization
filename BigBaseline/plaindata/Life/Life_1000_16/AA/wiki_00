She was born in New Orleans, Louisiana and grew up in the 3rd Ward. 3D Na'Tee has been featured on several national media outlets such as MTV, The Source Magazine, XXL Magazine, The Fader Magazine, RapRadar and RapRehab. She has also received attention from Louisiana newspapers and music magazines.\n\nIn her middle school years, 3D Na'Tee honed her skills by what is called in New Orleans, ribbin' (rib - ing). Most people know this as \"Playing the Dozens\". Someone would start a beat by beating on a lunch room table or a garbage can, and off she went, lyrically attacking someone who was bold enough to test her skill. The rhymes were mostly about what they were wearing, how lame they were, or silly they looked.\n\nIn 1999, she began recording with local label called Clientell Records. Over the next five years, she would record multiple mixtapes under the \"Snypa Squad\" and feature on other projects Clientell Records came out with. However, in 2006, a year after Hurricane Katrina, Clientell Records dismantled and 3D Na'Tee, who had previously established herself as a battler rapper amongst the local rap scene in New Orleans, released her first mix tape project \"3's Company Vol.1: The Rapper, The Hustler, the Diva\" followed by Volume 2 in 2007. After the release of her second project, she appeared on The Kush 2 DVD which was produced by YMCMB president Mack Maine. The DVD featured other Cash Money/Young Money artist like Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, and Birdman as well as Curren$y of Warner Bros. Records\n\nAfter the local success of her first two releases and her critically acclaimed appearance on The Kush 2, she released her third mix tape Heavy Is the head That Wears The Crown followed by a music video for a song she titled, Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner. That video piqued the interest of G-Unit Records affiliate and Shade 45 Sirius XM radio host Nelson Gomez who invited her to New York for an interview on his XM show as well as on rapper 50 Cents' wildly popular ThisIs50.com website. Soon after, the talk of her third release also got her featured in HipHop Weekly Magazine by Benzino, former co-owner of The Source Magazine.\n\nBecause of video releases like Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner which spoofed many mainstream hip hop artists, 3D Na'Tee's music has been described as controversial and sometimes offensive. That song also shared the title of her for mix tape released in 2010.\n\nGuess Who's Coming 2 Dinner (The Mixtape) lead to 3D Na'Tee being nominated for a total of 5 Nola HipHop Awards by her in her home town at the NOLA Hiphop Awards. She won three awards (the most awards won by a single artist) for Lyricist of the Year, Mixtape of the Year, and Female Artist of the Year. The mixtape included collaborations from Curren$y (courtesy of Warner Bros. Records), Ebony Eyez, and Babs Bunny (formally of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs) founded group, Da Band.\n\nIn early 2011 3D Na'Tee was featured on MTV's SuckerFree Freestyle hosted by DJ Envy. 3D Na'Tee and Syleena collaborated on a song called Go Head.\n\nJuly 27, 2011 3D Na'Tee released a video for Switch which she shot and edited herself. The song included several previously released instrumental versions of songs produced by super producer Timbaland. This video gained her a nomination for Director of the Year and an award for Video of the Year. Because of the momentum the Switch video gained the day of its release, Timbaland viewed it online and in less than 24 hours, flew 3D Na'Tee to Miami's Hit Factory Studio to work with her on her next project, The Coronation. After several months spent traveling with Timbaland and other artist signed to his label, a contract was presented to 3D Na'Tee to sign to Timbaland's production company Mosely Music Group and to be managed by members of Timbaland's management team. 3D Na'Tee and Timbaland later announced via Twitter that she was no longer a part of Timbaland's company because she decided not to sign the contract presented. In a later interview, 3D Na'Tee explained that there was no ill feelings towards Timbaland and cited her reasons for not signing were strictly because of contractual clauses that could not be agreed upon.\n\nExactly two years after 3D Na'Tee's last mix tape release, she released her highly anticipated street album \"The Coronation\" which featured artists like Keri Hilson, Young Fletcher, and Lyrica Anderson. The Coronation also featured production from Mizay Entertainment's Lex Luger, Maybach Music Group's Yung Shun, Heartbeatz, Casa Di, Versive Manhattan, Serious Beats, Da Smokestarz, among others.\n\nIn August 2012 it was announced by DJ Skee, Sirius Satellite Radio Host, that the first release from The Coronation entitled NO LOVE produced by MMG's Young Shun was the #9 most requested song in the country. The Coronation's second release, Lil Kim produced by Casa Di gained tons of recognition as well as it was featured on both The Source and The Fader Magazines' websites. Lil Kim was a cautionary tale of a young girl with an absentee father who, because of her father's absence, unfortunately grew up and \"fell in love\" too fast. The song and its video (directed by Charley Mac), gained a lot of attention from tons of hiphop artist like Trina, Missy Elliott, and Grammy Award Winning Chamillionaire, who featured 3D Na'Tee's video on his famed social site www.chamillionaire.com.\n\n\n"}

It was Kool Herc who coined the term B-boy and B-girls for the African American teenage Funk dancers that attended his earliest parties. Sasa along with the first generation B-boys, Trixie, Wallace, Dancing Doug, The Legendary Twins, DJ Clark Kent, Chip The Mad Hatter and a few others from Kool Herc's parties, set the foundation for the B-boy dance style in Hip-Hop taking it to the floor, performing acrobatic moves. Originating from the music of James Brown records and breakbeats, along with many other funk hits. The 3rd generation of dancers later introduced the B-boy dance as (Breakdancing) into the mass media, because of the popularity of Hip-Hop becoming a mainstream genre in the early 1980's.\n\nSasa was born in Manhattan New York City and raised in the West Bronx. From childhood he grew up dancing to R&B, Soul and Funk music, early on he began getting recognition from his school peers for his fine dancing skills at school parties and later in his teenage years. Many of his friends began inviting him to house parties where he made a name for himself on the dance floor with his unique style, especially at Kool Herc parties where the best dancers from all over the Bronx and Harlem went to get down, and even dancers from Brooklyn. The best B-boy dancer was given the title \"(A1).\" Sasa, like most of the \"first generation originals,\" stopped B-boy dancing by 1977. He retired undefeated never losing a B-boy battle. The original (1975-77) Zulu king's B-boys popularity and influence brought in the era of forming break crews also known as rockers, with the Zulu's adding \"new footwork and acrobatic tricks\" to the foundation of the dance, causing it to become a city-wide competitive trend amongst the youth, \"which established this performing art form between the years of 1973 to 1977. After that, new generation B-boy crews began to pop up in communities all across the city.\"\n\n"}

John Byl simplified Langton's automaton further, with an even smaller automaton that reproduced in just 25 time-steps. Byl's automaton consisted of an array of 12 chips — of which 4 or 5 could be counted as the instruction tape — and 43 transition rules, while Langton's device consisted of some 10×15 chips, including an instruction tape of 33 chips, plus some 190 transition rules.\n\nEssentially, the simplification consisted in using fewer cellular states (6 as compared with Langton's 8) and a smaller replicating loop (12 cells as compared with Langton's 86).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1170160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1170160", "title": "Chirality (mathematics)", "text": "Chirality (mathematics)\n\nIn geometry, a figure is chiral (and said to have chirality) if it is not identical to its mirror image, or, more precisely, if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by rotations and translations alone. An object that is not chiral is said to be achiral. In 3 dimensions, not all achiral objects have a mirror plane. For example, a 3-dimensional object with inversion centre as its only nontrivial symmetry operation is achiral but has no mirror plane.\n\nA chiral object and its mirror image are said to be enantiomorphs. The word \"chirality\" is derived from the Greek (cheir), the hand, the most familiar chiral object; the word \"enantiomorph\" stems from the Greek (enantios) 'opposite' + (morphe) 'form'. A non-chiral figure is called achiral or amphichiral.\n\nSome chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the helix, can be assigned a right or left handedness, according to the right-hand rule.\n\nMany other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves and shoes. Right shoes differ from left shoes only by being mirror images of each other. In contrast thin gloves may not be considered chiral if you can wear them inside-out.\n\nThe J, L, S and Z-shaped \"tetrominoes\" of the popular video game Tetris also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space. Individually they contain no mirror symmetry in the plane.\n\nA figure is achiral if and only if its symmetry group contains at least one \"orientation-reversing\" isometry. (In Euclidean geometry any isometry can be written as formula_1 with an orthogonal matrix formula_2 and a vector formula_3. The determinant of formula_2 is either 1 or −1 then. If it is −1 the isometry is \"orientation-reversing\", otherwise it is orientation-preserving.)\n\nSee for a full mathematical definition of chirality.\n\nIn three dimensions, every figure that possesses a mirror plane of symmetry \"S\", an inversion center of symmetry \"S\", or a higher improper rotation (rotoreflection) \"S\" axis of symmetry is achiral. (A \"plane of symmetry\" of a figure formula_5 is a plane formula_6, such that formula_5 is invariant under the mapping formula_8, when formula_6 is chosen to be the formula_10-formula_11-plane of the coordinate system. A \"center of symmetry\" of a figure formula_5 is a point formula_13, such that formula_5 is invariant under the mapping formula_15, when formula_13 is chosen to be the origin of the coordinate system.) Note, however, that there are achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry. An example is the figure\n\nwhich is invariant under the orientation reversing isometry formula_18 and thus achiral, but it has neither plane nor center of symmetry. The figure\n\nalso is achiral as the origin is a center of symmetry, but it lacks a plane of symmetry.\n\nNote also that achiral figures can have a center axis.\n\nIn two dimensions, every figure which possesses an axis of symmetry is achiral, and it can be shown that every \"bounded\" achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry. (An \"axis of symmetry\" of a figure formula_5 is a line formula_21, such that formula_5 is invariant under the mapping formula_23, when formula_21 is chosen to be the formula_10-axis of the coordinate system.) For that reason, a triangle is achiral if it is equilateral or isosceles, and is chiral if it is scalene.\n\nConsider the following pattern:\n\nThis figure is chiral, as it is not identical to its mirror image:\n\nBut if one prolongs the pattern in both directions to infinity, one receives an (unbounded) achiral figure which has no axis of symmetry. Its symmetry group is a frieze group generated by a single glide reflection.\n\nA knot is called achiral if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called a chiral knot. For example, the unknot and the figure-eight knot are achiral, whereas the trefoil knot is chiral.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56016131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56016131", "title": "CryptoKitties", "text": "CryptoKitties\n\nCryptoKitties is a blockchain based video game developed by Axiom Zen that allows players to purchase, collect, breed and sell various types of virtual cats. It represents one of the earliest attempts to deploy blockchain technology for recreational and leisurely purposes. The game's popularity in December 2017 congested the Ethereum network, causing it to reach an all-time high in transactions and slow down significantly.\n\nCryptoKitties is not a cryptocurrency. Instead it operates on Ethereum's underlying blockchain network, as a non fungible token (NFT) unique to each CryptoKitty. Each CryptoKitty is unique and owned by the user, validated through the blockchain, and its value can appreciate or depreciate based on the market. CryptoKitties cannot be replicated and cannot be transferred without the user's permission even by the game developers. Users can interact with their CryptoKitties, having the ability to buy, sell, and sire (breed) them. A test version of CryptoKitties was unveiled at ETH Waterloo on October 19, 2017, the largest Ethereum hackathon in the world. As of December 2, 2017, Genesis, the first and highest selling cat was sold for 246.9255 ETH (~$117,712 USD) on that day.\n\nThe virtual cats are breedable and carry a unique number and 256 bit distinct genome with DNA and different attributes (cattributes) that can be passed to offspring. Several traits can be passed down from the parents to the offspring. These include pattern, mouth (shape), fur, eye shape, base color, accent color, highlight color, eye color, and optional wild and environment characteristics. Other features like cool down times are not passed down but are instead a function of the 'generation' of the offspring, which is one higher than the maximum generation between the two parents. In December 2017 a CryptoKitty sold for $100,000.\n\nOn March 20, 2018, it was announced that \"CryptoKitties\" would be spun off into its own company and raised $12 million from several top venture capital firms and angel investors. The investment round was led by New York based Union Square Ventures and San Francisco based Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nIn May 2018, \"CryptoKitties\" launched their first celebrity-branded CryptoKitty with Stephen Curry, an American professional basketball player. As part of the partnership, Curry was given three CryptoKitties with special imagery, the first of which he put up for auction. The company later suspended the auction, claiming that Stephen Curry wasn't as involved as they initially thought. The company was later sued for trade secret theft over the Stephen Curry collectibles.\n\nIn October 2018, \"CryptoKitties\" reached the milestone of 1 million cats being bred with a volume of 3.2 million transactions on its smart contracts. In November 2018, Dapper Labs, which was spun out of Axiom Zen as the developer of \"CryptoKitties\", raised an additional $15 million in a venture round led by Venrock.The company doubled its valuation in this round.\n\nIn 2018 \"CryptoKitties\" will help the German museum ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe explain blockchain.\n\nA CryptoKitties' ownership is tracked via a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. CryptoKitties are distributed automatically, via smart contract, at the rate of one every 15 minutes (672 per week) for one year. Each CryptoKitty is represented in the form of a non-fungible ERC-721 token, which allows for each entity to have specific cattributes.\n\nBased on the limited number of cats going into circulation and their limited genomes, there is a limit of 4 billion total cats that can be bred. Each cat will have a distinct visual appearance (\"phenotype\") determined by its immutable genes (\"genotype\") stored in the smart contract. Because cats are tokens on a blockchain, they can be bought, sold, or transferred digitally, with strong guarantees of ownership. A CryptoKitty does not have a permanently assigned gender. While they can only engage in one breeding session at one time, each cat is able to act as either matron or sire. The owner chooses with each breeding interaction.\n\nA group known as Axiom Zen innovation studio developed the game. Until November 2018, Axiom Zen intends to continually release a new CryptoKitty every 15 minutes, with the rest of supply determined by breeding of CryptoKitties. CryptoKitty owners may put them up for sale via an auction for a price set in Ether (ETH).\n\nThere are concerns that \"CryptoKitties\" is crowding out more serious, significant business that use the Ethereum platform. As of December 5, 2017 Etherscan has reported a sixfold increase in pending transactions on Ethereum since the game's release just a week earlier. \"\"CryptoKitties\" has become so popular that it's taking up a significant amount of available space for transactions on the Ethereum platform\", said Garrick Hileman, from the University of Cambridge. Ethereum miners increased the gas limit in response to \"CryptoKitties\", which allowed for more data per block and increasing transactions per second.\n\n"}

They were created by Jim Lee and first appeared in \"WildC.A.T.s.\" #1 (August 1992).\n\nDaemonites are reptilian aliens from the planet Daemon, who are capable of possessing host bodies. Daemonites need to possess a host to survive on planets with a climate different from Daemon, like Earth (though a deal with the D'rahn eliminated this weakness from all Daemonites that resided on Earth at the time). When possessing a host, the Daemonite has access to all abilities that host has. A Daemonite can change his host into his true, Daemonite form, but can only maintain this form for a short period of time.\n\nSome Daemonites, particularly the more elite, are also avid shape-changers capable of taking on the physical form of whoever or whatever they see fit at will. Some of the stronger members of their race can also resume the semblance of inorganic substances e.i. metals, granules, liquids; in order to add to their own deadliness, even able to alternate while possessing a host. Albeit changing back rather quickly soon afterwards.\n\nDaemonites can survive for millennia and are possibly even immortal. They are capable of regenerating missing limbs and quickly recover from serious injuries able to heal from destroyed organs, critical injuries and heavy brain damage, though the healing capacity varies from Daemonite to Daemonite and few to most lack the capability to survive a destroyed head or brain. healing processes can be accelerated while within a host body as well.\n\nSome Daemonites even have a capacity for chronokinesis, having taught it to Voodoo of the WildC.A.Ts during her recovery process.\n\nHigher born Daemonite class' akin to Kherubim lords hold a plethora of new and exotic attributes open to them, This particular species genus are called Daemonite Royalty. This upper tier possess a number of traits that make them superior to their weaker kin such as complete bio-molecular physical control, hive mind collectives, multi-hosting and vast mental and physical energy manipulation. Four members of this group include Helspont, Defile, Hightower and S'Ryn each possessing hosts of unique abilities all their own.\n\nThe true form of the Daemonites differs depending on the artist, but generally includes dark green skin, long sharp claws, sharp teeth, and a hunched posture.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, which merges the Wildstorm universe, Daemonites take on a whole new look and feel while retaining many old aspects it shared in the Wildstorm imprint. For starters, The Daemonites have become a telepathic hive intelligence capable of not only reading and sharing thoughts between other Daemonites and their respective hosts. But are also avid mentalists capable of probing minds and having open mind to mind communications with other individuals, even being able to psionically track targets via their unique neural signal's.\n\nOther proclivities include an enhancement of their Metamorphosis capabilities to enable the phasing through solid matter with ease, akin to a martian.\n\nMillennia ago, the Daemonites discovered interstellar travel and started to conquer the universe. Their ability to possess other species gave them a distinct advantage over most species, allowing infiltration and survival in almost any environment. Their rise to power was unopposed until they encountered the Kherubim. The Kherubim were a noble race of nearly immortal warriors. Despite the Daemonites' ability to possess the Kherubim, the Kherubim's technology allowed them to detect possessed individuals. The war raged for millennia.\n\nA Daemonite vessel fought a Kherubim vessel near Earth, thousands of years ago. Both spaceships were damaged and crashlanded on Earth. The Daemonites decided to conquer this world and use its population as host bodies, while the Kherubim wanted to defend humanity. The Daemonite-Kherubim War inspired many tales of gods, demons, angels and monsters. Most of the Daemonites organised themselves as the Cabal and focused on the goal of Daemonite Reunification: a return to Daemon. They were opposed by multiple heroes, such as Axel Brass and the WildC.A.Ts.\n\nUnbeknownst to those stranded on Earth, the Kherubim won the war and imposed heavy reparations on Daemon. Daemonite society went bankrupt trying to pay and many Daemonites migrated to prosperous Khera, but were confined to ghettos.\n\nWhen the Daemonites on Earth found out, many of them ceased their quest for Reunification. Some settled down, others became mercenaries and others again, like Lord Helspont, now focused on increasing their own power and wealth. Helspont finds a 'sleeper ship' of Daemonites and manages to recruit them to his cause. Most of these Daemonites are slain by human police officers.\n\nLater, the Daemonite Lord Helspont found a Kheran World Shaper Engine on Earth and discovered that the Kherans were sending Shaper Engines across the universe to land on planets and turn them into ideal habitats for Kherubim. He also discovered that one of these engines had created new races across the universe, including the humans and Daemonites.\n\nSince DC Comics' The New 52 relaunch in 2011, the Daemonites have been featured in several series. Most notably, they play a central role in both the \"Voodoo\" and \"Grifter\" ongoing series, both featuring title characters who originated in the Wildstorm Universe. The Daemonites have also been featured in the relaunched \"Stormwatch\", \"Superman\", \"Demon Knights\" and \"Hawkman\" series. In \"Demon Knights\", they obliterate every incarnation of Camelot and attempt to slay Merlin to stop him creating them.\n\nWith the coming of the DC Rebirth publishing, Wildstorm characters have now undergone extensive revamp, once again with characters such as the WildC.A.T.S and Stormwatch being relegated to their own separate continuum. In the new continuity written and illustrated by Warren Ellis and Jon Davis-Hunt, The initial Daemonites appear on site at an old Internal Operations safe house where a firefight ensued between two separate factions who have powerful ties to the world at large. They would encounter another familiar face in Lucy Blaze who was dispatched by Stormwatch's ground division, who initially reacted with hostility to their presence. Said Daemonite commented that they were only observing, seeing that something new was going on and that Lucy should't interfere with it before fading away into the shadows.\n\nLittle is known about Daemonite culture. The Daemonites on Earth are ruled by three Lords or Royalty as coined by some of them. Most Daemonites on Earth are aggressive and completely devoted to the cause of Reunification. A process in which all existent Daemonites throughout the universe congregate at central focal point where a Lord resides to begin conquest of native worlds. \n\nOn Khera, the WildC.A.Ts encountered Daemonite civilians whose behaviour was very much like human behaviour. The Daemonites on Khera seemed to have a more tribal structure, but this could be a result of being confined to low-tech ghettos. After encountering peaceful Daemonites on Khera, the WildC.A.Ts have encountered several peaceful Daemonites on Earth as well.\n\nThe Daemonites on Khera showed WildC.A.Ts-member Voodoo, part Daemonite herself, rituals where Daemonites possessed other Daemonites. This ritual transferred memories, emotions and knowledge between Daemonites and forged a strong bond between Daemonites.\n\nThe strongest of Daemonites possess can grow into a host of special powers ranging to metamorphosis, structure merging, time manipulation, some psychic powers, etc. While the Daemonite Royalty come to withhold entirely unique powers and abilities all their own. Likewise, it is unknown if a Daemonite is either born into or becomes one\n\nWhile very little is known of the Daemonite social circle. There seem to be two main castes present within their species.\n\nDaemonites prefer to use their own natural abilities in battle, but their technology is very advanced. They have spaceships capable of interstellar flight. Nanotechnology allows them to create highly advanced weaponry in a short period of time. Mister Majestic discovered a Daemonite-built portal into the Bleed, allowing them to enter alternate dimensions.\n\nDaemonites on Earth often wear special \"stealth-suits\", hiding them from most forms of detection. Others wear \"flash-suits\", which are armoured and possess built-in weaponry.\n\n"}
{"id": "8221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8221", "title": "Death", "text": "Death\n\nDeath is the cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism. Phenomena which commonly bring about death include aging, predation, malnutrition, disease, suicide, homicide, starvation, dehydration, and accidents or major trauma resulting in terminal injury. In most cases, bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death.\n\nDeath – particularly the death of humans – has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion, due to the affection for the being that has died and the termination of social and familial bonds with the deceased. Other concerns include fear of death, necrophobia, anxiety, sorrow, grief, emotional pain, depression, sympathy, compassion, solitude, or saudade. Many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife, and also hold the idea of reward or judgement and punishment for past sin.\n\nThe word death comes from Old English \"dēaþ\", which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic *\"dauþuz\" (reconstructed by etymological analysis). This comes from the Proto-Indo-European stem *\"dheu-\" meaning the \"process, act, condition of dying\".\n\nThe concept and symptoms of death, and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums, have generated numerous scientific, legal, and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms for death. When a person has died, it is also said they have \"passed away\", \"passed on\", \"expired\", or are \"gone\", among numerous other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms. Bereft of life, the dead person is then a \"corpse\", \"cadaver\", a \"body\", a \"set of remains\", and when all flesh has rotted away, a skeleton. The terms \"carrion\" and \"carcass\" can also be used, though these more often connote the remains of non-human animals. As a polite reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the participle form of \"decease\", as in \"the deceased\"; another noun form is \"decedent\". The ashes left after a cremation are sometimes referred to by the neologism \"cremains\", a portmanteau of \"cremation\" and \"remains\".\n\nSenescence refers to a scenario when a living being is able to survive all calamities, but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age. Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning. Aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence, while around the world it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily (Hayflick & Moody, 2003).\n\nAlmost all animals who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from biological aging, known in life sciences as \"senescence\". Some organisms experience negligible senescence, even exhibiting biological immortality. These include the jellyfish \"Turritopsis dohrnii\", the hydra, and the planarian. Unnatural causes of death include suicide and homicide. From all causes, roughly 150,000 people die around the world each day.<ref name=\"doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011\"></ref> Of these, two thirds die directly or indirectly due to senescence, but in industrialized countries – such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany – the rate approaches 90%, i.e., nearly nine out of ten of all deaths are related to senescence.\n\nPhysiological death is now seen as a process, more than an event: conditions once considered indicative of death are now reversible. Where in the process a dividing line is drawn between life and death depends on factors beyond the presence or absence of vital signs. In general, clinical death is neither necessary nor sufficient for a determination of legal death. A patient with working heart and lungs determined to be brain dead can be pronounced legally dead without clinical death occurring. As scientific knowledge and medicine advance, formulating a precise medical definition of death becomes more difficult.\n\nSigns of death or strong indications that a warm-blooded animal is no longer alive are:\n\nThe concept of death is a key to human understanding of the phenomenon. There are many scientific approaches to the concept. For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases.\n\nOne of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from life. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems. Such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life. This general problem applies to the particular challenge of defining death in the context of medicine.\n\nIt is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers. Additionally, many religious traditions, including Abrahamic and Dharmic traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness. In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.\n\nOther definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something. In this context \"death\" describes merely the state where something has ceased, for example, life. Thus, the definition of \"life\" simultaneously defines death.\n\nHistorically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human's death have been subjective, or imprecise. Death was once defined as the cessation of heartbeat (cardiac arrest) and of breathing, but the development of CPR and prompt defibrillation have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events which were causally linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of life support devices, organ transplants and artificial pacemakers.\n\nToday, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to \"brain death\" or \"biological death\" to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of consciousness. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain sleep stages, and especially a coma. In the case of sleep, EEGs can easily tell the difference.\n\nThe category of \"brain death\" is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: \"By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant \"brain-dead\" women).\"\n\nThose people maintaining that only the neo-cortex of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of cognitive function, as evidenced by the death of the cerebral cortex. All hope of recovering human thought and personality is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death – irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex – has been adopted (for example the Uniform Determination Of Death Act in the United States). In 2005, the Terri Schiavo case brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of American politics.\n\nEven by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain drugs, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, or hypothermia can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.\n\nThe death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between different jurisdictions.\nA death certificate is issued in most jurisdictions, either by a doctor, or by an administrative office upon presentation of a doctor's declaration of death.\n\nThere are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then \"coming back to life\", sometimes days later in their own coffin, or when embalming procedures are about to begin. From the mid-18th century onwards, there was an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive, and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J.C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.\n\nIn cases of electric shock, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for an hour or longer can allow stunned nerves to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive. People found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an emergency room. In science fiction scenarios where such technology is readily available, real death is distinguished from reversible death.\n\nThe leading cause of human death in developing countries is infectious disease. The leading causes in developed countries are atherosclerosis (heart disease and stroke), cancer, and other diseases related to obesity and aging. By an extremely wide margin, the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging, leading to various complications known as aging-associated diseases. These conditions cause loss of homeostasis, leading to cardiac arrest, causing loss of oxygen and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the brain and other tissues. Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die of age-related causes. In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, approaching 90%. With improved medical capability, dying has become a condition to be managed. Home deaths, once commonplace, are now rare in the developed world.\nIn developing nations, inferior sanitary conditions and lack of access to modern medical technology makes death from infectious diseases more common than in developed countries. One such disease is tuberculosis, a bacterial disease which killed 1.8M people in 2015. Malaria causes about 400–900M cases of fever and 1–3M deaths annually. AIDS death toll in Africa may reach 90–100M by 2025.\n\nAccording to Jean Ziegler (United Nations Special Reporter on the Right to Food, 2000 – Mar 2008), mortality due to malnutrition accounted for 58% of the total mortality rate in 2006. Ziegler says worldwide approximately 62M people died from all causes and of those deaths more than 36M died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in micronutrients.\n\nTobacco smoking killed 100 million people worldwide in the 20th century and could kill 1 billion people around the world in the 21st century, a World Health Organization report warned.\n\nMany leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by diet and physical activity, but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human longevity. The evolutionary cause of aging is, at best, only just beginning to be understood. It has been suggested that direct intervention in the aging process may now be the most effective intervention against major causes of death.\n\nSelye proposed a unified non-specific approach to many causes of death. He demonstrated that stress decreases adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe the adaptability as a special resource, \"adaptation energy\". The animal dies when this resource is exhausted. Selye assumed that the adaptability is a finite supply, presented at birth. Later on, Goldstone proposed the concept of a production or income of adaptation energy which may be stored (up to a limit), as a capital reserve of adaptation. In recent works, adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the \"dominant path\" in the model of adaptation. It is demonstrated that oscillations of well-being appear when the reserve of adaptability is almost exhausted.\n\nIn 2012, suicide overtook car crashes for leading causes of human injury deaths in the U.S., followed by poisoning, falls and murder. Causes of death are different in different parts of the world. In high-income and middle income countries nearly half up to more than two thirds of all people live beyond the age of 70 and predominantly die of chronic diseases. In low-income countries, where less than one in five of all people reach the age of 70, and more than a third of all deaths are among children under 15, people predominantly die of infectious diseases.\n\nAn autopsy, also known as a \"postmortem examination\" or an \"obduction\", is a medical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a human corpse to determine the cause and manner of a person's death and to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present. It is usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a pathologist.\n\nAutopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from next of kin may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.\n\nA \"necropsy\" is an older term for a postmortem examination, unregulated, and not always a medical procedure. In modern times the term is more often used in the postmortem examination of the corpses of animals.\n\nCryonics (from Greek κρύος 'kryos-' meaning 'icy cold') is the low-temperature preservation of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and resuscitation may be possible in the future.\n\nCryopreservation of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology. The stated rationale for cryonics is that people who are considered dead by current legal or medical definitions may not necessarily be dead according to the more stringent information-theoretic definition of death. It is proposed that cryopreserved people might someday be recovered by using highly advanced technology.\n\nSome scientific literature supports the feasibility of cryonics. Many other scientists regard cryonics with skepticism. By 2015, more than 300 people have undergone cryopreservation procedures since cryonics was first proposed in 1962.\n\nLife extension refers to an increase in maximum or average lifespan, especially in humans, by slowing down or reversing the processes of aging. Average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to accidents and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as cancer, or cardiovascular disease. Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good diet, exercise and avoidance of hazards such as smoking. Maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is calorie restriction. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by periodic replacement of damaged tissues, or by molecular repair or rejuvenation of deteriorated cells and tissues.\n\nA United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people. 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.\n\nResearchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as \"biomedical gerontologists\". They try to understand the nature of aging and they develop treatments to reverse aging processes or to at least slow them down, for the improvement of health and the maintenance of youthful vigor at every stage of life. Those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called \"life extensionists\" or \"longevists\". The primary life extension strategy currently is to apply available anti-aging methods in the hope of living long enough to benefit from a complete cure to aging once it is developed.\n\n\"One of medicine's new frontiers: treating the dead\", recognizes that cells that have been without oxygen for more than five minutes die, not from lack of oxygen, but rather when their oxygen supply is resumed. Therefore, practitioners of this approach, e.g., at the Resuscitation Science institute at the University of Pennsylvania, \"aim to reduce oxygen uptake, slow metabolism and adjust the blood chemistry for gradual and safe reperfusion.\"\n\nBefore about 1930, most people in Western countries died in their own homes, surrounded by family, and comforted by clergy, neighbors, and doctors making house calls. By the mid-20th century, half of all Americans died in a hospital. By the start of the 21st century, only about 20 to 25% of people in developed countries died outside a medical institution. The shift away from dying at home, towards dying in a professionalized medical environment, has been termed the \"Invisible Death\". The \"Invisible Death\" process was extremely slow and infinitesimal. It took many years to shift to this new location where dying was commonly taking place outside the home.\n\nIn society, the nature of death and humanity's awareness of its own mortality has for millennia been a concern of the world's religious traditions and of philosophical inquiry. This includes belief in resurrection or an afterlife (associated with Abrahamic religions), reincarnation or rebirth (associated with Dharmic religions), or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist, known as eternal oblivion (associated with atheism).\n\nCommemoration ceremonies after death may include various mourning, funeral practices and ceremonies of honouring the deceased. The physical remains of a person, commonly known as a \"corpse\" or \"body\", are usually interred whole or cremated, though among the world's cultures there are a variety of other methods of mortuary disposal. In the English language, blessings directed towards a dead person include \"rest in peace\", or its initialism RIP.\n\nDeath is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. Much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the afterlife and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. The disposal of human corpses does, in general, begin with the last offices before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or cremation. This is not a unified practice; in Tibet, for instance, the body is given a sky burial and left on a mountain top. Proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one's spiritual attainments into another body (reincarnation) are subjects of detailed study in Tibet. Mummification or embalming is also prevalent in some cultures, to retard the rate of decay.\n\nLegal aspects of death are also part of many cultures, particularly the settlement of the deceased estate and the issues of inheritance and in some countries, inheritance taxation.\nCapital punishment is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. In most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated murder, espionage, treason, or as part of military justice. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as adultery and sodomy, carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as apostasy, the formal renunciation of one's religion. In many retentionist countries, drug trafficking is also a capital offense. In China, human trafficking and serious cases of corruption are also punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world courts-martial have imposed death sentences for offenses such as cowardice, desertion, insubordination, and mutiny.\n\nDeath in warfare and in suicide attack also have cultural links, and the ideas of dulce et decorum est pro patria mori, mutiny punishable by death, grieving relatives of dead soldiers and death notification are embedded in many cultures. Recently in the western world, with the increase in terrorism following the September 11 attacks, but also further back in time with suicide bombings, kamikaze missions in World War II and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history, death for a cause by way of suicide attack, and martyrdom have had significant cultural impacts.\n\nSuicide in general, and particularly euthanasia, are also points of cultural debate. Both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. In Japan, for example, ending a life with honor by seppuku was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional Christian and Islamic cultures, suicide is viewed as a sin. Death is personified in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the Grim Reaper, Azrael, the Hindu God Yama and Father Time.\n\nIn Brazil, a human death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório, a government-authorized registry. Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório. Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate mortality rates.\n\nTalking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures. Western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. Eastern societies (like India) may be more open to accepting it as a \"fait accompli\", with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open air burning-to-ashes of the same.\n\nMuch interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one's consciousness as one's body dies. The belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called \"eternal oblivion\". Belief that the stream of consciousness is preserved after physical death is described by the term \"afterlife\".\n\nAfter death the remains of an organism become part of the biogeochemical cycle. Animals may be consumed by a predator or a scavenger. Organic material may then be further decomposed by detritivores, organisms which recycle detritus, returning it to the environment for reuse in the food chain, where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of a living organism. Examples of detritivores include earthworms, woodlice and dung beetles.\n\nMicroorganisms also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be decomposed fully. Coal, a fossil fuel formed over vast tracts of time in swamp ecosystems, is one example.\n\nContemporary evolutionary theory sees death as an important part of the process of natural selection. It is considered that organisms less adapted to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the gene pool. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to extinction and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as speciation. Frequency of reproduction plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to Darwinian criteria, much greater fitness than a long-lived organism leaving only one.\n\nExtinction is the cessation of existence of a species or group of taxa, reducing biodiversity. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the capacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential range may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as Lazarus taxa, where species presumed extinct abruptly \"reappear\" (typically in the fossil record) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of speciation, an aspect of evolution. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an ecological niche – and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.\n\nInquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (exceptions include \"Hydra\" and the already cited jellyfish \"Turritopsis dohrnii\", which research shows to be biologically immortal). The evolutionary origin of senescence remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. Gerontology specializes in the science of human aging processes.\n\nOrganisms showing only asexual reproduction (e.g. bacteria, some protists, like the euglenoids and many amoebozoans) and unicellular organisms with sexual reproduction (colonial or not, like the volvocine algae \"Pandorina\" and \"Chlamydomonas\") are \"immortal\" at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident. In multicellular organisms (and also in multinucleate ciliates), with a Weismannist development, that is, with a division of labor between mortal somatic (body) cells and \"immortal\" germ (reproductive) cells, death becomes an essential part of life, at least for the somatic line.\n\nThe \"Volvox\" algae are among the simplest organisms to exhibit that division of labor between two completely different cell types, and as a consequence include death of somatic line as a regular, genetically regulated part of its life history.\n\nDeath is an important subject of religious doctrine.\n\nIn Buddhist doctrine and practice, death plays an important role. Awareness of death was what motivated Prince Siddhartha to strive to find the \"deathless\" and finally to attain enlightenment. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of having been born as a human being. Being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain enlightenment, therefore death helps remind oneself that one should not that for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove death anxiety, since all existence in the cycle of rebirth is considered filled with suffering, and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.\n\nDeath is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the Four Noble Truths and dependent origination.\n\nDeath is seen in Judaism as tragic and intimidating. Persons who come into contact with corpses are ritually impure. There are a variety of beliefs about the afterlife within Judaism, but none of them contradict the preference of life over death. This is partially because death puts a cessation to the possibility of fulfilling any commandments.\n\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "31537853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31537853", "title": "Death anxiety (psychology)", "text": "Death anxiety (psychology)\n\nDeath anxiety is anxiety caused by thoughts of death. One source defines death anxiety as a \"feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude (anxiety) when one thinks of the process of dying, or ceasing to 'be'\". Also referred to as thanatophobia (fear of death), death anxiety is distinguished from necrophobia, which is a specific fear of dead or dying people and/or things (i.e., fear of others who are dead or dying, not of one's own death or dying).\n\nAdditionally, there is anxiety caused by death-recent thought-content, which might be classified within a clinical setting by a psychiatrist as morbid and/or abnormal, which for classification pre-necessitates a degree of anxiety which is persistent and interferes with everyday functioning. Lower ego integrity, more physical problems and more psychological problems are predictive of higher levels of death anxiety in elderly people perceiving themselves close to death.\n\nDeath anxiety can cause extreme timidness with a person's attitude towards discussing organ donation and anything to do with death.\n\nRobert Langs distinguishes three types of death anxiety:\n\nPredatory death anxiety arises from the fear of being harmed. It is the most basic and oldest form of death anxiety, with its origins in the first unicellular organisms’ set of adaptive resources. Unicellular organisms have receptors that have evolved to react to external dangers, along with self-protective, responsive mechanisms made to increase the likelihood of survival in the face of chemical and physical forms of attack or danger. In humans, predatory death anxiety is evoked by a variety of danger situations that put one at risk or threaten one's survival. These traumas may be physical, psychological, or both. Predatory death anxiety mobilizes an individual's adaptive resources and leads to a fight-or-flight response: active efforts to combat the danger or attempts to escape the threatening situation.\n\nPredation or predator death anxiety is a form that arises when an individual harms another, physically and/or mentally. This form of death anxiety is often accompanied by unconscious guilt. This guilt, in turn, motivates and encourages a variety of self-made decisions and actions by the perpetrator of harm to others.\n\nExistential death anxiety stems from the basic knowledge that human life must end. Existential death anxiety is known to be the most powerful form. It is said that language has created the basis for existential death anxiety through communicative and behavioral changes. Other factors include an awareness of the distinction between self and others, a full sense of personal identity, and the ability to anticipate the future.\nAwareness of human mortality arose some 150,000 years ago. In that extremely short span of evolutionary time, humans have fashioned a single basic mechanism through which they deal with the existential death anxieties this awareness has evoked—denial. Denial is effected through a wide range of mental mechanisms and physical actions, many of which go unrecognized. While denial can be adaptive in limited use, excessive use is more common and is emotionally costly. Denial is the root of such diverse actions as breaking rules, violating frames and boundaries, manic celebrations, directing violence against others, attempting to gain extraordinary wealth and power—and more. These pursuits are often activated by a death-related trauma, and while they may lead to constructive actions, more often than not, they lead to actions that are damaging to self and others.\n\nSigmund Freud hypothesized that people express a fear of death, called thanatophobia. He said he saw this as a disguise for a deeper source of concern. It was not actually death that people feared, because in Freud's view nobody believes in their own death. The unconscious does not deal with the passage of time or with negations, which does not calculate amount of time left in one's life. Furthermore, that which one does fear cannot be death itself, because one has never died. People who express death-related fears, actually are trying to deal with unresolved childhood conflicts that they cannot come to terms with or express emotion towards. The name Thanatophobia is made from the Greek figure of death known as Thanatos.\n\nDevelopmental psychologist Erik Erikson formulated the psychosocial theory that explained that people progress through a series of crises as they grow older. The theory also envelops the concept that once an individual reaches the latest stages of life, they reach the level he titled as \"ego integrity\". Ego Integrity is when one comes to terms with their life and accepts it. It was also suggested that when a person reaches the stage of late adulthood they become involved in a thorough overview of their life to date. When one can find meaning or purpose in their life, they have reached the integrity stage. In opposition, when an individual views their life as a series of failed and missed opportunities, then they do not reach the ego integrity stage. Elders that have attained this stage of ego integrity are believed to exhibit less of an influence from death anxiety.\n\nErnest Becker based this theory on existential views which turned death anxiety theories towards a new dimension. It said that death anxiety is not only real, but also it is people's most profound source of concern. He explained the anxiety as so intense that it can generate fears and phobias of everyday life—Fears of being alone or in a confined space. Based on the theory, many of people's daily behavior consist of attempts to deny death and to keep their anxiety under strict regulation.\n\nAs an individual develops mortality salience, i.e. becomes more aware of the inevitability of death, they will instinctively try to suppress it out of fear. The method of suppression usually leads to mainstreaming towards cultural beliefs, leaning for external support rather than treading alone. This behavior may range from simply thinking about death to severe phobias and desperate actions.\n\nMohammad Samir Hossain postulated the Death and adjustment hypotheses. With the declaration of the hypotheses, two things were postulated. The first part of the hypotheses theorizes that death should not be considered the end of existence. The next segment states the belief that the immortal pattern of human existence can only be adopted in a morally rich life with the attitude towards morality and materialism balanced mutually.\n\nMartin Heidegger, the German philosopher, on the one hand showed death as something conclusively determined, in the sense that it is inevitable for every human being, while on the other hand, it unmasks its indeterminate nature via the truth that one never knows when or how death is going to come. Heidegger does not engage in speculation about whether being after death is possible. He argues that all human existence is embedded in time: past, present, future, and when considering the future, we encounter the notion of death. This then creates angst. Angst can create a clear understanding in one that death is a possible mode of existence, which Heidegger described as “clearing”. Thus, angst can lead to a freedom about existence, but only if we can stop denying our mortality (as expressed in Heidegger's terminology as “stop denying being-for-death”).\n\nPaul T. P. Wong's work on the meaning management theory indicates that human reactions to death are complex, multifaceted and dynamic. His “Death Attitude Profile” identifies three types of death acceptances as Neutral, Approach, and Escape acceptances. Apart from acceptances, his work also represents different aspects of the meaning of death fear that are rooted in the bases of death anxiety. The ten meanings he proposes are finality, uncertainty, annihilation, ultimate loss, life flow disruption, leaving the loved ones, pain and loneliness, prematurity and violence of death, failure of life work completion, judgment and retribution centered.\n\nOther theories on death anxiety were introduced in the late part of the twentieth century. The existential approach, with theorists such as Rollo May and Viktor Frankl, views an individual's personality as being governed by the continuous choices and decisions in relation to the realities of life and death. Another approach is the \"regret theory\" which was introduced by Adrian Tomer and Grafton Eliason. The main focus of the theory is to target the way people evaluate the quality and/or worth of their lives. The possibility of death usually makes people more anxious if they feel that they have not and cannot accomplish any positive task in the life that they are living. Research has tried to unveil the factors that might influence the amount of anxiety people experience in life.\n\nHumans develop meanings and associate them with objects and events in their environment, provoking certain emotions within an individual. People tend to develop personal meanings of death which could accordingly be negative or positive for the individual. If they are positive, then the consequences of those meanings can be comforting (for example, ideas of a rippling effect left on those still alive). If negative they can cause emotional turmoil. Depending on the certain meaning one has associated with death, the consequences will vary accordingly whether they are negative or positive meanings.\n\nThe thought of death causes a different degree of anxiety for different individuals, depending on many factors.\n\nA 2012 study involving Christian and Muslim college students from the US, Turkey, and Malaysia found that their religiosity was positively correlated with an increased fear of death.\n\nOther studies have found a strong sense of religion in a person's life can be related to a lower sense of anxiety towards death. Although there has been no association discovered between religiosity and death anxiety, it has also been shown that death anxiety tends to be lower in individuals who regularly attend religious meetings or gatherings. On a recent study, one hundred and sixty-five church participants have been asked to fill out the \"Intrinsic Religious Motivation Scale, the Revised Death Anxiety Scale\" and the results were analyzed using factor analyses, Pearson correlation, and linear and quadratic regression. All found an inverse relationship between intrinsic religious motivation and death anxiety. In short, the more religious you are, the less anxious you are about death because you may associate death with another beginning that is promised through many religions. The study also found that gender did not have an effect on religiosity and total death anxiety.\n\nThe earliest documentation of the fear of death has been found in children as young as age 5. Psychological measures and reaction times were used to measure fear of death in young children. Recent studies that assess fear of death in children use questionnaire rating scales. There are many tests to study this including The Death Anxiety Scale for Children (DASC) developed by Schell and Seefeldt. However the most common version of this test is the revised Fear Survey Schedule for Children (FSSC-R). The FSSC-R describes specific fearful stimuli and children are asked to rate the degree to which the scenario/item makes them anxious or fearful. The most recent version of the FSSC-R presents the scenarios in a pictorial form to children as young as 4. It is called the Koala Fear Questionnaire (KFQ). The fear studies show that children's fears can be grouped into five categories. One of these categories is death and danger. This response was found amongst children age 4 to 6 on the KFQ, and from age 7 to 10. Death is the most commonly feared item and remains the most commonly feared item throughout adolescence.\n\nA study of 90 children, aged 4–8, done by Virginia Slaughter and Maya Griffiths showed that a more mature understanding of the biological concept of death was correlated to a decreased fear of death. This may suggest that it is helpful to teach children about death (in a biological sense), in order to alleviate the fear.\n\nThere has been much literature that supports the existence of a correlation between one's state of coping skills, mental health, emotions and cognitive reactions to stressful events, and one's ability to regulate affect concerning one's death anxiety. A series of tests determined that significantly high levels of death anxiety tend to occur in close relationships with an intimate partner (more so amongst females than males).\n\nThe connection between death anxiety and one's sex appears to be strong. Studies show that females tend to have more death anxiety than males. Thorson and Powell (1984) did a study to investigate this connection, and they sampled men and women from 16 years of age to over 60. The Death Anxiety Scale showed higher mean scores for women than for men. Moreover, researchers believe that age and culture could be major influences in why women score higher on death anxiety scales than men.\n\nThrough the evolutionary period, a basic method was created to deal with death anxiety and also as a means of dealing with loss. Denial is used when memories or feelings are too painful to accept and are often rejected. By maintaining that the event never happened, rather than accepting it, allows an individual more time to work through the inevitable pain. When a loved one dies in a family, denial is often implemented as a means to come to grips with the reality that the person is gone. Closer families often deal with death better than when coping individually. As society and families drift apart so does the time spent bereaving those who have died, which in turn leads to negative emotion and negativity towards death. Women, who are the child bearers and are often the ones who look after children hold greater concerns about death due to their caring role within the family. It is this common role of women that leads to greater death anxiety as it emphasize the ‘importance to live’ for her offspring. Although it is common knowledge that all living creatures die, many people do not accept their own mortality, preferring not to accept that death is inevitable, and that they will one day die.\n\nIt is during the years of young adulthood (20 to 40 years of age) that death anxiety most often begins to become prevalent. However, during the next phase of life, the middle age adult years (40–64 years of age), death anxiety peaks at its highest levels when in comparison to all other age ranges throughout the lifespan. Surprisingly, levels of death anxiety then slump off in the old age years of adulthood (65 years of age and older). This is in contrast with most people's expectations, especially regarding all of the negative connotations younger adults have about the elderly and the aging process (Kurlychek & Trenner, 1982).\n\nThere are many ways to measure death anxiety and fear. Katenbaum and Aeinsberg (1972) devised three propositions for this measurement. From this start, the ideologies about death anxiety have been able to be recorded and their attributes listed. Methods such as imagery tasks to simple questionnaires and apperception tests such as the Stroop test enable psychologists to adequately determine if a person is under stress due to death anxiety or suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.\nThe Lester attitude death scale was developed in 1966 but not published until 1991 until its validity was proven. By measuring the general attitude towards death and also the inconsistencies with death attitudes, participants are scaled to their favorable value towards death.\n\n\n\n"}

Those who are dying may lose their ability to swallow and may have increased production of bronchial secretions, resulting in such an accumulation. Usually, two or three days earlier, the symptoms of approaching death can be observed as saliva accumulates in the throat, making it very difficult to take even a spoonful of water. Related symptoms can include shortness of breath and rapid chest movement. While death rattle is a strong indication that someone is near death, it can also be produced by other problems that cause interference with the swallowing reflex, such as brain injuries.\n\nIt is sometimes misinterpreted as the sound of the person choking to death, or alternatively, that they are gargling. \n\nThis symptom most commonly appears sometime during the last 24 hours of the person's life, although some people live somewhat longer.\n\nThe dying person is usually unaware of the noisy breathing and is not disturbed by it, but some healthcare providers attempt to minimize the sound for the emotional comfort of family members and caregivers. This may be done through repositioning the person, reducing the volume of IV fluids being given, or giving anticholinergic drugs to reduce secretions. In hospice and palliative care, drugs such as glycopyrronium, hyoscine hydrobromide (scopolamine) or atropine may be used for their anticholinergic effects to reduce secretions and minimize this effect.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44452821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44452821", "title": "Death trajectory", "text": "Death trajectory\n\nDeath trajectory refers to the pattern of dying when a patient is given a projected death date with limited or no medical recourse for the remaining existence of the individual's life. The death trajectory is dependent on the cause of death, whether it is sudden death, chronic illness, or the steady decline in health due to senescence (aging). Death trajectory is analyzed in two separate aspects: duration and shape. Duration refers to the period of time a patient has to live, which can be anywhere from imminent death to several months. Shape refers to how that duration is then graphed. In other words, the shape is \"the course of dying, its predictability, and whether death is expected or unexpected\".\nDying trajectories were first studied in the 1960s by two researchers, Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss, in an attempt to understand the end of human life from different ailments, including cancer.\n\nSudden or premature death occurs when the death of an individual is not perceived to be imminent. In a sudden death trajectory, an otherwise healthy and high-functioning individual will suddenly and unexpectedly die without any observable indications of oncoming demise. People are at a high or normal level of functioning until the moment of death occurs. These types of deaths include fatal accidents and inconspicuous health issues like myocardial infarction or severe stroke. Deaths that align with a sudden death trajectory may happen over the course of a few days or in a matter of seconds.\n\nThe chronic malady trajectory occurs with types of death caused by autoimmune diseases such as HIV or other incurable illnesses. This process of death is characterized by an overall decline in health accompanied by acute crises and intermittent recoveries. The chronic malady trajectory projects emotional stress or turmoil; the patient may eventually become mentally and emotionally exhausted.\n\nA natural death trajectory is typically a long, steady decline due to old age. In these cases, the death trajectory is based on how the mind and body degenerate, including the speed of organ failure. In these cases, it is much easier to anticipate a person's death.\n\nWhen someone has an estimated death date and a death trajectory, the patient's caregivers generally cease curative care and proceed to provide palliative or comfort care. Curative care refers to situations where the patient still feels it is possible to use current medical care to recover or become stable enough to carry on with life. Comfort care, or hospice care, is reserved for patients who acknowledge they will not be able to recover.\n\n"}

The result might look like an avatar behaving, reacting, and thinking like a person on the basis of that person's digital archive. After the death of the individual, this avatar could remain static or continue to learn and develop autonomously.\n\nA considerable portion of transhumanists and singularitarians place great hope into the belief that they may become immortal by the year 2045, by creating one or many non-biological functional copies of their brains, thereby leaving their \"biological shell\". These copies may then \"live eternally\" in a version of digital \"heaven\" or paradise.\n\nThe National Science Foundation has awarded a half-million-dollar grant to the universities of Central Florida at Orlando and Illinois at Chicago to explore how researchers might use artificial intelligence, archiving, and computer imaging to create convincing, digital versions of real people, a possible first step toward virtual immortality.\n\nThe Digital Immortality Institute explores three factors necessary for digital immortality. First, at whatever level of implementation, avatars require guaranteed Internet accessibility. Next, avatars must be what users specify, and they must remain so. Finally, future representations must be secured before the living users are no more.\n\nThe aim of Dmitry Itskov's 2045 Initiative is to \"create technologies enabling the transfer of an individual’s personality to a non-biological carrier, and extending existence, including to the point of immortality\".\n\nReaching digital immortality is a two-step process:\n\nAccording to Gordon Bell and Jim Gray from Microsoft Research, retaining every conversation that a person has ever heard is already realistic: it needs less than a terabyte of storage (for adequate quality). The speech or text recognition technologies are one of the biggest challenges of the concept.\n\nA second possibility would be to archive and analyze social Internet use to map the personality of people. By analyzing social Internet use during 50 years, it would be possible to model a society's culture, a society's way of thinking, and a society's interests.\n\nRothblatt envisions the creation of \"mindfiles\" – collections of data from all kinds of sources, including the photos we upload to Facebook, the discussions and opinions we share on forums or blogs, and other social media interactions that reflect our life experiences and our unique self.\n\nRichard Grandmorin summarized the concept of digital immortality by the following equation: \"semantic analysis + social internet use + Artificial Intelligence = immortality\".\n\nSome find that photos, videos, soundclips, social media posts and other data of oneself could already be regarded as such an archiving.\n\nSusanne Asche states:\nDefining the avatar to be alive allows it to communicate with the future in the sense that it continues to learn, evolve and interact with people, if they still exist. Technically, the operation exists to implement an artificial intelligence system to the avatar. This artificial intelligence system is then assumed to think and will react on the base of the archive.\n\nRothblatt proposes the term \"mindware\" for software that is being developed with the goal of generating conscious AIs. Such software would read a person's \"mindfile\" to generate a \"mindclone.\" Rothblatt also proposes a certain level of governmental approval for mindware, like an FDA certification, to ensure that the resulting mindclones are well made.\n\nDuring the calibration process, the biological people are living at the same time as their artifact in silicon. The artifact in silicon is calibrated to be as close as possible to the person in question.\nDuring this process ongoing updates, synchronization, and interaction between the two minds would maintain the twin minds as one.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2667092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2667092", "title": "Everyday life", "text": "Everyday life\n\nEveryday life, daily life or routine life comprises the ways in which people typically act, think, and feel on a daily basis. Everyday life may be described as mundane, routine, natural, habitual, or normal.\n\nHuman diurnality means most people sleep at least part of the night and are active in daytime. Most eat two or three meals in a day. Working time (apart from shift work) mostly involves a daily schedule, beginning in the morning. This produces the daily rush hours experienced by many millions, and the drive time focused on by radio broadcasters. Evening is often leisure time. Bathing every day is a custom for many.\n\nBeyond these broad similarities, lifestyles vary and different people spend their days differently. Nomadic life differs from sedentism, and among the sedentary, urban people live differently from rural folk. Differences in the lives of the rich and the poor, or between factory workers and intellectuals, may go beyond their working hours. Many women spend their day in activities greatly different from those of men, and everywhere children do different things than adults.\n\nEveryday life is a key concept in cultural studies and is a specialized subject in the field of sociology. Some argue that, motivated by capitalism and industrialism's degrading effects on human existence and perception, writers and artists of the 19th century turned more towards self-reflection and the portrayal of everyday life represented in their writings and art to a noticeably greater degree than in past works, for example Renaissance literature's interest in hagiography and politics. Other theorists dispute this argument based on a long history of writings about daily life which can be seen in works from Ancient Greece, medieval Christianity and the Age of Enlightenment.\n\nIn the study of everyday life gender has been an important factor in its conceptions. Some theorists regard women as the quintessential representatives and victims of everyday life. \n\nThe connotation of everyday life is often negative and is distinctively separated from exceptional moments by its lack of distinction and differentiation, ultimately defined as the essential, taken-for-granted continuum of mundane activity that outlines forays into more esoteric experiences. It is the non-negotiable reality that exists amongst all social groupings without discrimination and is an unavoidable basis for which all human endeavor exists.\n\nMuch of everyday life is automatic in that it is driven by current environmental features as mediated by automatic cognitive processing of those features, and without any mediation by conscious choice, according to social psychologist John A. Bargh. Daily life is also studied by sociologists to investigate how it is organised and given meaning. A sociological journal called the \"Journal of Mundane Behavior\", published 2000 - 2004, studied these everyday actions.\n\nDaily entertainment once consisted mainly of telling stories in the evening. This custom developed into the theatre of ancient Greece and other professional entertainments. Reading later became less a mysterious specialty of scholars, and more a common pleasure for people who could afford books. During the 20th century mass media became prevalent in rich countries, creating among other things a daily prime time to consume fiction and other professionally produced works.\n\nDifferent media forms serve different purposes in different individuals' everyday lives—which give people the opportunities to make choices about what media form(s)--watching television, using the Internet, listening to the radio, or reading newspapers or magazines—most effectively help them to accomplish their tasks. Many people have steadily increased their daily use of the Internet, over all other media forms. Fearing changes promoted by mass entertainment, social conservatives have long censored books and films, called television a vast wasteland, and predicted that social media and other Internet sites would distract people from good personal relationships or valuable interactions. These concerns did not prevent the progressively wider popularity of these innovations.\n\nPeople's everyday lives are shaped through language and communication. They choose what to do with their time based on opinions and ideals formed through the discourse they are exposed to. Much of the dialogue people are subject to comes from the mass media, which is an important factor in what shapes human experience. The media uses language to make an impact on one’s everyday life, whether that be as small as helping to decide where to eat or as big as choosing a representative in government.\n\nTo improve people's everyday life, Phaedra Pezzullo, professor in the Department of Communication and Culture at Indiana University Bloomington, says people should seek to understand the rhetoric that so often and unnoticeably changes their lives. She writes that “...rhetoric enables us to make connections... It's about understanding how we engage with the world.”\n\nActivities of daily living (ADL) is a term used in healthcare to refer to daily self care activities within an individual's place of residence, in outdoor environments, or both. Health professionals routinely refer to the ability or inability to perform ADLs as a measurement of the functional status of a person, particularly in regard to people with disabilities and the elderly. ADLs are defined as \"the things we normally do...such as feeding ourselves, bathing, dressing, grooming, work, homemaking, and leisure.\" The ability and the extent to which the elderly can perform these activities is at the focus of gerontology and understandings of later life. In an 'active society' which sees mobility as an important norm, constant physical activity has replaced the striving towards personal growth in later life.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9593", "title": "Existentialism", "text": "Existentialism\n\nExistentialism () is a tradition of philosophical inquiry associated mainly with certain 19th and 20th-century European philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences, shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject—not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individual. While the predominant value of existentialist thought is commonly acknowledged to be freedom, its primary virtue is authenticity. In the view of the existentialist, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called \"the existential attitude\", or a sense of disorientation, confusion, or dread in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world. Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.\n\nSøren Kierkegaard is generally considered to have been the first existentialist philosopher, though he did not use the term existentialism. He proposed that each individual—not society or religion—is solely responsible for giving meaning to life and living it passionately and sincerely, or \"authentically\". Existentialism became popular in the years following World War II, and strongly influenced many disciplines besides philosophy, including theology, drama, art, literature, and psychology.\n\nThe term \"existentialism\" (French: \"L'existentialisme\") was coined by the French Catholic philosopher Gabriel Marcel in the mid-1940s. At first, when Marcel applied the term to him at a colloquium in 1945, Jean-Paul Sartre rejected it. Sartre subsequently changed his mind and, on October 29, 1945, publicly adopted the existentialist label in a lecture to the \"Club Maintenant\" in Paris. The lecture was published as \"L'existentialisme est un humanisme\" (\"Existentialism is a Humanism\"), a short book that did much to popularize existentialist thought. Marcel later came to reject the label himself in favour of the term Neo-Socratic, in honor of Kierkegaard's essay \"On The Concept of Irony\".\n\nSome scholars argue that the term should be used only to refer to the cultural movement in Europe in the 1940s and 1950s associated with the works of the philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Albert Camus. Other scholars extend the term to Kierkegaard, and yet others extend it as far back as Socrates. However, the term is often identified with the philosophical views of Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nThe labels \"existentialism\" and \"existentialist\" are often seen as historical conveniences in as far as they were first applied to many philosophers in hindsight, long after they had died. In fact, while existentialism is generally considered to have originated with Kierkegaard, the first prominent existentialist philosopher to adopt the term as a self-description was Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartre posits the idea that \"what all existentialists have in common is the fundamental doctrine that existence precedes essence\", as scholar Frederick Copleston explains. According to philosopher Steven Crowell, defining existentialism has been relatively difficult, and he argues that it is better understood as a general approach used to reject certain systematic philosophies rather than as a systematic philosophy itself. Sartre himself, in a lecture delivered in 1945, described existentialism as \"the attempt to draw all the consequences from a position of consistent atheism\".\n\nAlthough many outside Scandinavia consider the term existentialism to have originated from Kierkegaard himself, it is more likely that Kierkegaard adopted this term (or at least the term \"existential\" as a description of his philosophy) from the Norwegian poet and literary critic Johan Sebastian Cammermeyer Welhaven. This assertion comes from two sources. The Norwegian philosopher Erik Lundestad refers to the Danish philosopher Fredrik Christian Sibbern. Sibbern is supposed to have had two conversations in 1841, the first with Welhaven and the second with Kierkegaard. It is in the first conversation that it is believed that Welhaven came up with \"a word that he said covered a certain thinking, which had a close and positive attitude to life, a relationship he described as existential\". This was then brought to Kierkegaard by Sibbern.\n\nThe second claim comes from the Norwegian historian Rune Slagstad, who claims to prove that Kierkegaard himself said the term \"existential\" was borrowed from the poet. He strongly believes that it was Kierkegaard himself who said that \"Hegelians do not study philosophy 'existentially'; to use a phrase by Welhaven from one time when I spoke with him about philosophy\".\n\nSartre claimed that a central proposition of Existentialism is that \"existence precedes essence\", which means that the most important consideration for individuals is that they are individuals—independently acting and responsible, conscious beings (\"existence\")—rather than what labels, roles, stereotypes, definitions, or other preconceived categories the individuals fit (\"essence\"). The actual life of the individuals is what constitutes what could be called their \"true essence\" instead of there being an arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Thus, human beings, through their own consciousness, create their own values and determine a meaning to their life. Although it was Sartre who explicitly coined the phrase, similar notions can be found in the thought of existentialist philosophers such as Heidegger, and Kierkegaard:\n\nSome interpret the imperative to define oneself as meaning that anyone can wish to be anything. However, an existentialist philosopher would say such a wish constitutes an inauthentic existence - what Sartre would call 'bad faith'. Instead, the phrase should be taken to say that people are (1) defined only insofar as they act and (2) that they are responsible for their actions. For example, someone who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel person. Furthermore, by this action of cruelty, such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity (cruel persons). This is as opposed to their genes, or \"human nature\", bearing the blame.\n\nAs Sartre says in his lecture \"Existentialism is a Humanism\": \"... man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world—and defines himself afterwards\". The more positive, therapeutic aspect of this is also implied: A person can choose to act in a different way, and to be a good person instead of a cruel person.\n\nSartre's definition of existentialism was based on Heidegger's magnum opus \"Being and Time\". In the correspondence with Jean Beaufret later published as the \"Letter on Humanism\", Heidegger implies that Sartre misunderstood him for his own purposes of subjectivism, and that he did not mean that actions take precedence over being so long as those actions were not reflected upon. Heidegger commented that \"the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement\", meaning that he thought Sartre had simply switched the roles traditionally attributed to essence and existence without interrogating these concepts and their history in the way that Heidegger claimed to have done.\n\nThe notion of the Absurd contains the idea that there is no meaning in the world beyond what meaning we give it. This meaninglessness also encompasses the amorality or \"unfairness\" of the world. This conceptualization can be highlighted in the way it opposes the traditional Judeo-Christian-Islamic perspective, which establishes that life's purpose is about the fulfillment of God's commandments. Such a purpose is what gives meaning to people's lives. To live the life of the absurd means rejecting a life that finds or pursues specific meaning for man's existence since there is nothing to be discovered. According to Albert Camus, the world or the human being is not in itself absurd. The concept only emerges through the juxtaposition of the two, where life becomes absurd due to the incompatibility between human beings and the world they inhabit. This view constitutes one of the two interpretations of the absurd in existentialist literature. The second view, which was first elaborated by Søren Kierkegaard, holds that absurdity is limited to actions and choices of human beings. These are considered absurd since they issue from human freedom, undermining their foundation outside of themselves.\n\nThe notion of the absurd in existentialism contrasts with the claim that \"bad things don't happen to good people\"; to the world, metaphorically speaking, there is no such thing as a good person or a bad person; what happens happens, and it may just as well happen to a \"good\" person as to a \"bad\" person. Because of the world's absurdity, at any point in time, anything can happen to anyone, and a tragic event could plummet someone into direct confrontation with the Absurd. The notion of the Absurd has been prominent in literature throughout history. Many of the literary works of Søren Kierkegaard, Samuel Beckett, Franz Kafka, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Eugène Ionesco, Miguel de Unamuno, Luigi Pirandello, Jean-Paul Sartre, Joseph Heller and Albert Camus contain descriptions of people who encounter the absurdity of the world.\n\nIt is in relation to the concept of the devastating awareness of meaninglessness that Albert Camus claimed that \"there is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide\" in his \"The Myth of Sisyphus\". Although \"prescriptions\" against the possibly deleterious consequences of these kinds of encounters vary, from Kierkegaard's religious \"stage\" to Camus' insistence on persevering in spite of absurdity, the concern with helping people avoid living their lives in ways that put them in the perpetual danger of having everything meaningful break down is common to most existentialist philosophers. The possibility of having everything meaningful break down poses a threat of quietism, which is inherently against the existentialist philosophy. It has been said that the possibility of suicide makes all humans existentialists. The ultimate hero of absurdism lives without meaning and faces suicide without succumbing to it.\n\nFacticity is a concept defined by Sartre in \"Being and Nothingness\" as the \"in-itself\", which delineates for humans the modalities of being and not being. This can be more easily understood when considering facticity in relation to the temporal dimension of our past: one's past is what one is, in the sense that it co-constitutes oneself. However, to say that one is only one's past would be to ignore a significant part of reality (the present and the future), while saying that one's past is only what one was, would entirely detach it from oneself now. A denial of one's own concrete past constitutes an inauthentic lifestyle, and the same goes for all other kinds of facticity (having a human body — e.g., one that doesn't allow a person to run faster than the speed of sound — identity, values, etc.).\n\nFacticity is both a limitation and a condition of freedom. It is a limitation in that a large part of one's facticity consists of things one couldn't have chosen (birthplace, etc.), but a condition of freedom in the sense that one's values most likely depend on it. However, even though one's facticity is \"set in stone\" (as being past, for instance), it cannot determine a person: The value ascribed to one's facticity is still ascribed to it freely by that person. As an example, consider two men, one of whom has no memory of his past and the other who remembers everything. They both have committed many crimes, but the first man, knowing nothing about this, leads a rather normal life while the second man, feeling trapped by his own past, continues a life of crime, blaming his own past for \"trapping\" him in this life. There is nothing essential about his committing crimes, but he ascribes this meaning to his past.\n\nHowever, to disregard one's facticity when, in the continual process of self-making, one projects oneself into the future, that would be to put oneself in denial of oneself, and thus would be inauthentic. In other words, the origin of one's projection must still be one's facticity, though in the mode of not being it (essentially). An example of one focusing solely on one's possible projects without reflecting on one's current facticity: if one continually thinks about future possibilities related to being rich (e.g. a better car, bigger house, better quality of life, etc.) without considering the facticity of \"not currently having the financial means to do so\". In this example, considering both facticity and transcendence, an authentic mode of being would be considering future projects that might improve one's current finances (e.g. putting in extra hours, or investing savings) in order to arrive at a \"future-facticity\" of a modest pay rise, further leading to purchase of an affordable car.\n\nAnother aspect of facticity is that it entails angst, both in the sense that freedom \"produces\" angst when limited by facticity, and in the sense that the lack of the possibility of having facticity to \"step in\" for one to take responsibility for something one has done, also produces angst.\n\nAnother aspect of existential freedom is that one can change one's values. Thus, one is responsible for one's values, regardless of society's values. The focus on freedom in existentialism is related to the limits of the responsibility one bears, as a result of one's freedom: the relationship between freedom and responsibility is one of interdependency, and a clarification of freedom also clarifies that for which one is responsible.\n\nMany noted existentialist writers consider the theme of authentic existence important. Authentic existence involves the idea that one has to \"create oneself\" and then live in accordance with this self. What is meant by authenticity is that in acting, one should act as oneself, not as \"one's acts\" or as \"one's genes\" or any other essence requires. The authentic act is one that is in accordance with one's freedom. As a condition of freedom is facticity, this includes one's facticity, but not to the degree that this facticity can in any way determine one's transcendent choices (in the sense that one could then blame one's background [facticity] for making the choice one made [chosen project, from one's transcendence]). The role of facticity in relation to authenticity involves letting one's actual values come into play when one makes a choice (instead of, like Kierkegaard's Aesthete, \"choosing\" randomly), so that one also takes responsibility for the act instead of choosing either-or without allowing the options to have different values.\n\nIn contrast to this, the inauthentic is the denial to live in accordance with one's freedom. This can take many forms, from pretending choices are meaningless or random, through convincing oneself that some form of determinism is true, to a sort of \"mimicry\" where one acts as \"one should\".\n\nHow \"one should\" act is often determined by an image one has, of how one such as oneself (say, a bank manager, lion tamer, prostitute, etc.) acts. In Being and Nothingness, Sartre relates an example of a \"waiter\" in \"bad faith\": he merely takes part in the \"act\" of being a typical waiter, albeit very convincingly. This image usually corresponds to some sort of social norm, but this does not mean that all acting in accordance with social norms is inauthentic: The main point is the attitude one takes to one's own freedom and responsibility, and the extent to which one acts in accordance with this freedom.\n\nThe Other (when written with a capital \"O\") is a concept more properly belonging to phenomenology and its account of intersubjectivity. However, the concept has seen widespread use in existentialist writings, and the conclusions drawn from it differ slightly from the phenomenological accounts. The experience of the Other is the experience of another free subject who inhabits the same world as a person does. In its most basic form, it is this experience of the Other that constitutes intersubjectivity and objectivity. To clarify, when one experiences someone else, and this Other person experiences the world (the same world that a person experiences)—only from \"over there\"—the world itself is constituted as objective in that it is something that is \"there\" as identical for both of the subjects; a person experiences the other person as experiencing the same things. This experience of the Other's look is what is termed the Look (sometimes the Gaze).\n\nWhile this experience, in its basic phenomenological sense, constitutes the world as objective, and oneself as objectively existing subjectivity (one experiences oneself as seen in the Other's Look in precisely the same way that one experiences the Other as seen by him, as subjectivity), in existentialism, it also acts as a kind of limitation of freedom. This is because the Look tends to objectify what it sees. As such, when one experiences oneself in the Look, one doesn't experience oneself as nothing (no thing), but as something. Sartre's own example of a man peeping at someone through a keyhole can help clarify this: at first, this man is entirely caught up in the situation he is in; he is in a pre-reflexive state where his entire consciousness is directed at what goes on in the room. Suddenly, he hears a creaking floorboard behind him, and he becomes aware of himself as seen by the Other. He is thus filled with shame for he perceives himself as he would perceive someone else doing what he was doing, as a Peeping Tom. The Look is then co-constitutive of one's facticity.\n\nAnother characteristic feature of the Look is that no Other really needs to have been there: It is quite possible that the creaking floorboard was nothing but the movement of an old house; the Look isn't some kind of mystical telepathic experience of the actual way the other sees one (there may also have been someone there, but he could have not noticed that the person was there). It is only one's perception of the way another might perceive him.\n\n\"Existential angst\", sometimes called existential dread, anxiety, or anguish, is a term that is common to many existentialist thinkers. It is generally held to be a negative feeling arising from the experience of human freedom and responsibility. The archetypical example is the experience one has when standing on a cliff where one not only fears falling off it, but also dreads the possibility of throwing oneself off. In this experience that \"nothing is holding me back\", one senses the lack of anything that predetermines one to either throw oneself off or to stand still, and one experiences one's own freedom. Angst, according to the modern existentialist, Adam Fong, is the sudden realization of a lack of meaning, often while one completes a task that initially seems to have intrinsic meaning.\n\nIt can also be seen in relation to the previous point how angst is before nothing, and this is what sets it apart from fear that has an object. While in the case of fear, one can take definitive measures to remove the object of fear, in the case of angst, no such \"constructive\" measures are possible. The use of the word \"nothing\" in this context relates both to the inherent insecurity about the consequences of one's actions, and to the fact that, in experiencing freedom as angst, one also realizes that one is fully responsible for these consequences. There is nothing in people (genetically, for instance) that acts in their stead—that they can blame if something goes wrong. Therefore, not every choice is perceived as having dreadful possible consequences (and, it can be claimed, human lives would be unbearable if every choice facilitated dread). However, this doesn't change the fact that freedom remains a condition of every action.\n\nDespair, in existentialism, is generally defined as a loss of hope. More specifically, it is a loss of hope in reaction to a breakdown in one or more of the defining qualities of one's self or identity. If a person is invested in being a particular thing, such as a bus driver or an upstanding citizen, and then finds their being-thing compromised, they would normally be found in a state of despair—a hopeless state. For example, a singer who loses the ability to sing may despair if they have nothing else to fall back on—nothing to rely on for their identity. They find themselves unable to be what defined their being.\n\nWhat sets the existentialist notion of despair apart from the conventional definition is that existentialist despair is a state one is in even when they aren't overtly in despair. So long as a person's identity depends on qualities that can crumble, they are in perpetual despair—and as there is, in Sartrean terms, no human essence found in conventional reality on which to constitute the individual's sense of identity, despair is a universal human condition. As Kierkegaard defines it in \"Either/Or\": \"Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person’s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy.\" In \"Works of Love\", he said: \n\nExistentialists oppose definitions of human beings as primarily rational, and, therefore, oppose positivism and rationalism. Existentialism asserts that people actually make decisions based on subjective meaning rather than pure rationality. The rejection of reason as the source of meaning is a common theme of existentialist thought, as is the focus on the feelings of anxiety and dread that we feel in the face of our own radical freedom and our awareness of death. Kierkegaard advocated rationality as a means to interact with the objective world (e.g., in the natural sciences), but when it comes to existential problems, reason is insufficient: \"Human reason has boundaries\".\n\nLike Kierkegaard, Sartre saw problems with rationality, calling it a form of \"bad faith\", an attempt by the self to impose structure on a world of phenomena—\"the Other\"—that is fundamentally irrational and random. According to Sartre, rationality and other forms of bad faith hinder people from finding meaning in freedom. To try to suppress their feelings of anxiety and dread, people confine themselves within everyday experience, Sartre asserts, thereby relinquishing their freedom and acquiescing to being possessed in one form or another by \"the Look\" of \"the Other\" (i.e., possessed by another person—or at least one's idea of that other person).\n\nAn existentialist reading of the Bible would demand that the reader recognize that (s)he is an existing subject studying the words more as a recollection of events. This is in contrast to looking at a collection of \"truths\" that are outside and unrelated to the reader, but may develop a sense of reality/God. Such a reader is not obligated to follow the commandments as if an external agent is forcing these commandments upon them, but as though they are inside them and guiding them from inside. This is the task Kierkegaard takes up when he asks: \"Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life - or the learner who should put it to use?\"\n\nAlthough nihilism and existentialism are distinct philosophies, they are often confused with one another as both are rooted in the human experience of anguish and confusion stemming from the apparent meaninglessness of a world in which humans are compelled to find or create meaning. A primary cause of confusion is that Friedrich Nietzsche is an important philosopher in both fields. Existentialist philosophers often stress the importance of Angst as signifying the absolute lack of any objective ground for action, a move that is often reduced to a moral or an existential nihilism. A pervasive theme in the works of existentialist philosophy, however, is to persist through encounters with the absurd, as seen in Camus' \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" (\"One must imagine Sisyphus happy\"), and it is only very rarely that existentialist philosophers dismiss morality or one's self-created meaning: Kierkegaard regained a sort of morality in the religious (although he wouldn't himself agree that it was ethical; the religious suspends the ethical), and Sartre's final words in \"Being and Nothingness\" are \"All these questions, which refer us to a pure and not an accessory (or impure) reflection, can find their reply only on the ethical plane. We shall devote to them a future work.\"\n\nSøren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche were two of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement, though neither used the term \"existentialism\" and it is unclear whether they would have supported the existentialism of the 20th century. They focused on subjective human experience rather than the objective truths of mathematics and science, which they believed were too detached or observational to truly get at the human experience. Like Pascal, they were interested in people's quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from boredom. Unlike Pascal, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche also considered the role of making free choices, particularly regarding fundamental values and beliefs, and how such choices change the nature and identity of the chooser. Kierkegaard's knight of faith and Nietzsche's Übermensch are representative of people who exhibit Freedom, in that they define the nature of their own existence. Nietzsche's idealized individual invents his own values and creates the very terms they excel under. By contrast, Kierkegaard, opposed to the level of abstraction in Hegel, and not nearly as hostile (actually welcoming) to Christianity as Nietzsche, argues through a pseudonym that the objective certainty of religious truths (specifically Christian) is not only impossible, but even founded on logical paradoxes. Yet he continues to imply that a leap of faith is a possible means for an individual to reach a higher stage of existence that transcends and contains both an aesthetic and ethical value of life. Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were also precursors to other intellectual movements, including postmodernism, and various strands of psychotherapy. However, Kierkegaard believed that individuals should live in accordance with their thinking.\n\nThe first important literary author also important to existentialism was the Russian Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Dostoyevsky's \"Notes from Underground\" portrays a man unable to fit into society and unhappy with the identities he creates for himself. Jean-Paul Sartre, in his book on existentialism \"Existentialism is a Humanism\", quoted Dostoyevsky's \"The Brothers Karamazov\" as an example of existential crisis. Sartre attributes Ivan Karamazov's claim, \"If God did not exist, everything would be permitted\" to Dostoyevsky himself, though this quote does not appear in the novel. However, a similar sentiment is explicitly stated when Alyosha visits Dimitri in prison. Dimitri mentions his conversations with Rakitin in which the idea that \"Then, if He doesn't exist, man is king of the earth, of the universe\" allowing the inference contained in Sartre's attribution to remain a valid idea contested within the novel. Other Dostoyevsky novels covered issues raised in existentialist philosophy while presenting story lines divergent from secular existentialism: for example, in \"Crime and Punishment\", the protagonist Raskolnikov experiences an existential crisis and then moves toward a Christian Orthodox worldview similar to that advocated by Dostoyevsky himself.\n\nIn the first decades of the 20th century, a number of philosophers and writers explored existentialist ideas. The Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo, in his 1913 book \"The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Nations\", emphasized the life of \"flesh and bone\" as opposed to that of abstract rationalism. Unamuno rejected systematic philosophy in favor of the individual's quest for faith. He retained a sense of the tragic, even absurd nature of the quest, symbolized by his enduring interest in Cervantes' fictional character Don Quixote. A novelist, poet and dramatist as well as philosophy professor at the University of Salamanca, Unamuno wrote a short story about a priest's crisis of faith, \"Saint Manuel the Good, Martyr\", which has been collected in anthologies of existentialist fiction. Another Spanish thinker, Ortega y Gasset, writing in 1914, held that human existence must always be defined as the individual person combined with the concrete circumstances of his life: \"Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia\" (\"I am myself and my circumstances\"). Sartre likewise believed that human existence is not an abstract matter, but is always situated (\"en situation\").\n\nAlthough Martin Buber wrote his major philosophical works in German, and studied and taught at the Universities of Berlin and Frankfurt, he stands apart from the mainstream of German philosophy. Born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1878, he was also a scholar of Jewish culture and involved at various times in Zionism and Hasidism. In 1938, he moved permanently to Jerusalem. His best-known philosophical work was the short book \"I and Thou\", published in 1922. For Buber, the fundamental fact of human existence, too readily overlooked by scientific rationalism and abstract philosophical thought, is \"man with man\", a dialogue that takes place in the so-called \"sphere of between\" (\"das Zwischenmenschliche\").\n\nTwo Russian thinkers, Lev Shestov and Nikolai Berdyaev, became well known as existentialist thinkers during their post-Revolutionary exiles in Paris. Shestov, born into a Ukrainian-Jewish family in Kiev, had launched an attack on rationalism and systematization in philosophy as early as 1905 in his book of aphorisms \"All Things Are Possible\".\n\nBerdyaev, also from Kiev but with a background in the Eastern Orthodox Church, drew a radical distinction between the world of spirit and the everyday world of objects. Human freedom, for Berdyaev, is rooted in the realm of spirit, a realm independent of scientific notions of causation. To the extent the individual human being lives in the objective world, he is estranged from authentic spiritual freedom. \"Man\" is not to be interpreted naturalistically, but as a being created in God's image, an originator of free, creative acts. He published a major work on these themes, \"The Destiny of Man\", in 1931.\n\nGabriel Marcel, long before coining the term \"existentialism\", introduced important existentialist themes to a French audience in his early essay \"Existence and Objectivity\" (1925) and in his \"Metaphysical Journal\" (1927). A dramatist as well as a philosopher, Marcel found his philosophical starting point in a condition of metaphysical alienation: the human individual searching for harmony in a transient life. Harmony, for Marcel, was to be sought through \"secondary reflection\", a \"dialogical\" rather than \"dialectical\" approach to the world, characterized by \"wonder and astonishment\" and open to the \"presence\" of other people and of God rather than merely to \"information\" about them. For Marcel, such presence implied more than simply being there (as one thing might be in the presence of another thing); it connoted \"extravagant\" availability, and the willingness to put oneself at the disposal of the other.\n\nMarcel contrasted \"secondary reflection\" with abstract, scientific-technical \"primary reflection\", which he associated with the activity of the abstract Cartesian ego. For Marcel, philosophy was a concrete activity undertaken by a sensing, feeling human being incarnate—embodied—in a concrete world. Although Jean-Paul Sartre adopted the term \"existentialism\" for his own philosophy in the 1940s, Marcel's thought has been described as \"almost diametrically opposed\" to that of Sartre. Unlike Sartre, Marcel was a Christian, and became a Catholic convert in 1929.\n\nIn Germany, the psychologist and philosopher Karl Jaspers—who later described existentialism as a \"phantom\" created by the public—called his own thought, heavily influenced by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, \"Existenzphilosophie\". For Jaspers, \"\"Existenz\"-philosophy is the way of thought by means of which man seeks to become himself...This way of thought does not cognize objects, but elucidates and makes actual the being of the thinker\".\n\nJaspers, a professor at the University of Heidelberg, was acquainted with Martin Heidegger, who held a professorship at Marburg before acceding to Husserl's chair at Freiburg in 1928. They held many philosophical discussions, but later became estranged over Heidegger's support of National Socialism (Nazism). They shared an admiration for Kierkegaard, and in the 1930s, Heidegger lectured extensively on Nietzsche. Nevertheless, the extent to which Heidegger should be considered an existentialist is debatable. In \"Being and Time\" he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence (\"Dasein\") to be analysed in terms of existential categories (\"existentiale\"); and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, existentialism became a well-known and significant philosophical and cultural movement, mainly through the public prominence of two French writers, Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, who wrote best-selling novels, plays and widely read journalism as well as theoretical texts. These years also saw the growing reputation of Heidegger's book \"Being and Time\" outside Germany.\nSartre dealt with existentialist themes in his 1938 novel \"Nausea\" and the short stories in his 1939 collection \"The Wall\", and had published his treatise on existentialism, \"Being and Nothingness\", in 1943, but it was in the two years following the liberation of Paris from the German occupying forces that he and his close associates—Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others—became internationally famous as the leading figures of a movement known as existentialism. In a very short period of time, Camus and Sartre in particular became the leading public intellectuals of post-war France, achieving by the end of 1945 \"a fame that reached across all audiences.\" Camus was an editor of the most popular leftist (former French Resistance) newspaper \"Combat\"; Sartre launched his journal of leftist thought, \"Les Temps Modernes\", and two weeks later gave the widely reported lecture on existentialism and secular humanism to a packed meeting of the Club Maintenant. Beauvoir wrote that \"not a week passed without the newspapers discussing us\"; existentialism became \"the first media craze of the postwar era.\"\n\nBy the end of 1947, Camus' earlier fiction and plays had been reprinted, his new play \"Caligula\" had been performed and his novel \"The Plague\" published; the first two novels of Sartre's \"The Roads to Freedom\" trilogy had appeared, as had Beauvoir's novel \"The Blood of Others\". Works by Camus and Sartre were already appearing in foreign editions. The Paris-based existentialists had become famous.\n\nSartre had traveled to Germany in 1930 to study the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, and he included critical comments on their work in his major treatise \"Being and Nothingness\". Heidegger's thought had also become known in French philosophical circles through its use by Alexandre Kojève in explicating Hegel in a series of lectures given in Paris in the 1930s. The lectures were highly influential; members of the audience included not only Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, but Raymond Queneau, Georges Bataille, Louis Althusser, André Breton, and Jacques Lacan. A selection from Heidegger's \"Being and Time\" was published in French in 1938, and his essays began to appear in French philosophy journals.\nHeidegger read Sartre's work and was initially impressed, commenting: \"Here for the first time I encountered an independent thinker who, from the foundations up, has experienced the area out of which I think. Your work shows such an immediate comprehension of my philosophy as I have never before encountered.\" Later, however, in response to a question posed by his French follower Jean Beaufret, Heidegger distanced himself from Sartre's position and existentialism in general in his \"Letter on Humanism\". Heidegger's reputation continued to grow in France during the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1960s, Sartre attempted to reconcile existentialism and Marxism in his work \"Critique of Dialectical Reason\". A major theme throughout his writings was freedom and responsibility.\n\nCamus was a friend of Sartre, until their falling-out, and wrote several works with existential themes including \"The Rebel\", \"Summer in Algiers\", \"The Myth of Sisyphus\", and \"The Stranger\", the latter being \"considered—to what would have been Camus's irritation—the exemplary existentialist novel.\" Camus, like many others, rejected the existentialist label, and considered his works concerned with facing the absurd. In the titular book, Camus uses the analogy of the Greek myth of Sisyphus to demonstrate the futility of existence. In the myth, Sisyphus is condemned for eternity to roll a rock up a hill, but when he reaches the summit, the rock will roll to the bottom again. Camus believes that this existence is pointless but that Sisyphus ultimately finds meaning and purpose in his task, simply by continually applying himself to it. The first half of the book contains an extended rebuttal of what Camus took to be existentialist philosophy in the works of Kierkegaard, Shestov, Heidegger, and Jaspers.\n\nSimone de Beauvoir, an important existentialist who spent much of her life as Sartre's partner, wrote about feminist and existentialist ethics in her works, including \"The Second Sex\" and \"The Ethics of Ambiguity\". Although often overlooked due to her relationship with Sartre, de Beauvoir integrated existentialism with other forms of thinking such as feminism, unheard of at the time, resulting in alienation from fellow writers such as Camus.\n\nPaul Tillich, an important existentialist theologian following Kierkegaard and Karl Barth, applied existentialist concepts to Christian theology, and helped introduce existential theology to the general public. His seminal work \"The Courage to Be\" follows Kierkegaard's analysis of anxiety and life's absurdity, but puts forward the thesis that modern humans must, via God, achieve selfhood in spite of life's absurdity. Rudolf Bultmann used Kierkegaard's and Heidegger's philosophy of existence to demythologize Christianity by interpreting Christian mythical concepts into existentialist concepts.\n\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty, an existential phenomenologist, was for a time a companion of Sartre. Merleau-Ponty's \"Phenomenology of Perception\" (1945) was recognized as a major statement of French existentialism. It has been said that Merleau-Ponty's work \"Humanism and Terror\" greatly influenced Sartre. However, in later years they were to disagree irreparably, dividing many existentialists such as de Beauvoir, who sided with Sartre.\n\nColin Wilson, an English writer, published his study \"The Outsider\" in 1956, initially to critical acclaim. In this book and others (e.g. \"Introduction to the New Existentialism\"), he attempted to reinvigorate what he perceived as a pessimistic philosophy and bring it to a wider audience. He was not, however, academically trained, and his work was attacked by professional philosophers for lack of rigor and critical standards.\n\nStanley Kubrick's 1957 anti-war film \"Paths of Glory\" \"illustrates, and even illuminates...existentialism\" by examining the \"necessary absurdity of the human condition\" and the \"horror of war\". The film tells the story of a fictional World War I French army regiment ordered to attack an impregnable German stronghold; when the attack fails, three soldiers are chosen at random, court-martialed by a \"kangaroo court\", and executed by firing squad. The film examines existentialist ethics, such as the issue of whether objectivity is possible and the \"problem of authenticity\". Orson Welles' 1962 film \" The Trial\", based upon Franz Kafka's book of the same name (Der Process), is characteristic of both existentialist and absurdist themes in its depiction of a man (Joseph K.) arrested for a crime for which the charges are neither revealed to him nor to the reader.\n\n\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" is a Japanese science fiction animation series created by the anime studio Gainax and was both directed and written by Hideaki Anno. Existential themes of individuality, consciousness, freedom, choice, and responsibility are heavily relied upon throughout the entire series, particularly through the philosophies of Jean-Paul Sartre and Søren Kierkegaard. Episode 16's title, is a reference to Kierkegaard's book, \"The Sickness Unto Death\". Some contemporary films dealing with existentialist issues include \"Melancholia\", \"Fight Club\", \"I Heart Huckabees\", \"Waking Life\", \"The Matrix\", \"Ordinary People\", and \"Life in a Day\". Likewise, films throughout the 20th century such as \"The Seventh Seal\", \"Ikiru\", \"Taxi Driver\", the \"Toy Story\" films, \"The Great Silence\", \"Ghost in the Shell\", \"Harold and Maude\", \"High Noon\", \"Easy Rider\", \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", \"A Clockwork Orange\", \"Groundhog Day\", \"Apocalypse Now\", \"Badlands\", and \"Blade Runner\" also have existentialist qualities.\nNotable directors known for their existentialist films include Ingmar Bergman, François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Michelangelo Antonioni, Akira Kurosawa, Terrence Malick, Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky, Hideaki Anno, Wes Anderson, Gaspar Noé, Woody Allen, and Christopher Nolan. Charlie Kaufman's \"Synecdoche, New York\" focuses on the protagonist's desire to find existential meaning. Similarly, in Kurosawa's \"Red Beard\", the protagonist's experiences as an intern in a rural health clinic in Japan lead him to an existential crisis whereby he questions his reason for being. This, in turn, leads him to a better understanding of humanity. The French film, \"Mood Indigo\" (directed by Michel Gondry) embraced various elements of existentialism. The film \"The Shawshank Redemption\", released in 1994, depicts life in a prison in Maine, United States to explore several existentialist concepts.\n\nExistential perspectives are also found in modern literature to varying degrees, especially since the 1920s. Louis-Ferdinand Céline's \"Journey to the End of the Night\" (Voyage au bout de la nuit, 1932) celebrated by both Sartre and Beauvoir, contained many of the themes that would be found in later existential literature, and is in some ways, the proto-existential novel. Jean-Paul Sartre's 1938 novel \"Nausea\" was \"steeped in Existential ideas\", and is considered an accessible way of grasping his philosophical stance. Between 1900 and 1960, other authors such as Albert Camus, Franz Kafka, Rainer Maria Rilke, T.S. Eliot, Herman Hesse, Luigi Pirandello, Ralph Ellison, and Jack Kerouac, composed literature or poetry that contained, to varying degrees, elements of existential or proto-existential thought. The philosophy's influence even reached pulp literature shortly after the turn of the 20th century, as seen in the existential disparity witnessed in Man's lack of control of his fate in the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Since the late 1960s, a great deal of cultural activity in literature contains postmodernist as well as existential elements. Books such as \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" (1968) (now republished as \"Blade Runner\") by Philip K. Dick, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" by Kurt Vonnegut, \"Fight Club\" by Chuck Palahniuk and \"Formless Meanderings\" by Bharath Srinivasan all distort the line between reality and appearance while simultaneously espousing existential themes.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre wrote \"No Exit\" in 1944, an existentialist play originally published in French as \"Huis Clos\" (meaning \"In Camera\" or \"behind closed doors\"), which is the source of the popular quote, \"Hell is other people.\" (In French, \"L'enfer, c'est les autres\"). The play begins with a Valet leading a man into a room that the audience soon realizes is in hell. Eventually he is joined by two women. After their entry, the Valet leaves and the door is shut and locked. All three expect to be tortured, but no torturer arrives. Instead, they realize they are there to torture each other, which they do effectively by probing each other's sins, desires, and unpleasant memories.\n\nExistentialist themes are displayed in the Theatre of the Absurd, notably in Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\", in which two men divert themselves while they wait expectantly for someone (or something) named Godot who never arrives. They claim Godot is an acquaintance, but in fact, hardly know him, admitting they would not recognize him if they saw him. Samuel Beckett, once asked who or what Godot is, replied, \"If I knew, I would have said so in the play.\" To occupy themselves, the men eat, sleep, talk, argue, sing, play games, exercise, swap hats, and contemplate suicide—anything \"to hold the terrible silence at bay\". The play \"exploits several archetypal forms and situations, all of which lend themselves to both comedy and pathos.\" The play also illustrates an attitude toward human experience on earth: the poignancy, oppression, camaraderie, hope, corruption, and bewilderment of human experience that can be reconciled only in the mind and art of the absurdist. The play examines questions such as death, the meaning of human existence and the place of God in human existence.\n\nTom Stoppard's \"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead\" is an absurdist tragicomedy first staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1966. The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\". Comparisons have also been drawn to Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting For Godot\", for the presence of two central characters who appear almost as two halves of a single character. Many plot features are similar as well: the characters pass time by playing Questions, impersonating other characters, and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time. The two characters are portrayed as two clowns or fools in a world beyond their understanding. They stumble through philosophical arguments while not realizing the implications, and muse on the irrationality and randomness of the world.\n\nJean Anouilh's \"Antigone\" also presents arguments founded on existentialist ideas. It is a tragedy inspired by Greek mythology and the play of the same name (Antigone, by Sophocles) from the 5th century BC. In English, it is often distinguished from its antecedent by being pronounced in its original French form, approximately \"Ante-GŌN.\" The play was first performed in Paris on 6 February 1944, during the Nazi occupation of France. Produced under Nazi censorship, the play is purposefully ambiguous with regards to the rejection of authority (represented by Antigone) and the acceptance of it (represented by Creon). The parallels to the French Resistance and the Nazi occupation have been drawn. Antigone rejects life as desperately meaningless but without affirmatively choosing a noble death. The crux of the play is the lengthy dialogue concerning the nature of power, fate, and choice, during which Antigone says that she is, \"... disgusted with [the]...promise of a humdrum happiness.\" She states that she would rather die than live a mediocre existence.\n\nCritic Martin Esslin in his book \"Theatre of the Absurd\" pointed out how many contemporary playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco, Jean Genet, and Arthur Adamov wove into their plays the existentialist belief that we are absurd beings loose in a universe empty of real meaning. Esslin noted that many of these playwrights demonstrated the philosophy better than did the plays by Sartre and Camus. Though most of such playwrights, subsequently labeled \"Absurdist\" (based on Esslin's book), denied affiliations with existentialism and were often staunchly anti-philosophical (for example Ionesco often claimed he identified more with 'Pataphysics or with Surrealism than with existentialism), the playwrights are often linked to existentialism based on Esslin's observation.\n\nA major offshoot of existentialism as a philosophy is existentialist psychology and psychoanalysis, which first crystallized in the work of Otto Rank, Freud's closest associate for 20 years. Without awareness of the writings of Rank, Ludwig Binswanger was influenced by Freud, Edmund Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre. A later figure was Viktor Frankl, who briefly met Freud as a young man. His logotherapy can be regarded as a form of existentialist therapy. The existentialists would also influence social psychology, antipositivist micro-sociology, symbolic interactionism, and post-structuralism, with the work of thinkers such as Georg Simmel and Michel Foucault. Foucault was a great reader of Kierkegaard even though he almost never refers this author, who nonetheless had for him an importance as secret as it was decisive.\n\nAn early contributor to existentialist psychology in the United States was Rollo May, who was strongly influenced by Kierkegaard and Otto Rank. One of the most prolific writers on techniques and theory of existentialist psychology in the USA is Irvin D. Yalom. Yalom states that\n\nAside from their reaction against Freud's mechanistic, deterministic model of the mind and their assumption of a phenomenological approach in therapy, the existentialist analysts have little in common and have never been regarded as a cohesive ideological school. These thinkers—who include Ludwig Binswanger, Medard Boss, Eugène Minkowski, V.E. Gebsattel, Roland Kuhn, G. Caruso, F.T. Buytendijk, G. Bally and Victor Frankl—were almost entirely unknown to the American psychotherapeutic community until Rollo May's highly influential 1985 book \"Existence\"—and especially his introductory essay—introduced their work into this country.\n\nA more recent contributor to the development of a European version of existentialist psychotherapy is the British-based Emmy van Deurzen.\n\nAnxiety's importance in existentialism makes it a popular topic in psychotherapy. Therapists often offer existentialist philosophy as an explanation for anxiety. The assertion is that anxiety is manifested of an individual's complete freedom to decide, and complete responsibility for the outcome of such decisions. Psychotherapists using an existentialist approach believe that a patient can harness his anxiety and use it constructively. Instead of suppressing anxiety, patients are advised to use it as grounds for change. By embracing anxiety as inevitable, a person can use it to achieve his full potential in life. Humanistic psychology also had major impetus from existentialist psychology and shares many of the fundamental tenets. Terror management theory, based on the writings of Ernest Becker and Otto Rank, is a developing area of study within the academic study of psychology. It looks at what researchers claim are implicit emotional reactions of people confronted with the knowledge that they will eventually die.\n\nAlso, Gerd B. Achenbach has refreshed the Socratic tradition with his own blend of philosophical counseling. So did Michel Weber with his Chromatiques Center in Belgium.\n\nWalter Kaufmann criticized 'the profoundly unsound methods and the dangerous contempt for reason that have been so prominent in existentialism.'\nLogical positivist philosophers, such as Rudolf Carnap and A. J. Ayer, assert that existentialists are often confused about the verb \"to be\" in their analyses of \"being\". Specifically, they argue that the verb \"is\" is transitive and pre-fixed to a predicate (e.g., an apple \"is red\") (without a predicate, the word \"is\" is meaningless), and that existentialists frequently misuse the term in this manner. Colin Wilson has stated in his book \"The Angry Years\" that existentialism has created many of its own difficulties: \"we can see how this question of freedom of the will has been vitiated by post-romantic philosophy, with its inbuilt tendency to laziness and boredom, we can also see how it came about that existentialism found itself in a hole of its own digging, and how the philosophical developments since then have amounted to walking in circles round that hole\".\n\nMany critics argue Jean-Paul Sartre's philosophy is contradictory. Specifically, they argue that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claiming that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics. Herbert Marcuse criticized Sartre's 1943 \"Being and Nothingness\" for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: \"Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it hypostatizes specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory\".\n\nIn \"Letter on Humanism\", Martin Heidegger criticized Sartre's existentialism:\n\nExistentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking \"existentia\" and \"essentia\" according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that \"essentia\" precedes \"existentia\". Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "177052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177052", "title": "Immortality", "text": "Immortality\n\nImmortality is eternal life, being exempt from death, unending existence. Some modern species may possess biological immortality.\n\nCertain scientists, futurists, and philosophers have theorized about the immortality of the human body, with some suggesting that human immortality may be achievable in the first few decades of the 21st century. Other advocates believe that life extension is a more achievable goal in the short term, with immortality awaiting further research breakthroughs. The absence of aging would provide humans with biological immortality, but not invulnerability to death by disease or physical trauma; although mind uploading could solve that if it proved possible. Whether the process of internal endoimmortality is delivered within the upcoming years depends chiefly on research (and in neuron research in the case of endoimmortality through an immortalized cell line) in the former view and perhaps is an awaited goal in the latter case.\n\nIn religious contexts, immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of God (or other deities) to human beings who show goodness or else follow divine law. What form an unending human life would take, or whether an immaterial soul exists and possesses immortality, has been a major point of focus of religion, as well as the subject of speculation, fantasy, and debate.\n\nLife extension technologies promise a path to complete rejuvenation. Cryonics holds out the hope that the dead can be revived in the future, following sufficient medical advancements. While, as shown with creatures such as hydra and planarian worms, it is indeed possible for a creature to be biologically immortal, it is not known if it is possible for humans.\n\nMind uploading is the transference of brain states from a human brain to an alternative medium providing similar functionality. Assuming the process to be possible and repeatable, this would provide immortality to the computation of the original brain, as predicted by futurists such as Ray Kurzweil.\n\nThe belief in an \"afterlife\" is a fundamental tenet of most religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Islam, Judaism, and the Bahá'í Faith; however, the concept of an immortal soul is not. The \"soul\" itself has different meanings and is not used in the same way in different religions and different denominations of a religion. For example, various branches of Christianity have disagreeing views on the soul's immortality and its relation to the body.\n\nPhysical immortality is a state of life that allows a person to avoid death and maintain conscious thought. It can mean the unending existence of a person from a physical source other than organic life, such as a computer. Active pursuit of physical immortality can either be based on scientific trends, such as cryonics, digital immortality, breakthroughs in rejuvenation or predictions of an impending technological singularity, or because of a spiritual belief, such as those held by Rastafarians or Rebirthers.\n\nThere are three main causes of death: aging, disease and physical trauma. Such issues can be resolved with the solutions provided in research to any end providing such alternate theories at present that require unification.\n\nAubrey de Grey, a leading researcher in the field, defines aging as \"a collection of cumulative changes to the molecular and cellular structure of an adult organism, which result in essential metabolic processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in pathology and death.\" The current causes of aging in humans are cell loss (without replacement), DNA damage, oncogenic nuclear mutations and epimutations, cell senescence, mitochondrial mutations, lysosomal aggregates, extracellular aggregates, random extracellular cross-linking, immune system decline, and endocrine changes. Eliminating aging would require finding a solution to each of these causes, a program de Grey calls engineered negligible senescence. There is also a huge body of knowledge indicating that change is characterized by the loss of molecular fidelity.\n\nDisease is theoretically surmountable via technology. In short, it is an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism, something the body shouldn't typically have to deal with its natural make up. Human understanding of genetics is leading to cures and treatments for a myriad of previously incurable diseases. The mechanisms by which other diseases do damage are becoming better understood. Sophisticated methods of detecting diseases early are being developed. Preventative medicine is becoming better understood. Neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's may soon be curable with the use of stem cells. Breakthroughs in cell biology and telomere research are leading to treatments for cancer. Vaccines are being researched for AIDS and tuberculosis. Genes associated with type 1 diabetes and certain types of cancer have been discovered, allowing for new therapies to be developed. Artificial devices attached directly to the nervous system may restore sight to the blind. Drugs are being developed to treat a myriad of other diseases and ailments.\n\nPhysical trauma would remain as a threat to perpetual physical life, as an otherwise immortal person would still be subject to unforeseen accidents or catastrophes. The speed and quality of paramedic response remains a determining factor in surviving severe trauma. A body that could automatically repair itself from severe trauma, such as speculated uses for nanotechnology, would mitigate this factor.\nBeing the seat of consciousness, the brain cannot be risked to trauma if a continuous physical life is to be maintained. This aversion to trauma risk to the brain would naturally result in significant behavioral changes that would render physical immortality undesirable for some people.\n\nOrganisms otherwise unaffected by these causes of death would still face the problem of obtaining sustenance (whether from currently available agricultural processes or from hypothetical future technological processes) in the face of changing availability of suitable resources as environmental conditions change. After avoiding aging, disease, and trauma, you could still starve to death.\n\nIf there is no limitation on the degree of gradual mitigation of risk then it is possible that the cumulative probability of death over an infinite horizon is less than certainty, even when the risk of fatal trauma in any finite period is greater than zero. Mathematically, this is an aspect of achieving \"actuarial escape velocity\"\n\nBiological immortality is an absence of aging. Specifically it's the absence of a sustained increase in rate of mortality as a function of chronological age. A cell or organism that does not experience aging, or ceases to age at some point, is biologically immortal.\n\nBiologists have chosen the word \"immortal\" to designate cells that are not limited by the Hayflick limit, where cells no longer divide because of DNA damage or shortened telomeres. The first and still most widely used immortal cell line is HeLa, developed from cells taken from the malignant cervical tumor of Henrietta Lacks without her consent in 1951. Prior to the 1961 work of Leonard Hayflick, there was the erroneous belief fostered by Alexis Carrel that all normal somatic cells are immortal. By preventing cells from reaching senescence one can achieve biological immortality; telomeres, a \"cap\" at the end of DNA, are thought to be the cause of cell aging. Every time a cell divides the telomere becomes a bit shorter; when it is finally worn down, the cell is unable to split and dies. Telomerase is an enzyme which rebuilds the telomeres in stem cells and cancer cells, allowing them to replicate an infinite number of times. No definitive work has yet demonstrated that telomerase can be used in human somatic cells to prevent healthy tissues from aging. On the other hand, scientists hope to be able to grow organs with the help of stem cells, allowing organ transplants without the risk of rejection, another step in extending human life expectancy. These technologies are the subject of ongoing research, and are not yet realized.\n\nLife defined as biologically immortal is still susceptible to causes of death besides aging, including disease and trauma, as defined above. Notable immortal species include:\n\nAs the existence of biologically immortal species demonstrates, there is no thermodynamic necessity for senescence: a defining feature of life is that it takes in free energy from the environment and unloads its entropy as waste. Living systems can even build themselves up from seed, and routinely repair themselves. Aging is therefore presumed to be a byproduct of evolution, but why mortality should be selected for remains a subject of research and debate. Programmed cell death and the telomere \"end replication problem\" are found even in the earliest and simplest of organisms. This may be a tradeoff between selecting for cancer and selecting for aging.\n\nModern theories on the evolution of aging include the following:\n\nThere are some known naturally occurring and artificially produced chemicals that may increase the lifetime or life-expectancy of a person or organism, such as resveratrol.\n\nSome scientists believe that boosting the amount or proportion of telomerase in the body, a naturally forming enzyme that helps maintain the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, could prevent cells from dying and so may ultimately lead to extended, healthier lifespans. A team of researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Centre (Madrid) tested the hypothesis on mice. It was found that those mice which were genetically engineered to produce 10 times the normal levels of telomerase lived 50% longer than normal mice.\n\nIn normal circumstances, without the presence of telomerase, if a cell divides repeatedly, at some point all the progeny will reach their Hayflick limit. With the presence of telomerase, each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of DNA, and any single cell can then divide unbounded. While this unbounded growth property has excited many researchers, caution is warranted in exploiting this property, as exactly this same unbounded growth is a crucial step in enabling cancerous growth. If an organism can replicate its body cells faster, then it would theoretically stop aging.\n\nEmbryonic stem cells express telomerase, which allows them to divide repeatedly and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed in cells that need to divide regularly (e.g., in the immune system), whereas most somatic cells express it only at very low levels in a cell-cycle dependent manner.\n\nTechnological immortality is the prospect for much longer life spans made possible by scientific advances in a variety of fields: nanotechnology, emergency room procedures, genetics, biological engineering, regenerative medicine, microbiology, and others. Contemporary life spans in the advanced industrial societies are already markedly longer than those of the past because of better nutrition, availability of health care, standard of living and bio-medical scientific advances. Technological immortality predicts further progress for the same reasons over the near term. An important aspect of current scientific thinking about immortality is that some combination of human cloning, cryonics or nanotechnology will play an essential role in extreme life extension. Robert Freitas, a nanorobotics theorist, suggests tiny medical nanorobots could be created to go through human bloodstreams, find dangerous things like cancer cells and bacteria, and destroy them. Freitas anticipates that gene-therapies and nanotechnology will eventually make the human body effectively self-sustainable and capable of living indefinitely in empty space, short of severe brain trauma. This supports the theory that we will be able to continually create biological or synthetic replacement parts to replace damaged or dying ones. Future advances in nanomedicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. K. Eric Drexler, one of the founders of nanotechnology, postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical biological machines, in his 1986 book Engines of Creation. Raymond Kurzweil, a futurist and transhumanist, stated in his book \"The Singularity Is Near\" that he believes that advanced medical nanorobotics could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030. According to Richard Feynman, it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a \"medical\" use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see biological machine). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) \"swallow the doctor\". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom.\"\n\nCryonics, the practice of preserving organisms (either intact specimens or only their brains) for possible future revival by storing them at cryogenic temperatures where metabolism and decay are almost completely stopped, can be used to 'pause' for those who believe that life extension technologies will not develop sufficiently within their lifetime. Ideally, cryonics would allow clinically dead people to be brought back in the future after cures to the patients' diseases have been discovered and aging is reversible. Modern cryonics procedures use a process called vitrification which creates a glass-like state rather than freezing as the body is brought to low temperatures. This process reduces the risk of ice crystals damaging the cell-structure, which would be especially detrimental to cell structures in the brain, as their minute adjustment evokes the individual's mind.\n\nOne idea that has been advanced involves uploading an individual's habits and memories via direct mind-computer interface. The individual's memory may be loaded to a computer or to a new organic body. Extropian futurists like Moravec and Kurzweil have proposed that, thanks to exponentially growing computing power, it will someday be possible to upload human consciousness onto a computer system, and exist indefinitely in a virtual environment. This could be accomplished via advanced cybernetics, where computer hardware would initially be installed in the brain to help sort memory or accelerate thought processes. Components would be added gradually until the person's entire brain functions were handled by artificial devices, avoiding sharp transitions that would lead to issues of identity, thus running the risk of the person to be declared dead and thus not be a legitimate owner of his or her property. After this point, the human body could be treated as an optional accessory and the program implementing the person could be transferred to any sufficiently powerful computer. Another possible mechanism for mind upload is to perform a detailed scan of an individual's original, organic brain and simulate the entire structure in a computer. What level of detail such scans and simulations would need to achieve to emulate awareness, and whether the scanning process would destroy the brain, is still to be determined. It is suggested that achieving immortality through this mechanism would require specific consideration to be given to the role of consciousness in the functions of the mind. An uploaded mind would only be a copy of the original mind, and not the conscious mind of the living entity associated in such a transfer. Without a simultaneous upload of consciousness, the original living entity remains mortal, thus not achieving true immortality. Research on neural correlates of consciousness is yet inconclusive on this issue. Whatever the route to mind upload, persons in this state could then be considered essentially immortal, short of loss or traumatic destruction of the machines that maintained them.\n\nTransforming a human into a cyborg can include brain implants or extracting a human processing unit and placing it in a robotic life-support system. Even replacing biological organs with robotic ones could increase life span (e.g. pace makers) and depending on the definition, many technological upgrades to the body, like genetic modifications or the addition of nanobots would qualify an individual as a cyborg. Some people believe that such modifications would make one impervious to aging and disease and theoretically immortal unless killed or destroyed.\n\nAs late as 1952, the editorial staff of the \"\" found in their compilation of the Great Books of the Western World, that \"The philosophical issue concerning immortality cannot be separated from issues concerning the existence and nature of man's soul.\" Thus, the vast majority of speculation regarding immortality before the 21st century was regarding the nature of the afterlife.\n\nImmortality in ancient Greek religion originally always included an eternal union of body and soul as can be seen in Homer, Hesiod, and various other ancient texts. The soul was considered to have an eternal existence in Hades, but without the body the soul was considered dead. Although almost everybody had nothing to look forward to but an eternal existence as a disembodied dead soul, a number of men and women were considered to have gained physical immortality and been brought to live forever in either Elysium, the Islands of the Blessed, heaven, the ocean or literally right under the ground. Among these were Amphiaraus, Ganymede, Ino, Iphigenia, Menelaus, Peleus, and a great part of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars. Some were considered to have died and been resurrected before they achieved physical immortality. Asclepius was killed by Zeus only to be resurrected and transformed into a major deity. In some versions of the Trojan War myth, Achilles, after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother Thetis, resurrected, and brought to an immortal existence in either Leuce, the Elysian plains, or the Islands of the Blessed. Memnon, who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. Alcmene, Castor, Heracles, and Melicertes were also among the figures sometimes considered to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to Herodotus' Histories, the 7th century BC sage Aristeas of Proconnesus was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. Later he was found not only to have been resurrected but to have gained immortality.\n\nThe philosophical idea of an immortal soul was a belief first appearing with either Pherecydes or the Orphics, and most importantly advocated by Plato and his followers. This, however, never became the general norm in Hellenistic thought. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, many or perhaps most traditional Greeks maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that others could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead, though everlasting, souls. The parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of Jesus was not lost on the early Christians, as Justin Martyr argued: \"when we say ... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus.\" (\"1 Apol.\" 21).\n\nThe goal of Hinayana is Arhatship and Nirvana. By contrast, the goal of Mahayana is Buddhahood.\n\nAccording to one Tibetan Buddhist teaching, Dzogchen, individuals can transform the physical body into an immortal body of light called the rainbow body.\n\nChristian theology holds that Adam and Eve lost physical immortality for themselves and all their descendants in the Fall of man, although this initial \"imperishability of the bodily frame of man\" was \"a preternatural condition\".\nChristians who profess the Nicene Creed believe that every dead person (whether they believed in Christ or not) will be resurrected from the dead at the Second Coming, and this belief is known as Universal resurrection.\n\nN.T. Wright, a theologian and former Bishop of Durham, has said many people forget the physical aspect of what Jesus promised. He told Time: \"Jesus' resurrection marks the beginning of a restoration that he will complete upon his return. Part of this will be the resurrection of all the dead, who will 'awake', be embodied and participate in the renewal. Wright says John Polkinghorne, a physicist and a priest, has put it this way: 'God will download our software onto his hardware until the time he gives us new hardware to run the software again for ourselves.' That gets to two things nicely: that the period after death (the Intermediate state) is a period when we are in God's presence but not active in our own bodies, and also that the more important transformation will be when we are again embodied and administering Christ's kingdom.\" This kingdom will consist of Heaven and Earth \"joined together in a new creation\", he said.\n\nHindus believe in an immortal soul which is reincarnated after death. According to Hinduism, people repeat a process of life, death, and rebirth in a cycle called \"samsara\". If they live their life well, their \"karma\" improves and their station in the next life will be higher, and conversely lower if they live their life poorly. After many life times of perfecting its karma, the soul is freed from the cycle and lives in perpetual bliss. There is no place of eternal torment in Hinduism, although if a soul consistently lives very evil lives, it could work its way down to the very bottom of the cycle.\n\nThere are explicit renderings in the Upanishads alluding to a physically immortal state brought about by purification, and sublimation of the 5 elements that make up the body. For example, in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (Chapter 2, Verse 12), it is stated \"When earth, water fire, air and akasa arise, that is to say, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death.\"\n\nAnother view of immortality is traced to the Vedic tradition by the interpretation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi:\n\nThat man indeed whom these (contacts)<br>do not disturb, who is even-minded in<br>pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit<br>for immortality, O best of men.\n\nTo Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the verse means, \"Once a man has become established in the understanding of the permanent reality of life, his mind rises above the influence of pleasure and pain. Such an unshakable man passes beyond the influence of death and in the permanent phase of life: he attains eternal life ... A man established in the understanding of the unlimited abundance of absolute existence is naturally free from existence of the relative order. This is what gives him the status of immortal life.\"\n\nAn Indian Tamil saint known as Vallalar claimed to have achieved immortality before disappearing forever from a locked room in 1874.\n\nSikhism was found in the 15th century and over a millennium after Hinduism and Buddhism. Therefore, sikhs have a similar belief of immortality of reincarnation like the hindus, however they belief there is a way that we could get out of the cycle of rebirth and death, by doing the good deeds that all the ten gurus have left behind for them to do. This is like being immortal itself because once, a sikh dies he or she would live forever by being the gurus angel that may come to earth as they please to help the world a better place. \n\nThe traditional concept of an immaterial and immortal soul distinct from the body was not found in Judaism before the Babylonian Exile, but developed as a result of interaction with Persian and Hellenistic philosophies. Accordingly, the Hebrew word \"nephesh\", although translated as \"soul\" in some older English Bibles, actually has a meaning closer to \"living being\". \"Nephesh\" was rendered in the Septuagint as \"\" (\"psūchê\"), the Greek word for soul.\n\nThe only Hebrew word traditionally translated \"soul\" (\"nephesh\") in English language Bibles refers to a living, breathing conscious body, rather than to an immortal soul. In the New Testament, the Greek word traditionally translated \"soul\" () has substantially the same meaning as the Hebrew, without reference to an immortal soul. ‘Soul’ may refer to the whole person, the self: ‘three thousand souls’ were converted in Acts 2:41 (see Acts 3:23).\n\nThe Hebrew Bible speaks about \"Sheol\" (שאול), originally a synonym of the grave-the repository of the dead or the cessation of existence until the resurrection of the dead. This doctrine of resurrection is mentioned explicitly only in although it may be implied in several other texts. New theories arose concerning Sheol during the intertestamental period.\n\nThe views about immortality in Judaism is perhaps best exemplified by the various references to this in Second Temple Period. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in 2 Maccabees, according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh. Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of Enoch, and in Apocalypse of Baruch. According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism Philip R. Davies, there is “little or no clear reference … either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead” in the Dead Sea scrolls texts. Both Josephus and the New Testament record that the Sadducees did not believe in an afterlife, but the sources vary on the beliefs of the Pharisees. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not. According to Josephus, who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be reincarnated and “pass into other bodies,” while “the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.” Jubilees seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.\n\nRabbinic Judaism claims that the righteous dead will be resurrected in the Messianic Age with the coming of the messiah. They will then be granted immortality in a perfect world. The wicked dead, on the other hand, will not be resurrected at all. This is not the only Jewish belief about the afterlife. The Tanakh is not specific about the afterlife, so there are wide differences in views and explanations among believers.\n\nIt is repeatedly stated in Lüshi Chunqiu that death is unavoidable. Henri Maspero noted that many scholarly works frame Taoism as a school of thought focused on the quest for immortality. Isabelle Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a \"way of life\" than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non-Taoist historians have done. In the Tractate of Actions and their Retributions, a traditional teaching, spiritual immortality can be rewarded to people who do a certain amount of good deeds and live a simple, pure life. A list of good deeds and sins are tallied to determine whether or not a mortal is worthy. Spiritual immortality in this definition allows the soul to leave the earthly realms of afterlife and go to pure realms in the Taoist cosmology.\n\nZoroastrians believe that on the fourth day after death, the human soul leaves the body and the body remains as an empty shell. Souls would go to either heaven or hell; these concepts of the afterlife in Zoroastrianism may have influenced Abrahamic religions. The Persian word for \"immortal\" is associated with the month \"Amurdad\", meaning \"deathless\" in Persian, in the Iranian calendar (near the end of July). The month of Amurdad or Ameretat is celebrated in Persian culture as ancient Persians believed the \"Angel of Immortality\" won over the \"Angel of Death\" in this month.\n\nAlcmaeon of Croton argued that the soul is continuously and ceaselessly in motion. The exact form of his argument is unclear, but it appears to have influenced Plato, Aristotle, and other later writers.\n\nPlato's \"Phaedo\" advances four arguments for the soul's immortality:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotinus offers a version of the argument that Kant calls \"The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology\". Plotinus first argues that the soul is simple, then notes that a simple being cannot decompose. Many subsequent philosophers have argued both that the soul is simple and that it must be immortal. The tradition arguably culminates with Moses Mendelssohn's Phaedon.\n\nTheodore Metochites argues that part of the soul's nature is to move itself, but that a given movement will cease only if what causes the movement is separated from the thing moved – an impossibility if they are one and the same.\n\nAvicenna argued for the distinctness of the soul and the body, and the incorruptibility of the former.\n\nThe full argument for the immortality of the soul and Thomas Aquinas' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the \"Summa Theologica\".\n\nRené Descartes endorses the claim that the soul is simple, and also that this entails that it cannot decompose. Descartes does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear.\n\nIn early work, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz endorses a version of the argument from the simplicity of the soul to its immortality, but like his predecessors, he does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear. In his monadology he advances a sophisticated novel argument for the immortality of monads.\n\nMoses Mendelssohn's \"Phaedon\" is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul. It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue \"Phaedo\", in which Socrates argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including Plotinus, Descartes, and Leibniz, argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the Phaedon, Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.\n\nThe possibility of clinical immortality raises a host of medical, philosophical, and religious issues and ethical questions. These include persistent vegetative states, the nature of personality over time, technology to mimic or copy the mind or its processes, social and economic disparities created by longevity, and survival of the heat death of the universe.\n\nPhysical immortality has also been imagined as a form of eternal torment, as in Mary Shelley's short story \"The Mortal Immortal\", the protagonist of which witnesses everyone he cares about dying around him. Jorge Luis Borges explored the idea that life gets its meaning from death in the short story \"The Immortal\"; an entire society having achieved immortality, they found time becoming infinite, and so found no motivation for any action. In his book \"Thursday's Fictions\", and the stage and film adaptations of it, Richard James Allen tells the story of a woman named Thursday who tries to cheat the cycle of reincarnation to get a form of eternal life. At the end of this fantastical tale, her son, Wednesday, who has witnessed the havoc his mother's quest has caused, forgoes the opportunity for immortality when it is offered to him. Likewise, the novel \"Tuck Everlasting\" depicts immortality as \"falling off the wheel of life\" and is viewed as a curse as opposed to a blessing. In the anime \"Casshern Sins\" humanity achieves immortality due to advances in medical technology; however, the inability of the human race to die causes Luna, a Messianic figure, to come forth and offer normal lifespans because she believed that without death, humans could not live. Ultimately, Casshern takes up the cause of death for humanity when Luna begins to restore humanity's immortality. In Anne Rice's book series \"The Vampire Chronicles\", vampires are portrayed as immortal and ageless, but their inability to cope with the changes in the world around them means that few vampires live for much more than a century, and those who do often view their changeless form as a curse.\n\nIn his book \"Death\", Yale philosopher Shelly Kagan argues that any form of human immortality would be undesirable. Kagan's argument takes the form of a dilemma. Either our characters remain essentially the same in an immortal afterlife, or they do not. If our characters remain basically the same—that is, if we retain more or less the desires, interests, and goals that we have now—then eventually, over an infinite stretch of time, we will get bored and find eternal life unbearably tedious. If, on the other hand, our characters are radically changed—e.g., by God periodically erasing our memories or giving us rat-like brains that never tire of certain simple pleasures—then such a person would be too different from our current self for us to care much what happens to them. Either way, Kagan argues, immortality is unattractive. The best outcome, Kagan argues, would be for humans to live as long as they desired and then to accept death gratefully as rescuing us from the unbearable tedium of immortality.\n\nIf human beings were to achieve immortality, there would most likely be a change in the worlds' social structures. Sociologists argue that human beings' awareness of their own mortality shapes their behavior. With the advancements in medical technology in extending human life, there may need to be serious considerations made about future social structures. The world is already experiencing a global demographic shift of increasingly ageing populations with lower replacement rates. The social changes that are made to accommodate this new population shift may be able to offer insight on the possibility of an immortal society.\n\nAlthough some scientists state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping aging are achievable, there are no international or national programs focused on stopping aging or on radical life extension. In 2012 in Russia, and then in the United States, Israel and the Netherlands, pro-immortality political parties were launched. They aimed to provide political support to anti-aging and radical life extension research and technologies and at the same time transition to the next step, radical life extension, life without aging, and finally, immortality and aim to make possible access to such technologies to most currently living people.\n\nThere are numerous symbols representing immortality. The ankh is an Egyptian symbol of life that holds connotations of immortality when depicted in the hands of the and pharaohs, who were seen as having control over the journey of life. The Möbius strip in the shape of a trefoil knot is another symbol of immortality. Most symbolic representations of infinity or the life cycle are often used to represent immortality depending on the context they are placed in. Other examples include the Ouroboros, the Chinese fungus of longevity, the \"ten\" kanji, the phoenix, the peacock in Christianity, and the colors amaranth (in Western culture) and peach (in Chinese culture).\n\nImmortality is a popular subject in fiction, as it explores humanity's deep-seated fears and comprehension of its own mortality. Immortal beings and species abound in fiction, especially fantasy fiction, and the meaning of \"immortal\" tends to vary. The \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", one of the first literary works, is primarily a quest of a hero seeking to become immortal.\n\nSome fictional beings are completely immortal (or very nearly so) in that they are immune to death by injury, disease and age. Sometimes such powerful immortals can only be killed by each other, as is the case with the Q from the \"Star Trek\" series. Even if something can't be killed, a common plot device involves putting an immortal being into a slumber or limbo, as is done with Morgoth in J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Silmarillion\" and the Dreaming God of \"Pathways Into Darkness\". Storytellers often make it a point to give weaknesses to even the most indestructible of beings. For instance, Superman is supposed to be invulnerable, yet his enemies were able to exploit his now-infamous weakness: Kryptonite. (See also Achilles' heel.)\n\nMany fictitious species are said to be immortal if they cannot die of old age, even though they can be killed through other means, such as injury. Modern fantasy elves often exhibit this form of immortality. Other creatures, such as vampires and the immortals in the film \"Highlander\", can only die from beheading. The classic and stereotypical vampire is typically slain by one of several very specific means, including a silver bullet (or piercing with other silver weapons), a stake through the heart (perhaps made of consecrated wood), or by exposing them to sunlight.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The book suggests causes of aging and ways to slow them, with material on improving health and various aspects of the quality of life.\n\nOne notable feature of the book was several full-page pictures of its male and female authors, Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw, striking bodybuilding poses and showing off some impressive muscles for \"sedentary research scientists,\" which they claimed was due to the \"growth hormone releasers\" they took daily.\nMedical health experts have dismissed Pearson and Shaw's life-extension formula as dangerous. The American Council on Science and Health reported that the risks of their formula included headaches, intestinal disorders and kidney damage. \n\nIn the 1992 documentary \"Never Say Die: The Pursuit of Eternal Youth\", Antony Thomas interviewed Pearson and Shaw, and criticised the anti-aging movement as misguided. A review in \"JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association\" by researchers with the Harvard School of Public Health advised that “Some of the \"health\" advice contained in this book would be humorous if it was not so dangerous” and that “Potential readers of this ridiculous book would be wiser to take only the antacids—as we felt the urge to do after the realization that we had spent $22.50 on an unscientific, impractical, and potentially dangerous health fraud that literally made us ill.” \n\nStephen Barrett of Quackwatch wrote that the advice in the book was impractical and unscientific.

The aim was to build a spacecraft concept to study the effects of Mars-level gravity (~0.38g) on mammals. \n\nPresentations were given to Robert Zubrin (Mars Society), and the award for best design was given to The University of Washington (UW). The UW team continued to develop the concept until the end of the school year (June 2002), after which funding became an issue. The team from UW contacted members of the team that presented from MIT, and the two universities agreed to continue development together. Later University of Queensland – Australia (UQ) joined the team as well. The program ended in 2009.\n\nThe Mars Gravity Biosatellite program began in 2001 as a Mars Society initiative called Translife that grew out of a discussion between Robert Zubrin and Elon Musk. It was intended to study the effects of the gravity of Mars (about one-third that of Earth) on mammals, for which no data was available. Over the next few years, the program grew both scope and vision, with staff and students from MIT (Payload), UW (Spacecraft Bus) and UQ (Reentry) collaboratively designing various parts of the mission concept. With ongoing funding challenges, UW and UQ withdrew after several years and Georgia Institute of Technology stepped in to build on their design work. The effort represented the most ambitious and complex student satellite project to date.\n\nThe mission concept was envisioned to carry 15 mice in low Earth orbit for five weeks. The satellite was designed to spin at approximately 32 rpm to generate centrifugal force that they would experience as gravity on the surface of Mars. At the end of its mission, the satellite would reenter Earth's atmosphere and its cargo of mice would be retrieved. In 2007, a tentative launch date for the Mars Gravity Biosatellite had been set for 2010 or 2011, as the primary payload on a Falcon 1E or a Minotaur IV launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. \n\nIn 2005, the involved universities received a $200,000 NASA advanced projects development grant to support the development of a full payload engineering model. In 2006, the students of Mars Gravity developed a novel microfinancing platform called Your Name Into Space. This was meant to help finance the development of their spacecraft. This initiative is designed to give individuals and corporations the opportunity to fly images of their choice into orbit.\n\nBy the program's end in 2009, the project had engaged over 600 undergraduate, graduate, and high school students in aerospace engineering, space life sciences, and program management. Over 20 conference presentations and papers were published, earning multiple student awards.\n\nOn 24 June 2009, a status report was released declaring the end of this program, due to lack of funding and shifting priorities at NASA.\n\nGravity on Mars is only about 38% as strong as it is on Earth, and the long-term effects of such reduced gravity are unknown. Astronauts who are weightless for long periods of time lose significant amounts of bone and muscle mass. It is unclear if the gravity on Mars is strong enough to avoid or minimize these health problems. The Mars Gravity Biosatellite was meant to provide data on how mammalian health is affected by long-term exposure to lower levels of gravity, focusing on bone loss, changes in bone structure, muscle atrophy, and changes in the inner ear. The results from the five-week mission experiment would have been compared against a variety of Earth-based controls, including vivarium, hindlimb suspension, partial weight suspension, flight habitat effects, and short-radius centrifuge testing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "162435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162435", "title": "Mind uploading", "text": "Mind uploading\n\nWhole brain emulation (WBE), mind upload or brain upload (sometimes called \"mind copying\" or \"mind transfer\") is the hypothetical futuristic process of scanning the mental state (including long-term memory and \"self\") of a particular brain substrate and copying it to a computer. The computer could then run a simulation model of the brain's information processing, such that it responds in essentially the same way as the original brain (i.e., indistinguishable from the brain for all relevant purposes) and experiences having a conscious mind.\n\nMind uploading may potentially be accomplished by either of two methods: Copy-and-transfer or gradual replacement of neurons. In the case of the former method, mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and mapping the salient features of a biological brain, and then by copying, transferring, and storing that information state into a computer system or another computational device. The biological brain may not survive the copying process. The simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or simulated world, supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model. Alternatively the simulated mind could reside in a computer that is inside (or connected to) a (not necessarily humanoid) robot or a biological body.\n\nAmong some futurists and within the transhumanist movement, mind uploading is treated as an important proposed life extension technology. Some believe mind uploading is humanity's current best option for preserving the identity of the species, as opposed to cryonics. Another aim of mind uploading is to provide a permanent backup to our \"mind-file\", to enable interstellar space travels, and a means for human culture to survive a global disaster by making a functional copy of a human society in a Matrioshka brain, i.e. a computing device that consumes all energy from a star. Whole brain emulation is discussed by some futurists as a \"logical endpoint\" of the topical computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics fields, both about brain simulation for medical research purposes. It is discussed in artificial intelligence research publications as an approach to strong AI. Computer-based intelligence such as an upload could think much faster than a biological human even if it were no more intelligent. A large-scale society of uploads might, according to futurists, give rise to a technological singularity, meaning a sudden time constant decrease in the exponential development of technology. Mind uploading is a central conceptual feature of numerous science fiction novels and films.\n\nSubstantial mainstream research in related areas is being conducted in animal brain mapping and simulation, development of faster supercomputers, virtual reality, brain–computer interfaces, connectomics and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains. According to supporters, many of the tools and ideas needed to achieve mind uploading already exist or are currently under active development; however, they will admit that others are, as yet, very speculative, but still in the realm of engineering possibility. Neuroscientist Randal Koene has formed a nonprofit organization called Carbon Copies to promote mind uploading research.\n\nThe human brain contains, on average, about 86 billion nerve cells called neurons, each individually linked to other neurons by way of connectors called axons and dendrites. Signals at the junctures (synapses) of these connections are transmitted by the release and detection of chemicals known as neurotransmitters. The established neuroscientific consensus is that the human mind is largely an emergent property of the information processing of this neural network.\n\nNeuroscientists have stated that important functions performed by the mind, such as learning, memory, and consciousness, are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws. For example, Christof Koch and Giulio Tononi wrote in \"IEEE Spectrum\":\n\nThe concept of mind uploading is based on this mechanistic view of the mind, and denies the vitalist view of human life and consciousness.\n\nEminent computer scientists and neuroscientists have predicted that specially programmed computers will be capable of thought and even attain consciousness, including Koch and Tononi, Douglas Hofstadter, Jeff Hawkins, Marvin Minsky, Randal A. Koene, and Rodolfo Llinás.\n\nHowever, even though uploading is dependent upon such a general capability, it is conceptually distinct from general forms of AI in that it results from dynamic reanimation of information derived from a specific human mind so that the mind retains a sense of historical identity (other forms are possible but would compromise or eliminate the life-extension feature generally associated with uploading). The transferred and reanimated information would become a form of artificial intelligence, sometimes called an infomorph or \"noömorph\".\n\nMany theorists have presented models of the brain and have established a range of estimates of the amount of computing power needed for partial and complete simulations. Using these models, some have estimated that uploading may become possible within decades if trends such as Moore's law continue.\n\nIn theory, if the information and processes of the mind can be disassociated from the biological body, they are no longer tied to the individual limits and lifespan of that body. Furthermore, information within a brain could be partly or wholly copied or transferred to one or more other substrates (including digital storage or another brain), thereby – from a purely mechanistic perspective – reducing or eliminating \"mortality risk\" of such information. This general proposal was discussed in 1971 by biogerontologist George M. Martin of the University of Washington.\n\nAn “uploaded astronaut” could be used instead of a \"live\" astronaut in human spaceflight, avoiding the perils of zero gravity, the vacuum of space, and cosmic radiation to the human body. It would allow for the use of smaller spacecraft, such as the proposed StarChip, and it would enable virtually unlimited interstellar travel distances.\n\nThe focus of mind uploading, in the case of copy-and-transfer, is on data acquisition, rather than data maintenance of the brain. A set of approaches known as loosely coupled off-loading (LCOL) may be used in the attempt to characterize and copy the mental contents of a brain. The LCOL approach may take advantage of self-reports, life-logs and video recordings that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence. A bottom-up approach may focus on the specific resolution and morphology of neurons, the spike times of neurons, the times at which neurons produce action potential responses.\n\nAdvocates of mind uploading point to Moore's law to support the notion that the necessary computing power is expected to become available within a few decades. However, the actual computational requirements for running an uploaded human mind are very difficult to quantify, potentially rendering such an argument specious.\n\nRegardless of the techniques used to capture or recreate the function of a human mind, the processing demands are likely to be immense, due to the large number of neurons in the human brain along with the considerable complexity of each neuron.\n\nIn 2004, Henry Markram, lead researcher of the \"Blue Brain Project\", stated that \"it is not [their] goal to build an intelligent neural network\", based solely on the computational demands such a project would have.\n\nIt will be very difficult because, in the brain, every molecule is a powerful computer and we would need to simulate the structure and function of trillions upon trillions of molecules as well as all the rules that govern how they interact. You would literally need computers that are trillions of times bigger and faster than anything existing today.\n\nFive years later, after successful simulation of part of a rat brain, Markram was much more bold and optimistic. In 2009, as director of the Blue Brain Project, he claimed that “A detailed, functional artificial human brain can be built within the next 10 years.”\n\nRequired computational capacity strongly depend on the chosen level of simulation model scale:\n\nSince the function of the human mind and how it might arise from the working of the brain's neural network, are poorly understood issues, mind uploading relies on the idea of neural network emulation. Rather than having to understand the high-level psychological processes and large-scale structures of the brain, and model them using classical artificial intelligence methods and cognitive psychology models, the low-level structure of the underlying neural network is captured, mapped and emulated with a computer system. In computer science terminology, rather than analyzing and reverse engineering the behavior of the algorithms and data structures that resides in the brain, a blueprint of its source code is translated to another programming language. The human mind and the personal identity then, theoretically, is generated by the emulated neural network in an identical fashion to it being generated by the biological neural network.\n\nOn the other hand, a molecule-scale simulation of the brain is not expected to be required, provided that the functioning of the neurons is not affected by quantum mechanical processes. The neural network emulation approach only requires that the functioning and interaction of neurons and synapses are understood. It is expected that it is sufficient with a black-box signal processing model of how the neurons respond to nerve impulses (electrical as well as chemical synaptic transmission).\n\nA sufficiently complex and accurate model of the neurons is required. A traditional artificial neural network model, for example multi-layer perceptron network model, is not considered as sufficient. A dynamic spiking neural network model is required, which reflects that the neuron fires only when a membrane potential reaches a certain level. It is likely that the model must include delays, non-linear functions and differential equations describing the relation between electrophysical parameters such as electrical currents, voltages, membrane states (ion channel states) and neuromodulators.\n\nSince learning and long-term memory are believed to result from strengthening or weakening the synapses via a mechanism known as synaptic plasticity or synaptic adaptation, the model should include this mechanism. The response of sensory receptors to various stimuli must also be modelled.\n\nFurthermore, the model may have to include metabolism, i.e. how the neurons are affected by hormones and other chemical substances that may cross the blood–brain barrier. It is considered likely that the model must include currently unknown neuromodulators, neurotransmitters and ion channels. It is considered unlikely that the simulation model has to include protein interaction, which would make it computationally complex.\n\nA digital computer simulation model of an analog system such as the brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion. However, the biological neurons also suffer from randomness and limited precision, for example due to background noise. The errors of the discrete model can be made smaller than the randomness of the biological brain by choosing a sufficiently high variable resolution and sample rate, and sufficiently accurate models of non-linearities. The computational power and computer memory must however be sufficient to run such large simulations, preferably in real time.\n\nWhen modelling and simulating the brain of a specific individual, a brain map or connectivity database showing the connections between the neurons must be extracted from an anatomic model of the brain. For whole brain simulation, this network map should show the connectivity of the whole nervous system, including the spinal cord, sensory receptors, and muscle cells. Destructive scanning of a small sample of tissue from a mouse brain including synaptic details is possible as of 2010.\n\nHowever, if short-term memory and working memory include prolonged or repeated firing of neurons, as well as intra-neural dynamic processes, the electrical and chemical signal state of the synapses and neurons may be hard to extract. The uploaded mind may then perceive a memory loss of the events and mental processes immediately before the time of brain scanning.\n\nA full brain map has been estimated to occupy less than 2 x 10 bytes (20,000 TB) and would store the addresses of the connected neurons, the synapse type and the synapse \"weight\" for each of the brains' 10 synapses. However, the biological complexities of true brain function (e.g. the epigenetic states of neurons, protein components with multiple functional states, etc.) may preclude an accurate prediction of the volume of binary data required to faithfully represent a functioning human mind.\n\nA possible method for mind uploading is serial sectioning, in which the brain tissue and perhaps other parts of the nervous system are frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer, which for frozen samples at nano-scale requires a cryo-ultramicrotome, thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections. The exposed surface of frozen nerve tissue would be scanned and recorded, and then the surface layer of tissue removed. While this would be a very slow and labor-intensive process, research is currently underway to automate the collection and microscopy of serial sections. The scans would then be analyzed, and a model of the neural net recreated in the system that the mind was being uploaded into.\n\nThere are uncertainties with this approach using current microscopy techniques. If it is possible to replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone, then the resolution afforded by a scanning electron microscope would suffice for such a technique. However, as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events (particularly at synapses, but also at other places on the neuron's cell membrane), this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions. It may be possible to extend the techniques of serial sectioning and to capture the internal molecular makeup of neurons, through the use of sophisticated immunohistochemistry staining methods that could then be read via confocal laser scanning microscopy. However, as the physiological genesis of 'mind' is not currently known, this method may not be able to access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity.\n\nIt may be possible to create functional 3D maps of the brain activity, using advanced neuroimaging technology, such as functional MRI (fMRI, for mapping change in blood flow), magnetoencephalography (MEG, for mapping of electrical currents), or combinations of multiple methods, to build a detailed three-dimensional model of the brain using non-invasive and non-destructive methods. Today, fMRI is often combined with MEG for creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks, as the methods complement each other. Even though current imaging technology lacks the spatial resolution needed to gather the information needed for such a scan, important recent and future developments are predicted to substantially improve both spatial and temporal resolutions of existing technologies.\n\nThere is ongoing work in the field of brain simulation, including partial and whole simulations of some animals. For example, the \"C. elegans\" roundworm, \"Drosophila\" fruit fly, and mouse have all been simulated to various degrees.\n\nThe Blue Brain Project by the Brain and Mind Institute of the \"École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,\" Switzerland is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry.\n\nUnderlying the concept of \"mind uploading\" (more accurately \"mind transferring\") is the broad philosophy that consciousness lies within the brain's information processing and is in essence an emergent feature that arises from large neural network high-level patterns of organization, and that the same patterns of organization can be realized in other processing devices. Mind uploading also relies on the idea that the human mind (the \"self\" and the long-term memory), just like non-human minds, is represented by the current neural network paths and the weights of the brain synapses rather than by a dualistic and mystic soul and spirit. The mind or \"soul\" can be defined as the information state of the brain, and is immaterial only in the same sense as the information content of a data file or the state of a computer software currently residing in the work-space memory of the computer. Data specifying the information state of the neural network can be captured and copied as a \"computer file\" from the brain and re-implemented into a different physical form. This is not to deny that minds are richly adapted to their substrates. An analogy to the idea of mind uploading is to copy the temporary information state (the variable values) of a computer program from the computer memory to another computer and continue its execution. The other computer may perhaps have different hardware architecture but emulates the hardware of the first computer.\n\nThese issues have a long history. In 1775 Thomas Reid wrote: “I would be glad to know... whether when my brain has lost its original structure, and when some hundred years after the same materials are fabricated so curiously as to become an intelligent being, whether, I say that being will be me; or, if, two or three such beings should be formed out of my brain; whether they will all be me, and consequently one and the same intelligent being.”\n\nA considerable portion of transhumanists and singularitarians place great hope into the belief that they may become immortal, by creating one or many non-biological functional copies of their brains, thereby leaving their \"biological shell\". However, the philosopher and transhumanist Susan Schneider claims that at best, uploading would create a copy of the original person's mind. Susan Schneider agrees that consciousness has a computational basis, but this does not mean we can upload and survive. According to her views, \"uploading\" would probably result in the death of the original person's brain, while only outside observers can maintain the illusion of the original person still being alive. For it is implausible to think that one's consciousness would leave one's brain and travel to a remote location; ordinary physical objects do not behave this way. Ordinary objects (rocks, tables, etc.) are not simultaneously here, and elsewhere. At best, a copy of the original mind is created. Neural correlates of consciousness, a sub-branch of neuroscience, states that consciousness may be thought of as a state-dependent property of some undefined complex, adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system.\n\nOthers have argued against such conclusions. For example, Buddhist transhumanist James Hughes has pointed out that this consideration only goes so far: if one believes the self is an illusion, worries about survival are not reasons to avoid uploading, and Keith Wiley has presented an argument wherein all resulting minds of an uploading procedure are granted equal primacy in their claim to the original identity, such that survival of the self is determined retroactively from a strictly subjective position. Some have also asserted that consciousness is a part of an extra-biological system that is yet to be discovered and cannot be fully understood under the present constraints of neurobiology. Without the transference of consciousness, true mind-upload or perpetual immortality cannot be practically achieved.\n\nAnother potential consequence of mind uploading is that the decision to \"upload\" may then create a mindless symbol manipulator instead of a conscious mind (see philosophical zombie). Are we to assume that an upload is conscious if it displays behaviors that are highly indicative of consciousness? Are we to assume that an upload is conscious if it verbally insists that it is conscious? Could there be an absolute upper limit in processing speed above which consciousness cannot be sustained? The mystery of consciousness precludes a definitive answer to this question. Numerous scientists, including Kurzweil, strongly believe that determining whether a separate entity is conscious (with 100% confidence) is fundamentally unknowable, since consciousness is inherently subjective (see solipsism). Regardless, some scientists strongly believe consciousness is the consequence of computational processes which are substrate-neutral. On the contrary, numerous scientists believe consciousness may be the result of some form of quantum computation dependent on substrate (see quantum mind).\n\nIn light of uncertainty on whether to regard uploads as conscious, Sandberg proposes a cautious approach: \n\nIt is argued that if a computational copy of one's mind did exist, it would be impossible for one to verify this. The argument for this stance is the following: for a computational mind to recognize an emulation of itself, it must be capable of deciding whether two Turing machines (namely, itself and the proposed emulation) are functionally equivalent. This task is uncomputable due to the undecidability of equivalence, thus there cannot exist a computational procedure in the mind that is capable of recognizing an emulation of itself.\n\nThe process of developing emulation technology raises ethical issues related to animal welfare and artificial consciousness. The neuroscience required to develop brain emulation would require animal experimentation, first on invertebrates and then on small mammals before moving on to humans. Sometimes the animals would just need to be euthanized in order to extract, slice, and scan their brains, but sometimes behavioral and \"in vivo\" measures would be required, which might cause pain to living animals.\n\nIn addition, the resulting animal emulations themselves might suffer, depending on one's views about consciousness. Bancroft argues for the plausibility of consciousness in brain simulations on the basis of the \"fading qualia\" thought experiment of David Chalmers. He then concludes: “If, as I argue above, a sufficiently detailed computational simulation of the brain is potentially operationally equivalent to an organic brain, it follows that we must consider extending protections against suffering to simulations.”\n\nIt might help reduce emulation suffering to develop virtual equivalents of anaesthesia, as well as to omit processing related to pain and/or consciousness. However, some experiments might require a fully functioning and suffering animal emulation. Animals might also suffer by accident due to flaws and lack of insight into what parts of their brains are suffering. Questions also arise regarding the moral status of \"partial\" brain emulations, as well as creating neuromorphic emulations that draw inspiration from biological brains but are built somewhat differently.\n\nBrain emulations could be erased by computer viruses or malware, without need to destroy the underlying hardware. This may make assassination easier than for physical humans. The attacker might take the computing power for its own use.\n\nMany questions arise regarding the legal personhood of emulations. Would they be given the rights of biological humans? If a person makes an emulated copy of themselves and then dies, does the emulation inherit their property and official positions? Could the emulation ask to \"pull the plug\" when its biological version was terminally ill or in a coma? Would it help to treat emulations as adolescents for a few years so that the biological creator would maintain temporary control? Would criminal emulations receive the death penalty, or would they be given forced data modification as a form of \"rehabilitation\"? Could an upload have marriage and child-care rights?\n\nIf simulated minds would come true and if they were assigned rights of their own, it may be difficult to ensure the protection of \"digital human rights\". For example, social science researchers might be tempted to secretly expose simulated minds, or whole isolated societies of simulated minds, to controlled experiments in which many copies of the same minds are exposed (serially or simultaneously) to different test conditions.\n\nEmulations could create a number of conditions that might increase risk of war, including inequality, changes of power dynamics, a possible technological arms race to build emulations first, first-strike advantages, strong loyalty and willingness to \"die\" among emulations, and triggers for racist, xenophobic, and religious prejudice. If emulations run much faster than humans, there might not be enough time for human leaders to make wise decisions or negotiate. It is possible that humans would react violently against growing power of emulations, especially if they depress human wages. Emulations may not trust each other, and even well-intentioned defensive measures might be interpreted as offense.\n\nThere are very few feasible technologies that humans have refrained from developing. The neuroscience and computer-hardware technologies that may make brain emulation possible are widely desired for other reasons, and logically their development will continue into the future. Assuming that emulation technology will arrive, a question becomes whether we should accelerate or slow its advance.\n\nArguments for speeding up brain-emulation research:\n\nArguments for slowing down brain-emulation research:\n\nEmulation research would also speed up neuroscience as a whole, which might accelerate medical advances, cognitive enhancement, lie detectors, and capability for psychological manipulation.\n\nEmulations might be easier to control than \"de novo\" AI because\n\nAs counterpoint to these considerations, Bostrom notes some downsides:\n\nRay Kurzweil, director of engineering at Google, claims to know and foresee that people will be able to \"upload\" their entire brains to computers and become \"digitally immortal\" by 2045. Kurzweil made this claim for many years, e.g. during his speech in 2013 at the Global Futures 2045 International Congress in New York, which claims to subscribe to a similar set of beliefs. Mind uploading is also advocated by a number of researchers in neuroscience and artificial intelligence, such as Marvin Minsky while he was still alive. In 1993, Joe Strout created a small web site called the Mind Uploading Home Page, and began advocating the idea in cryonics circles and elsewhere on the net. That site has not been actively updated in recent years, but it has spawned other sites including MindUploading.org, run by Randal A. Koene, who also moderates a mailing list on the topic. These advocates see mind uploading as a medical procedure which could eventually save countless lives.\n\nMany transhumanists look forward to the development and deployment of mind uploading technology, with transhumanists such as Nick Bostrom predicting that it will become possible within the 21st century due to technological trends such as Moore's law.\n\nMichio Kaku, in collaboration with Science, hosted a documentary, \"\", based on his book \"Physics of the Impossible\".  Episode four, titled \"How to Teleport\", mentions that mind uploading \"via\" techniques such as quantum entanglement and whole brain emulation using an advanced MRI machine may enable people to be transported to vast distances at near light-speed.\n\nThe book \"Beyond Humanity: CyberEvolution and Future Minds\" by Gregory S. Paul & Earl D. Cox, is about the eventual (and, to the authors, almost inevitable) evolution of computers into sentient beings, but also deals with human mind transfer. Richard Doyle's \"Wetwares: Experiments in PostVital Living\" deals extensively with uploading from the perspective of distributed embodiment, arguing for example that humans are currently part of the \"artificial life phenotype\". Doyle's vision reverses the polarity on uploading, with artificial life forms such as uploads actively seeking out biological embodiment as part of their reproductive strategy.\n\nKenneth D. Miller, a professor of neuroscience at Columbia and a co-director of the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, raised doubts about the practicality of mind uploading. His major argument is that reconstructing neurons and their connections is in itself a formidable task, but it is far from being sufficient. Operation of the brain depends on the dynamics of electrical and biochemical signal exchange between neurons; therefore, capturing them in a single \"frozen\" state may prove insufficient. In addition, the nature of these signals may require modeling down to the molecular level and beyond. Therefore, while not rejecting the idea in principle, Miller believes that the complexity of the \"absolute\" duplication of an individual mind is insurmountable for the nearest hundreds of years.\n\n"}

{"id": "2436363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2436363", "title": "Neontology", "text": "Neontology\n\nNeontology is a part of biology that, in contrast to paleontology, deals with living (or, more generally, \"recent\") organisms. It is the study of extant taxa (singular: extant taxon): taxa (such as species, genera and families) with members still alive, as opposed to (all) being extinct. For example:\n\nA taxon can be classified as extinct if it is broadly agreed or certified that no members of the group are still alive. Conversely, an extinct taxon can be reclassified as extant if there are new discoveries of extant species (\"Lazarus species\"), or if previously-known extant species are reclassified as members of the taxon.\n\nMost biologists, zoologists, and botanists are in practice neontologists, and the term neontologist is used largely by paleontologists referring to non-paleontologists. Stephen Jay Gould said of neontology:\n\nAll professions maintain their parochialisms, and I trust that nonpaleontological readers will forgive our major manifestation. We are paleontologists, so we need a name to contrast ourselves with all you folks who study modern organisms in human or ecological time. You therefore become neontologists. We do recognize the unbalanced and parochial nature of this dichotomous division.\nNeontological evolutionary biology has a temporal perspective between 100 to 1000 years. Neontology's fundamental basis relies on models of natural selection as well as speciation. Neontology's methods, when compared to evolutionary paleontology, has a greater emphasis on experiments. There are more frequent discontinuities present in paleontology than in neontology, because paleontology involves extinct taxa. Neontology has organisms actually present and available to sample and perform research on. Neontology's research method uses cladistics to examine morphologies and genetics. Neontology data has more emphasis on genetic data and the population structure than paleontology does.\n\nWhen the scientific community accepted the synthetic theory of evolution, taxonomies became phylogenetic. As a result, information gaps arose within the fossil record of species- especially in Homo sapiens. The anthropologists who accepted the synthetic theory, reject the idea of an \"ape man\" because the concept had mistaken paleontology with neontology. An ape man, in actuality, would be a primate with traits that would represent anything in between Homo sapiens and the great apes. If the concept of an ape man was based on neontology, then our phenotype would resemble Bigfoot. Since the concept was based on paleontology, the idea of an ape man could possibly be represented by the fossil hominids.\n\nNeontology studies extant taxa and also recently extinct taxa, but declaring a taxon to be definitively extinct is difficult. Taxa that have previously been declared extinct may reappear over time. Species that were once considered extinct and then reappear unscathed are characterized by the term \"The Lazarus effect\", or are also called a Lazarus species. For example, a study determined that 36% of supposed mammalian extinction had been resolved, while the other 64% had insufficient evidence to be declared extinct or had been rediscovered. Currently, the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers a taxon to be recently extinct if the extinction occurred after 1500 C.R. The most recently considered extinct mammal was the Bouvier's red colobus monkey, who was considered extinct up until 2015 when it was rediscovered after no recorded sightings for 40 years.\n\nNeontology's fundamental theories relies on biological models of natural selection and speciation that connects genes, the unit of heredity with the mechanism of evolution, natural selection. For example, researchers utilized neontological and paleontological datasets to study mouse dentitions compared with human dentitions. In order to understand the underlying genetic mechanisms that influences this variation between nonhuman primates and humans, neontological methods are applied to the research method. By incorporating neontology with different biological research methods, it can become clear how genetic mechanisms underlie major events in things such as primate evolution.\n"}
{"id": "19653842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19653842", "title": "Organism", "text": "Organism\n\nIn biology, an organism (from Greek: ὀργανισμός, \"organismos\") is any individual entity that exhibits the properties of life. It is a synonym for \"life form\".\n\nOrganisms are classified by taxonomy into specified groups such as the multicellular animals, plants, and fungi; or unicellular microorganisms such as a protists, bacteria, and archaea. All types of organisms are capable of reproduction, growth and development, maintenance, and some degree of response to stimuli. Humans are multicellular animals composed of many trillions of cells which differentiate during development into specialized tissues and organs.\n\nAn organism may be either a prokaryote or a eukaryote. Prokaryotes are represented by two separate domains—bacteria and archaea. Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound cell nucleus and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called organelles (such as mitochondria in animals and plants and plastids in plants and algae, all generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria). Fungi, animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms within the eukaryotes.\n\nEstimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which only about 1.2 million have been documented. More than 99% of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived are estimated to be extinct. In 2016, a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms was identified.\n\nThe term \"organism\" (from Greek ὀργανισμός, \"organismos\", from ὄργανον, \"organon\", i.e. \"instrument, implement, tool, organ of sense or apprehension\") first appeared in the English language in 1703 and took on its current definition by 1834 (Oxford English Dictionary). It is directly related to the term \"organization\". There is a long tradition of defining organisms as self-organizing beings, going back at least to Immanuel Kant's 1790 \"Critique of Judgment\".\n\nAn organism may be defined as an assembly of molecules functioning as a more or less stable whole that exhibits the properties of life. Dictionary definitions can be broad, using phrases such as \"any living structure, such as a plant, animal, fungus or bacterium, capable of growth and reproduction\". Many definitions exclude viruses and possible man-made non-organic life forms, as viruses are dependent on the biochemical machinery of a host cell for reproduction. A superorganism is an organism consisting of many individuals working together as a single functional or social unit.\n\nThere has been controversy about the best way to define the organism and indeed about whether or not such a definition is necessary. Several contributions are responses to the suggestion that the category of \"organism\" may well not be adequate in biology.\n\nViruses are not typically considered to be organisms because they are incapable of autonomous reproduction, growth or metabolism. This controversy is problematic because some cellular organisms are also incapable of independent survival (but are capable of independent metabolism and procreation) and live as obligatory intracellular parasites. Although viruses have a few enzymes and molecules characteristic of living organisms, they have no metabolism of their own; they cannot synthesize and organize the organic compounds from which they are formed. Naturally, this rules out autonomous reproduction: they can only be passively replicated by the machinery of the host cell. In this sense, they are similar to inanimate matter. While viruses sustain no independent metabolism, and thus are usually not classified as organisms, they do have their own genes, and they do evolve by mechanisms similar to the evolutionary mechanisms of organisms.\n\nThe most common argument in support of viruses as living organisms is their ability to undergo evolution and replicate through self-assembly. Some scientists argue that viruses neither evolve, nor self- reproduce. In fact, viruses are evolved by their host cells, meaning that there was co-evolution of viruses and host cells. If host cells did not exist, viral evolution would be impossible. This is not true for cells. If viruses did not exist, the direction of cellular evolution could be different, but cells would nevertheless be able to evolve. As for the reproduction, viruses totally rely on hosts' machinery to replicate. The discovery of viral megagenomes with genes coding for energy metabolism and protein synthesis fueled the debate about whether viruses belong in the tree of life. The presence of these genes suggested that viruses were once able to metabolize. However, it was found later that the genes coding for energy and protein metabolism have a cellular origin. Most likely, these genes were acquired through horizontal gene transfer from viral hosts.\n\nOrganisms are complex chemical systems, organized in ways that promote reproduction and some measure of sustainability or survival. The same laws that govern non-living chemistry govern the chemical processes of life. It is generally the phenomena of entire organisms that determine their fitness to an environment and therefore the survivability of their DNA-based genes.\n\nOrganisms clearly owe their origin, metabolism, and many other internal functions to chemical phenomena, especially the chemistry of large organic molecules. Organisms are complex systems of chemical compounds that, through interaction and environment, play a wide variety of roles.\n\nOrganisms are semi-closed chemical systems. Although they are individual units of life (as the definition requires), they are not closed to the environment around them. To operate they constantly take in and release energy. Autotrophs produce usable energy (in the form of organic compounds) using light from the sun or inorganic compounds while heterotrophs take in organic compounds from the environment.\n\nThe primary chemical element in these compounds is carbon. The chemical properties of this element such as its great affinity for bonding with other small atoms, including other carbon atoms, and its small size making it capable of forming multiple bonds, make it ideal as the basis of organic life. It is able to form small three-atom compounds (such as carbon dioxide), as well as large chains of many thousands of atoms that can store data (nucleic acids), hold cells together, and transmit information (protein).\n\nCompounds that make up organisms may be divided into macromolecules and other, smaller molecules. The four groups of macromolecule are nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. Nucleic acids (specifically deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) store genetic data as a sequence of nucleotides. The particular sequence of the four different types of nucleotides (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine) dictate many characteristics that constitute the organism. The sequence is divided up into codons, each of which is a particular sequence of three nucleotides and corresponds to a particular amino acid. Thus a sequence of DNA codes for a particular protein that, due to the chemical properties of the amino acids it is made from, folds in a particular manner and so performs a particular function.\n\nThese protein functions have been recognized:\n\nA bilayer of phospholipids makes up the membrane of cells that constitutes a barrier, containing everything within the cell and preventing compounds from freely passing into, and out of, the cell. Due to the selective permeability of the phospholipid membrane only specific compounds can pass through it. In some multicellular organisms they serve as a storage of energy and mediate communication between cells. Carbohydrates are more easily broken down than lipids and yield more energy to compare to lipids and proteins. In fact, carbohydrates are the number one source of energy for all living organisms.\n\nAll organisms consist of structural units called cells; some contain a single cell (unicellular) and others contain many units (multicellular). Multicellular organisms are able to specialize cells to perform specific functions. A group of such cells is a tissue, and in animals these occur as four basic types, namely epithelium, nervous tissue, muscle tissue, and connective tissue. Several types of tissue work together in the form of an organ to produce a particular function (such as the pumping of the blood by the heart, or as a barrier to the environment as the skin). This pattern continues to a higher level with several organs functioning as an organ system such as the reproductive system, and digestive system. Many multicellular organisms consist of several organ systems, which coordinate to allow for life.\n\nThe cell theory, first developed in 1839 by Schleiden and Schwann, states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells; all cells come from preexisting cells; and cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells.\n\nThere are two types of cells, eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are usually singletons, while eukaryotic cells are usually found in multicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells lack a nuclear membrane so DNA is unbound within the cell; eukaryotic cells have nuclear membranes.\n\nAll cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, have a membrane, which envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out, and maintains the electric potential of the cell. Inside the membrane, a salty cytoplasm takes up most of the cell volume. All cells possess DNA, the hereditary material of genes, and RNA, containing the information necessary to build various proteins such as enzymes, the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of biomolecules in cells.\n\nAll cells share several similar characteristics of:\n\nThe last universal common ancestor (LUCA) is the most recent organism from which all organisms now living on Earth descend. Thus it is the most recent common ancestor of all current life on Earth. The LUCA is estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago (sometime in the Paleoarchean era). The earliest evidence for life on Earth is graphite found to be biogenic in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. Although more than 99 percent of all species that ever lived on the planet are estimated to be extinct, there are currently 10–14 million species of life on Earth.\n\nInformation about the early development of life includes input from many different fields, including geology and planetary science. These sciences provide information about the history of the Earth and the changes produced by life. However, a great deal of information about the early Earth has been destroyed by geological processes over the course of time.\n\nAll organisms are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool. Evidence for common descent may be found in traits shared between all living organisms. In Darwin's day, the evidence of shared traits was based solely on visible observation of morphologic similarities, such as the fact that all birds have wings, even those that do not fly.\n\nThere is strong evidence from genetics that all organisms have a common ancestor. For example, every living cell makes use of nucleic acids as its genetic material, and uses the same twenty amino acids as the building blocks for proteins. All organisms use the same genetic code (with some extremely rare and minor deviations) to translate nucleic acid sequences into proteins. The universality of these traits strongly suggests common ancestry, because the selection of many of these traits seems arbitrary. Horizontal gene transfer makes it more difficult to study the last universal ancestor. However, the universal use of the same genetic code, same nucleotides, and same amino acids makes the existence of such an ancestor overwhelmingly likely.\n\nThe most commonly accepted location of the root of the tree of life is between a monophyletic domain Bacteria and a clade formed by Archaea and Eukaryota of what is referred to as the \"traditional tree of life\" based on several molecular studies. A very small minority of studies have concluded differently, namely that the root is in the domain Bacteria, either in the phylum Firmicutes or that the phylum Chloroflexi is basal to a clade with Archaea and Eukaryotes and the rest of Bacteria as proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith.\n\nResearch published in 2016, by William F. Martin, by genetically analyzing 6.1 million protein coding genes from sequenced prokaryotic genomes of various phylogenetic trees, identified 355 protein clusters from amongst 286,514 protein clusters that were probably common to the LUCA. The results \"depict LUCA as anaerobic, CO-fixing, H-dependent with a Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (the reductive acetyl-coenzyme A pathway), N-fixing and thermophilic. LUCA's biochemistry was replete with FeS clusters and radical reaction mechanisms. Its cofactors reveal dependence upon transition metals, flavins, S-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A, ferredoxin, molybdopterin, corrins and selenium. Its genetic code required nucleoside modifications and S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylations.\" The results depict methanogenic clostria as a basal clade in the 355 lineages examined, and suggest that the LUCA inhabited an anaerobic hydrothermal vent setting in a geochemically active environment rich in H, CO, and iron. However, the identification of these genes as being present in LUCA was criticized, suggesting that many of the proteins assumed to be present in LUCA represent later horizontal gene transfers between archaea and bacteria.\n\nSexual reproduction is widespread among current eukaryotes, and was likely present in the last common ancestor. This is suggested by the finding of a core set of genes for meiosis in the descendants of lineages that diverged early from the eukaryotic evolutionary tree. and Malik et al. It is further supported by evidence that eukaryotes previously regarded as \"ancient asexuals\", such as \"Amoeba\", were likely sexual in the past, and that most present day asexual amoeboid lineages likely arose recently and independently.\n\nIn prokaryotes, natural bacterial transformation involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another and integration of the donor DNA into the recipient chromosome by recombination. Natural bacterial transformation is considered to be a primitive sexual process and occurs in both bacteria and archaea, although it has been studied mainly in bacteria. Transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation and not an accidental occurrence, because it depends on numerous gene products that specifically interact with each other to enter a state of natural competence to perform this complex process. Transformation is a common mode of DNA transfer among prokaryotes.\n\nThe ancestry of living organisms has traditionally been reconstructed from morphology, but is increasingly supplemented with phylogenetics—the reconstruction of phylogenies by the comparison of genetic (DNA) sequence.\nSequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer of many genes among diverse species including across the boundaries of phylogenetic \"domains\". Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes.\n\nBiologist Peter Gogarten suggests \"the original metaphor of a tree no longer fits the data from recent genome research\", therefore \"biologists (should) use the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use (the) metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes.\"\n\nModern biotechnology is challenging traditional concepts of organism and species. Cloning is the process of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another, with the potential of creating entirely new species of organisms. Cloning is the subject of much ethical debate.\n\nIn 2008, the J. Craig Venter Institute assembled a synthetic bacterial genome, \"Mycoplasma genitalium\", by using recombination in yeast of 25 overlapping DNA fragments in a single step. \"The use of yeast recombination greatly simplifies the assembly of large DNA molecules from both synthetic and natural fragments.\" Other companies, such as Synthetic Genomics, have already been formed to take advantage of the many commercial uses of custom designed genomes.\n\n\n"}

It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue Phaedo, in which Socrates argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including Plotinus, Descartes, and Leibniz, argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the \"Phaedon\", Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls \"the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology\"). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.\n\nMaterialistic views were at the time rampant and fashionable, and faith in immortality was at a low ebb. At this favourable juncture appeared Phädon oder über die Unsterblichkeit der Seele (Phaedo or On the Immortality of Souls; 1767). Modelled on Plato's dialogue of the same name, Mendelssohn's work possessed some of the charm of its Greek exemplar and impressed the German world with its beauty and lucidity of style. The Phaedon was an immediate success, and besides being one of the most widely read books of its time in German it was speedily translated into several European languages, including English. The author was hailed as the \"German Plato,\" or the \"German Socrates\"; royal and other aristocratic friends showered attentions on him, and it was said that \"no stranger who came to Berlin failed to pay his personal respects to the German Socrates.\"\n\nImmanuel Kant criticized Mendelssohn's argument for immortality in the second edition of the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (1787), at B413–15. Commentators disagree over whether Kant's criticism is successful. Mendelssohn's arguments have been largely overlooked by contemporary analytic philosophers, but philosophers including Bertrand Russell and E.J. Lowe have offered arguments for the simplicity of the soul.\n\n"}

The many varieties of \"shijie\" range from deceitful cases, such as a person feigning death by substituting the corpse of their recently deceased grandfather as their own, to supernatural cases, such as (\"jianjie\" 劍解, \"sword liberation\") using a \"waidan\" alchemical sword to temporarily create a corpse-simulacrum, which enables one to escape and assume a new identity.\n\nThe Chinese term \"shījiě\" compounds the words \"shī\" (尸 or 屍, \"corpse; body\") and \"jiě\" (解, \"separate; divide; cut apart\"), and has been described as a \"rather strange name\" (Seidel 1987: 230), \"notoriously slippery term\" (Benn 2003: 139), with \"the potential for confusion\" (Campany 2002: 53), and sometimes \"misrepresented or interpreted in a way too vague to be intelligible\" (Pas 1998: 57).\n\nShī (尸) has three sets of English translation equivalents in Paul W. Kroll's dictionary of Classical Chinese and Medieval Chinese:\n\"Shi\"'s first equivalent of the ceremonial personator who was a stand-in for a deceased relative (\"corpse\") during Chinese funeral rituals and ancestral rites is a semantic extension of the basic meaning \"corpse\" (Carr 2007). Campany describes the \"shi\" \"impersonator of deceased ancestors, one who sat in their place during the solemn presentation of food, drink, and announcements and the performance of dances\" (2002: 53).\n\nBesides the usual meaning of \"corpse, dead body\", \"shi\" 尸 can sometimes mean \"body, mortal body\"—particularly in \"shijie\" contexts. Joseph Needham translates \"shijie\" as \"release from the mortal part\" (1974: 297), which is more appropriate than \"release from the corpse\" because the first step in achieving \"shijie\" transcendence is to abandon one's corporeal body (Pregadio 2004: 117). Anna Seidel points out that \"shi\" in the term \"shijie\" denotes \"all the corruptible aging factors of the physical body,\" rather than the corpse itself (1987: 230). Fabrizio Pregadio cites a classic Daoist text that clearly uses the word \"shi\" to denote \"not specifically a corpse, but in general the 'mortal body', either living or dead\". A passage in the c. 200 CE \"Xiang'er\" commentary to the \"Daodejing\" (see below) contrasts \"shisi\" (尸死) and \"shisheng\" (尸生), which cannot be read literally to mean \"a corpse dies\" and \"a corpse lives\". \"When the mortal body dies (\"shisi\"), that is wearing out; when the mortal body lives (\"shisheng\"), that is accomplishment\"; this context refers to options for a living person, and not to a postmortem renewal; \"its subject, in other words, is not the 'corpse' but the 'mortal body'\" (2004: 116-117). However, Campany contends that what is escaped through \"shijie\" is not the adept's \"shi\" dead body but the administrative system of death registration (2002: 53).\n\nOwing to the ambiguities of reading the original Chinese character 尸 for \"shi\" \"corpse; mortal body; personator of the dead; etc.\", the basic meaning of \"corpse\" is clarified with the character \"shi\" 屍 that adds \"si\" (死, \"die; death\") to \"shi\" 尸. Compare the word \"sǐshī\" (死屍, lit. \"dead corpse\") meaning \"corpse; dead body\".\n\nJie (解) has seven sets of English translation equivalents in Kroll's dictionary:\nKroll gives \"shijie\" as a usage example under both \"shi\" 2. and \"jie\" 4., glossed as \"'deliverance by means of a [simulated] corpse,' in which the adept's supposed corpse is buried but is actually substituted with a personal object (sword, staff, etc.) that temporarily takes on the appearance of the corpse, thus allowing one to escape from the bureaucracy of death; a lower-level means of transcendence.\" \n\nScholars propose divergent semantic interpretations of the \"jie\" in \"shijie\": \"to molt,\" \"to quarter,\" \"to expel an affliction\" (Robinet 1979: 58); \"to divide, separate, disperse, to detach, deliver\", \"to loosen, dissolve, explain\", and \"emancipation, liberation\" in Chinese Buddhism (Pas 1998: 58); and \"release, deliverance, escape\" (Campany 2002: 53). The ancient \"shijie\" is related with the medical term \"shītǐ jiěpu\" (屍體解剖, \"autopsy; postmortem examination\") that combines \"shītǐ\" (屍體, \"corpse; remains\") with \"jiěpōu\" (解剖, \"dissect\").\n\nThe forms of \"shijie\" are quite diverse, in its broadest meaning, the term sometimes simply denotes disappearance, \"to depart on a journey through foreign lands.\" It more commonly designates a type of disappearance that leaves a trace behind, such as a body without its bones, or a coffin that contains only a symbolic staff, sword, or sandal. Sometimes \"shijie\" can even refer to an adept who comes back to life after apparent death (Robinet 1979: 58-59).\n\nThe French sinologist Isabelle Robinet compares the common forms of \"shijie\".\nAnother variation is \"zhangjie\" (杖解, \"staff-liberated)\", when the adept's bamboo staff served as a temporary stand-in for his real body, which was transformed and vanished away to the realm of the immortals (Strickmann 1979: 130).\n\n\"Shijie\" is similar to the word \"bianhua\" (\"transformation; metamorphosis\") and its synonymous components \"bian\" (變, \"change; alter\") and \"hua\" (化, \"change; transform\"). For instance, the 499 \"Zhen'gao\" refers to a superior method of \"shijie\" called \"huadun\" (化遁, \"to transform and escape\"), and mentions \"tuohua dunbian\" (託化遁變, \"to simulate transformation and hide by metamorphosis\"); and the 983 \"Taiping Yulan\" describes \"shijie dunbian\" (尸解遁變, \"delivered from the body and transformed by escaping\") (Robinet 1979: 57). All types of \"bianhua\" require a material support, and \"shijie\" generally involves \"going away by making use of a material object.\" However, there is an essential difference between them. \"Bianhua\" is a magical trick or the manipulation of a power that the mystic can use while alive; \"Shijie\" is only practiced at the end of life and is a form of deliverance linked with the purification and refinement of the body (Robinet 1993: 168).\nThe \"huà\" (化, \"change; transform; convert\") in \"bianhua\" occurs in several Daoist alternative terms for \"shijie\". \"Jiěhuà\" (解化, with the \"jie\" \"release; etc.\" in \"shijie\") means \"liberate the mortal body and attain the Dao\". \"Xiāohuà\" (銷化, with \"melt away; disintegrate\") means \"release the physical body and transform into a \"xian\"\" (see the \"Shiji\" below). \"Yǔhuà\" (羽化, with \"feather; wing\") refers to an insect \"growing wings; eclosion\", which Daoists semantically extended to \"die and become a \"xian\" flying up to heaven\"; wings are a common feature in depictions of \"xian\", either riding a mythological flying creature or flying with their own wings—compare \"yǔrén\" (羽人, with \"person\") \"\"xian\" transcendent/immortal; Daoist priest\". \n\nAs detailed in \"Early textual usages\" below, the term \"xingjie\" (形解, \"release of the form\"), with \"xíng\" (形, \"outward form, appearance, shape; figure, configuration; structure, contour, outline\", Kroll 2007: 509), was a near synonym of \"shijie\" (\"release from the corpse\") that was recorded several centuries earlier. \n\n\"Tuōsǐ\" (託死, \"feign death; simulate death\", later written 托死) frequently occurs in \"shijie\" contexts. Compare the Chinese Buddhist term \"tuōshēng\" (托生, \"be reincarnated\") that was also used in early Daoist texts.\n\nThe term \"shijie\" has been \"variously and often poorly translated\" (Robinet 1979: 58). Translational difficulty stems from \"shi\" \"corpse\", and the term is usually rendered \"liberation or deliverance from the corpse\". However, Kirkland points out that in most accounts of \"shijie\" the subject did not actually die, and although all the appearances of death were involved, no corpse was really left behind (2008: 897).\n\nEnglish translations include:\nWithin this sample, \"shi\" is usually translated as \"corpse\", and \"jie\" most commonly as \"liberation\" or \"release\".\n\nThe word \"shijie\" (\"release from/of the corpse\") is first recorded in the c. 80 CE \"Lunheng\" below, but its near synonym \"xingjie\" (形解, \"release from the form\") occurs in earlier texts dating from around the 3rd to 1st centuries BCE. They do not use \"xingjie\" to denote a specific Daoist practice or method, but as general ways of transcending one's limited individuality (Pregadio 2004: 116). While \"shijie\" and \"xingjie\" are both instances of transcending the mortal body, they are not exactly the same, \"release from the corpse\" requires undergoing death but \"release from the form\" does not (Pregadio 2004: 117).\n\nFirst, \"xingjie\" \"release from the form\" refers to a spiritual epiphany in the c. 3rd-2nd century BCE \"Zhuangzi\" story about Tian Zifang (田子方, Sir Square Field) praising his teacher Dongguo Xunzi (東郭順子, Sir Accord of Easturb) to the Marquess Wen of Wei (r. 446-397 BCE) (Pregadio 2004: 115).\nAfter Sir Square went out, Marquis Wen spent the rest of the day in a state of dumb uncertainty. Then he summoned before him the officials who were standing on duty and said to them, \"How far we are from the gentleman of complete integrity. At first I considered the words of the sages and the wise men, the practice of humaneness and righteousness to be the ultimate. But now that I have heard about Sir Square's teacher, my physical form is unstrung and I have no desire to move [吾形解而不欲動]; my mouth is clamped shut and I have no desire to speak. What I have emulated is only an earthen image, and the state of Wei has truly been an encumbrance to me.\" (tr. Mair 1994: 199) \n\nSecond, the term \"xingjie\" (形解, \"release of the form\") describes an advanced self-cultivation exercise in the \"Shiwen\" (十問, Ten Questions), a previously-unknown medical book within the c. 200-168 BCE Mawangdui Silk Texts that archeologists discovered in a Western Han tomb (Pas 1998: 58). The fourth of the \"Shiwen\"'s ten dialogues (MSVI.A.4) is between the mythical Yellow Emperor and Rong Cheng (容成), a legendary ancient master of Daoist sexual practices and \"Daoyin\" breath circulation techniques, who says, \nLongevity is born of growth and accumulation. As for the fullness of that life: above it scans heaven and below it spreads over earth. The person who is capable of it invariably becomes a spirit. Thus he is capable of achieving release of the form. The person who perceives the great way skims the clouds as he moves. … like water flowing he can range far; like the dragon ascending he can rise high. (tr. Harper 1998: 390). \nThis is the only \"Shiwen\" passage that reflects the likely influence of \"xian\" or \"syncretistic-Daoist\" ideas about transcendence/immortality in the Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan bamboo medical texts, which primarily discuss maintaining health and attaining longevity. Harper notes that \"xingjie\" \"release from the form\" is thought to be synonymous with \"shijie\" \"release from the corpse\", which for the Daoist believer, marked the moment of \"xian\" transformation when a new, immortal physique was perfected and the mortal body sloughed off, leaving behind a husk-like corpse (or an object such as a sword or staff) as evidence that the adept had achieved \"shijie\" (citing Maspero 1981: 445–48). However, it is evident that \"xingjie\" in this \"Shiwen\" context, with references to \"becoming a spirit\" above and rising \"like the dragon\", does not represent the concepts of \"shijie\" in religious Daoism (Harper 1998: 114, 124).\n\nThird, \"xingjie\" names a supernatural technique in Sima Qian's c. 94 BCE \"Shiji\" (Records of the Historian) passage denouncing the practices performed by some \"fangshi\" (\"masters of the methods\") from the state of Yan who arrived at the First Emperor of Qin's court. These masters \"practiced methods for immortality [僊道] and for the release from the form through dissolution and transformation [形解銷化], relying on services offered to gods and demons.\" (tr. Pregadio 2004: 115). The \"Shiji\" commentary cites Fu Qian 服虔 (c. 125-c. 195 CE), who glosses \"xingjie\" (形解) as \"shijie\" (尸解).\n\nThe abtruse meaning of this phrase \"xingjie xiaohua\" (形解銷化) is illustrated in other translations:\nBased upon this term \"xiao\" (銷, \"melt [esp. metal]; dissolve\"), some scholars (e.g., Robinet 1979: 66) believe \"xiaohua\" alludes to \"waidan\" External Alchemy practices, but Pregadio disagrees and says it refers to \"thaumaturgic methods for replicating and multiplying one's form (ubiquity), or for dissolving it and hiding it (invisibility)\" (2004: 115).\n\nThe iconoclastic philosopher Wang Chong's c. 80 CE \"Lunheng\" (Balanced Inquiries) has earliest known occurrences of the term \"shijie\" \"separation from the body\" (tr. Alfred Forke).\n\nThe \"Daoxu\" (道虛, Daoist Untruths) chapter uses \"shijie\" six times in a passage refuting the legend that Li Shaojun, a Daoist \"fangshi\" the court of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87), was several hundred years old when he died.\n\nWang Chong explains the \"shijie\" process with the \"chán\" (蟬, \"cicada\") analogy of a nymph molting its exoskeleton, converting into an adult, and leaving behind its exuviae; the adept transforms the body and joins with the spirit into physical immortality, leaving behind some external object in the coffin to prove that the corpse disappeared (Pas 1998: 60). \n\nForke also translates \"separation from the body\" for \"lixing\" (離形, \"separate from the form\") in another \"Lunheng\" chapter, \"Siwei\" (死偽, False Reports About the Dead). \"The souls of the dead are dissolved, and cannot hear any more what men say. This inability to hear what others say is called death. If after their separation from the body they became ghosts, and kept near to men, their connection with the body would already have been severed, and, though people addressed them, it would be impossible for them to again enter the body. and close the eyes, or open the mouth.\" (1907: 207).\n\nThe c. 190-200 CE \"Xiang'er\" commentary to the \"Daodejing\", which is central to the Daoist Way of the Celestial Masters religious tradition, uses \"shi\" to mean not specifically a \"corpse\" but generally a \"mortal body\", either living or dead (Pregadio 2004: 116).\n\nThe \"Xiang'er\" commentary uses the uncommon terms \"shisi\" (尸死, \"a corpse dies\") and \"shisheng\" (尸生, \"a corpse lives\") to explain the last line in \"Daodejing\" Chapter 15, \"Through this lack of fullness, they are able to disintegrate and be renewed\" [能辭復成]\" (tr. Pregadio 2004: 117). Bokenkamp interprets \"shisheng\" literally, \"When the corpse perishes, that is disintegration; when it lives, that is \"renewal\" [尸死為弊尸生為成]. Only by holding to the Dao without allowing one's will to overflow is one able to transform disintegration into renewal.\" (1997: 100). Pregadio translates \"shi\" as \"mortal body\", \"When the mortal body dies, that is wearing out; when the mortal body lives, that is accomplishment. Only by guarding the Dao without being full and overflowing is one able to transform wearing out into accomplishment.\" (2004: 117); noting that the passage refers to options given to a living person for their \"mortal body\", and not to a postmortem renewal for their \"corpse\".\n\nThe commentary to two \"Daodejing\" chapters describe an early Daoist understanding of transcendence. The adept \"tuōsǐ\" (託死, \"feigns/simulates death\") and goes to the \"Tàiyīn\" (太陰, Palace of Great Darkness, in the extreme north of the heavens), where their bodily form is refined, in analogy with alchemically refining base metals, resulting in \"fusheng\" (復生, \"rebirth\" or \"second birth\") in a body that preserves itself indefinitely (Pregadio 2018: 387). On the other hand, the damned are consigned to \"dìguān\" (地官, Earth Office), equated with the \"Diyu\" (地獄, \"earth prisons; purgatories\") of later texts. While the Celestial Masters recognized that death was inevitable, they sought longevity not through extended life in this world, but through the avoidance of death, described in terms of \"feigned death\" and continued existence in the next life (Bokenkamp 1997: 47).\n\n\"Daodejing\" Chapter 33 ends with the baffling phrase \"Those who die without perishing are longevous [死而不亡者壽]\", which the \"Xiang'er\" commentary explains.\nWhen a Daoist's practices are complete, the spirits of the Dao call that person to return. Departing the world through feigned death [避去託死], the person passes through Grand Darkness to be born again and not perish. That is longevity. Commoners have no good merits, and when they die, they belong to the Earth Office. That is to perish. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 135) \nCompare Seidel 's translation, \"When he retires from the world, he \"simulates\" death and passes over to the realm of the Extreme Yin (\"Taiyin\")\" (1987: 230).\n\nFor the Chapter 16 passage \"Their bodies obliterated, they do not perish [沒身不殆]\", the commentary says:\nGrand Darkness is the palace where those who have accumulated the Dao refine their forms [煉形]. When there is no place for them to stay in the world, the worthy withdraw and, feigning death [避去託死], pass through Grand Darkness to have their images reborn on the other side. This is to be \"obliterated without perishing.\" The profane are unable to accumulate good deeds, so when they die it is truly death. They are taken away in service of the Earth Offices. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 102) \nPregadio specifically translates \"lianxing\" (煉形) as \"refine their [bodily] forms\", and says, \"Since the release from, or rather of, the mortal body is a necessary step to continue one’s cultivation, the refining process takes place after one who is ready for it has \"simulated death\". Leaving one’s mortal body and refining one’s form results, at first, in entering again into a state in which neither form nor matter exist, but only a \"xiang\" (象, image, appearance). After the adept’s bodily form has been refined, the process culminates in his \"rebirth\".\" (2018: 387).\n\nThe \"Xiang'er\" commentary refers to those who lose faith in the Dao as \"xíngshī\" (行尸, \"mobile corpses\"). While received texts of Chapter 7 have \"Is it not just because he does not strive for any personal end that all his personal ends are fulfilled?\" (tr. Watson, 非以其無私耶故能成其私), the commentary has \"shi\" (尸, \"corpse\") instead of \"si\" (私, \"self-interest; selfish concerns\"), thus, \"Because he is without a corpse, he is able to perfect his [mortal] corpse.\" \nThe bodies of those who do not know the Dao of long life are but mobile corpses. It is not the Dao that they practice, but merely the way of the corpses. The reason the people of the Dao are able to achieve the longevity of Transcendents is that they do not practice the way of the corpses. They differ from the vulgar and thus are able to perfect their corpses, allowing them to enter the ranks of the Transcendent nobility. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 85) \n\nBeginning with the c. 2nd century CE \"Liexian Zhuan\" (Biographies of Exemplary Immortals), numerous hagiographies of Daoist masters directly or indirectly mentioned them transcending death through \"shijie\". While many religious traditions maintain that a believer can ascend to heaven and leave behind a body, Daoist accounts of \"shijie\" are notable for denying that a real corpse was left behind (Kirkland 2008: 896).\n\nSeveral \"Liexian zhuan\" hagiographies mention discovering \"wushi\" (無屍, \"corpseless\") coffins, implying that the adept had used \"shijie\", but only one directly refers to \"shijie\" (屍解). Kou Xian (寇先) was a legendary fisherman in the Zhou dynasty state of Song who lived on the banks of the Sui River (睢水) for over a century. Duke Jing (景公) of Song (r. 516-451) asked Kou to teach the \"Dao\" of longevity, but he refused and the duke had him executed. Several decades later Kou Xian was seen playing a \"qin\" lute by the Song city gate, revealing that he evaded death by means of \"shijie\". In later texts, this was interpreted as \"bingjie\" (兵解, \"escape by execution\") (Campany 2009: 125).\n\nThe \"Taiqing\" (太清, Great Clarity) school of Daoism, which preceded the better-known Shangqing School (Highest Clarity), devised new \"shijie\" methods using documents to game the spirit-administration system that regulates and enforces human lifespans. In contrast to the Jewish and Christian beliefs that God records the name of every person in the \"Book of Life\" and \"Book of Death\", the Chinese believed that the otherworldly death ledger system operated like the imperial system of census family registration, with scribes keeping track of people by their names and registered places of residence.\n\nTwo exemplary \"Taiqing\" scriptures, both mentioned in the c. 320 \"Baopuzi\" below, describe novel \"shijie\" procedures: placing a brief listing one's own name and registration data onto one's grandfather's corpse during the funeral, and creating a Daoist \"fu\" (符, supernatural talisman) asserting the cause of death was illness (Campany 2002: 57). Both \"shijie\" procedures require that the adept and substitute corpse have similar surnames and home districts.\n\nFirst, the \"Taiqing yinye shenqi jing\" (太清金液神氣經, Grand Purity Scripture of the Divine Pneumas of Potable Gold') quotes the mythical Yellow Thearch's instructions for preparing a legalistic brief and incantation in order to falsify the life and death ledger system.\n\"The Sovereign of Humanity (人皇) is familiar with all the registers of the living and the dead (死生之錄). He knows the names of the hundred ghosts and he records the surnames and bynames of the myriad spirits. If you seek a method of extending your years and increasing your longevity, you should prepare a brief (疏) to the Sovereign of Humanity, fully listing your own surname and given name, the year, month, and day of your birth anniversary, and the province, commandery, district, hamlet, village, sector, and earth-god shrine under whose jurisdiction you [are registered as] residing. Then, at the funeral of your grandfather, place this brief in the tomb and incant (祝) as follows: 'Whatever is born must die; allotted life span should accord with the registers. My name was not recorded in the Great Dark Storehouse (大幽藏), yet now I am already set to rest in Haoli. Roaming in the infernal realms, I wail over this in eternal vexation.' Having completed [this incantation], return home. In addition, you must change your surname and byname; these must not be the same as before. Thereupon you will not die in a thousand autumns or a myriad years; for the ledgers have already been fixed, and your name has forever been expunged.\" (tr. Campany 2002: 53-54) \nSecond, the \"Lingbao wufu xu\" (靈寶五符序, Explanations on the Five Numinous Treasure Talismans) promises earthbound transcendence to those who follow a complex procedure involving a poisonous alchemical elixir, a mystical Daoist talisman, death meditation (cf. Buddhist \"Maraṇasati\"), and a \"shijie\" simulated corpse. The text gives instructions for compounding and ingesting a mercury-based elixir called \"shijie yao\" (尸解藥, \"shijie\" drug), and writing out in red characters (as for an imperial edict) the Numinous Treasure Talisman of the Grand Mystery for Living in Hiding (靈寶太玄陰生之符), which includes stylized Chinese calligraphy for \"bingsi\" (病死, died of illness), \"shi\" (尸, corpse), and \"gui\" (鬼, ghost). \nAfter you have ingested the Medicine for the Release from the Mortal Body for the prescribed number of days, write the talisman [of the Highest Mystery of Living Unseen] in red on white silk, and place it on your belly. On a \"wu\" or \"ji\" day [in the sexagenary cycle], lie down, your head pointing towards the west, and visualize yourself being dead [思念自作死人]. After quite some time, take off your clothes, leave them where you have lain, and head straight to enter the mountains. When you are far away, change your name. Never return to your hometown. Right after you have left, people will find that where you had lain there is a corpse. But suddenly, after a while, no one will know where your corpse is to be found. (tr. Pregadio 2018: 390) \nThis Taiqing account shows that \"shijie\" \"release from the mortal body\" requires \"memento mori\"-like meditation practices and ritual aspects. The adept literally \"stages\" his or her death, and the \"audience\" of family members or Daoist companions participate in the \"performance\". They state that the corpse disappeared and was replaced by another object, such as a sword or staff. This \"shijie\" object performs the same function as played by the \"tishen\" (替身, \"replacement bodies\") in early funerary rites. In a ritual sense, the object replaces the deceased, whether the adept's death is real or only \"simulated\" (Pregadio 2018: 390-391). The same scripture also describes how to make male and female versions of a talisman for \"masters of the Dao who wish to perform \"shijie\"\", which when written with a \"spirit-brush\" (神筆) on any wood or metal object will immediately transform it into a substitute cadaver that will subsequently \"die and depart\" (Campany 2002: 54).\n\nComparing the two documentary \"shijie\" procedures, Campany finds common elements. Both involve a ritual performance (an incantation protesting one's untimely death, meditating on oneself as a corpse). Each uses an administrative document to magically activate an object (one's grandfather's corpse, one's discarded clothing) that creates an illusory substitute corpse. Both mandate a complete name change.\n\nThe usual interpretation for a practitioner who performs \"shijie\" to change their name is as a simple trick to elude the spirits enforcing the \"registers of life and death\" for each person's lifespan; the adept changes their name in the belief that the spirit-bureaucrats would be unable to locate them and cause their death. On a deeper level, Pregadio notes the homophonous correspondence between \"gǎimíng\" (改名, changing name) and \"gǎimìng\" (改命, changing destiny), and says the change of name does not merely intend to cheat the spirits, but is symbolically equivalent to the meditational and ritual act of \"taking off one's clothes\", that is, discarding one’s old persona (Pregadio 2018: 391).\n\nThe Daoist scholar Ge Hong's c. 320 \"Baopuzi\" (Master who Embraces Simplicity) reflects contemporary understanding of \"shijie\" during the Jin dynasty (265–420). Two \"Inner Chapters\" mention \"shijie\", and Ge's appended \"Daoist Library\" records the \"Shijie jing\" (尸解經, Classic of \"Shijie\"), which is no longer extant (Ware 1966: 382).\n\nOne passage about the 2nd century BCE \"fangshi\" Li Shaojun (李少君, mentioned in the \"Lunheng\" above) lists \"shijie\" as the lowest category of \"xian\" transcendents after \"tian\" (heavenly) and di\" (earthly).\nThe manuals of the immortals say that masters of the highest category are able to raise themselves high up into the aery void; these are called 'celestial immortals' [\"tianxian\" 天仙]. Those of the second category resort to the famous mountains (and forests) and are called 'terrestrial immortals' [\"dixian\" 地仙]. As for those of the third category they simply slough off the body after death, and they are called 'corpse-free immortals' [\"shijiexian\" 尸解仙]. (2, tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 106, adapted from Ware 1966: 47, \"Corpse-freed Genii\") \nBased on Han dynasty sources, Ge Hong concludes that Li Shaojun must have been a \"shijiexian\" because long after his death from illness, Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87) had the coffin opened, and it was found to contain \"only a gown and hat\". Ge gives three other Eastern Han (25-220 CE) adepts who were \"shijie\" transcendents. Xie Yuanyi (謝元一) took Fei Changfang (費長房) away and left \"a bamboo effigy to be buried in his place\"; Li Yiqi (李意期) and two disciples \"died\" in Pixian, but when their families opened their coffins they found in each \"a bamboo staff with red writing on it\" (tr. Ware 1966: 47-48). \n\nIn another \"Baopuzi\" passage, Ge Hong denounced as a charlatan the healer Li Kuan (李寬), who treated illnesses with holy water and amulets and became extremely popular in south China. Ge's personal acquaintances who had witnessed Li's healing rituals, using \"very shallow\" recipes, unanimously said he was frail, senile, and no different from ordinary old people. After Li Kuan died from a virulent plague, his followers repeatedly claimed that he had metamorphosed into a \"xian\" transcendent through \"release as a corpse and that his was not a true death\". Ge concluded that Li's death proved he was \"not the right type of individual\" to become a \"shijiexian\" (tr. Ware 1966: 159-160).\n\nIn the \"Baopuzi\", Ge Hong considered processes like \"shijie\" to be perfectly natural. \nWhen gold and jade are inserted into the nine orifices, corpses do not decay. When salt and brine are absorbed into flesh and marrow, dried meats do not spoil. So when men ingest substances which are able to benefit their bodies and lengthen their days, why should it be strange that (some of these) should confer life perpetual? (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 284, adapted from Ware 1966: 62) \nDuring Zhou dynasty funerals, amulets of jade, beads or cicadas, were placed in the mouth of the dead (Needham et al. 1976: 3).\n\nBesides the \"Baopuzi\", Ge Hong also compiled the \"Shenxian Zhuan\" (Biographies of Divine Transcendents) that provides more information about \"shijie\" than the earlier \"Liexian Zhuan\" above. Five hagiographies of \"xian\" directly mention \"shijie\" and many others allude to it with finding empty coffins, such as Ling Shouguang (靈壽光).\nLing Shouguang was a native of Fufeng. At the age of over seventy obtained a method for [making] \"efflorescence of vermilion\" pills. These he synthesized and ingested, with the result that his appearance was that of a person in his twenties. By the first year of the [Latter] Han \"jian'an\" period [196 CE] he was already two hundred twenty years old. Later, without having shown any signs of illness, he \"died\" at the home of Hu Gang (胡岡) in Jiangling. Over a hundred days after his funeral and burial, someone saw Ling in Xiaohuang. This person sent a letter to Hu Gang, who, upon receiving the letter, dug up the coffin and looked inside. It was empty except for an old shoe. (tr. Campany 2002: 232) \n\nWang Yuan's (王遠) hagiography has a rare description of how the \"shijie\" process feels. Wang explains to his pupil Cai Jing (蔡經):\n\"By birth, you are destined to transcend the world; you will be chosen as a replacement for an office. But your knowledge of the Way is scant; your pneumas are few and you have much flesh. You cannot ascend [directly] in this condition, but must avail yourself of shijie. It's like passing out through a dog's hole [too narrow to permit a person easy passage], that's all.\" Then Wang declared to Cai the essential teachings, and left him. Soon Cai felt his entire body grow hot as if on fire. He craved cold water to bathe himself in; his entire family brought water and poured it over him, and it was like making steam by pouring water over hot rocks. This went on for three days. Then, once his bones had completely dissolved, he stood up, went into his room, and covered himself with a blanket. Suddenly he had vanished. When his family looked inside the blanket, only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell. (tr. Campany 2002: 260) \nCai Jing's \"shijie\" is not merely escape by means of a simulated corpse that leaves behind the adept's possession (shoe, staff, etc.) but a transformative refinement that dissolves their bones (believed to be the seat of lifespan allotment) and leaves behind only their skin. Thus, Campany suggests translating Cai Jing's case as \"'release from one's corpse', where the 'corpse' is all the dross of one's own former, impure body, refined away to leave one with a newly incorruptible body\" (2002: 266).\n\nThe hagiography of Yin Changsheng (陰長生), who supposedly lived over three hundred years, estimates the frequency of adepts achieving \"shijie\". \"In upper antiquity, there were many transcendents, so many that they cannot all be accounted for. But since the rise of the Han, only forty-five persons have attained transcendence—forty-six counting myself. Twenty of them did so via 'escape by means of a simulated corpse,' the rest all ascended to Heaven in broad daylight.\" (tr. Campany 2002: 275).\n\nCampany summarizes five common features of \"shijie\" stories in the \"Shenxian zhuan\" and other early hagiographies.\nHowever, not every \"shijie\" narrative in the \"Shenxian zhuan\" conforms to these patterns. When Zuo Ci and Guo Pu were condemned to execution, they escaped through \"bingjie\" (兵解, \"martial liberation\") and simultaneously eluded the agents of both the imperial and the spirit world bureaucracies (2002: 59).\n\n\"Shijie\" is frequently mentioned in the 499 \"Zhen'gao\" (Declarations of the Perfected), which is Tao Hongjing's collection of materials from the \"Shangqing revelations\" that were allegedly given to the mystic Yang Xi (330-c. 386) by a group of Daoist Perfected Ones from 364 to 370. \n\nSeveral revelations concern \"shijie\" methods and the destinies of Yang Xi and his aristocratic collaborators, Xu Mi (許謐, 303-376) and his son Xu Hui (許翽, 341-c. 370). Perfected Consort An (安妃) suggests \"jianjie\" (劍解, escape by means of a sword; here written \"jiejian\" 解劍) to her spirit-fiancé Yang Xi, \"My lord, if you can't abide the smoke from windblown flames and wish to embrace Perfected form in a secluded wood, then could you just seek the Way of escape by means of the sword and perform the technique of announcing [your own] end? If you finish yourself off, doing it openly or in secret and leaving your trace [corpse-simulacrum] concealed or in plain view are matters to be separately arranged at the last moment. It's all up to you, discerning lord!\" (tr. Smith 2013: 101). \n\nA \"Zhen'gao\" revelation from Mao Gu (茅固), one of the Three Lords Mao, discloses to Xu Mi that his missing elder brother Xu Mai (許邁, 300-348), had paired with a Perfected partner, retreated into the mountains, and escaped from the world by means of a \"simulated corpse\" (Smith 2013: 18). Another context says Xu Mai studied under his teacher Wang Shilong (王世龍), and \"received the Way of loosening constraints [\"jieshu zhi dao\" 解束之衜], practiced the method of walking backward, consumed jade fluid, and had audience at Brain-Essence [Palace]\". This \"Way of loosening constraints\" may refer to the \"shijie\" variety called \"jiedai\" (解帯, escape leaving one's waistband behind) (Smith 2013: 276). Others revelations tell Xu Hui that he will perform a \"nocturnal escape\", which apparently means staging death under cover of night, without using a simulacrum like a sword or staff, and tell Xu Mi that he is too preoccupied with worldly affairs to escape immediately (Smith 2013: 299).\n\n\"Zhen'gao\" passages provide a general outline of a complicated \"shijie\" process, which goes through several stages, usually over a span of many years. First, the practitioner must become \"suitably detached\" from worldly affairs. Second, one must be in the correct frame of mind that views life and death as opposite banks of the same river—\"both are equal and essential\". Third, after one escapes, the \"hun\" cloud-souls go to Grand Yin, the \"po\" earth-souls enter the earth, and the Four Numina and Five Male Ones preserve the body's seminal essence and five viscera. Fourth, once the cloud-souls arrive at Grand Yin (a place far in the north), they undergo further refinement, in a process like that which takes place in the alchemist's sealed crucible. Finally, all those who are fit for the process inevitably wake up as Perfected. \"Only then can the practitioner truly understand the wondrousness of the spirit immortals' \"dying but not perishing\" and the profundity of the principles governing life and death\". (Smith 2013: 300).\n\nZhao Cui (d. 622 BCE) was a legendary Daoist transcendent who assisted Duke Wen of Jin (r. 636-628), and the \"Zhen'gao\" records that five to six years after he died, \"a man travelling through the mountains one evening spotted this corpse inside a rock chamber. The flesh had rotted, but the bones remained. He also saw that the five viscera in the abdomen were still alive as before. The [bodily] fluids and blood were wrapped in bundles therein; a purple placenta was woven on the outside.\" (tr. Smith 2013: 302-303)\n\nMany \"Zhen'gao\" passages mention alchemical drugs as a means to achieving \"shijie\" \"release from the corpse\". Chinese alchemists were aware that the metallic compounds produced in their furnaces were highly poisonous, but they believed that the practitioner would suffer only an apparent death while in fact passing into the heavens without dying (Bokenkamp 1997: 291; Smith 2013: 284). One context lists historical figures who achieved \"shijie\" by consuming the powerful alchemical Elixir of Langgan Efflorescence, which was compounded from toxic heavy metals.\nThose who feigned construction of a tomb after swallowing Efflorescence of Langgan are Yan Menzi [衍門子], Gao Qiuzi [髙丘子], and Master Hongyai [洪涯先生]. The residents of the three counties (in which their graves are found) all call them vacant tumuli of the dead of highest antiquity. They are unaware, though, that on one occasion Gao Qiuzi entered Mount Liujing through liberation by means of a corpse. He afterwards consumed a powder of Liquefied Gold [金液], then ingested Efflorescence of Langgan at Zhongshan and feigned the appearance of still another death, whereupon he at last entered Xuanzhou [玄州, \"dark region\" netherworld]. (tr. Strickmann 1979: 131, cf. Needham and Lu 1974: 296) \nThese practitioners notably do not ascend into the Shangqing heavens but live among the terrestrial paradises. \n\nThe Shangqing School founder, Wei Huacun, who supposedly performed \"shijie\" herself (Bokenkamp 1997: 251), describes some others who performed it.\nFinding the Way and leaving the world is done either visibly or in secret. Using the body to leave a trace behind is the secret [approach to] the Way. Some have taken two swigs of rose-gem essence and knocked on their coffins, or consumed a speck of it once and had their corpses rot. Sire Deerskin swallowed jade blossoms and the maggots streamed out his door; Youngest Son Qiu gulped the gold fluid and the stench was smelled a hundred \"Ii\" away. The Yellow Thearch, who fired the nine cauldrons [elixir] on Mount Jing, still has a tomb at Qiao Peak; Sima Jizhu, who consumed mica powder to make a covert ascent, still [left his] head and feet in different places. Mo Di gulped rainbow elixir to throw himself into a river; Young Ning consumed stone brains and rushed into a fire. Wu Guang cut leeks to enter Qingling Pool; Bocheng Zigao absorbed pneumas, and his guts rotted three times. People like these are beyond count. Isn't the Way subtle? In finding it, the traces of one's inclinations and aversions are never constant.\" (tr. Smith 2013: 295-298) \nSima Jizhu (司馬季主) was a diviner for Han Emperor Wen (r. 180-157 BCE); \"head and feet in different places\" (\"tóuzúyìchù\" 頭足異凥) is a fixed expression for beheaded persons. The \"Zhen'gao\" translator Thomas E. Smith describes Wei Huacun as employing \"graveyard humor\", such as the name for mica powder, \"yunsan\" (云散, lit. \"disperse like clouds\") with \"san\" (散 also meaning \"scatter; vanish; (TCM) powdered medicine\"), which is a pun for \"vanishing powder\" (2013: 300).\n\nThe \"Shangqing\" classic \"Jianjing\" (劍巠, Sword Scripture) compares several \"shijie\" alchemical preparations and says the \"lingwan\" (靈丸, Numinous Bolus) elixir is the only one that permits the adept to return home without changing his or her name. The \"Zhen'gao\" Appendix to the \"Jianjing\" describes the range of different techniques.\nThose who manage to escape by means of the corpse through the use of other medicines and are not transformed by means of the Numinous Bolus may not, in any case, return to their hometowns, for the Three Offices would detain them. There are those who die and revive. There are those who get beheaded, only to emerge [again] from one side. There are those whose corpses disappear before encoffinment. There are those whose human forms remain but whose bones are not recovered, those whose clothes remain but whose forms disappear, and those whose hair falls out but whose forms are lost. Departing in broad daylight is called a superior escape by corpse, and departing at midnight is called an inferior escape by corpse. (Smith 2013: 304-305) \nThis passage distinguishes two grades of \"shijie\" by the time of day when the adept leaves the world, superior \"bairi\" (白日, daytime; broad daylight) and inferior \"yeban\" (夜半, midnight). The term \"bairi\" is usually translated as \"in broad daylight\" but more precisely means \"midday; noon\", in contrast to \"shijie\" proper at midnight. Hagiographies of Daoist immortals provide many examples of ascension to Heaven occurring exactly at midday, often expressed with the stock phrase \"bairi shengtian\" (白日昇天, \"ascending to Heaven in broad daylight\"). These two ways of deliverance are distinguished by opposite but corresponding \"yinyang\" features: ascent and descent, midday and midnight, light and darkness, sun and moon. On one hand, ascent to Heaven is the way of non-return to the world, a spiritual journey ascending from one empyrean to the next. On the other, descent to Great Darkness is the way of return, one obtains a \"second birth\" and eventually comes back to the world (Pregadio 2004: 122).\n\nThe reason for this inferior status of an adept who performs \"shijie\" is that despite their having attained an advanced spiritual state, it is insufficient for them to \"ascend to heaven in broad daylight\", and they need to undergo a transformational \"refining the bodily form\". As long as the adept continues dwelling in their physical body, they are able to focus upon creating their perfected body (Pregadio 2018: 391).\nLogically, a question about \"shijie\" occurs: \"If \"release from the corpse\" serves to leave one’s ordinary body and to generate a \"perfected body\", why would an adept ever return to their mortal body from which they wanted to be liberated?\" The famed legend of Li Tieguai (\"Iron-Crutch Li\"), one of the Eight Immortals in the Daoist pantheon, illustrates that the function of this \"recovered\" body is to provide a means to cultivate the \"perfected\" body. Once when Li Tieguai was in deep meditation, his spirit left his body and was roaming in the heavens, but his disciples mistakenly thought that he had died and cremated what they believed was his corpse. When his spirit returned, Li realized that since his original body was no longer available, he had to enter the only available corpse, that of a lame beggar who had recently starved to death. Thus, what is to be \"perfected\" through \"shijie\" is not the physical form, Iron-Crutch only needed a body in order to continue his Daoist practices. \"Even in this uncommon case of a forced \"release from the mortal body\", the focus of the practice is the perfected body.\" (Pregadio 2018: 392).\n\nThe \"Zhen'gao\"'s Examination of the Corpse section is widely quoted (Strickmann 1979: 182). It gives wide-ranging criteria for verifying \"shijie\" \"escape by an apparent corpse\", reflecting the wide variety of escape methods and contingent factors (e.g., choosing to escape openly or secretly) that would tend to leave different signs on the corpse.\nWhen a person dies, you must look at the body. If it is like that of a living person, it is in all instances a case of escape by corpse. If you see that the feet are not blue and the skin is not wrinkled, it is also a case of escape by corpse. If the light of the eyes is undimmed and no different from that of a living person, it is also a case of escape by corpse. If all the head hair has fallen out but the body and bones are missing, it is in all instances a case of escape by corpse. If an [apparent] escape by corpse occurs in broad daylight, then even though [the person] is an immortal it is not an instance of escape by corpse. (tr. Smith 2013: 300-301) \nMost of these criteria would allow a deceased master's disciples to announce that he or she had successfully achieved \"shijie\" \"escape by corpse\", except the one \"broad daylight\" criterion for not attaining \"shijie\" that actually indicates the highest form of transcendence, directly rising to heaven. Declaring successful \"shijie\" is easy, \"none of the criteria are negative indicators of a failed quest\". (Smith 2013: 301).\n\nEven though the word \"shijie\" (尸解) was in use during the 1st century CE, before Buddhism had any influence in China, the meaning was probably later influenced by \"jiětuō\" (解脫)—the Chinese Buddhist translation of \"moksha\" (liberation, emancipation, release) (Pas 1998: 58). Cross-borrowings between Buddhism and Daoism were so pervasive that many narratives about Buddhist monks include supposedly distinctive Daoist practices such as \"shijie\" (liberation from the corpse) and \"bigu\" (grain avoidance) (Campany 1996: 329, 2009: 59). For instance, the 648 \"Book of Jin\" records that the Buddhist monk Shan Daokai (單衜開), a contemporary of the Central Asian missionary Fotudeng (c. 232-348 CE), \"achieved a cicada-like metamorphosis by ingesting pills\" (Needham et al. 1976: 112).\n\nThe c. 700 Buddhist-influenced text \"Daojiaoyishu\" (衜敎義樞, Pivotal Meaning of Daoist Teachings) describes \"shijie\" as the second of three types of \"bianhua\" transformations. \nThe first is adepts who \"ascend to Heaven in broad daylight\" (\"bairi shengtian\" 白日昇天), merge with the divine, and roam together with the gods, which means that \"one's entire person ascends to Heaven\".\nThe second [type of transformation] is \"release from the corpse\" (\"shijie\"). Some replace their corpse with a sword or a bamboo staff; all of a sudden, they rise up and go, and abruptly they are no longer there. Some leave behind their skin. Some receive a funeral and are buried, but then if their coffin is opened there is only a staff or a shoe. Some roam to the five sacred peaks, while some can rise to Heaven. In the Southern Palace (Nangong) there is the Court of Flowing Fire (\"liuhuo zhi ting\"); in the Golden Gate (Jinmen) there is the Water of Smelting Refinement (\"yelian zhi shui\"). All those who inwardly ascend to Heaven while they are alive must first go to the Court of Fire (\"huoting\") in order to refine their form and spirit, while those who rise to heaven after their death must first go the Courtly Pond (\"tingchi\") in order to refine their celestial soul(s) (\"hun\") and body frame. All this accords with the results of their practice (\"gongye\"). \nThe third is \"transfer by extinction\" (\"miedu\" 烕度, the Chinese Buddhist name for \"Nirvana\"), \"The mortal form (\"shixing\") does not become ashes, as if the corpse is guarded by the Great One (Taiyi) itself. Sometimes, after years, the corpse reverts to be a human being.\" (tr. Pregadio 2004: 118). The \"shijie\" implements such as a sword or shoe perform a function similar to the \"tishen\" (替身, \"replacement bodies\") used in some Daoist rites to represent the adept's negative and \"unrefined\" aspects, worldly bonds which made it impossible for one to achieve a higher form of liberation in life (Pregadio 2004: 125-126).\n\nThe term \"shijie\" \"corpse deliverance\" has \"baffled scholars because the ideas and practices behind it have remained quite murky\", perhaps owing to intentional secrecy among Daoist initiates (Campany 2002: 52). Academics cannot even decide how to translate the term. \"Should we interpret it as deliverance of a person \"from\" the mortal coil of his corpse, as deliverance of a person's body from death and putrefaction, or as deliverance \"by means of\" a corpse? While arguments in favor of each of these interpretations have been offered, scholars essentially agree that \"corpse deliverance\" implies a freedom gained after either what really \"was\" or what \"appeared to be\" physical death.\" (Cedzich 2001: 2).\nThe oldest explanation of \"shijie\" is the cicada metamorphosis metaphor, which later became a standard Chinese literary trope, both of which first appeared in Wang Chong's 1st-century \"Lunheng\". There are multiple parallels between a \"shijie\" practitioner leaving behind their (sometimes apparent) corpse and transforming into a \"xian\" transcendent and a cicada nymph moulting its exoskeleton, emerging as an adult, and leaving behind an exuvia. \n\nThe \"Shenxian zhuan\" above uses the term \"chántuì\" (蟬蛻), which means both \"cicada slough\" (used in Traditional Chinese medicine) and \"free/extricate oneself\", to describe Cai Jing after his body had melted away for three days, \"only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell\". Zhang Junfang's c. 1029 \"Yunji Qiqian\" (Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel) Daoist encyclopedia describes \"jianjie\" transcendence as \"chánhuà\" (蟬化, \"cicada transformation\"), \"When men use a precious sword for the deliverance of the body, this is the highest example of metamorphic transformations\" (tr. Needham and Wang 1956: 141).\n\nJoseph Needham and Lu Gwei-djen say that Daoist alchemists believed immortality elixirs could generate \"a new physical but immortal self, embodying the whole personality, which could leave the adept's corpse like a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis, and go off to dwell among the other immortals\". Two possible results of \"shijie\" \"liberation from the corpse\" were either an empty coffin if the physical body had fully etherealized, or the changeless perpetuation of an adept's light body, never showing any signs of post-mortem decomposition (1974: 284).\n\nNeedham and Lu also interpret that the remarkably well-preserved body of Xin Zhui or Lady Dai (d. 163 BCE), discovered in 1972 among Mawangdui tombs, showed that early Chinese mortuary specialists, whom they presume were Daoists, had sufficiently advanced chemical knowledge and skill to achieve an almost perpetual conservation, which suggests \"for the first time all that [\"shijie\"] may have implied\". Furthermore, they say this adds another dimension to the Daoist doctrine of physical immortality and suggests that traditional stories about incorruptible corpses were possibly based on fact (1974: 303-304). Lady Dai's body demonstrates that the Daoist conception of \"shijiexian\" \"corpse-free immortals, whose bodies would remain century after century like those of persons still living, was not entirely imaginary (Needham et al. 1976: 21).\n\nMichel Strickman convincingly proposed that the adept's \"corpse\" in \"shijie\" techniques was not always a temporary stand-in but in certain cases could be the cadaver of someone who achieved \"xian\" transcendence by means of ritual suicide through Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning. For a Daoist religious believer, suicide could sometimes be an acceptable way to escape during periods of social or political trouble. For example, Ge Xuan (164-244) resorted to \"shijie\" to flee from the oppression of Emperor Wu of Jin (1979: 132-133).\n\nIn response, Isabelle Robinet contended that \"shijie\" \"liberation from the body\" was not a ritual suicide—an \"interpretation that has grown up without any supporting evidence\"—but instead a procedure of salvation after death. When a practitioner dies before completing spiritual purification, a kind of \"partial death\" takes place, with an afterlife in an intermediate realm while it awaits a more complete purification and final deliverance (1997: 138).\n\nUrsula-Angelika Cedzich concurs with Strickman's ritual suicide hypothesis. In one of the best-documented cases, Tao Hongjing's disciple Zhou Ziliang (周子良, 497-516) received visions from Perfected Ones who guaranteed him transcendence into Shangqing heavens, and gave instructions how to compound a deadly potion of mushrooms and cinnabar, with which he committed suicide (2001: 33-34, 37-39).\n\nAnother interpretation of \"shijie\" centers around similarities with resurrection as the concept of coming back to life after death. \n\nDonald Harper studied documents found in Late Warring States tombs, including an official report that recounts a spectacular resurrection story. A man named Dan (丹, cinnabar), who was employed by a general in the Wei army, committed suicide in 300 BCE because he had murdered a man. After Dan's burial, however, the general filed an official bureaucratic complaint with the netherworld administration claiming that he had not yet been \"fated\" to die, and they subsequently released Dan from the grave and returned him to the world of the living in 297 BCE (1994: 13-14). However, it took several years after his resurrection before Dan could hear or eat food again, and \"his four limbs were useless\" (1994: 22-23). Harper suggests that the concept of \"shijie\" began around the 1st century CE from a synthesis of ancient beliefs about resurrecting the dead and the Daoist notion of \"xian\" transcendence/immortality, \"shijie was a special form of resurrection with elements that distinguished it from an already existing belief in resurrection in popular religion\" (1994: 25).\n\nJulian Pas says that when Daoism adopted the \"shijie\" procedure, properly translated here not as \"liberation from the body\" but as \"liberation through the body\", it changed the focus from relying on official documents to revive a dead person to relying on self-cultivation to metamorphize into a \"xian\" transcendent (1998: 59). In addition, \"shijie\" has some parallels with Christian resurrection of the dead in which the deceased body is reunited with the soul. Describing the resurrection of Jesus, the Bible says his tomb was found empty, except for some grave clothes—which is reminiscent of Daoist \"shijie\" cases when the master's coffin is found empty except for some article of clothing left behind (1998: 60).\n\nIn some cases, a Daoist adept carrying out \"shijie\" \"escape by means of a corpse\" was not attempting miraculous transcendence but was simply absconding from difficult demands, such as when Emperor Wu of Jin indefinitely detained Ge Xuan, he told his disciple, \"I do not have the leisure to prepare the great drug [of immortality]. Now I will perform \"shijie\".\" (tr. Campany 2002: 59).\n\nThe \"Book of the Later Han\" gives several examples. Xu Yang (許楊) was an expert in Chinese numerology, but when the usurper Wang Mang conscripted him into the new government, Xu changed his name and became a famed healer in a distant province, and returned home only after the Han army had executed Wang Mang in 23 CE. For similar reasons, Feng Liang (馮良) supposedly killed his horse, smashed his carriage, tore his clothes to pieces, and disappeared. Everyone believed that wild animals had killed him, and his family buried the remains found at the site—but Feng returned more than ten years later (Cedzich 2011: 40).\n\nNarratives involving this expedient type of \"shijie\" have common themes of name change and identity creation (Cedzich 2011: 27). This represents \"a momentous abstention from the family lineage system that formed the spine of Chinese society\" (Campany 2002: 55-56). The elaborate \"shijie\" process given above in the \"Lingbao wufu xu\" says, \"After the adept has reached a safe place, they begin a new life under a pseudonym, but can never return home (where they might be recognized).\" (tr. Campany 2002: 54). Finally, even the Shangqing patriarch Tao Hongjing himself, after years of unsuccessful alchemical experiments with immortality elixirs for Emperor Wu of Liang (r. 502-549), desperately attempted to flee his imperial patron in 508 by changing his name to Wang Zheng (王整) and pretending to be an ordinary soldier (Cedzich 2011: 40).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "658686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=658686", "title": "Sinistral and dextral", "text": "Sinistral and dextral\n\nSinistral and dextral, in some scientific fields, are the two types of chirality (\"handedness\") or relative direction.\n\nThe terms are derived from the Latin words for \"left\" (\"sinister\") and \"right\" (\"dexter\").\n\nOther disciplines have different terms (such as dextro- and laevo-rotary, in chemistry, or clockwise and anticlockwise in physics) or simply use left and right (as in anatomy).\n\nRelative direction and chirality are distinct concepts. Relative direction is from the point of view of the observer. A completely symmetrical object has a left and a right side, from the observer's point of view, if the top and bottom and direction of observation are defined. Chirality, however, is observer-independent: no matter how one looks at a right-hand screw thread, it remains different from a left-hand screw thread. Therefore, a symmetrical object has sinistral and dextral directions arbitrarily defined by the position of the observer, while an object that has chirality can have sinistral and dextral directions defined by characteristics of the object, no matter the position of the observer.\n\nIn geology the terms sinistral and dextral refer to the horizontal component of movement of blocks on either side of a fault or the sense of movement within a shear zone. These are terms of relative direction, as the movement of the blocks are described relative to each other when viewed from above. \nMovement is sinistral (left-handed) if the block on the other side of the fault moves to the left, or if straddling the fault the left side moves toward the observer.\nMovement is dextral (right-handed) if the block on the other side of the fault moves to the right, or if straddling the fault the right side moves toward the observer.\n\nBecause the coiled shells of gastropods are asymmetrical, they possess a quality called chirality, the \"handedness\" of an asymmetrical structure.\n\nOver 90%\nof gastropod species have dextral (right-handed) shells in their coiling. A small minority of species and genera are almost always sinistral (left-handed). A very few species show an even mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals (for example, \"Amphidromus perversus\").\n\nThe most obvious characteristic of flatfish, other than their flatness, is asymmetry because both eyes are on the same side of the head in the adult fish. In some families of flatfish, the eyes are always on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish), and in others, they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). Primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-sided individuals, and are generally more symmetrical than other families.\n\n"}
{"id": "1364342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1364342", "title": "Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence", "text": "Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence\n\nStrategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS) is the term coined by British biogerontologist Aubrey de Grey for the diverse range of regenerative medical therapies, either planned or currently in development, for the periodical repair of all age-related damage to human tissue with the ultimate purpose of maintaining a state of negligible senescence in the patient, thereby postponing age-associated disease for as long as the therapies are reapplied.\n\nThe term \"negligible senescence\" was first used in the early 1990s by professor Caleb Finch to describe organisms such as lobsters and hydras, which do not show symptoms of aging. The term \"engineered negligible senescence\" first appeared in print in Aubrey de Grey's 1999 book \"The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging\", and was later prefaced with the term \"strategies\" in the article \"Time to Talk SENS: Critiquing the Immutability of Human Aging\" De Grey called SENS a \"goal-directed rather than curiosity-driven\" approach to the science of aging, and \"an effort to expand regenerative medicine into the territory of aging\". To this end, SENS identifies seven categories of aging \"damage\" and a specific regenerative medical proposal for treating each.\n\nWhile many biogerontologists find it \"worthy of discussion\" and SENS conferences feature important research in the field, some contend that the ultimate goals of de Grey's programme are too speculative given the current state of technology, referring to it as \"fantasy rather than science\".\n\nThe ultimate objective of SENS is the eventual elimination of age-related diseases and infirmity by repeatedly reducing the state of senescence in the organism. The SENS project consists in implementing a series of periodic medical interventions designed to repair, prevent or render irrelevant all the types of molecular and cellular damage that cause age-related pathology and degeneration, in order to avoid debilitation and death from age-related causes.\n\nDe Grey defines aging as \"the set of accumulated side effects from metabolism that eventually kills us\", and, more specifically, as follows: \"a collection of cumulative changes to the molecular and cellular structure of an adult organism, which result in essential metabolic processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in pathology and death.\" He adds: \"geriatrics is the attempt to stop damage from causing pathology; traditional gerontology is the attempt to stop metabolism from causing damage; and the SENS (engineering) approach is to eliminate the damage periodically, so keeping its abundance below the level that causes any pathology.\" The SENS approach to biomedical gerontology is thus distinctive because of its emphasis on tissue rejuvenation rather than attempting to slow the aging process.\n\nBy enumerating the various differences between young and old tissue identified by the science of biogerontology, a 'damage' report was drawn, which in turn formed the basis of the SENS strategy. The results fell into seven main categories of 'damage', seven alterations whose reversal would constitute negligible senescence:\n\n\nFor each of these areas SENS offers at least one strategy, with a research and a clinical component. The clinical component is required because in some of the proposed therapies, feasibility has already been proven, but not completely applied and approved for human trials. These strategies do not presuppose that the underlying metabolic mechanisms of aging be fully understood, only that we take into account the form senescence takes as directly observable to science, and described in scientific literature..\n\nThese are changes to the nuclear DNA (nDNA), or to proteins which bind to the nDNA. Certain mutations can lead to cancer.\n\nThis would need to be corrected in order to prevent or cure cancer. SENS focuses on a strategy called \"whole-body interdiction of lengthening telomeres\" (WILT), which would be made possible by periodic regenerative medicine treatments.\n\nMitochondria are components in our cells that are important for energy production. Because of the highly oxidative environment in mitochondria and their lack of the sophisticated repair systems, mitochondrial mutations are believed to be a major cause of progressive cellular degeneration.\n\nThis would be corrected by allotopic expression—copying the DNA for mitochondria completely within the cellular nucleus, where it is better protected. De Grey argues that experimental evidence demonstrates that the operation is feasible, however, a 2003 study showed that some mitochondrial proteins are too hydrophobic to survive the transport from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria.\n\nOur cells are constantly breaking down proteins and other molecules that are no longer useful or which can be harmful. Those molecules which can’t be digested accumulate as junk inside our cells, which is detected in the form of lipofuscin granules. Atherosclerosis, macular degeneration, liver spots on the skin and all kinds of neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease) are associated with this problem.\n\nJunk inside cells might be removed by adding new enzymes to the cell's natural digestion organ, the lysosome. These enzymes would be taken from bacteria, molds and other organisms that are known to completely digest animal bodies.\n\nHarmful junk protein can accumulate outside of our cells. Junk here means useless things accumulated by a body, but which cannot be digested or removed by its processes, such as the amyloid plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and other amyloidoses.\n\nJunk outside cells might be removed by enhanced phagocytosis (the normal process used by the immune system), and small drugs able to break chemical beta-bonds. The large junk in this class can be removed surgically.\n\nSome of the cells in our bodies cannot be replaced, or can be only replaced very slowly—more slowly than they die. This decrease in cell number affects some of the most important tissues of the body. Muscle cells are lost in skeletal muscles and the heart, causing them to become frailer with age. Loss of neurons in the substantia nigra causes Parkinson's disease, while loss of immune cells impairs the immune system.\n\nThis can be partly corrected by therapies involving exercise and growth factors, but stem cell therapy, regenerative medicine and tissue engineering are almost certainly required for any more than just partial replacement of lost cells.\n\nSenescence is a phenomenon where the cells are no longer able to divide, but also do not die and let others divide. They may also do other harmful things, like secreting proteins. Degeneration of joints, immune senescence, accumulation of visceral fat and type 2 diabetes are caused by this. Cells sometimes enter a state of resistance to signals sent, as part of a process called apoptosis, to instruct cells to destroy themselves.\n\nCells in this state could be eliminated by forcing them to apoptose (via suicide genes, vaccines, or recently discovered senolytic agents), and healthy cells would multiply to replace them.\n\nCells are held together by special linking proteins. When too many cross-links form between cells in a tissue, the tissue can lose its elasticity and cause problems including arteriosclerosis, presbyopia and weakened skin texture. These are chemical bonds between structures that are part of the body, but not within a cell. In senescent people many of these become brittle and weak.\n\nSENS proposes to further develop small-molecular drugs and enzymes to break links caused by sugar-bonding, known as advanced glycation endproducts, and other common forms of chemical linking.\n\nWhile some fields mentioned as branches of SENS are broadly supported by the medical research community, e.g., stem cell research (RepleniSENS), anti-Alzheimers research (AmyloSENS) and oncogenomics (OncoSENS), the SENS programme as a whole has been a highly controversial proposal, with many critics arguing that the SENS agenda is fanciful and the highly complicated biomedical phenomena involved in the aging process contain too many unknowns for SENS to be fully implementable in the foreseeable future. Cancer may well deserve special attention as an aging-associated disease (OncoSENS), but the SENS claim that nuclear DNA damage only matters for aging because of cancer has been challenged in the literature as well as by material in the article DNA damage theory of aging.\n\nIn November 2005, 28 biogerontologists published a statement of criticism in \"EMBO Reports\", \"Science fact and the SENS agenda: what can we reasonably expect from ageing research?,\" arguing \"each one of the specific proposals that comprise the SENS agenda is, at our present stage of ignorance, exceptionally optimistic,\" and that some of the specific proposals \"will take decades of hard work [to be medically integrated], if [they] ever prove to be useful.\" The researchers argue that while there is \"a rationale for thinking that we might eventually learn how to postpone human illnesses to an important degree,\" increased basic research, rather than the goal-directed approach of SENS, is presently the scientifically appropriate goal. This article was written in response to a July 2005 \"EMBO Reports\" article previously published by de Grey and a response from de Grey was published in the same November issue. De Grey summarizes these events in \"The biogerontology research community's evolving view of SENS,\" published on the Methuselah Foundation website.\n\nIn 2012, Colin Blakemore criticised Aubrey de Grey, but not SENS specifically, in a debate hosted at the Oxford University Scientific Society.\n\nMore recently, biogerontologist Marios Kyriazis has sharply criticised the clinical applicability of SENS claiming that such therapies, even if developed in the laboratory, would be practically unusable by the general public. De Grey responded to one such criticism.\n\nIn February 2005, \"Technology Review\", which is owned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, published an article by Sherwin Nuland, a Clinical Professor of Surgery at Yale University and the author of \"How We Die\", that drew a skeptical portrait of SENS, at the time de Grey was a computer associate in the Flybase Facility of the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge. The April 2005 issue of \"Technology Review\" contained a reply by Aubrey de Grey and numerous comments from readers.\n\nDuring June 2005, David Gobel, CEO and Co-founder of Methuselah Foundation offered Technology Review $20,000 to fund a prize competition to publicly clarify the viability of the SENS approach. In July 2005, Pontin announced a $20,000 prize, funded 50/50 by Methuselah Foundation and MIT Technology Review, open to any molecular biologist, with a record of publication in biogerontology, who could prove that the alleged benefits of SENS were \"so wrong that it is unworthy of learned debate.\" \"Technology Review\" received five submissions to its Challenge. In March 2006, \"Technology Review\" announced that it had chosen a panel of judges for the Challenge: Rodney Brooks, Anita Goel, Nathan Myhrvold, Vikram Sheel Kumar, and Craig Venter. Three of the five submissions met the terms of the prize competition. They were published by \"Technology Review\" on June 9, 2006. Accompanying the three submissions were rebuttals by de Grey, and counter-responses to de Grey's rebuttals. On July 11, 2006, \"Technology Review\" published the results of the SENS Challenge.\n\nIn the end, no one won the $20,000 prize. The judges felt that no submission met the criterion of the challenge and discredited SENS, although they unanimously agreed that one submission, by Preston Estep and his colleagues, was the most eloquent. Craig Venter succinctly expressed the prevailing opinion: \"Estep et al. ... have not demonstrated that SENS is unworthy of discussion, but the proponents of SENS have not made a compelling case for it.\" Summarizing the judges' deliberations, Pontin wrote that SENS is \"highly speculative\" and that many of its proposals Myhrvold described SENS as belonging to a kind of \"antechamber of science\" where they wait until technology and scientific knowledge advance to the point where it can be tested. In a letter of dissent dated July 11, 2006 in Technology Review, Estep et al. criticized the ruling of the judges.\n\nOf the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.<ref name=\"doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011\"></ref> In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.\n\nDe Grey and other scientists in the general field have argued that the costs of a rapidly growing aging population will increase to the degree that the costs of an accelerated pace of aging research are easy to justify in terms of future costs avoided. Olshansky \"et al.\" 2006 argue, for example, that the total economic cost of Alzheimer's disease in the US alone will increase from $80–100 billion today to more than $1 trillion in 2050. \"Consider what is likely to happen if we don't [invest further in aging research]. Take, for instance, the impact of just one age-related disorder, Alzheimer disease (AD). For no other reason than the inevitable shifting demographics, the number of Americans stricken with AD will rise from 4 million today to as many as 16 million by midcentury. This means that more people in the United States will have AD by 2050 than the entire current population of the Netherlands. Globally, AD prevalence is expected to rise to 45 million by 2050, with three of every four patients with AD living in a developing nation. The US economic toll is currently $80–$100 billion, but by 2050 more than $1 trillion will be spent annually on AD and related dementias. The impact of this single disease will be catastrophic, and this is just one example.\"\n\nThere have been four SENS roundtables and six SENS conferences held. The first SENS roundtable was held in Oakland, California on October, 2000, and the last SENS roundtable was held in Bethesda, Maryland on July, 2004.\n\nOn March 30–31, 2007 a North American SENS symposium was held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada as the \"Edmonton Aging Symposium\". Another SENS-related conference (\"Understanding Aging\") was held at UCLA in Los Angeles, California on June 27–29, 2008\n\nSix SENS conferences have been held at Queens' College, Cambridge in England. All the conferences were organized by de Grey and all featured world-class researchers in the field of biogerontology.\n\n\nAnother meeting was held in August 2014 in Santa Clara, California.\n\nThe SENS Research Foundation is a non-profit organization co-founded by Michael Kope, Aubrey de Grey, Jeff Hall, Sarah Marr and Kevin Perrott, which is based in California, United States. Its activities include SENS-based research programs and public relations work for the acceptance of and interest in related research.\n\nBefore March 2009, the SENS research programme was mainly pursued by the Methuselah Foundation, co-founded by Aubrey de Grey and David Gobel. The Methuselah Foundation is most notable for establishing the Methuselah Mouse Prize, a monetary prize awarded to researchers who extend the lifespan of mice to unprecedented lengths.\n\nFor 2013, The SENS Research Foundation has a research budget of approximately $4 million annually, half of it funded by a personal contribution of $13 million of Aubrey de Grey's own wealth, and the other half coming from external donors, with the largest external donor being Peter Thiel, and another Internet entrepreneur Jason Hope, has recently begun to contribute comparable sums.\n"}

Epstein & Robert Axtell in their book \"Growing Artificial Societies\".\n\nFundaments of Sugarscape models can be traced back to the University of Maryland where economist Thomas Schelling presented his paper titled \"Models of Segregation\". Written in 1969, Schelling and the rest of the social environment modelling fraternity had their options limited by a lack of adequate computing power and an applicable programming mechanism to fully develop the potential of their model.\n\nJohn Conway's agent-based simulation \"Game of Life\" was enhanced and applied to Schelling's original idea by Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell in their book \"Growing Artificial Societies\". To demonstrate their findings on the field of agent-based simulation, a model was created and distributed with their book on CD-ROM. The concept of this model has come to be known as \"the Sugarscape model\". Since then, the name \"Sugarscape\" has been used for agent-based models using rules similar to those defined by Epstein & Axtell.\n\nAll Sugarscape models include the agents (inhabitants), the environment (a two-dimensional grid) and the rules governing the interaction of the agents with each other and the environment.\n\nThe original model presented by J. Epstein & R. Axtell (considered as the first large scale agent model) is based on a 51x51 cell grid, where every cell can contain different amounts of sugar (or spice). In every step agents look around, find the closest cell filled with sugar, move and metabolize. They can leave pollution, die, reproduce, inherit sources, transfer information, trade or borrow sugar, generate immunity or transmit diseases - depending on the specific scenario and variables defined at the set-up of the model.\n\nSugar in simulation could be seen as a metaphor for resources in an artificial world through which the examiner can study the effects of social dynamics such as evolution, marital status and inheritance on populations.\n\nExact simulation of the original rules provided by J. Epstein & R. Axtell in their book can be problematic and it is not always possible to recreate the same results as those presented in \"Growing Artificial Societies\".\n\nThe Sugarscape model has had several implementations, some of which are available as open source software.\n\nAn original implementation was developed in Ascape, Java software suitable for agent-based social simulation. The Sugarscape model remains part of the built-in library of models distributed with Ascape.\n\nNetLogo has been used to build Sugarscape models. Three Sugarscape scenarios are included in the NetLogo Models Library: \"Immediate Growback\", \"Constant Growback\" and \"Wealth Distribution\". Besides these three scenarios lies Iain Weaver's Sugarscape NetLogo model, which is part of the User Community Models Library. \"It builds on Owen Densmore's NetLogo community model to encompass all rules discussed in \"Growing Artificial Societies\" with the exception of the combat rule (although trivial to include, it adds little value to the model).\" The model is equipped with rich documentation including instructions for successful replication of the original Sugarscape rules.\n\nDue to the emergent nature of agent-based models (ABMs), it is critical that the population sizes in the simulations match the population sizes of the dynamic systems being modelled. However, the performance of contemporary agent simulation frameworks has been inadequate to handle such large population sizes and parallel computing frameworks designed to run on computing clusters has been limited by available bandwidth. As computing power increases with Moore's law, the size and complexity of simulation frameworks can be expected to increase. The team of R. M. D’Souza, M. Lysenko and K Rahmani from Michigan Technological University used a Sugarscape model to demonstrate the power of Graphics processing units (GPU) in ABM simulations with over 50 updates per second with agent populations exceeding 2 millions.\n\nAnother implementation can be found written in Mathematica.\n\nGMU's MASON project, available under the Academic Free License, also includes an implementation of Sugarscape.\n\n"}

{"id": "9407088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9407088", "title": "Thrownness", "text": "Thrownness\n\nThrownness () is a concept introduced by German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) to describe humans' individual existences as \"being thrown\" (\"geworfen\") into the world.\n\n\"Geworfen\" denotes the arbitrary or inscrutable nature of \"Dasein\" that connects the past with the present. The past, through Being-toward-death, becomes a part of \"Dasein\". Awareness and acknowledgment of the arbitrariness of \"Dasein\" is characterized as a state of \"thrown-ness\" in the present with all its attendant frustrations, sufferings, and demands that one does not choose, such as social conventions or ties of kinship and duty. The very fact of one's own existence is a manifestation of thrown-ness. The idea of the past as a matrix not chosen, but at the same time not utterly binding or deterministic, results in the notion of \"Geworfenheit\"—a kind of alienation that human beings struggle against, and that leaves a paradoxical opening for freedom:\n\nFor William J. Richardson, \"Geworfenheit\" \"must be understood in a purely ontological sense as wishing to signify the matter-of-fact character of human finitude\". That's why \"thrownness\" is the best English word for \"Geworfenheit\". Richardson: \"[Other] attractive translations such as 'abandon,' 'dereliction,' 'dejection,' etc. [...] are [dangerous because they are] too rich with ontic, anthropological connotations. We retain 'thrown-ness' as closest to the original and, perhaps, least misleading.\"\n\nIn his main work \"The Principle of Hope\" (1954-9), the anti-Heideggerian author Ernst Bloch has correlated the thrownness into the world with a dog's life: hope \"will not tolerate a dog's life which feels itself only passively thrown into What Is, which is not seen through, even wretchedly recognized\". Such a connection had been picked up by The Doors in a verse of their song \"Riders on the Storm\" (1971): \"Into this world we're thrown / Like a dog without a bone\". Speaking with Krieger and Manzarek, the philosopher Thomas Vollmer tells how this verse recalls Heidegger's concept of thrownness: in 1963 at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Jim Morrison heard an influential lesson for him, where were discussed philosophers who had a critical look at the philosophical tradition, including Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger.\nIn 2009, Simon Critchley dedicated his column on \"The Guardian\" to Heidegger's concept of thrownness and explained it using the aforementioned verse of The Doors.\n\nIn their 1986 book \"Understanding Computers and Cognition. A New Foundation for Design\", authors Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores applied Heidegger's concept of thrownness to the field of software design.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52962850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52962850", "title": "Transmasculine reproduction", "text": "Transmasculine reproduction\n\nTransmasculine reproduction is when an individual with a masculine gender identity, who was born with biologically female reproductive organs, conceives and births a child. Transmasculine individuals were assigned female at birth, but identify more on the male side of the gender spectrum than on the female side. These individuals may identify with some stereotypically masculine behaviors and gender performances, but may not necessarily identify with all aspects of masculinity or refer to themselves as “a man”. They are also born with mammary glands and milk ducts, so in most cases it is also possible for them to breastfeed or “chest feed” their children even if they have had their breast surgically removed. Transmasculine reproduction is a matter of sexual and reproductive health, but transmasculine individuals commonly deal with lack of cooperation from health care professionals when attempting to seek medical attention for stereotypically “woman’s health issues”.\n\nTransmasculine individuals have several terms they use to describe the act of feeding their children with their bodies natural lactation. Some commonly used terms include chestfeeding, breastfeeding, nursing, feeding, and mammal feeding. Chestfeeding is a term that can be used by both cisgender and transgender parents to describe feeding their baby, since it is not gender exclusive. The term breastfeeding can cause feelings of gender dysphoria among transgender men. Gender dysphoria is the emotional and psychological distress a person experiences when their gender identity does not aligned with their biological sex, and it can cause extreme anxiety, stress, and depression for those who experience it. Referring to transmasculine people’s chest as breasts can some trigger this dysphoria, which is why gender neutral terms are often preferred. Gender dysphoria can also come to transmasculine individuals through the action of holding their baby to their chest to nurse, since it is a traditionally female action. \n\nAlthough both men and women are born with breasts, the presence of grown breasts on a transgender individual assigned female at birth can lead them to feel extreme discomfort in how their body aligns with their gender identity. It is a common choice for transgender men to have bilateral mastectomies or “chest surgery” due to the gender dysphoria surrounding their breasts. After a transmasculine individual has undergone a bilateral mastectomy their female breasts are no longer present, but they still have some mammary tissue and the ability to lactate. It is not always easy for transgender men to lactate after chest surgery, but with the help of lactation nurses the option is available for those who feel comfortable doing so. Chestfeeding is a personal choice made by some, but not all transmasculine parents and it is just one aspect of transmasculine reproduction.\n\nEven though transmasculine individuals do not identify as women, they still need to screened for the same sexual and reproductive health problems covered in women’s health as long as they have biologically female organs. Most transmasculine individuals are at risk for women’s heath problems like cervical, ovarian, and uterine cancers, unless they have their female organs removed as a part of their transition. Health care providers are not always aware of the necessity for transmasculine people to be tested for women’s health problems. There have been many instances of providers discriminating against trans individuals either by refusing service and treatment or being verbally abusive. Doctors and health care providers should be aware of the needs of patients so they can properly treat them while respecting their gender identity so as to not create further gender dysmorphia. Clinical management of transmasculine patients can be complicated by a lack of knowledge about treatments which may be unfamiliar to physicians and failure to accommodate these patients within healthcare systems leads to deficient health policy. \n"}

{"id": "779111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=779111", "title": "Xenotransplantation", "text": "Xenotransplantation\n\nXenotransplantation (\"xenos-\" from the Greek meaning \"foreign\" or strange), or heterologous transplant is the transplantation of living cells, tissues or organs from one species to another. Such cells, tissues or organs are called xenografts or xenotransplants. It is contrasted with allotransplantation (from other individual of same species), syngeneic transplantation or isotransplantation (grafts transplanted between two genetically identical individuals of the same species) and autotransplantation (from one part of the body to another in the same person).\n\nXenotransplantation of human tumor cells into immunocompromised mice is a research technique frequently used in pre-clinical oncology research.\n\nHuman xenotransplantation offers a potential treatment for end-stage organ failure, a significant health problem in parts of the industrialized world. It also raises many novel medical, legal and ethical issues. A continuing concern is that many animals, such as pigs, have a shorter lifespan than humans, meaning that their tissues age at a quicker rate. Disease transmission (xenozoonosis) and permanent alteration to the genetic code of animals are also causes for concern. Similarly to objections to animal testing, animal rights activists have also objected to xenotransplantation on ethical grounds. A few temporarily successful cases of xenotransplantation are published.\n\nIt is common for patients and physicians to use the term \"allograft\" imprecisely to refer to either allograft (human-to-human) or xenograft (animal-to-human), but it is helpful scientifically (for those searching or reading the scientific literature) to maintain the more precise distinction in usage.\n\nThe first serious attempts at xenotransplantation (then called heterotransplantation) appeared in the scientific literature in 1905, when slices of rabbit kidney were transplanted into a child with renal insufficiency. In the first two decades of the 20th century, several subsequent efforts attempts to use organs from lambs, pigs and primates were published.\n\nScientific interest in xenotransplantation declined when the immunological basis of the organ rejection process was described. The next waves of studies on the topic came with the discovery of immunosuppressive drugs. Even more studies followed Dr. Joseph Murray's first successful renal transplantation in 1954 and scientists, facing the ethical questions of organ donation for the first time, accelerated their effort in looking for alternatives to human organs.\n\nIn 1963, doctors at Tulane University attempted chimpanzee-to-human renal transplantations in six people who were near death; after this and several subsequent unsuccessful attempts to use primates as organ donors and the development of a working cadaver organ procuring program, interest in xenotransplantation for kidney failure dissipated.\n\nAn American infant girl known as \"Baby Fae\" with hypoplastic left heart syndrome was the first infant recipient of a xenotransplantation, when she received a baboon heart in 1983. The procedure was performed by Leonard L. Bailey at Loma Linda University Medical Center in Loma Linda, California. Fae died 21 days later due to a humoral-based graft rejection thought to be caused mainly by an ABO blood type mismatch, considered unavoidable due to the rarity of type O baboons. The graft was meant to be temporary, but unfortunately a suitable allograft replacement could not be found in time. While the procedure itself did not advance the progress on xenotransplantation, it did shed a light on the insufficient amount of organs for infants. The story grew so big that it made such an impact that the crisis of infant organ shortage improved for that time. \n\nXenotransplantation of human tumor cells into immunocompromised mice is a research technique frequently used in oncology research. It is used to predict the sensitivity of the transplanted tumor to various cancer treatments; several companies offer this service, including the Jackson Laboratory.\n\nHuman organs have been transplanted into animals as a powerful research technique for studying human biology without harming human patients. This technique has also been proposed as an alternative source of human organs for future transplantation into human patients. For example, researchers from the Ganogen Research Institute transplanted human fetal kidneys into rats which demonstrated life supporting function and growth.\n\nA worldwide shortage of organs for clinical implantation causes about 20–35% of patients who need replacement organs to die on the waiting list. Certain procedures, some of which are being investigated in early clinical trials, aim to use cells or tissues from other species to treat life-threatening and debilitating illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, liver failure and Parkinson's disease. If vitrification can be perfected, it could allow for long-term storage of xenogenic cells, tissues and organs so that they would be more readily available for transplant.\n\nXenotransplants could save thousands of patients waiting for donated organs. The animal organ, probably from a pig or baboon could be genetically altered with human genes to trick a patient’s immune system into accepting it as a part of its own body. They have re-emerged because of the lack of organs available and the constant battle to keep immune systems from rejecting allotransplants. Xenotransplants are thus potentially a more effective alternative.\n\nXenotransplantation also is and has been a valuable tool used in research laboratories to study developmental biology.\n\nPatient derived tumor xenografts in animals can be used to test treatments.\n\nSince they are the closest relatives to humans, non-human primates were first considered as a potential organ source for xenotransplantation to humans. Chimpanzees were originally considered the best option since their organs are of similar size, and they have good blood type compatibility with humans, which makes them potential candidates for xenotransfusions. However, since chimpanzees are listed as an endangered species, other potential donors were sought. Baboons are more readily available, but impractical as potential donors. Problems include their smaller body size, the infrequency of blood group O (the universal donor), their long gestation period, and their typically small number of offspring. In addition, a major problem with the use of nonhuman primates is the increased risk of disease transmission, since they are so closely related to humans.\n\nPigs (\"Sus scrofa domesticus\") are currently thought to be the best candidates for organ donation. The risk of cross-species disease transmission is decreased because of their increased phylogenetic distance from humans. They are readily available, their organs are anatomically comparable in size, and new infectious agents are less likely since they have been in close contact with humans through domestication for many generations. Current experiments in xenotransplantation most often use pigs as the donor, and baboons as human models.\n\nIn the field of regenerative medicine, pancreatogenesis- or nephrogenesis-disabled pig embryos, unable to form a specific organ, allow experimentation toward the \"in vivo\" generation of functional organs from xenogenic pluripotent stem cells in large animals via compensation for an empty developmental niche (blastocyst complementation). Such experiments provide the basis for potential future application of blastocyst complementation to generate transplantable human organs from the patient's own cells, using livestock animals, to increase quality of life for those with end-stage organ failure.\n\nTo date no xenotransplantation trials have been entirely successful due to the many obstacles arising from the response of the recipient’s immune system. \"Xenozoonoses\" are one of the biggest threats to rejections, as they are xenogenetic infections. The introduction of these microorganisms are a big issue that lead ti the fatal infections and then rejection of the organs. This response, which is generally more extreme than in allotransplantations, ultimately results in rejection of the xenograft, and can in some cases result in the immediate death of the recipient. There are several types of rejection organ xenografts are faced with, these include: \n\nA rapid, violent, and hyperacute response comes as a result of antibodies present in the host organism. These antibodies are known as xenoreactive natural antibodies (XNAs).\n\nThis rapid and violent type of rejection occurs within minutes to hours from the time of the transplant. It is mediated by the binding of XNAs (xenoreactive natural antibodies) to the donor endothelium, causing activation of the human complement system, which results in endothelial damage, inflammation, thrombosis and necrosis of the transplant. XNAs are first produced and begin circulating in the blood in neonates, after colonization of the bowel by bacteria with galactose moieties on their cell walls. Most of these antibodies are the IgM class, but also include IgG, and IgA.\n\nThe epitope XNAs target is an α-linked galactose moiety, Gal-α-1,3Gal (also called the α-Gal epitope), produced by the enzyme α-galactosyl transferase. Most non-primates contain this enzyme thus, this epitope is present on the organ epithelium and is perceived as a foreign antigen by primates, which lack the galactosyl transferase enzyme. In pig to primate xenotransplantation, XNAs recognize porcine glycoproteins of the integrin family.\n\nThe binding of XNAs initiate complement activation through the classical complement pathway. Complement activation causes a cascade of events leading to: destruction of endothelial cells, platelet degranulation, inflammation, coagulation, fibrin deposition, and hemorrhage. The end result is thrombosis and necrosis of the xenograft.\n\nSince hyperacute rejection presents such a barrier to the success of xenografts, several strategies to overcome it are under investigation:\n\n\"Interruption of the complement cascade\" \n\n\"Transgenic organs (Genetically engineered pigs)\" \n\nAlso known as delayed xenoactive rejection, this type of rejection occurs in discordant xenografts within 2 to 3 days, if hyperacute rejection is prevented. The process is much more complex than hyperacute rejection and is currently not completely understood. Acute vascular rejection requires de novo protein synthesis and is driven by interactions between the graft endothelial cells and host antibodies, macrophages, and platelets. The response is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate of mostly macrophages and natural killer cells (with small numbers of T cells), intravascular thrombosis, and fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls.\n\nBinding of the previously mentioned XNAs to the donor endothelium leads to the activation of host macrophages as well as the endothelium itself. The endothelium activation is considered type II since gene induction and protein synthesis are involved. The binding of XNAs ultimately leads to the development of a procoagulant state, the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).\n\nThis response is further perpetuated as normally binding between regulatory proteins and their ligands aid in the control of coagulation and inflammatory responses. However, due to molecular incompatibilities between the molecules of the donor species and recipient (such as porcine major histocompatibility complex molecules and human natural killer cells), this may not occur.\n\nDue to its complexity, the use of immunosuppressive drugs along with a wide array of approaches are necessary to prevent acute vascular rejection, and include: \n\nIf hyperacute and acute vascular rejection are avoided accommodation is possible, which is the survival of the xenograft despite the presence of circulating XNAs. The graft is given a break from humoral rejection when the complement cascade is interrupted, circulating antibodies are removed, or their function is changed, or there is a change in the expression of surface antigens on the graft. This allows the xenograft to up-regulate and express protective genes, which aid in resistance to injury, such as heme oxygenase-1 (an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme).\n\nRejection of the xenograft in hyperactute and acute vascular rejection is due to the response of the humoral immune system, since the response is elicited by the XNAs. Cellular rejection is based on cellular immunity, and is mediated by: \n\nIn direct xenorecognition, antigen presenting cells from the xenograft present peptides to recipient CD4 T cells via xenogeneic MHC class II molecules, resulting in the production of interleukin 2 (IL-2). Indirect xenorecognition involves the presentation of antigens from the xenograft by recipient antigen presenting cells to CD4 T cells. Antigens of phagocytosed graft cells can also be presented by the host’s class I MHC molecules to CD8 T cells.\n\nThe strength of cellular rejection in xenografts remains uncertain, however it is expected to be stronger than in allografts due to differences in peptides among different animals. This leads to more antigens potentially recognized as foreign, thus eliciting a greater indirect xenogenic response.\n\nA proposed strategy to avoid cellular rejection is to induce donor non-responsiveness using hematopoietic chimerism. Donor stem cells are introduced into the bone marrow of the recipient, where they coexist with the recipient’s stem cells. The bone marrow stem cells give rise to cells of all hematopoietic lineages, through the process of hematopoiesis. Lymphoid progenitor cells are created by this process and move to the thymus where negative selection eliminates T cells found to be reactive to self. The existence of donor stem cells in the recipient’s bone marrow causes donor reactive T cells to be considered self and undergo apoptosis.\n\nChronic rejection is slow and progressive, and usually occurs in transplants that survive the initial rejection phases. Scientists are still unclear how chronic rejection exactly works, research in this area is difficult since xenografts rarely survive past the initial acute rejection phases. Nonetheless, it is known that XNAs and the complement system are not primarily involved. Fibrosis in the xenograft occurs as a result of immune reactions, cytokines (which stimulate fibroblasts), or healing (following cellular necrosis in acute rejection). Perhaps the major cause of chronic rejection is arteriosclerosis. Lymphocytes, which were previously activated by antigens in the vessel wall of the graft, activate macrophages to secrete smooth muscle growth factors. This results in a build up of smooth muscle cells on the vessel walls, causing the hardening and narrowing of vessels within the graft. Chronic rejection leads to pathologic changes of the organ, and is why transplants must be replaced after so many years. It is also anticipated that chronic rejection will be more aggressive in xenotransplants as opposed to allotransplants.\n\nSuccessful efforts have been made to create knockout mice without α1,3GT; the resulting reduction in the highly immunogenic αGal epitope has resulted in the reduction of the occurrence of hyperacute rejection, but has not eliminated other barriers to xenotransplantation such as dysregulated coagulation, also known as coagulopathy.\n\nDifferent organ xenotransplants result in different responses in clotting. For example, kidney transplants result in a higher degree of coagulopathy, or impaired clotting, than cardiac transplants, whereas liver xenografts result in severe thrombocytopenia, causing recipient death within a few days due to bleeding. An alternate clotting disorder, thrombosis, may be initiated by preexisting antibodies that affect the protein C anticoagulant system. Due to this effect, porcine donors must be extensively screened before transplantation. Studies have also shown that some porcine transplant cells are able to induce human tissue factor expression, thus stimulating platelet and monocyte aggregation around the xenotransplanted organ, causing severe clotting. Additionally, spontaneous platelet accumulation may be caused by contact with pig von Willebrand factor.\n\nJust as the α1,3G epitope is a major problem in xenotransplantation, so too is dysregulated coagulation a cause of concern. Transgenic pigs that can control for variable coagulant activity based on the specific organ transplanted would make xenotransplantation a more readily available solution for the 70,000 patients per year who do not receive a human donation of the organ or tissue they need.\n\nExtensive research is required to determine whether animal organs can replace the physiological functions of human organs. Many issues include:\n\n\nXenozoonosis, also known as zoonosis or xenosis, is the transmission of infectious agents between species via xenograft. Animal to human infection is normally rare, but has occurred in the past. An example of such is the avian influenza, when an influenza A virus was passed from birds to humans. Xenotransplantation may increase the chance of disease transmission for 3 reasons:\n\nExamples of viruses carried by pigs include porcine herpesvirus, rotavirus, parvovirus, and circovirus. Porcine herpesviruses and rotaviruses can be eliminated from the donor pool by screening, however others (such as parvovirus and circovirus) may contaminate food and footwear then re-infect the herd. Thus, pigs to be used as organ donors must be housed under strict regulations and screened regularly for microbes and pathogens. Unknown viruses, as well as those not harmful in the animal, may also pose risks. Of particular concern are PERVS (porcine endogenous retroviruses), vertically transmitted microbes that embed in swine genomes. The risks with xenosis are twofold, as not only could the individual become infected, but a novel infection could initiate an epidemic in the human population. Because of this risk, the FDA has suggested any recipients of xenotransplants shall be closely monitored for the remainder of their life, and quarantined if they show signs of xenosis.\n\nBaboons and pigs carry myriad transmittable agents that are harmless in their natural host, but extremely toxic and deadly in humans. HIV is an example of a disease believed to have jumped from monkeys to humans. Researchers also do not know if an outbreak of infectious diseases could occur and if they could contain the outbreak even though they have measures for control. Another obstacle facing xenotransplants is that of the body’s rejection of foreign objects by its immune system. These antigens (foreign objects) are often treated with powerful immunosuppressive drugs that could, in turn, make the patient vulnerable to other infections and actually aid the disease. This is the reason the organs would have to be altered to fit the patients' DNA (histocompatibility).\n\nIn 2005, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) declared an eighteen-year moratorium on all animal-to-human transplantation, concluding that the risks of transmission of animal viruses to patients and the wider community had not been resolved.\nThis was repealed in 2009 after an NHMRC review stated \"... the risks, if appropriately regulated, are minimal and acceptable given the potential benefits.\", citing international developments on the management and regulation of xenotransplantation by the World Health Organisation and the European Medicines Agency.\n\nEndogenous retroviruses are remnants of ancient viral infections, found in the genomes of most, if not all, mammalian species. Integrated into the chromosomal DNA, they are vertically transferred through inheritance. Due to the many deletions and mutations they accumulate over time, they usually are not infectious in the host species, however the virus may become infectious in another species. PERVS were originally discovered as retrovirus particles released from cultured porcine kidney cells. Most breeds of swine harbor approximately 50 PERV genomes in their DNA. Although it is likely that most of these are defective, some may be able to produce infectious viruses so every proviral genome must be sequenced to identify which ones pose a threat. In addition, through complementation and genetic recombination, two defective PERV genomes could give rise to an infectious virus. There are three subgroups of infectious PERVs (PERV-A, PERV-B, and PERV-C). Experiments have shown that PERV-A and PERV-B can infect human cells in culture. To date no experimental xenotransplantations have demonstrated PERV transmission, yet this does not mean PERV infections in humans are impossible. Pig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 PERVs in the genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.\n\nXenografts have been a controversial procedure since they were first attempted. Many, including animal rights groups, strongly oppose killing animals to harvest their organs for human use. None of the major religions object to the use of genetically modified pig organs for life-saving transplantation. In general, the use of pig and cow tissue in humans has been met with little resistance, save some religious beliefs and a few philosophical objections. Experimentation without consent doctrines are now followed, which was not the case in the past, which may lead to new religious guidelines to further medical research on pronounced ecumenical guidelines. The \"Common Rule\" is the United States bio-ethics mandate .\n\nAutonomy and informed consent are important when considering the future uses of xenotransplantation. A patient undergoing xenotransplantation should be fully aware of the procedure and should have no outside force influencing their choice. The patient should understand the risks and benefits of such a transplantation. However, it has been suggested that friends and family members should also give consent, because the repercussions of transplantation are high, with the potential of diseases and viruses crossing over to humans from the transplantation. Close contacts are at risk for such infections. Monitoring of close relations may also be required to ensure that xenozoonosis is not occurring. The question then becomes: does the autonomy of the patient become limited based on the willingness or unwillingness of friends and family to give consent, and are the principles of confidentiality broken?\n\nThe safety of public health is a factor to be considered. If there is any risk to the public at all for an outbreak from transplantation there must be procedures in place to protect the public. Not only does the recipient of the transplantation have to understand the risks and benefits, but society must also understand and consent to such an agreement.\n\nThe Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association points out one major ethical issue is the societal response to such a procedure. The assumption is that the recipient of the transplantation will be asked to undergo lifelong monitoring, which would deny the recipient the ability to terminate the monitoring at any time, which is in direct opposition of the Declaration of Helsinki and the US Code of Federal Regulations.\nIn 2007, xenotransplantation was banned under ethical grounds in all countries but Argentina, Russia and New Zealand. Since then, the practice has only been carried out to treatment for diabetes type 1 to serve as a substitute for penicillin injections. \n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also stated that if a transplantation takes place the recipient must undergo monitoring for the rest of that recipient's lifetime and waive their right to withdraw. The reason for requiring lifelong monitoring is due to the risk of acute infections that may occur. The FDA suggests that a passive screening program should be implemented and should extend for the life of the recipient.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8455187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8455187", "title": "Xian (Taoism)", "text": "Xian (Taoism)\n\nXian () is a Chinese word for an enlightened person, translatable in English as:\n\"Xian\" semantically developed from meaning spiritual \"immortality; enlightenment\", to physical \"immortality; longevity\" involving methods such as alchemy, breath meditation, and tai chi, and eventually to legendary and figurative \"immortality\".\n\nThe \"xian\" archetype is described by Victor H. Mair.\n\nThey are immune to heat and cold, untouched by the elements, and can fly, mounting upward with a fluttering motion. They dwell apart from the chaotic world of man, subsist on air and dew, are not anxious like ordinary people, and have the smooth skin and innocent faces of children. The transcendents live an effortless existence that is best described as spontaneous. They recall the ancient Indian ascetics and holy men known as \"ṛṣi\" who possessed similar traits.1994:376 \n\nAccording to the Digital Dictionary of Buddhism, Chinese \"xian\" (仙) can mean Sanskrit \"ṛṣi\" (\"rishi\" \"inspired sage in the Vedas\").\n\nThe most famous Chinese compound of \"xiān\" is \"Bāxiān\" (八仙 \"the Eight Immortals\"). Other common words include \"xiānrén\" (仙人 sennin in Japanese, \"immortal person; transcendent\", see \"Xiānrén Dòng\"), \"xiānrénzhăng\" (仙人掌 \"immortal's palm; cactus\"), \"xiānnǚ\" (仙女 \"immortal woman; female celestial; angel\"), and \"shénxiān\" (神仙 \"gods and immortals; divine immortal\"). Besides humans, \"xiān\" can also refer to supernatural animals. The mythological \"húlijīng\" 狐狸精 (lit. \"fox spirit\") \"fox fairy; vixen; witch; enchantress\" has an alternate name of \"húxiān\" 狐仙 (lit. \"fox immortal\").\n\nThe etymology of \"xiān\" remains uncertain. The circa 200 CE \"Shiming\", a Chinese dictionary that provided word-pun \"etymologies\", defines \"xiān\" (仙) as \"to get old and not die,\" and explains it as someone who \"qiān\" (遷 \"moves into\") the mountains.\"\n\nEdward H. Schafer (1966:204) defined \"xian\" as \"transcendent, sylph (a being who, through alchemical, gymnastic and other disciplines, has achieved a refined and perhaps immortal body, able to fly like a bird beyond the trammels of the base material world into the realms of aether, and nourish himself on air and dew.)\" Schafer noted \"xian\" was cognate to \"xian\" 䙴 \"soar up\", \"qian\" 遷 \"remove\", and \"xianxian\" 僊僊 \"a flapping dance movement\"; and compared Chinese \"yuren\" 羽人 \"feathered man; \"xian\"\" with English peri \"a fairy or supernatural being in Persian mythology\" (Persian pari from \"par\" \"feather; wing\").\n\nTwo linguistic hypotheses for the etymology of \"xian\" involve Arabic and Sino-Tibetan languages. Wu and Davis (1935:224) suggested the source was \"jinn\", or \"jinni\" \"genie\" (from Arabic \"جني\" \"jinnī\"). \"The marvelous powers of the \"Hsien\" are so like those of the \"jinni\" of the Arabian Nights that one wonders whether the Arabic word, \"jinn\", may not be derived from the Chinese \"Hsien\".\" Axel Schuessler's etymological dictionary (2007:527) suggests a Sino-Tibetan connection between \"xiān\" (Old Chinese *\"san\" or *\"sen\") \"'An immortal' ... men and women who attain supernatural abilities; after death they become immortals and deities who can fly through the air\" and Tibetan \"gšen\" < \"g-syen\" \"shaman, one who has supernatural abilities, incl[uding] travel through the air\".\n\nThe word \"xiān\" is written with three characters , , or , which combine the logographic \"radical\" \"rén\" (人 or 亻 \"person; human\") with two \"phonetic\" elements (see Chinese character classification). The oldest recorded \"xiān\" character 僊 has a \"xiān\" (\"rise up; ascend\") phonetic supposedly because immortals could \"ascend into the heavens\". (Compare \"qiān\" 遷 \"move; transfer; change\" combining this phonetic and the motion radical.) The usual modern \"xiān\" character 仙, and its rare variant 仚, have a \"shān\" (山 \"mountain\") phonetic. For a character analysis, Schipper (1993:164) interprets \"'the human being of the mountain,' or alternatively, 'human mountain.' The two explanations are appropriate to these beings: they haunt the holy mountains, while also embodying nature.\"\n\nThe \"Classic of Poetry\" (220/3) contains the oldest occurrence of the character 僊, reduplicated as \"xiānxiān\" (僊僊 \"dance lightly; hop about; jump around\"), and rhymed with \"qiān\" (遷). \"But when they have drunk too much, Their deportment becomes light and frivolous—They leave their seats, and [遷] go elsewhere, They keep [僊僊] dancing and capering.\" (tr. James Legge) Needham and Wang (1956:134) suggest \"xian\" was cognate with \"wu\" 巫 \"shamanic\" dancing. Paper (1995:55) writes, \"the function of the term \"xian\" in a line describing dancing may be to denote the height of the leaps. Since, \"to live for a long time\" has no etymological relation to \"xian\", it may be a later accretion.\"\n\nThe 121 CE \"Shuowen Jiezi\", the first important dictionary of Chinese characters, does not enter 仙 except in the definition for ( \"name of an ancient immortal\"). It defines 僊 as \"live long and move away\" and 仚 as \"appearance of a person on a mountaintop\".\n\nThis section chronologically reviews how Chinese texts describe \"xian\" \"immortals; transcendents\". While the early \"Zhuangzi\", \"Chuci\", and \"Liezi\" texts allegorically used \"xian\" immortals and magic islands to describe spiritual immortality, later ones like the \"Shenxian zhuan\" and \"Baopuzi\" took immortality literally and described esoteric Chinese alchemical techniques for physical longevity. On one the hand, \"neidan\" (內丹 \"internal alchemy\") techniques included \"taixi\" (胎息 \"embryo respiration\") breath control, meditation, visualization, sexual training, and Tao Yin exercises (which later evolved into Qigong and T'ai chi ch'uan). On the other hand, \"waidan\" (外丹 \"external alchemy\") techniques for immortality included alchemical recipes, magic plants, rare minerals, herbal medicines, drugs, and dietetic techniques like inedia.\n\nThe earliest representations of Chinese immortals, dating from the Han Dynasty, portray them flying with feathery wings (the word \"yuren\" 羽人 \"feathered person\" later meant \"Daoist\") or riding dragons. In Chinese art, \"xian\" are often pictured with symbols of immortality including the dragon, crane, fox, white deer, pine tree, peach, and mushroom. \nBesides the following major Chinese texts, many others use both graphic variants of \"xian\". \"Xian\" (仙) occurs in the \"Chunqiu Fanlu\", \"Fengsu Tongyi\", \"Qian fu lun\", \"Fayan\", and \"Shenjian\"; \"xian\" (僊) occurs in the \"Caizhong langji\", \"Fengsu Tongyi\", \"Guanzi\", and \"Shenjian\".\n\nTwo circa 3rd century BCE \"Outer Chapters\" of the \"Zhuangzi\" (莊子 \"[Book of] Master Zhuang\") use the archaic character \"xian\" 僊. Chapter 11 has a parable about \"Cloud Chief\" (雲 將)  and \"Big Concealment\" (鴻濛) that uses the \"Shijing\" compound \"xianxian\" (\"dance; jump\"):\nBig Concealment said, \"If you confuse the constant strands of Heaven and violate the true form of things, then Dark Heaven will reach no fulfillment. Instead, the beasts will scatter from their herds, the birds will cry all night, disaster will come to the grass and trees, misfortune will reach even to the insects. Ah, this is the fault of men who 'govern'!\"<br>\"Then what should I do?\" said Cloud Chief.<br>\"Ah,\" said Big Concealment, \"you are too far gone! [僊僊] Up, up, stir yourself and be off!\"<br>Cloud Chief said, \"Heavenly Master, it has been hard indeed for me to meet with you—I beg one word of instruction!\"<br>\"Well, then—mind‑nourishment!\" said Big Concealment. \"You have only to rest in inaction and things will transform themselves. Smash your form and body, spit out hearing and eyesight, forget you are a thing among other things, and you may join in great unity with the deep and boundless. Undo the mind, slough off spirit, be blank and soulless, and the ten thousand things one by one will return to the root—return to the root and not know why. Dark and undifferentiated chaos—to the end of life none will depart from it. But if you try to know it, you have already departed from it. Do not ask what its name is, do not try to observe its form. Things will live naturally end of themselves.\"<br>Cloud Chief said, \"The Heavenly Master has favored me with this Virtue, instructed me in this Silence. All my life I have been looking for it, and now at last I have it!\" He bowed his head twice, stood up, took his leave, and went away. (11, tr. Burton Watson 1968:122-3)\n\nChapter 12 uses \"xian\" when mythical Emperor Yao describes a \"shengren\" (聖 人 \"sagely person\").\nThe true sage is a quail at rest, a little fledgling at its meal, a bird in flight who leaves no trail behind. When the world has the Way, he joins in the chorus with all other things. When the world is without the Way, he nurses his Virtue and retires in leisure. And after a thousand years, should he weary of the world, he will leave it and [上] ascend to [僊] the immortals, riding on those white clouds all the way up to the village of God. (12, tr. Watson 1968:130)\n\nWithout using the word \"xian\", several \"Zhuangzi\" passages employ \"xian\" imagery, like flying in the clouds, to describe individuals with superhuman powers. For example, Chapter 1, within the circa 3rd century BCE \"Inner Chapters\", has two portrayals. First is this description of Liezi (below).\nLieh Tzu could ride the wind and go soaring around with cool and breezy skill, but after fifteen days he came back to earth. As far as the search for good fortune went, he didn't fret and worry. He escaped the trouble of walking, but he still had to depend on something to get around. If he had only mounted on the truth of Heaven and Earth, ridden the changes of the six breaths, and thus wandered through the boundless, then what would he have had to depend on? Therefore, I say, the Perfect Man has no self; the Holy Man has no merit; the Sage has no fame. (1, tr. Watson 1968:32) \n\nSecond is this description of a \"shenren\" (神人 \"divine person\").\nHe said that there is a Holy Man living on faraway [姑射] Ku-she Mountain, with skin like ice or snow, and gentle and shy like a young girl. He doesn't eat the five grains, but sucks the wind, drinks the dew, climbs up on the clouds and mist, rides a flying dragon, and wanders beyond the Four Seas. By concentrating his spirit, he can protect creatures from sickness and plague and make the harvest plentiful. (1, tr. Watson 1968:33) \n\nThe authors of the \"Zhuangzi\" had a lyrical view of life and death, seeing them as complimentary aspects of natural changes. This is antithetical to the physical immortality (\"changshengbulao\" 長生不老 \"live forever and never age\") sought by later Daoist alchemists. Consider this famous passage about accepting death.\nChuang Tzu's wife died. When Hui Tzu went to convey his condolences, he found Chuang Tzu sitting with his legs sprawled out, pounding on a tub and singing. \"You lived with her, she brought up your children and grew old,\" said Hui Tzu. \"It should be enough simply not to weep at her death. But pounding on a tub and singing—this is going too far, isn't it?\"\n\nChuang Tzu said, \"You're wrong. When she first died, do you think I didn't grieve like anyone else? But I looked back to her beginning and the time before she was born. Not only the time before she was born, but the time before she had a body. Not only the time before she had a body, but the time before she had a spirit. In the midst of the jumble of wonder and mystery a change took place and she had a spirit. Another change and she had a body. Another change and she was born. Now there's been another change and she's dead. It's just like the progression of the four seasons, spring, summer, fall, winter.\"<br>\"Now she's going to lie down peacefully in a vast room. If I were to follow after her bawling and sobbing, it would show that I don't understand anything about fate. So I stopped. (18, tr. Watson 1968:191–2) \n\nAlan Fox explains this anecdote about Zhuangzi's wife.\nMany conclusions can be reached on the basis of this story, but it seems that death is regarded as a natural part of the ebb and flow of transformations which constitute the movement of Dao. To grieve over death, or to fear one's own death, for that matter, is to arbitrarily evaluate what is inevitable. Of course, this reading is somewhat ironic given the fact that much of the subsequent Daoist tradition comes to seek longevity and immortality, and bases some of their basic models on the \"Zhuangzi\". (1995:100) \n\nThe 3rd-2nd century BCE \"Chuci\" (楚辭 \"Lyrics of Chu\") anthology of poems uses \"xian\" 仙 once and \"xian\" 僊 twice, reflecting the disparate origins of the text. These three contexts mention the legendary Daoist \"xian\" immortals Chi Song (赤松 \"Red Pine\", see Kohn 1993:142–4) and Wang Qiao (王僑, or Zi Qiao 子僑). In later Daoist hagiography, Chi Song was Lord of Rain under Shennong, the legendary inventor of agriculture; and Wang Qiao was a son of King Ling of Zhou (r. 571–545 BCE), who flew away on a giant white bird, became an immortal and was never again seen.\n\nThe \"Yuan You\" (遠遊 \"Far-off Journey\") poem describes a spiritual journey into the realms of gods and immortals, frequently referring to Daoist myths and techniques.\nMy spirit darted forth and did not return to me,<br>And my body, left tenantless, grew withered and lifeless.<br>Then I looked into myself to strengthen my resolution,<br>And sought to learn from where the primal spirit issues.<br>In emptiness and silence I found serenity;<br>In tranquil inaction I gained true satisfaction.<br>I heard how once Red Pine had washed the world's dust off:<br>I would model myself on the pattern he had left me.<br>I honoured the wondrous powers of the [真人] Pure Ones,<br>And those of past ages who had become [仙] Immortals.<br>They departed in the flux of change and vanished from men's sight,<br>Leaving a famous name that endures after them. (tr. Hawkes 1985:194) \n\nThe \"Xi shi\" (惜誓 \"Sorrow for Troth Betrayed\") resembles the \"Yuan You\", and both reflect Daoist ideas from the Han period. \"Though unoriginal in theme,\" says Hawkes (1985:239), \"its description of air travel, written in a pre-aeroplane age, is exhilarating and rather impressive.\"\nWe gazed down of the Middle Land [China] with its myriad people<br>As we rested on the whirlwind, drifting about at random.<br>In this way we came at last to the moor of Shao-yuan:<br>There, with the other blessed ones, were Red Pine and Wang Qiao.<br>The two Masters held zithers tuned in perfect concord:<br>I sang the Qing Shang air to their playing.<br>In tranquil calm and quiet enjoyment,<br>Gently I floated, inhaling all the essences.<br>But then I thought that this immortal life of [僊] the blessed,<br>Was not worth the sacrifice of my home-returning. (tr. Hawkes 1985:240) \n\nThe \"Ai shi ming\" (哀時命 \"Alas That My Lot Was Not Cast\") describes a celestial journey similar to the previous two.\nFar and forlorn, with no hope of return:<br>Sadly I gaze in the distance, over the empty plain.<br>Below, I fish in the valley streamlet;<br>Above, I seek out [僊] holy hermits.<br>I enter into friendship with Red Pine;<br>I join Wang Qiao as his companion.\nWe send the Xiao Yang in front to guide us;<br>The White Tiger runs back and forth in attendance.<br>Floating on the cloud and mist, we enter the dim height of heaven;<br>Riding on the white deer we sport and take our pleasure. tr. Hawkes 1985:266) \n\nThe \"Li Sao\" (離騷 \"On Encountering Trouble\"), the most famous \"Chuci\" poem, is usually interpreted as describing ecstatic flights and trance techniques of Chinese shamans. The above three poems are variations describing Daoist \"xian\".\n\nSome other \"Chuci\" poems refer to immortals with synonyms of \"xian\". For instance, \"Shou zhi\" (守志 \"Maintaining Resolution), uses \"zhenren\" (真人 \"true person\", tr. \"Pure Ones\" above in \"Yuan You\"), which Wang Yi's commentary glosses as \"zhen xianren\" (真仙人 \"true immortal person\").\nI visited Fu Yue, bestriding a dragon,<br>Joined in marriage with the Weaving Maiden,<br>Lifted up Heaven's Net to capture evil,<br>Drew the Bow of Heaven to shoot at wickedness,<br>Followed the [真人] Immortals fluttering through the sky,<br>Ate of the Primal Essence to prolong my life. (tr. Hawkes 1985:318) \n\nThe \"Liezi\" (列子 \"[Book of] Master Lie\"), which Louis Komjathy (2004:36) says \"was probably compiled in the 3rd century CE (while containing earlier textual layers)\", uses \"xian\" four times, always in the compound \"xiansheng\" (仙聖 \"immortal sage\").\n\nNearly half of Chapter 2 (\"The Yellow Emperor\") comes from the \"Zhuangzi\", including this recounting of the above fable about Mount Gushe (姑射, or Guye, or Miao Gushe 藐姑射).\nThe Ku-ye mountains stand on a chain of islands where the Yellow River enters the sea. Upon the mountains there lives a Divine Man, who inhales the wind and drinks the dew, and does not eat the five grains. His mind is like a bottomless spring, his body is like a virgin's. He knows neither intimacy nor love, yet [仙聖] immortals and sages serve him as ministers. He inspires no awe, he is never angry, yet the eager and diligent act as his messengers. He is without kindness and bounty, but others have enough by themselves; he does not store and save, but he himself never lacks. The Yin and Yang are always in tune, the sun and moon always shine, the four seasons are always regular, wind and rain are always temperate, breeding is always timely, the harvest is always rich, and there are no plagues to ravage the land, no early deaths to afflict men, animals have no diseases, and ghosts have no uncanny echoes. (tr. Graham 1960:35) \n\nChapter 5 uses \"xiansheng\" three times in a conversation set between legendary rulers Tang (湯) of the Shang Dynasty and Ji (革) of the Xia Dynasty.\nT'ang asked again: 'Are there large things and small, long and short, similar and different?'<br>—'To the East of the Gulf of Chih-li, who knows how many thousands and millions of miles, there is a deep ravine, a valley truly without bottom; and its bottomless underneath is named \"The Entry to the Void\". The waters of the eight corners and the nine regions, the stream of the Milky Way, all pour into it, but it neither shrinks nor grows. Within it there are five mountains, called Tai-yü, Yüan-chiao, Fang-hu, Ying-chou and P'eng-Iai. These mountains are thirty thousand miles high, and as many miles round; the tablelands on their summits extend for nine thousand miles. It is seventy thousand miles from one mountain to the next, but they are considered close neighbours. The towers and terraces upon them are all gold and jade, the beasts and birds are all unsullied white; trees of pearl and garnet always grow densely, flowering and bearing fruit which is always luscious, and those who eat of it never grow old and die. The men who dwell there are all of the race of [仙聖] immortal sages, who fly, too many to be counted, to and from one mountain to another in a day and a night. Yet the bases of the five mountains used to rest on nothing; they were always rising and falling, going and returning, with the ebb and flow of the tide, and never for a moment stood firm. The [仙聖] immortals found this troublesome, and complained about it to God. God was afraid that they would drift to the far West and he would lose the home of his sages. So he commanded Yü-ch'iang to make fifteen [鼇] giant turtles carry the five mountains on their lifted heads, taking turns in three watches, each sixty thousand years long; and for the first time the mountains stood firm and did not move.<br>'But there was a giant from the kingdom of the Dragon Earl, who came to the place of the five mountains in no more than a few strides. In one throw he hooked six of the turtles in a bunch, hurried back to his country carrying them together on his back, and scorched their bones to tell fortunes by the cracks. Thereupon two of the mountains, Tai-yü and Yüan-chiao, drifted to the far North and sank in the great sea; the [仙聖] immortals who were carried away numbered many millions. God was very angry, and reduced by degrees the size of the Dragon Earl's kingdom and the height of his subjects. At the time of Fu-hsi and Shen-nung, the people of this country were still several hundred feet high.' (tr. Graham 1960:97–8) \n\nPenglai Mountain became the most famous of these five mythical peaks where the elixir of life supposedly grew, and is known as Horai in Japanese legends. The first emperor Qin Shi Huang sent his court alchemist Xu Fu on expeditions to find these plants of immortality, but he never returned (although by some accounts, he discovered Japan).\n\nHolmes Welch (1957:88–97) analyzed the beginnings of Daoism, sometime around the 4th-3rd centuries BCE, from four separate streams: philosophical Daoism (Laozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi), a \"hygiene school\" that cultivated longevity through breathing exercises and yoga, Chinese alchemy and Five Elements philosophy, and those who sought Penglai and elixirs of \"immortality\". This is what he concludes about \"xian\".\nIt is my own opinion, therefore, that though the word \"hsien\", or Immortal, is used by Chuang Tzu and Lieh Tzu, and though they attributed to their idealized individual the magic powers that were attributed to the \"hsien\" in later times, nonetheless the \"hsien\" ideal was something they did not believe in—either that it was possible or that it was good. The magic powers are allegories and hyperboles for the \"natural\" powers that come from identification with Tao. Spiritualized Man, P'eng-lai, and the rest are features of a \"genre\" which is meant to entertain, disturb, and exalt us, not to be taken as literal hagiography. Then and later, the philosophical Taoists were distinguished from all other schools of Taoism by their rejection of the pursuit of immortality. As we shall see, their books came to be adopted as scriptural authority by those who did practice magic and seek to become immortal. But it was their misunderstanding of philosophical Taoism that was the reason they adopted it. (Welch 1957:95) \n\nThe \"Shenxian zhuan\" (神仙傳 Biographies of Spirit Immortals\") is a hagiography of \"xian\". Although it was traditionally attributed to Ge Hong (283–343 CE), Komjathy (2004:43) says, \"The received versions of the text contain some 100-odd hagiographies, most of which date from 6th-8th centuries at the earliest.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Shenxian zhuan\", there are four schools of immortality:\n\nQì (气—“energy”): Breath control and meditation. Those who belong to this school can\n\n\"...blow on water and it will flow against its own current for several paces; blow on fire, and it will be extinguished; blow at tigers or wolves, and they will crouch down and not be able to move; blow at serpents, and they will coil up and be unable to flee. If someone is wounded by a weapon, blow on the wound, and the bleeding will stop. If you hear of someone who has suffered a poisonous insect bite, even if you are not in his presence, you can, from a distance, blow and say in incantation over your own hand (males on the left hand, females on the right), and the person will at once be healed even if more than a hundred li away. And if you yourself are struck by a sudden illness, you have merely to swallow pneumas in three series of nine, and you will immediately recover.<br>But the most essential thing [among such arts] is fetal breathing. Those who obtain [the technique of] fetal breathing become able to breathe without using their nose or mouth, as if in the womb, and this is the culmination of the way [of pneumatic cultivation].\" (Campany 2002:21) \n\nFàn (饭—“Diet”): Ingestion of herbal compounds and abstention from the \"Sān Shī Fàn\" (三尸饭—“Three-Corpses food”)—Meats (raw fish, pork, dog, leeks, and scallions) and grains. The \"Shenxian zhuan\" uses this story to illustrate the importance of \"bigu\" \"grain avoidance\":\n\"During the reign of Emperor Cheng of the Han, hunters in the Zhongnan Mountains saw a person who wore no clothes, his body covered with black hair. Upon seeing this person, the hunters wanted to pursue and capture him, but the person leapt over gullies and valleys as if in flight, and so could not be overtaken. [But after being surrounded and captured, it was discovered this person was a 200 plus year old woman, who had once been a concubine of Qin Emperor Ziying. When he had surrendered to the 'invaders of the east', she fled into the mountains where she learned to subside on 'the resin and nuts of pines' from an old man. Afterwards, this diet 'enabled [her] to feel neither hunger nor thirst; in winter [she] was not cold, in summer [she] was not hot.']<br>The hunters took the woman back in. They offered her grain to eat. When she first smelled the stink of grain, she vomited, and only after several days could she tolerate it. After little more than two years of this [diet], her body hair fell out; she turned old and died. Had she not been caught by men, she would have become a transcendent.\" (Campany 2002:22–23) \n\nFángzhōng Zhī Shù (房中之术—“Arts of the Bedchamber”): Sexual yoga. (Campany 2002:30–31) According to a discourse between the Yellow Emperor and the immortaless \"Sùnǚ\" (素女—“Plain Girl”), one of the three daughters of Hsi Wang Mu,\n\nThe \"White Tigress (Zhuang Li Quan Pure Angelic Metal Ajna Empress \"Toppest\") Manual\", a treatise on female sexual yoga, states,\n\nDān (丹—\"Alchemy\", literally \"Cinnabar\"): Elixir of Immortality.(Campany 2002:31)\n\nThe 4th century CE \"Baopuzi\" (抱朴子 \"[Book of] Master Embracing Simplicity\"), which was written by Ge Hong, gives some highly detailed descriptions of \"xian\".\n\nThe text lists three classes of immortals:\n\n\nThese titles were usually given to humans who had either not proven themselves worthy of or were not fated to become immortals. One such famous agent was Fei Changfang, who was eventually murdered by evil spirits because he lost his book of magic talismans. However, some immortals are written to have used this method in order to escape execution. (Campany 2002:52–60)\n\nGe Hong wrote in his book \"The Master Who Embraces Simplicity\",\nThe [immortals] Dark Girl and Plain Girl compared sexual activity as the intermingling of fire [yang/male] and water [yin/female], claiming that water and fire can kill people but can also regenerate their life, depending on whether or not they know the correct methods of sexual activity according to their nature. These arts are based on the theory that the more females a man copulates with, the greater benefit he will derive from the act. Men who are ignorant of this art, copulating with only one or two females during their life, will only suffice to bring about their untimely and early death. (Hsi 2001:48) \n\nThe \"Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji\" (鐘呂傳道集/钟吕传道集 \"Anthology of the Transmission of the Dao from Zhong[li Quan] to Lü [Dongbin]\") is associated with Zhongli Quan (2nd century CE?) and Lü Dongbin (9th century CE), two of the legendary Eight Immortals. It is part of the so-called “Zhong-Lü” (鍾呂) textual tradition of internal alchemy (\"neidan\"). Komjathy (2004:57) describes it as, \"Probably dating from the late Tang (618–906), the text is in question-and-answer format, containing a dialogue between Lü and his teacher Zhongli on aspects of alchemical terminology and methods.\"\n\nThe \"Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji\" lists five classes of immortals:\n\n\nThe \"Śūraṅgama Sūtra\", in an approach to Taoist teachings, discusses the characteristics of ten types of \"xian\" who exist between the world of devas (\"gods\") and that of human beings. This position, in Buddhist literature, is usually occupied by asuras (\"Titans\", \"antigods\"). These \"xian\" are not considered true cultivators of \"samadhi\" (\"unification of mind\"), as their methods differ from the practice of \"dhyāna\" (\"meditation\").\n\n\n\n\n"}
