Abraham-Joseph grew up around criminality and eventually dropped out of school, beginning to rap in 2013 after the death of a friend. He gained attention in the Atlanta underground for the 2015 mixtape \"The Slaughter Tape\" before attaining nationwide attention following the Metro Boomin collaborative album \"Savage Mode\" (2016), its lead single \"X\", and his collaboration with Drake, \"Sneakin'\".\n\nAbraham-Joseph released his debut studio album, \"Issa Album\", in 2017 which debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 and gave Abraham-Joseph his first top twenty song, \"Bank Account.\" He achieved his first number one single at the end of 2017 with his feature on Post Malone's \"Rockstar.\" In 2017, he also released the Offset and Metro Boomin collaboration \"Without Warning\".\n\nShayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph was born on October 22, 1992, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was raised by his mother Heather, who is of Dominica descent, and his four brothers and six sisters, though one is deceased due to a shooting after a drug deal.\n\nIn the seventh grade, Abraham-Joseph was banned permanently from every school in the DeKalb County School District due to gun possession. This led him to begin attending schools around the Atlanta metropolitan area before being sent to a youth detention center. After being released from the youth detention center, he completed eighth grade through an alternative program before finishing a semester of high school, dropping out in his freshman year following multiple exclusions which Abraham-Joseph said he was \"exhausted\" by.\n\nAfter dropping out, Abraham-Joseph joined a gang affiliated with the Bloods and became a full-time drug dealer, mainly selling cannabis. He also took parts in other criminal activities including robbery and grand theft auto regularly, though only being arrested once after contraband was found in a car he was driving. In 2011, when Abraham-Joseph was 19, he lost his \"right hand\" man, Larry in a shootout. In 2013, on his 21st birthday, Abraham-Joseph was shot six times and his brother Johnny \"Tay-Man\" was killed during an attempted robbery.\n\nFollowing the death of his friend in a shootout on his 21st birthday, Abraham-Joseph began rapping, naming himself after the event though Savage came from Instagram predictions. His music career was originally subsidized by the uncle of his deceased friend, giving him money for studio time in 2013. On November 12, 2014, 21 Savage's debut single, \"Picky\", produced by DJ Plugg, was released. It was later included on his debut mixtape, \"The Slaughter Tape\", which was released on May 25, 2015. The release made him what Interview called an \"underground hero in Atlanta.\"\n\nOn July 2, 2015, 21 released a collaborative EP, \"Free Guwop\", with Sonny Digital. It is a tribute EP to fellow rapper and influence Gucci Mane. On December 1, 2015, Abraham-Joseph released his second mixtape, \"Slaughter King\".\n\nIn June 2016, Abraham-Joseph was named as one of the \"Freshman Class\" of 2016 by \"XXL\". On July 15, 2016, Abraham-Joseph released his joint EP Savage Mode with Atlanta-based record producer Metro Boomin. The EP gained international success and peaked at number 23 on the \"Billboard\" 200, which became their highest charting EP to date. He was on the cover of \"Fader\". His single \"X\" featuring Future on the EP was confirmed by Billboard as going platinum in the US, being 21's 1st platinum record. On January 18, 2017, Abraham-Joseph announced that he had signed to Epic Records.\n\nIn 2017, his debut studio album, \"Issa Album\", reached at number two on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. Its lead single, \"Bank Account\", charted in the top 20 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Later that year, he was featured on Post Malone's single \"Rockstar\", which peaked at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and broke several records.\n\nIn April 2018, Abraham-Joseph had a guest appearance on Young Thug's extended play \"Hear No Evil\" along with fellow rappers Nicki Minaj and Lil Uzi Vert. Later that month he also appeared on the single \"Outstanding\" by SahBabii. In March 21 he was featured on the single \"Rover 2.0\", which is part of BlocBoy JB's Simi mixtape. In the following month, he was featured on Ty Dolla Sign's \"Clout\", which is part of the upcoming deluxe edition of last years's \"Beach House 3\".\n\nOn October 31, 2018, Halloween, Abraham-Joseph posted on his Instagram a picture of a man in silhouette jumping in the air in the direction away from a large blaze. In the bottom right corner of the picture there is a \"Parental Advisory\" notice, as there oftentimes is on the cover of rap releases. Abraham-Joseph also tagged Metro Boomin in the post. For these reasons, some speculated it to be a sequel to 2017's \"Without Warning\" record. However, it turned out to be the cover for Metro’s debut solo album, \"Not All Heroes Wear Capes\".\n\nCalled \"one of the last street niggas left making music\" by frequent collaborator Metro Boomin, Abraham-Joseph's music is heavily autobiographic with emphasis on violent and criminal aspects of his past including murder and drug dealing.\n\nIn 2018, 21 Savage reportedly started a movement called \"Guns Down, Paintballs Up\" which was intended to reduce gun violence. The head of the Detroit Police Department, James Craig, described the movement as \"well-intentioned, however, misguided\". The movement has been linked to several cases of property crime and homicide. 21 Savage has not commented on the matter, although he paid for the funeral of a 3-year old who was killed in a related incident.\n\nControversy arose after Abraham-Joseph pulled out a firearm during a pool party on June 11, 2018. Abraham-Joseph was given the firearm by a friend after seeing an opposing crew member also pull out a pistol.\n\nAbraham-Joseph practices the African religion Ifá. In summer 2017, Savage started dating model Amber Rose. As of March 2018, the couple has separated.\n\nHe also has three children.\n\n21 Savage is currently working on his first movie, \"Issa Movie\".\n\n21 Savage also worked on a YouTube miniseries named \"Year 2100\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

The following year, he released his debut solo EP, titled \"Rarities\", in which three of its four tracks featured his rap partner and best friend Pez.\n\nIn 2005, Pez and 360 released a song called \"Nutcase\", which 360 described as a \"fuck around track [that was] written and recorded in one day. Trying to make you laugh, or cringe\". 360 was featured on Sydney producers Weapon X and Ken Hell's 2006 mixtape \"Scar-Non III: Kick To The Head\" with the song \"In Da Chub\", a remix of 50 Cent's 2003 hit \"In Da Club\".\n\nIn February 2007, he signed to Soulmate Records. He released his debut album, \"What You See Is What You Get\", on 22 March 2008. An \"InTheMix\" reviewer found 360 \"not only showcases his hilariously funny comedic side but demonstrates his ability to approach more serious and personal issues, producing a well rounded album\".\n\nIn a video interview for \"Peak Street Magazine\", 360 described his musical style as a combination of \"some pop influences, electro, dubstep, and unintelligent rhymes\". On 14 January 2008, 360 released a music video of \"Mamma Mia\", which depicts his desire for Bec Hewitt and mocked her husband, Lleyton Hewitt, which was the Video of the Week on MySpace.com's Australian hip hop page. 360 described it as a comedic effort, \"I wanted to take the piss out of them ... It's not meant to be taken too seriously she's not really my type\". Management for the couple dismissed the rapper's effort as \"a publicity stunt\".\n\nBy March 2010, he remained signed with Soulmate Records, which had signed a distribution deal with EMI Records.

He described it further, \"No one sees behind the scenes and there's been a lot of bad (expletive) going on in my family life and personal life\". 360 hinted at a diverse production line-up for the album, saying he has \"been getting a gang of beats from all different people\".\n\nA video, published on 21 November 2013, served as the official press release for the launch of Forthwrite Records, a music label created by 360 and Pez. 360 then confirmed the announcement on his Facebook page the following day, stating that the label will release \"Don't Look Down\", by Pez, \"Utopia\", by 360, and the debut, yet untitled Forthwrite album.\n\nDuring his performance at the 2013 Sprung Hip Hop Festival, held in Brisbane, Australia, 360 garnered media attention for the manner in which he introduced a new song titled \"On A Planet No One Knows\". According to 360, the song, which also features a vocal sample from Joss Whedon regarding gender equality, is \"about racism in Australia.\" 360 exclaimed:\nThere's a lot of racist cunts in this country [Australia]. I don't know if people are proud to admit it, or what—but there is. No matter what colour or background we are, there are fuckheads in every single race. Generalising everyone is fucking ignorant and uneducated and stupid. If you're offended by this then you're probably fuckin' racist and you should fuck off.\n\nIn February 2014, 360 supported the Australian tour of American rapper Eminem, alongside Kendrick Lamar. 360 described the tour as a career highlight and explained to the media in January 2014 that it would be his first tour sober—he had previously struggled with drug addiction.\n\nPrior to the release of the artist's third album, \"Utopia\", on 13 June 2014, three singles were released: \"Impossible\", \"On A Planet No One Knows\" and \"Sixavelli\". \"Impossible\" is a collaboration with Daniel Johns, of Australian band Silverchair, and Johns also appears in the music video, in which he is a passenger in a car driven by 360. A music video was also released for the second single and was published on the artist's YouTube channel during the week before Australia Day. The music video for \"Sixavelli\" was directed by Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore and was published in March 2014.\n\nAlongside fellow Australian hip hop act Hilltop Hoods, 360 performed at the 2014 Splendour In The Grass festival, held in Byron Bay, Australia. The Australian \"Utopia Tour\" occurred during September 2014 and 360 was supported by US rapper Hopsin, UK artist Lunar C, Pez and Miracle.\n\nDuring the early years of his music career, 360 collaborated with Pez as part of a duo called \"Forthwrite\", including a track called \"The Club Song\" on the 2010 album \"Good Gracious\", by producer M-Phazes. 360 also featured on Pez's 2008 single, \"The Festival Song\", which peaked at No. 14 on the ARIA Australian Singles Chart.\n\nIn 2010, 360 started an online musical project in the Australian hip hop scene, called \"Rapper Tag\", on YouTube. Rapper Tag involves one person recording a portion of rap over a looped beat, and then nominating (\"tagging\") another person to add further rapping over the same loop. The process continued in accordance with the nomination of the next rapper.\n\nAustralian hip hop duo Diafrix collaborated with 360 for the song \"I'm A Dreamer\", which appears on the 2012 album \"Pocket Full Of Dreams\". 360 appeared on the self-titled debut album by Canberra producer, Ghosts in the Room, released on 14 September 2012 through Mudd Music. The album also features rappers Iron Solomon, Okwerdz and Kool G Rap.\n\n360 was a panel member for the 20 October 2014 edition of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) program \"Q&A\". He appeared alongside Brian Cox, a particle physicist, Richard Gill, renowned conductor, and Nalini Joshi, a notable Australian mathematician, to discuss the topic of \"passion\". 360 garnered media attention for his comments on the television program regarding racism in relation to Australia, Australian hip hop and the Australian flag. When questioned by the presenter, 360 replied:\nOn Australia Day, you see dudes walking around with their tops off, and they're getting on the drink and all that. And they've got an Australian flag wrapped around their neck. I've seen it so many times; like, I've been in a taxi where we've pulled up because these dickheads have been walking across the road—they just start yelling at the taxi driver, like: \"Get out of the country! This is not your country!\" ... And they're wearing Australian flags. I've seen it so much, like, growing up ... still today, you know what I mean?\n\nThis response caused controversy, including the transference of the media spotlight onto Pez, who made comments on social media following 360's appearance. In addition to a message of support for his friend and musical collaborator, Pez also wrote that he also \"got a bit offended\"; however, he subsequently removed the sentence \"To be honest, even I got a bit offended.\" from his original Facebook post. As of 24 October 2014, 360 had not retracted his \"Q&A\" comments and explained after the airing of the episode: \"If you are not racist then you have nothing to be offended about.\"\n\nAt the age of 18 years, 360 contracted a disease of his right eye, a cornea transplant, which \"left him with fuzzy vision\" in that eye. A July 2014 feature article in \"Rolling Stone Australia\" stated that he is \"legally blind in his right eye\", while his left eye is \"slowly deteriorating due to the degenerative eye disease Keratoconus\".\n\nOn 18 July 2010, 360 was involved in a go-karting accident while celebrating his birthday with Sydney-based hip hop artists Bliss n Eso. He suffered a torn artery, lacerated pancreas and a damaged scrotum. According to the rapper, \"It [scrotum] wasn't ruptured, but it was ripped open ... The first thing I checked once I woke up was I didn't need to use a colostomy bag. My sex life is intact. There's no sex appeal if you use a colostomy bag\".\n\nOn 13 February 2012, 360 and Crystal Bale became engaged; the pair then separated on 24 December 2012.\n\nAs of October 2014, 360 is listed as a supporter of the 'Oscar's Law' campaign, which seeks to raise public awareness about the detrimental effects of factory farming of companion animals. He also appeared in PETA's 'Ink not Mink' anti-fur campaign.\n\n360 and Bale promoted awareness of suicide and depression issues. In mid-February 2012, he posted a video clip with the following statement: \"I don't usually drop serious videos, but this is something I'm passionate about spreading awareness about. Even if you hate me, this has nothing to do with music—please share this around so as many people as possible can see it\". In September 2012, Bale posted her video, 'A Message from Crystal', which Beats Factorys Robyn Morrison described as footage of Bale \"talking about how she has been affected by suicide—multiple times ... [it] is sometimes hard to watch, but essential viewing\".\n\nOn 8 January 2016, 360 posted a song named \"I'm Sorry\" onto his Facebook page. It talked about his codeine addiction. His addiction resulted in him cancelling tours without notice. In the song 360 mentions how he didn't tell anyone because he felt like a burden. Because he was addicted to Nurofen Plus, the pills could be bought without a prescription.\n\nIn September 2016, 360 announced that he was diagnosed with unipolar depression.\n\n\"Boys like You\" was voted into the No. 8 position in the Triple J Hottest 100 countdown of 2011. Also that year, 360 was awarded the Channel [V] 'Oz Artist of the Year', ahead of Guy Sebastian and Short Stack, and received the 'Jägermeister Most Hunted Award' at the Jägermeister Independent Music Awards (Australian Independent Record (AIR) Awards), which is voted by fans.\n\nAt the 2012 AIR Awards, 360 won the 'Best Independent Hip Hop Album' award for \"Falling & Flying\".\n\nAt the ARIA Music Awards of 2012, 360 was nominated in six categories and won the 'ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist - Release' for \"Falling & Flying\", while Feugo won the 'Producer of the Year' in the Artisan section.\n\n"}

It was Kool Herc who coined the term B-boy and B-girls for the African American teenage Funk dancers that attended his earliest parties. Sasa along with the first generation B-boys, Trixie, Wallace, Dancing Doug, The Legendary Twins, DJ Clark Kent, Chip The Mad Hatter and a few others from Kool Herc's parties, set the foundation for the B-boy dance style in Hip-Hop taking it to the floor, performing acrobatic moves. Originating from the music of James Brown records and breakbeats, along with many other funk hits. The 3rd generation of dancers later introduced the B-boy dance as (Breakdancing) into the mass media, because of the popularity of Hip-Hop becoming a mainstream genre in the early 1980's.\n\nSasa was born in Manhattan New York City and raised in the West Bronx. From childhood he grew up dancing to R&B, Soul and Funk music, early on he began getting recognition from his school peers for his fine dancing skills at school parties and later in his teenage years. Many of his friends began inviting him to house parties where he made a name for himself on the dance floor with his unique style, especially at Kool Herc parties where the best dancers from all over the Bronx and Harlem went to get down, and even dancers from Brooklyn. The best B-boy dancer was given the title \"(A1).\" Sasa, like most of the \"first generation originals,\" stopped B-boy dancing by 1977. He retired undefeated never losing a B-boy battle. The original (1975-77) Zulu king's B-boys popularity and influence brought in the era of forming break crews also known as rockers, with the Zulu's adding \"new footwork and acrobatic tricks\" to the foundation of the dance, causing it to become a city-wide competitive trend amongst the youth, \"which established this performing art form between the years of 1973 to 1977. After that, new generation B-boy crews began to pop up in communities all across the city.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "7265090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7265090", "title": "Amor fati", "text": "Amor fati\n\nAmor fati ( \"love of fate\") is a Latin phrase that may be translated as \"love of fate\" or \"love of one's fate\". It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including suffering and loss, as good or, at the very least, necessary, in that they are among the facts of one's life and existence, so they are always necessarily there whether one likes them or not. Moreover, \"amor fati\" is characterized by an acceptance of the events or situations that occur in one's life.\n\nThis acceptance does not necessarily preclude an attempt at change or improvement, but rather, it can be seen to be along the lines of what Friedrich Nietzsche apparently means by the concept of \"eternal recurrence\": a sense of contentment with one's life and an acceptance of it, such that one could live exactly the same life, in all its minute details, over and over for all eternity.\n\nThe concept of \"amor fati\" has been linked to Epictetus. It has also been linked to the writings of Marcus Aurelius, who did not himself use the words (he wrote in Greek, not Latin).\n\nThe phrase is used in a few of Nietzsche's writings and is representative of the general outlook on life that he articulates in section 276 of \"The Gay Science\":\n\nI want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. \"Amor fati\": let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. \"Looking away\" shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.\nIt is important to note that Nietzsche in this context refers to the \"Yes-sayer\", not in a political or social sense, but as a person who is capable of uncompromising acceptance of reality \"per se\".\n\nQuotation from \"Why I Am So Clever\" in \"Ecce Homo\", section 10:\n\nMy formula for greatness in a human being is \"amor fati\": that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it—all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary—but \"love\" it.Furthermore, Nietzsche's spirit of acceptance occurs in the context of his radical embrace of suffering. For to love that which is necessary, demands not only that we love the bad along with the good, but that we view the two as inextricably linked. In section 3 of the preface of \"The Gay Science\", he writes:Only great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit….I doubt that such pain makes us ‘better’; but I know that it makes us more profound. \n"}
{"id": "36122619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36122619", "title": "Artificial life", "text": "Artificial life\n\nArtificial life (often abbreviated ALife or A-Life) is a field of study wherein researchers examine systems related to natural life, its processes, and its evolution, through the use of simulations with computer models, robotics, and biochemistry. The discipline was named by Christopher Langton, an American theoretical biologist, in 1986. There are three main kinds of alife, named for their approaches: \"soft\", from software; \"hard\", from hardware; and \"wet\", from biochemistry. Artificial life researchers study traditional biology by trying to recreate aspects of biological phenomena.\n\nArtificial life studies the fundamental processes of living systems in artificial environments in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex information processing that define such systems. These topics are broad, but often include evolutionary dynamics, emergent properties of collective systems, biomimicry, as well as related issues about the philosophy of the nature of life and the use of lifelike properties in artistic works.\n\nThe modeling philosophy of artificial life strongly differs from traditional modeling by studying not only \"life-as-we-know-it\" but also \"life-as-it-might-be\".\n\nA traditional model of a biological system will focus on capturing its most important parameters. In contrast, an alife modeling approach will generally seek to decipher the most simple and general principles underlying life and implement them in a simulation. The simulation then offers the possibility to analyse new and different lifelike systems.\n\nVladimir Georgievich Red'ko proposed to generalize this distinction to the modeling of any process, leading to the more general distinction of \"processes-as-we-know-them\" and \"processes-as-they-could-be\".\n\nAt present, the commonly accepted definition of life does not consider any current alife simulations or software to be alive, and they do not constitute part of the evolutionary process of any ecosystem. However, different opinions about artificial life's potential have arisen:\n\n\n\nThis is a list of artificial life/digital organism simulators, organized by the method of creature definition.\n\nProgram-based simulations contain organisms with a complex DNA language, usually Turing complete. This language is more often in the form of a computer program than actual biological DNA. Assembly derivatives are the most common languages used. An organism \"lives\" when its code is executed, and there are usually various methods allowing self-replication. Mutations are generally implemented as random changes to the code. Use of cellular automata is common but not required. Another example could be an artificial intelligence and multi-agent system/program.\n\nIndividual modules are added to a creature. These modules modify the creature's behaviors and characteristics either directly, by hard coding into the simulation (leg type A increases speed and metabolism), or indirectly, through the emergent interactions between a creature's modules (leg type A moves up and down with a frequency of X, which interacts with other legs to create motion). Generally these are simulators which emphasize user creation and accessibility over mutation and evolution.\n\nOrganisms are generally constructed with pre-defined and fixed behaviors that are controlled by various parameters that mutate. That is, each organism contains a collection of numbers or other \"finite\" parameters. Each parameter controls one or several aspects of an organism in a well-defined way.\n\nThese simulations have creatures that learn and grow using neural nets or a close derivative. Emphasis is often, although not always, more on learning than on natural selection.\n\nMathematical models of complex systems are of three types: black-box (phenomenological), white-box (mechanistic, based on the first principles) and grey-box (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models). In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex dynamic system remain hidden. Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex dynamic system has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a dynamic system are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. Creation of a white-box model of complex system is associated with the problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical cellular automata are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical ontology of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the first principles because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic axiomatic system of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem.\n\nHardware-based artificial life mainly consist of \"robots\", that is, automatically guided machines able to do tasks on their own.\n\nBiochemical-based life is studied in the field of synthetic biology. It involves e.g. the creation of synthetic DNA. The term \"wet\" is an extension of the term \"wetware\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAlife has had a controversial history. John Maynard Smith criticized certain artificial life work in 1994 as \"fact-free science\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1231522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1231522", "title": "Biological immortality", "text": "Biological immortality\n\nBiological immortality (sometimes referred to \"bio-indefinite\" mortality) is a state in which the rate of mortality from senescence is stable or decreasing, thus decoupling it from chronological age. Various unicellular and multicellular species, including some vertebrates, achieve this state either throughout their existence or after living long enough. A biologically immortal living being can still die from means other than senescence, such as through injury or disease.\n\nThis definition of immortality has been challenged in the \"Handbook of the Biology of Aging\", because the increase in rate of mortality as a function of chronological age may be negligible at extremely old ages, an idea referred to as the late-life mortality plateau. The rate of mortality may cease to increase in old age, but in most cases that rate is typically very high. As a hypothetical example, there is only a 50% chance of a human surviving another year at age 110 or greater.\n\nThe term is also used by biologists to describe cells that are not subject to the Hayflick limit on how many times they can divide.\n\nBiologists chose the word \"immortal\" to designate cells that are not subject to the Hayflick limit, the point at which cells can no longer divide due to DNA damage or shortened telomeres. Prior to Leonard Hayflick's theory, Alexis Carrel hypothesized that all normal somatic cells were immortal.\n\nThe term \"immortalization\" was first applied to cancer cells that expressed the telomere-lengthening enzyme telomerase, and thereby avoided apoptosis—i.e. cell death caused by intracellular mechanisms. Among the most commonly used cell lines are HeLa and Jurkat, both of which are immortalized cancer cell lines. HeLa cells originated from a sample of cervical cancer taken from Henrietta Lacks in 1951. These cells have been and still are widely used in biological research such as creation of the polio vaccine, sex hormone steroid research, and cell metabolism. Normal stem cells and germ cells can also be said to be immortal (when humans refer to the cell line).\n\nImmortal cell lines of cancer cells can be created by induction of oncogenes or loss of tumor suppressor genes. One way to induce immortality is through viral-mediated induction of the large T‑antigen, commonly introduced through simian virus 40 (SV-40).\n\nAccording to the Animal Aging and Longevity Database, the list of organisms with negligible aging (along with estimated longevity in the wild) includes:\n\n\nIn 2018, scientists working for Calico, a company owned by Alphabet, published a paper in the journal \"eLife\" which presents possible evidence that Heterocephalus glaber (Naked mole rat) do not face increased mortality risk due to aging.\n\nMany unicellular organisms age: as time passes, they divide more slowly and ultimately die. Asymmetrically dividing bacteria and yeast also age. However, symmetrically dividing bacteria and yeast can be biologically immortal under ideal growing conditions. In these conditions, when a cell splits symmetrically to produce two daughter cells, the process of cell division can restore the cell to a youthful state. However, if the parent asymmetrically buds off a daughter only the daughter is reset to the youthful state—the parent isn't restored and will go on to age and die. In a similar manner stem cells and gametes can be regarded as \"immortal\".\n\nHydras are a genus of the Cnidaria phylum. All cnidarians can regenerate, allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Hydras are simple, freshwater animals possessing radial symmetry and no post-mitotic cells. All hydra cells continually divide. It has been suggested that hydras do not undergo senescence, and, as such, are biologically immortal. In a four-year study, 3 cohorts of hydra did not show an increase in mortality with age. It is possible that these animals live much longer, considering that they reach maturity in 5 to 10 days. However, this does not explain how hydras are consequently able to maintain telomere lengths.\n\n\"Turritopsis dohrnii\", or \"Turritopsis nutricula\", is a small () species of jellyfish that uses transdifferentiation to replenish cells after sexual reproduction. This cycle can repeat indefinitely, potentially rendering it biologically immortal. This organism originated in the Caribbean sea, but has now spread around the world. Similar cases include hydrozoan \"Laodicea undulata\" and scyphozoan \"Aurelia\" sp.1.\n\nResearch suggests that lobsters may not slow down, weaken, or lose fertility with age, and that older lobsters may be more fertile than younger lobsters. This does not however make them immortal in the traditional sense, as they are significantly more likely to die at a shell moult the older they get (as detailed below).\n\nTheir longevity may be due to telomerase, an enzyme that repairs long repetitive sections of DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, referred to as telomeres. Telomerase is expressed by most vertebrates during embryonic stages but is generally absent from adult stages of life. However, unlike vertebrates, lobsters express telomerase as adults through most tissue, which has been suggested to be related to their longevity. Contrary to popular belief, lobsters are not immortal. Lobsters grow by moulting which requires a lot of energy, and the larger the shell the more energy is required. Eventually, the lobster will die from exhaustion during a moult. Older lobsters are also known to stop moulting, which means that the shell will eventually become damaged, infected, or fall apart and they die. The European lobster has an average life span of 31 years for males and 54 years for females.\n\nPlanarian flatworms have both sexually and asexually reproducing types. Studies on genus Schmidtea mediterranea suggest these planarians appear to regenerate (i.e. heal) indefinitely, and asexual individuals have an \"apparently limitless [telomere] regenerative capacity fueled by a population of highly proliferative adult stem cells\". \"Both asexual and sexual animals display age-related decline in telomere length; however, asexual animals are able to maintain telomere lengths somatically (i.e. during reproduction by fission or when regeneration is induced by amputation), whereas sexual animals restore telomeres by extension during sexual reproduction or during embryogenesis like other sexual species. Homeostatic telomerase activity observed in both asexual and sexual animals is not sufficient to maintain telomere length, whereas the increased activity in regenerating asexuals is sufficient to renew telomere length... \"\n\nLifespan: For sexually reproducing planaria: \"the lifespan of individual planarian can be as long as 3 years, likely due to the ability of neoblasts to constantly replace aging cells\". Whereas for asexually reproducing planaria: \"individual animals in clonal lines of some planarian species replicating by fission have been maintained for over 15 years\". They do not live forever.\n\nAlthough the premise that biological aging can be halted or reversed by foreseeable technology remains controversial, research into developing possible therapeutic interventions is underway. Among the principal drivers of international collaboration in such research is the SENS Research Foundation, a non-profit organization that advocates a number of what it claims are plausible research pathways that might lead to engineered negligible senescence in humans.\n\nIn 2015, Elizabeth Parrish, CEO of BioViva, treated herself using gene therapy, with the goal of not just halting, but reversing aging. She has since reported feeling more energetic, and no obvious negative side effects have been noticed.\n\nFor several decades, researchers have also pursued various forms of suspended animation as a means by which to indefinitely extend mammalian lifespan. Some scientists have voiced support for the feasibility of the cryopreservation of humans, known as cryonics. Cryonics is predicated on the concept that some people considered clinically dead by today's medicolegal standards are not actually dead according to information-theoretic death and can, in principle, be resuscitated given sufficient technological advances. The goal of current cryonics procedures is tissue vitrification, a technique first used to reversibly cryopreserve a viable whole organ in 2005.\n\nSimilar proposals involving suspended animation include chemical brain preservation. The non-profit Brain Preservation Foundation offers a cash prize valued at over $100,000 for demonstrations of techniques that would allow for high-fidelity, long-term storage of a mammalian brain.\n\nIn 2016, scientists at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the Mayo Clinic employed genetic and pharmacological approaches to ablate pro-aging senescent cells, extending healthy lifespan of mice by over 25%. The startup Unity Biotechnology is further developing this strategy in human clinical trials.\n\nIn early 2017, Harvard scientists headed by biologist David Sinclair announced they have tested a metabolic precursor that increases NAD+ levels in mice and have successfully reversed the cellular aging process and can protect the DNA from future damage. \"The old mouse and young mouse cells are indistinguishable\", David was quoted. Human trials are to begin shortly in what the team expect is 6 months at Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston.\n\nTo achieve the more limited goal of halting the increase in mortality rate with age, a solution must be found to the fact that any intervention to remove senescent cells that creates competition among cells will increase age-related mortality from cancer.\n\nIn 2012 in Russia, and then in the United States, Israel, and the Netherlands, pro-immortality transhumanist political parties were launched. They aim to provide political support to anti-aging and radical life extension research and technologies and want to ensure the fastest possible—and at the same time, the least disruptive—societal transition to radical life extension, life without aging, and ultimately, immortality. They aim to make it possible to provide access to such technologies to the majority of people alive today.\n\nFuture advances in nanomedicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. K. Eric Drexler, one of the founders of nanotechnology, postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular machines, in his 1986 book Engines of Creation. Raymond Kurzweil, a futurist and transhumanist, stated in his book \"The Singularity Is Near\" that he believes that advanced medical nanorobotics could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030. According to Richard Feynman, it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a \"medical\" use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see biological machine). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) \"swallow the doctor\". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom.\"\n\n\n"}

One is that it is a polytope that is chiral (or \"enantiomorphic\"), meaning that it does not have mirror symmetry. By this definition, a polytope that lacks any symmetry at all would be an example of a chiral polytope. \n\nThe other, competing definition of a chiral polytope is that it is a polytope that is as symmetric as possible without being mirror-symmetric, formalized in terms of the action of the symmetry group of the polytope on its flags. By this definition, even highly-symmetric and enantiomorphic polytopes such as the snub cube are not chiral. Much of the study of symmetric but chiral polytopes has been carried out in the framework of abstract polytopes, because of the paucity of geometric examples.\n\nMany polytopes lack mirror symmetry, and in that sense form chiral polytopes.\nThe simplest example is a scalene triangle.\n\nIt is possible for polytopes to have a high degree of symmetry, but yet to lack mirror symmetry; an example is the snub cube, which is vertex-transitive and chiral in this sense.\nThe more technical definition of a chiral polytope is a polytope that has two orbits of flags under its group of symmetries, with \nadjacent flags in different orbits. This implies that it must be vertex-transitive, edge-transitive, and face-transitive, as each vertex, edge, or face must be represented by flags in both orbits; however, it cannot be mirror-symmetric, as every mirror symmetry of the polytope would exchange some pair of adjacent flags.\n\nFor the purposes of this definition, the symmetry group of a polytope may be defined in either of two different ways: it can refer to the symmetries of a polytope as a geometric object (in which case the polytope is called \"geometrically chiral\") or it can refer to the symmetries of the polytope as a combinatorial structure (an abstract polytope). Chirality is meaningful for either type of symmetry but the two definitions classify different polytopes as being chiral or nonchiral.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not possible for a geometrically chiral polytope to have finitely many finite faces. For instance, the snub cube is vertex-transitive, but its flags have more than two orbits, and it is neither edge-transitive nor face-transitive, so it is not symmetric enough to meet the formal definition of chirality. The quasiregular polyhedra and their duals, such as the cuboctahedron and the rhombic dodecahedron, provide another interesting type of near-miss: they have two orbits of flags, but are mirror-symmetric, and not every adjacent pair of flags belongs to different orbits. However, despite the nonexistence of finite chiral three-dimensional polyhedra, there exist infinite three-dimensional chiral skew polyhedra of types {4,6}, {6,4}, and {6,6}.\n\n"}

Hogan. NASA's Advanced Automation for Space Missions was the direct inspiration for this novel detailing first contact between Earth explorers and the Taloids, clanking replicators who have colonized Saturn's moon Titan.\n\nA sequel titled \"The Immortality Option\" was published in 1995.\n\nAbout 1,000,000 B.C., an unidentified alien race sent out robotic factories to many worlds in their part of the galaxy to prepare for future settlement. One of those factory ships suffers severe radiation damage from a near-miss by a supernova and goes off course, drifting in space for a hundred thousand years before landing on the Saturnian moon Titan. Due to a malfunction in its database, it begins producing imperfect copies that begin to evolve on their own. (The description of this background is presented in a prologue that proved sufficiently popular among readers that it was later anthologized on its own in a collection of Hogan's short fiction.) The resulting machine ecosystem eventually gives rise to humanoid robots with human-like intellects, who develop a civilization similar to early civilization of Earth. Almost all of them have reverence for their mythical creator, a being they call the \"Lifemaker\".\n\nEarly in the 21st century, the North Atlantic Space Organization (combining NASA and NATO) dispatched the \"Orion\" with a cover story of terraforming Mars for human habitation. Karl Zambendorf, a con artist who is present on this expedition to verify ESP over interplanetary distances, prematurely learns that the \"Orion\" and its crew of researchers is headed for Titan, where the discovery of the Taloids has been kept need-to-know on Earth.\n\nWhen the \"Orion\" arrives, the first landing party sets down in a freethinking state where Thirg, a Taloid who was cast out of his home state Kroaxia, has fled. They are mistaken for the Lifemaker because they have come from the sky, which the Taloids cannot see out of due to Titan's atmosphere. But Thirg becomes more discerning as he and the humans begin to understand more of each other's speech. Thirg's brother Groork has come from Kroaxia to apprehend him, but Zambendorf intercepts him and sends him back to Kroaxia as a prophet.\n\nZambendorf learned that NASO plans to exploit Titan's natural resources and use the Taloids to build the factories they need, reducing them to slaves. The NASO business administrators on the \"Orion\" are already in agreement with the Kroaxian government to use human (the Taloids call humans \"Lumians\" because they glow brightly in their infrared vision) weapons to conquer Titan, believing the Kroaxian leadership buttressed by priests will be the easiest to control. Zambendorf, in his unanticipated role as Messenger for the Lifemaker, has given Groork guidelines akin to the Ten Commandments for his people to prevent a war from starting. \"All Taloids are brothers\" and \"No Taloid is to enslave or be a slave\" does not sit well with the ruling establishment of Kroaxia, and Groork is saved by the \"Orion\" crew not working for NASO. There will be use of Titan's resources, but the partnership between humans and Taloids will be one of equals.\n\n"}

{"id": "3157035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3157035", "title": "Death drive", "text": "Death drive\n\nIn classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, the death drive () is the drive toward death and self-destruction. It was originally proposed by Sabina Spielrein in her paper \"Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being\" (\"Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens\") in 1912, which was then taken up by Sigmund Freud in 1920 in \"Beyond the Pleasure Principle.\" This concept has been translated as \"opposition between the ego or death instincts and the sexual or life instincts\". In \"Pleasure Principle\", Freud used the plural \"death drives\" (\"Todestriebe\") much more frequently than in the singular.\n\nThe death drive opposes Eros, the tendency toward survival, propagation, sex, and other creative, life-producing drives. The death drive is sometimes referred to as \"Thanatos\" in post-Freudian thought, complementing \"Eros\", although this term was not used in Freud's own work, being rather introduced by Wilhelm Stekel in 1909 and then by Paul Federn in the present context.\n\nThe Standard Edition of Freud's works in English confuses two terms that are different in German, \"Instinkt\" (\"instinct\") and \"Trieb\" (\"drive\"), often translating both as \"instinct\"; for example, \"the hypothesis of a \"death instinct\", the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state\". \"This equating of \"instinkt\" and \"Trieb\" has created serious misunderstandings\". Freud actually refers to the term \"instinkt\" in explicit use elsewhere, and so while the concept of \"instinct\" can loosely be referred to as a \"drive,\" any essentialist or naturalist connotations of the term should be put in abeyance. In a sense, the death drive is a force that is not essential to the life of an organism (unlike an \"instinct\") and tends to denature it or make it behave in ways that are sometimes counter-intuitive. In other words, the term death \"drive\" is simply a false representation of death instinct. The term is almost universally known in scholarly literature on Freud as the \"death drive\", and Lacanian psychoanalysts often shorten it to simply \"drive\" (although Freud posited the existence of other drives as well, and Lacan explicitly states in Seminar XI that all drives are partial to the death drive). The contemporary Penguin translations of Freud translate \"Trieb\" and \"Instinkt\" as \"drive\" and \"instinct\" respectively.\n\nIt was a basic premise of Freud's that \"the course taken by mental events is automatically regulated by the pleasure principle...[associated] with an avoidance of unpleasure or a production of pleasure\". Three main types of conflictual evidence, difficult to explain satisfactorily in such terms, led Freud late in his career to look for another principle in mental life \"beyond\" the pleasure principle—a search that would ultimately lead him to the concept of the death drive.\n\nThe first problem Freud encountered was the phenomenon of repetition in (war) trauma. When Freud worked with people with trauma (particularly the trauma experienced by soldiers returning from World War I), he observed that subjects often tended to repeat or re-enact these traumatic experiences: \"dreams occurring in traumatic have the characteristic of repeatedly bringing the patient back into the situation of his accident\", contrary to the expectations of the pleasure principle.\n\nA second problematic area was found by Freud in children's play (such as the \"Fort/Da\" [Forth/here] game played by Freud's grandson, who would stage and re-stage the disappearance of his mother and even himself). \"How then does his repetition of this distressing experience as a game fit in with the pleasure principle?\"\n\nThe third problem came from clinical practice. Freud found his patients, dealing with painful experiences that had been repressed, regularly \"obliged to \"repeat\" the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of [...] \"remembering\" it as something belonging to the past\". Combined with what he called \"the compulsion of destiny [...] come across [in] people all of whose human relationships have the same outcome\", such evidence led Freud \"to justify the hypothesis of a compulsion to repeat—something that would seem more primitive, more elementary, more instinctual than the pleasure principle which it over-rides\".\n\nHe then set out to find an explanation of such a compulsion; in Freud's own words, \"What follows is speculation, often far-fetched speculation, which the reader will consider or dismiss according to his individual predilection\". Seeking a new instinctual paradigm for such problematic repetition, he found it ultimately in \"an urge in organic life to restore an earlier state of things\"—the inorganic state from which life originally emerged. From the conservative, restorative character of instinctual life, Freud derived his death drive, with its \"pressure towards death\", and the resulting \"separation of the death instincts from the life instincts\" seen in Eros. The death drive then manifested itself in the individual creature as a force \"whose function is to assure that the organism shall follow its own path to death\".\n\nSeeking further potential clinical support for the existence of such a self-destructive force, Freud found it through a reconsideration of his views of masochism—previously \"regarded as sadism that has been turned round upon the subject's own ego\"—so as to allow that \"there \"might\" be such a thing as primary masochism—a possibility which I had contested\" before. Even with such support, however, he remained very tentative to the book's close about the provisional nature of his theoretical construct: what he called \"the whole of our artificial structure of hypotheses\".\n\nAlthough Spielrein's paper was published in 1912, Freud initially resisted the concept as he considered it to be too Jungian. Nevertheless, Freud eventually adopted the concept, and in later years would build extensively upon the tentative foundations he had set out in \"Beyond the Pleasure Principle\". In \"The Ego and the Id\" (1923) he would develop his argument to state that \"the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an \"instinct of destruction\" directed against the external world\". The following year he would spell out more clearly that the \"libido has the task of making the destroying instinct innocuous, and it fulfils the task by diverting that instinct to a great extent outwards [...]. The instinct is then called the destructive instinct, the instinct for mastery, or the will to power\", a perhaps much more recognisable set of manifestations.\n\nAt the close of the decade, in \"Civilization and Its Discontents\" (1930), Freud acknowledged that \"To begin with it was only tentatively that I put forward the views I have developed here, but in the course of time they have gained such a hold upon me that I can no longer think in any other way\".\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, the death drive may be viewed in relation to the work of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. His philosophy, expounded in \"The World as Will and Representation\" (1818) postulates that all exists by a metaphysical \"will\" (more clearly, a will to live), and that pleasure affirms this will. Schopenhauer's pessimism led him to believe that the affirmation of the \"will\" was a negative and immoral thing, due to his belief of life producing more suffering than happiness. The death drive would seem to manifest as a natural and psychological negation of the \"will\".\n\nFreud was well aware of such possible linkages. In a letter of 1919, he wrote that regarding \"the theme of death, [that I] have stumbled onto an odd idea via the drives and must now read all sorts of things that belong to it, for instance Schopenhauer\". Indeed, Ernest Jones (who like many analysts was not convinced of the need for the death drive, over and above an instinct of aggression) considered that \"Freud seemed to have landed in the position of Schopenhauer, who taught that 'death is the goal of life'\".\n\nHowever, as Freud put it to the imagined auditors of his \"New Introductory Lectures\" (1932), \"You may perhaps shrug your shoulders and say: \"That isn't natural science, it's Schopenhauer's philosophy!\" But, ladies and gentlemen, why should not a bold thinker have guessed something that is afterwards confirmed by sober and painstaking detailed research?\" He then went on to add that \"what we are saying is not even genuine Schopenhauer...we are not overlooking the fact that there is life as well as death. We recognise two basic instincts and give each of them its own aim\".\n\nFreud applied his new theoretical construct in \"Civilization and Its Discontents\" (1930) to the difficulties inherent in Western civilization—indeed, in civilization and in social life as a whole. In particular, given that \"a portion of the [death] instinct is diverted towards the external world and comes to light as an instinct of aggressiveness', he saw 'the inclination to aggression [...] [as] the greatest impediment to civilization\". The need to overcome such aggression entailed the formation of the [cultural] superego: \"We have even been guilty of the heresy of attributing the origin of conscience to this diversion inwards of aggressiveness\". The presence thereafter in the individual of the superego and a related sense of guilt—\"Civilization, therefore, obtains mastery over the individual's dangerous desire for aggression by [...] setting up an agency within him to watch over it\"—leaves an abiding sense of uneasiness inherent in civilized life, thereby providing a structural explanation for 'the suffering of civilized man'.\n\nFreud made a further connection between group life and innate aggression, where the former comes together more closely by directing aggression to other groups, an idea later picked up by group analysts like Wilfred Bion.\n\nIn the closing decade of Freud's life, it has been suggested, his view of the death drive changed somewhat, with \"the stress much more upon the death instinct's manifestations \"outwards\"\". Given \"the ubiquity of non-erotic aggressivity and destructiveness\", he wrote in 1930, \"I adopt the standpoint, therefore, that the inclination to aggression is an original, self-subsisting instinctual disposition in man\".\n\nIn 1933 he conceded of his original formulation of the death drive 'the improbability of our speculations. A queer instinct, indeed, directed to the destruction of its own organic home!'. He wrote moreover that \"Our hypothesis is that there are two essentially different classes of instincts: the sexual instincts, understood in the widest sense—Eros, if you prefer that name—and the aggressive instincts, whose aim is destruction\". In 1937, he went so far as to suggest privately that 'We should have a neat schematic picture if we supposed that originally, at the beginning of life, all libido was directed to the inside and all aggressiveness to the outside'. In his last writings, it was the contrast of \"two basic instincts, \"Eros\" and \"the destructive instinct\" [...] our two primal instincts, \"Eros\" and \"destructiveness\", on which he laid stress. Nevertheless, his belief in \"the death instinct [...] [as] a return to an earlier state [...] into an inorganic state\" continued to the end.\n\nAs Freud wryly commented in 1930, \"The assumption of the existence of an instinct of death or destruction has met with resistance even in analytic circles\". Indeed, Ernest Jones would comment of \"Beyond the Pleasure Principle\" that the book not only \"displayed a boldness of speculation that was unique in all his writings\" but was \"further noteworthy in being the only one of Freud's which has received little acceptance on the part of his followers\".\n\nOtto Fenichel in his compendious survey of the first Freudian half-century concluded that \"the facts on which Freud based his concept of a death instinct in no way necessitate the assumption [...] of a genuine self-destructive instinct\". Heinz Hartmann set the tone for ego psychology when he \"chose to [...] do without 'Freud's other, mainly biologically oriented set of hypotheses of the \"life\" and \"death instincts\"'\". In the object relations theory, among the independent group 'the most common repudiation was the loathsome notion of the death instinct'. Indeed, \"for most analysts Freud's idea of a primitive urge towards death, of a primary masochism, was [...] bedevilled by problems\".\n\nNevertheless, the concept has been defended, extended, and carried forward by some analysts, generally those tangential to the psychoanalytic mainstream; while among the more orthodox, arguably of \"those who, in contrast to most other analysts, take Freud's doctrine of the death drive seriously, K. R. Eissler has been the most persuasive—or least unpersuasive\".\n\nMelanie Klein and her immediate followers considered that \"the infant is exposed from birth to the anxiety stirred up by the inborn polarity of instincts—the immediate conflict between the life instinct and the death instinct\"; and Kleinians indeed built much of their theory of early childhood around the outward deflection of the latter. \"This deflection of the death instinct, described by Freud, in Melanie Klein's view consists partly of a projection, partly of the conversion of the death instinct into aggression\".\n\nFrench psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, for his part, castigated the \"refusal to accept this culminating point of Freud's doctrine [...] by those who conduct their analysis on the basis of a conception of the \"ego\" [...] that death instinct whose enigma Freud propounded for us at the height of his experience\". Characteristically, he stressed the linguistic aspects of the death drive: \"the symbol is substituted for death in order to take possession of the first swelling of life [...]. There is therefore no further need to have recourse to the outworn notion of primordial masochism in order to understand the reason for the repetitive games in [...] his \"Fort!\" and in his \"Da!\".\"\n\nEric Berne too would proudly proclaim that he, \"besides having repeated and confirmed the conventional observations of Freud, also believes right down the line with him concerning the death instinct, and the pervasiveness of the repetition compulsion\".\n\nFor the twenty-first century, \"the death drive today [...] remains a highly controversial theory for many psychoanalysts [...] [almost] as many opinions as there are psychoanalysts\".\n\nFreud's conceptual opposition of death and eros drives in the human psyche was applied by Walter A. Davis in \"Deracination: Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative\" and \"Death's Dream Kingdom: The American Psyche since 9/11.\" Davis described social reactions to both Hiroshima and 9/11 from the Freudian viewpoint of the death force. Unless they consciously take responsibility for the damage of those reactions, Davis claims that Americans will repeat them.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44452821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44452821", "title": "Death trajectory", "text": "Death trajectory\n\nDeath trajectory refers to the pattern of dying when a patient is given a projected death date with limited or no medical recourse for the remaining existence of the individual's life. The death trajectory is dependent on the cause of death, whether it is sudden death, chronic illness, or the steady decline in health due to senescence (aging). Death trajectory is analyzed in two separate aspects: duration and shape. Duration refers to the period of time a patient has to live, which can be anywhere from imminent death to several months. Shape refers to how that duration is then graphed. In other words, the shape is \"the course of dying, its predictability, and whether death is expected or unexpected\".\nDying trajectories were first studied in the 1960s by two researchers, Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss, in an attempt to understand the end of human life from different ailments, including cancer.\n\nSudden or premature death occurs when the death of an individual is not perceived to be imminent. In a sudden death trajectory, an otherwise healthy and high-functioning individual will suddenly and unexpectedly die without any observable indications of oncoming demise. People are at a high or normal level of functioning until the moment of death occurs. These types of deaths include fatal accidents and inconspicuous health issues like myocardial infarction or severe stroke. Deaths that align with a sudden death trajectory may happen over the course of a few days or in a matter of seconds.\n\nThe chronic malady trajectory occurs with types of death caused by autoimmune diseases such as HIV or other incurable illnesses. This process of death is characterized by an overall decline in health accompanied by acute crises and intermittent recoveries. The chronic malady trajectory projects emotional stress or turmoil; the patient may eventually become mentally and emotionally exhausted.\n\nA natural death trajectory is typically a long, steady decline due to old age. In these cases, the death trajectory is based on how the mind and body degenerate, including the speed of organ failure. In these cases, it is much easier to anticipate a person's death.\n\nWhen someone has an estimated death date and a death trajectory, the patient's caregivers generally cease curative care and proceed to provide palliative or comfort care. Curative care refers to situations where the patient still feels it is possible to use current medical care to recover or become stable enough to carry on with life. Comfort care, or hospice care, is reserved for patients who acknowledge they will not be able to recover.\n\n"}

The result might look like an avatar behaving, reacting, and thinking like a person on the basis of that person's digital archive. After the death of the individual, this avatar could remain static or continue to learn and develop autonomously.\n\nA considerable portion of transhumanists and singularitarians place great hope into the belief that they may become immortal by the year 2045, by creating one or many non-biological functional copies of their brains, thereby leaving their \"biological shell\". These copies may then \"live eternally\" in a version of digital \"heaven\" or paradise.\n\nThe National Science Foundation has awarded a half-million-dollar grant to the universities of Central Florida at Orlando and Illinois at Chicago to explore how researchers might use artificial intelligence, archiving, and computer imaging to create convincing, digital versions of real people, a possible first step toward virtual immortality.\n\nThe Digital Immortality Institute explores three factors necessary for digital immortality. First, at whatever level of implementation, avatars require guaranteed Internet accessibility. Next, avatars must be what users specify, and they must remain so. Finally, future representations must be secured before the living users are no more.\n\nThe aim of Dmitry Itskov's 2045 Initiative is to \"create technologies enabling the transfer of an individual’s personality to a non-biological carrier, and extending existence, including to the point of immortality\".\n\nReaching digital immortality is a two-step process:\n\nAccording to Gordon Bell and Jim Gray from Microsoft Research, retaining every conversation that a person has ever heard is already realistic: it needs less than a terabyte of storage (for adequate quality). The speech or text recognition technologies are one of the biggest challenges of the concept.\n\nA second possibility would be to archive and analyze social Internet use to map the personality of people. By analyzing social Internet use during 50 years, it would be possible to model a society's culture, a society's way of thinking, and a society's interests.\n\nRothblatt envisions the creation of \"mindfiles\" – collections of data from all kinds of sources, including the photos we upload to Facebook, the discussions and opinions we share on forums or blogs, and other social media interactions that reflect our life experiences and our unique self.\n\nRichard Grandmorin summarized the concept of digital immortality by the following equation: \"semantic analysis + social internet use + Artificial Intelligence = immortality\".\n\nSome find that photos, videos, soundclips, social media posts and other data of oneself could already be regarded as such an archiving.\n\nSusanne Asche states:\nDefining the avatar to be alive allows it to communicate with the future in the sense that it continues to learn, evolve and interact with people, if they still exist. Technically, the operation exists to implement an artificial intelligence system to the avatar. This artificial intelligence system is then assumed to think and will react on the base of the archive.\n\nRothblatt proposes the term \"mindware\" for software that is being developed with the goal of generating conscious AIs. Such software would read a person's \"mindfile\" to generate a \"mindclone.\" Rothblatt also proposes a certain level of governmental approval for mindware, like an FDA certification, to ensure that the resulting mindclones are well made.\n\nDuring the calibration process, the biological people are living at the same time as their artifact in silicon. The artifact in silicon is calibrated to be as close as possible to the person in question.\nDuring this process ongoing updates, synchronization, and interaction between the two minds would maintain the twin minds as one.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1285228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1285228", "title": "Egotism", "text": "Egotism\n\nEgotism is the drive to maintain and enhance favorable views of oneself, and generally features an inflated opinion of one's personal features and importance. It often includes intellectual, physical, social and other overestimations. \n\nThe egotist has an overwhelming sense of the centrality of the 'Me', that is to say of their personal qualities. Egotism means placing oneself at the core of one's world with no concern for others, including those \"loved\" or considered as \"close\", in any other terms except those subjectively set by the egotist.\n\nEgotism is closely related to an egocentric love for one's imagined self or narcissism – indeed some would say \"by egotism we may envisage a kind of socialized narcissism\". Egotists have a strong tendency to talk about themselves in a self-promoting fashion, and they may well be arrogant and boastful with a grandiose sense of their own importance. Their inability to recognise the accomplishments of others leaves them profoundly self-promoting; while sensitivity to criticism may lead on the egotist's part to narcissistic rage at a sense of insult.\n\nEgotism differs from both altruism – or acting to gain \"fewer\" values than are being given – and from egoism, the constant pursuit of one's self-interest. Various forms of \"empirical egoism\" have been considered consistent with egotism, but do not – which is also the case with egotism in general – necessitate having an inflated sense of self.\n\nIn developmental terms, two rather different trajectories can be distinguished with respect to egotism – the one individual, the other cultural.\n\nWith respect to the developing individual, a movement takes place from egocentricity to sociality during the process of growing up. It is normal for an infant to have an inflated – almost a majestic – sense of egotism. The over-evaluation of one's own ego regularly appears in childish forms of love – in large part because the baby is to himself everything, omnipotent to the best of their own knowledge.\n\nOptimal development allows a gradual reconciliation to a more realistic view of one's own place in the world – a lessening of the egotistical swollen head. Less adequate adjustment may later lead to what has been called defensive egotism, serving to overcompensate for the fragility of the underlying concept of self. Robin Skynner however considered that in the main growing up leads to a state where \"your ego is still there, but it's taking its proper limited place among all the other egos\".\n\nHowever, alongside such a positive trajectory of diminishing \"individual\" egotism, a rather different arc of development can be noted in cultural terms, linked to what has been seen as the increasing infantilism of (post)modern society. Whereas in the nineteenth century egotism was still widely regarded as a traditional vice – for Nathaniel Hawthorne egotism was a sort of diseased self-contemplation – Romanticism had already set in motion a countervailing current, what Richard Eldridge described as a kind of \"cultural egotism, substituting the individual imagination for vanishing social tradition\". The romantic idea of the self-creating individual – of a self-authorizing, artistic egotism – then took on broader social dimensions in the following century. Keats might still attack Wordsworth for the regressive nature of his retreat into the egotistical sublime; but by the close of the twentieth century egotism had been naturalized much more widely by the Me generation into the Culture of Narcissism.\n\nIn the 21st century, romantic egotism has been seen as feeding into techno-capitalism in two complementary ways: on the one hand, through the self-centred consumer, focused on their own self-fashioning through brand 'identity'; on the other through the equally egotistical voices of 'authentic' protest, as they rage against the machine, only to produce new commodity forms that serve to fuel the system for further consumption.\n\nThere is a question mark over the relationship between sex and egotism. Sigmund Freud popularly made the claim that love can transform the egotist, giving him or her a new sense of humility in relation to others.\n\nAt the same time, it is very apparent that egotism can readily show itself in sexual ways and indeed arguably one's whole sexuality may function in the service of egotistical needs.\n\nThe term egotism is derived from the Greek (\"εγώ\") and subsequently its Latinised ego (\"ego\"), meaning \"self\" or \"I,\" and \"-ism\", used to denote a system of belief. As such, the term shares early etymology with egoism.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1468466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1468466", "title": "Elixir of life", "text": "Elixir of life\n\nThe elixir of life, also known as elixir of immortality and sometimes equated with the philosopher's stone, is a potion that supposedly grants the drinker eternal life and/or eternal youth. This elixir was also said to cure all diseases. Alchemists in various ages and cultures sought the means of formulating the elixir.\n\nIn ancient China, various emperors sought the fabled elixir with varying results. In the Qin Dynasty, Qin Shi Huang sent Taoist alchemist Xu Fu with 500 young men and 500 young women to the eastern seas to find the elixir, but he never came back (legend has it that he found Japan instead). When Shi Huang Di visited, he brought 3000 young girls and boys, but none of them ever returned.\n\nThe ancient Chinese believed that ingesting long-lasting precious substances such as jade, cinnabar or hematite would confer some of that longevity on the person who consumed them. Gold was considered particularly potent, as it was a non-tarnishing precious metal; the idea of potable or drinkable gold is found in China by the end of the third century BC. The most famous Chinese alchemical book, the Danjing yaojue (Essential Formulas of Alchemical Classics) attributed to Sun Simiao (c. 581 – c. 682 CE), a famous medical specialist respectfully called \"King of Medicine\" by later generations, discusses in detail the creation of elixirs for immortality (mercury, sulfur, and the salts of mercury and arsenic are prominent, and most are poisonous) as well as those for curing certain diseases and the fabrication of precious stones.\n\nMany of these substances, far from contributing to longevity, were actively toxic and resulted in Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning. The Jiajing Emperor in the Ming Dynasty died from ingesting a lethal dosage of mercury in the supposed \"Elixir of Life\" conjured by alchemists. British historian Joseph Needham compiled a list of Chinese emperors whose deaths were likely due to elixir poisoning.\n\nAmrita, the elixir of life has been described in the Hindu scriptures (not to be confused with Amrit related to Sikh religion (see Amrit Sanskar)). Anybody who consumes even a tiniest portion of Amrit has been described to gain immortality. Legend has it that at early times when the inception of the world had just taken place, evil demons (Ashur) had gained strength. This was seen as a threat to the gods (Devas) who feared them. So these gods (including Indra, the god of sky, Vayu, the god of wind, and Agni, the god of fire) went to seek advice and help from the three primary gods according to the Hindus: Vishnu (the preserver), Brahma (the creator), and Shiva (the destroyer). They suggested that Amrit could only be gained from the samudra manthan (or churning of the ocean) for the ocean in its depths hid mysterious and secret objects. Vishnu agreed to take the form of a turtle on whose shell a huge mountain was placed. This mountain was used as a churning pole.\n\nWith the help of a Vasuki (mighty and long serpent, king of Nagloka) the churning process began at the surface. From one side the gods pulled the serpent, which had coiled itself around the mountain, and the demons pulled it from the other side. As the churning process required immense strength, hence the demons were persuaded to do the job—they agreed in return for a portion of Amrit. Finally with their combined efforts (of the gods and demons), Amrit emerged from the ocean depths. All the gods were offered the drink but the gods managed to trick the demons who did not get the holy drink.\n\nThe oldest Indian writings, the Vedas (Hindu sacred scriptures), contain the same hints of alchemy that are found in evidence from ancient China, namely vague references to a connection between gold and long life. Mercury, which was so vital to alchemy everywhere, is first mentioned in the 4th to 3rd century BC Arthashastra, about the same time it is encountered in China and in the West. Evidence of the idea of transmuting base metals to gold appears in 2nd to 5th century AD Buddhist texts, about the same time as in the West.\n\nIt is also possible that the alchemy of medicine and immortality came to China from India, or vice versa; in any case, for both cultures, gold-making appears to have been a minor concern, and medicine the major concern. But the elixir of immortality was of little importance in India (which had other avenues to immortality). The Indian elixirs were mineral remedies for specific diseases or, at the most, to promote long life.\n\nIn European alchemical tradition, the Elixir of Life is closely related to the creation of the philosopher's stone. According to legend, certain alchemists have gained a reputation as creators of the elixir. These include Nicolas Flamel and St. Germain.\n\nThe Elixir has had hundreds of names (one scholar of Chinese history reportedly found over 1,000 names for it), among them Amrit Ras or Amrita, Aab-i-Hayat, Maha Ras, Aab-Haiwan, Dancing Water, Chasma-i-Kausar, Mansarover or the Pool of Nectar, Philosopher's stone, and Soma Ras. The word \"elixir\" was not used until the 7th century A.D. and derives from the Arabic name for miracle substances, \"al iksir\". Some view it as a metaphor for the spirit of God (\"e.g.\", Jesus's reference to \"the Water of Life\" or \"the Fountain of Life\"). \"But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\" (John 4:14) The Scots and the Irish adopted the name for their \"liquid gold\": the Gaelic name for whiskey is uisce beatha, or water of life.\n\n\"Aab-i-Hayat\" is Persian and means \"water of life\". \"Chashma-i-Kausar\" (not \"hasma\") is the \"Fountain of Bounty\", which Muslims believe to be located in Paradise. As for the Indian names, \"Amrit Ras\" means \"immortality juice\", \"Maha Ras\" means \"great juice\", and \"Soma Ras\" means \"juice of Soma\". Soma was a psychoactive drug, by which the poets of the Vedas received their visions, but the plant is no longer known. Later, Soma came to mean the moon. \"Ras\" later came to mean \"sacred mood experienced listening to poetry or music\"; there are altogether nine of them. Mansarovar, the \"mind lake\" is the holy lake at the foot of Mt. Kailash in Tibet, close to the source of the Ganges.\n\nThe elixir of life has been an inspiration, plot feature, or subject of artistic works including animation, comics, films, musical compositions, novels, and video games. Examples include L. Frank Baum's fantasy novel \"John Dough and the Cherub\", the science fiction series \"Doctor Who\", \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", \"House of Anubis\", the popular manga \"Fullmetal Alchemist\", the light novel \"Baccano!\", and the movie Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva of the popular Professor Layton franchise.\n\n"}

The youth referred to is usually meant to be in contrast to the depredations of aging, rather than a specific age of the human lifespan. Achieving eternal youth so far remains beyond the capabilities of scientific technology. However, much research is being conducted in the sciences of genetics which may allow manipulation of the aging process in the future. Eternal youth is common in mythology, and is a popular theme in fiction.\n\nEternal youth is a characteristic of the inhabitants of Paradise in Abrahamic religions.\n\nThe Hindus believe that the Vedic and the post-Vedic rishis have attained immortality, which implies the ability to change one's body's age or even shape at will. These are some of the siddhas in Yoga. Markandeya is said to always stay at the age of 16.\n\nThe difference between eternal life and the more specific eternal youth is a recurrent theme in Greek and Roman mythology. The mytheme of requesting the boon of immortality from a god, but forgetting to ask for eternal youth appears in the story of Tithonus. A similar theme is found in Ovid regarding the Cumaean Sibyl.\n\nIn Norse mythology, Iðunn is described as providing the gods apples that grant them eternal youthfulness in the 13th century Prose Edda.\n\nAn individual's DNA plays a role in the aging process. Aging begins even before birth, as soon as cells start to die and need to be replaced. On the ends of each chromosome are repetitive sequences of DNA, telomeres, that protect the chromosome from joining with other chromosomes, and have several key roles. One of these roles is to regulate cell division by allowing each cell division to remove a small amount of genetic code. The amount removed varies by the cell type being replicated. The gradual degradation of the telomeres restricts cell division to 40-60 times, also known as the Hayflick limit. Once this limit has been reached, more cells die than can be replaced in the same time span. Thus, soon after this limit is reached the organism dies. The importance of telomeres is now clearly evident: lengthen the telomeres, lengthen the life.\n\nHowever, a study of the comparative biology of mammalian telomeres indicated that telomere length correlates inversely, rather than directly, with lifespan, and concluded that the contribution of telomere length to lifespan remains controversial. Also, telomere shortening does not occur with age in a some postmitotic tissues, such as in the rat brain. In humans, skeletal muscle telomere lengths remain stable from ages 23–74. In baboon skeletal muscle, that consists of fully differentiated post-mitotic cells, less than 3% of myonuclei contain damaged telomeres and this percentage does not increase with age. Thus telomere shortening does not appear to be a major factor in the aging of the differentiated cells of brain or skeletal muscle.\n\nStudies have shown that 90 percent of cancer cells contain large amounts of an enzyme called telomerase. Telomerase is an enzyme that replenishes the worn away telomeres by adding bases to the ends and thus renewing the telomere. A cancer cell has in essence turned on the telomerase gene, and this allows them to have an unlimited amount of divisions without the telomeres wearing away. Other kinds of cells that can surpass the Hayflick limit are stem cells, hair follicles, and germ cells. This is because they contain raised amounts of telomerase.\n\nThe idea that the human body can be repaired in old age to a more youthful state has gathered significant commercial interest over the past few years, including by companies such as Human Longevity Inc, Google Calico, and Elysium Health. In addition to these larger companies, many startups are currently developing therapeutics to tackle the 'ageing problem' using therapy. In 2015 a new class of drugs senolytics was announced (currently in pre-clinical development) designed specifically to combat the underlying biological causes of frailty.\n\nThe \"loss of youth\" or ageing process is responsible for increasing the risk of individuals to many diseases including cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and others. As a result, in recent years, many high net worth individuals have donated large amounts of their money towards initiatives towards scientific research into the ageing process itself or therapies to slow or reverse the ageing process. These people include Peter Thiel, Aubrey de Grey, Larry Ellison, Sergey Brin, Dmitry Itskov, Paul Gallen, and Mark Zuckerberg. This would allow humans to extend or maintain their youth indefinitely.\n\n"}
{"id": "39830246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39830246", "title": "Evolving digital ecological networks", "text": "Evolving digital ecological networks\n\nEvolving digital ecological networks are webs of interacting, self-replicating, and evolving computer programs (i.e., digital organisms) that experience the same major ecological interactions as biological organisms (e.g., competition, predation, parasitism, and mutualism). Despite being computational, these programs evolve quickly in an open-ended way, and starting from only one or two ancestral organisms, the formation of ecological networks can be observed in real-time by tracking interactions between the constantly evolving organism phenotypes. These phenotypes may be defined by combinations of logical computations (hereafter tasks) that digital organisms perform and by expressed behaviors that have evolved. The types and outcomes of interactions between phenotypes are determined by task overlap for logic-defined phenotypes and by responses to encounters in the case of behavioral phenotypes. Biologists use these evolving networks to study active and fundamental topics within evolutionary ecology (e.g., the extent to which the architecture of multispecies networks shape coevolutionary outcomes, and the processes involved).\n\nIn nature, species do not evolve in isolation but in large networks of interacting species. One of the main goals in evolutionary ecology is to disentangle the evolutionary mechanisms that shape and are shaped by patterns of interaction between species. A particularly important question concerns how coevolution, the reciprocal evolutionary change in local populations of interacting species driven by natural selection, is shaped by the architecture of food webs, plant-animal mutualistic networks, and host-parasite communities. The concept of diffuse coevolution, where adaptation is in response to a suite of biotic interactions, was the first step towards a framework unifying relevant theories in community ecology and coevolution. Understanding how individual interactions within networks influence coevolution, and conversely how coevolution influences the overall structure of networks, requires an appreciation for how pair-wise interactions change due to their broader community contexts as well as how this community context shapes selective pressures. Accordingly, research is now focusing on how reciprocal selection influences and is embedded within the structure of multispecies interactive webs, not only on particular species in isolation.\n\nCoevolution in a community context can be addressed theoretically via mathematical modeling and simulation, by looking at ancient footprints of evolutionary history via ecological patterns that persist and are observable today, and by performing laboratory experiments with microorganisms. In spite of the long time scales involved and the substantial effort that is necessary to isolate and quantify samples, the latter approach of testing biological evolution in the lab has been successful over the last two decades. However, studying the evolution of interspecific interactions, which involves dealing with more complex webs of multiple interacting species, has proven to be a much more difficult challenge. A meta-analysis of host-phage interaction networks, carried out by Weitz and his team, found a striking statistical structure to the patterns of infection and resistance across a wide variety of environments and methods from which the hosts and phage were obtained. However, the ecological mechanisms and evolutionary processes responsible have yet to be unraveled.\n\nDigital ecological networks enable the direct, comprehensive, and real time observation of evolving ecological interactions between antagonistic and/or mutualistic digital organisms that are difficult to study in nature. Research using self-replicating computer programs can help us understand how coevolution shapes the emergence and diversification of coevolving species interaction networks and, in turn, how changes in the overall structure of the web (e.g., through extinction of taxa or the introduction of invasive species) affect the evolution of a given species. Studying the evolution of species interaction networks in these artificial evolving systems also contributes to the development of the field, while overcoming limitations evolutionary biologists may face. For example, laboratory studies have shown that historical contingency can enable or impede the outcome of the interactions between bacteria and phage, depending on the order in which mutations occur: the phage often, but not always, evolve the ability to infect a novel host. Therefore, in order to obtain statistical power for predicting such outcomes of the coevolutionary process, experiments require a high level of replication. This stochastic nature of the evolutionary process was exemplified by Stephen Jay Gould's inquiry (\"What would happen if the tape of the history of life were rewound and replayed?\") Because of their ease in scalability and replication, evolving digital ecological networks open the door to experiments that incorporate this approach of \"replaying the tape of life\". Such experiments allow researchers to quantify the role of historical contingency and repeatability in network evolution, enabling predictions about the architecture and dynamics of large networks of interacting species.\n\nThe inclusion of ecological interactions in digital systems enables new research avenues: investigations using self-replicating computer programs complement laboratory efforts by broadening the breadth of viable experiments focused on the emergence and diversification of coevolving interactions in complex communities. This cross-disciplinary research program provides fertile grounds for new collaborations between computer scientists and evolutionary biologists.\n\nThe field of digital life was inspired by the rampant computer viruses of the 1980s. These viruses were self-replicating computer programs that spread from one computer to another, but they did not evolve. Steen Rasmussen was the first to include the possibility of mutation in self-replicating computer programs by extending the once-popular Core War game, where programs competed in a digital battle ground for the computer's resources. Although Rasmussen observed some interesting evolution, mutations in this early genetic programming language produced many unstable organisms, thus prohibiting scientific experiments. Just one year later, Thomas S. Ray developed an alternative system, Tierra, and performed the first successful experiments with evolving populations of self-replicating computer programs.\n\nThomas S. Ray created a genetic language similar to earlier digital systems, but added several key features that made it more suitable for evolution in his artificial life system, Tierra. Primarily, he prevented instructions from writing beyond the \"privately\" allocated memory space, thus limiting the potential for organisms writing over others. The only selective pressure in Tierra was for rapid self-replication. Over the course of evolution, this pressure led to shorter and shorter genomes, reducing the time spent copying instructions during replication. Some individuals even started executing the replication code in other organisms, allowing those \"cheaters\", which were originally referred to as parasites in Ray's work, to further shrink their genetic programs. This form of cheating was the first evolved ecological interaction between organisms in artificial life software. Ray's cheaters pre-dated the formal study of evolving ecological interactions using Tierra-like digital evolution platforms by 20 years.\n\nIn 1993, Christoph Adami, Charles Ofria, and C. Titus Brown created the artificial life platform Avida at the California Institute of Technology. They added the ability for digital organisms to obtain bonus CPU cycles for performing computational tasks, like adding two numbers together. In Avida, researchers can define the available tasks and set the consequences for organisms upon successful calculation. When organisms are rewarded with additional CPU cycles, their replication rate increases. Since Avida was designed specifically as a scientific tool, it allows users to collect a comprehensive suite of data about evolving populations. Due to its flexibility and data tracking abilities, Avida has become the most widely used digital system for studying evolution. The Devolab at the BEACON Center currently continues development of Avida.\n\nDigital organisms in Avida are self-replicating computer programs with a genome composed of assembly-like instructions. The genetic programming language in Avida contains instructions for manipulating values in registers and stacks as well as for control flow and mathematical operations. Each digital organism contains virtual hardware on which its genome is executed. To reproduce, digital organisms must copy their genome instruction by instruction into a new region of memory through a potentially noisy channel that may lead to errors (i.e., mutations). While most mutations are detrimental, mutants will occasionally have higher fitness than their parents, thereby providing the basis for natural selection with all of the necessary components for Darwinian evolution. Digital organisms can acquire random binary numbers from the environment and are able to manipulate them using their genetic instructions, including the logic instruction \"NAND\". With only this instruction, digital organisms can compute any other task by stringing together various operations because NAND is a universal logic function. If the output of processing random numbers from the environment corresponds to the result of a particular logic task, then that task is incorporated into the set of tasks the organism performs, which in turn, defines part of its phenotype.\n\nInteractions between digital organisms occur through phenotypic matching, which, in the case of task-based phenotypes, results from the performance of overlapping logic functions. Different mechanisms for mapping phenotypic matching to interactions can be implemented, depending on the antagonistic or mutualistic nature of the interaction.\n\nIn host-parasite interactions, the parasite organisms benefits at the expense of the host organisms. Parasites in Avida are implemented just like other self-replicating digital organisms, but they live inside hosts and execute parasitic threads using CPU cycles stolen from their hosts. Because parasites impose a cost (lost CPU cycles) on hosts, there is selection for resistance, and when resistance starts to spread in a population, there is selective pressure for parasites to infect those new resistant hosts. Infection occurs when both the parasite and host perform at least one overlapping task. Thus a host is resistant to a particular parasite if they do not share any tasks. This mechanism of infection mimics the inverse-gene-for-gene model, in which infection only occurs if a host susceptibility gene (the presence of a logic task) is matched by a parasite virulence gene (a parasite performing the same task). Additional infection mechanisms, such as the matching allele and gene-for-gene models, can also be implemented.\n\nIn traditional infection genetic models, host resistance and pathogen infectivity have associated costs. These costs are an important part of theory about why defense genes do not always fix rapidly within populations. Costs are also present in digital host-parasite interactions: performing more or more complex tasks implies larger genomes and hence slower reproduction. Tasks may also allow organisms access to resources present in the abiotic environment, and the environment can be carefully manipulated to control the relative costs or benefits of resistance.\n\nBy keeping track of task-based phenotypes as well as tracking information about successful infections in the community, researchers are able to perfectly reconstruct the interaction networks of digital coevolving hosts and parasites. The structure of these networks is a result of the interplay between ecological processes, mainly host abundance, and coevolutionary dynamics, which lead to changes in host specificity.\n\nInteractions in which both species obtain mutual benefit, such as those between flowering plants and pollinators, and birds and fleshy fruits, can be implemented in evolving digital experiments by following the same task matching approach used for host-parasite interactions, but using free-living organisms instead of parasitic threads. For example, one way to set up a plant-pollinator type of interaction is to use an environment containing two mutually exclusive resources: one designated for \"plant\" organisms and one for \"pollinator\" organisms. Similar to parasites attempting infection, if tasks overlap between a pollinator and a plant it visits, pollination is successful and both organisms obtain extra CPU cycles. Thus, these digital organisms obtain mutual benefit when they perform at least one common task, and more common tasks lead to larger mutual benefits. While this is one specific way to enable mutualistic interactions, many others are possible in Avida. Interactions that begin as parasitic may even evolve to be mutualistic under the right conditions. In most cases, coevolution will result in concurrent interactions between multiple phenotypes. Thus, observed networks of mutualistic interactions can inform our understanding about the outcomes and processes of coevolution in complex communities.\n\nWhile host-parasite and mutualistic interactions are determined by task-based phenotypes, predator-prey interactions are determined by behavior. Predators are digital organisms that have evolved from ancestral prey phenotypes to locate, attack, and consume organisms. When a predator executes an attack instruction (acquired through mutation), it kills a neighboring organism. When predators kill prey, they gain resources required for reproduction (e.g., CPU cycles) proportional to the level accumulated by the consumed prey. Selection favors behavioral strategies in prey that enable them to avoid being eaten. At the same time, selection favors predators with behavioral strategies that improve their food finding and prey attacking abilities. The resulting diversity in the continuously evolving behavioral phenotypes creates dynamic predator-prey interaction networks in which selective forces are constantly changing as a consequence of the emergence of new, and loss of old, behaviors. Because predators and prey move around in and use information about their environment, these experiments are typically carried out using spatially structured populations. On the other hand, host-parasite and mutualistic coevolution are often done in well-mixed environments, though the choice of the environment is at the discretion of the experimenter.\n\nUnderstanding how biodiversity is organized in natural ecosystems requires going beyond the study of pairs of interacting species. Using digital organisms, one can find generalities about the evolutionary and ecological processes shaping the web of interactions among species, as well as the coevolutionary processes embedded within these networks. By tracing the evolution of digital communities and their ecological networks, researchers obtain perfect \"fossil records\" of how the number and patterns of links among interacting phenotypes evolved.\n\nThe stability-diversity debate is a long-standing debate about whether more diverse ecological networks are also more stable. Until recently, this debate has focused on one component of biodiversity: species diversity. However, newer research has begun dealing with another component of biodiversity: diversity in species interactions. Mathematical models show that a mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions can stabilize population dynamics and that the loss of one interaction type may critically destabilize ecosystems. Studies with digital organisms can shed light on this debate from an empirical perspective because the types of interactions included can be manipulated and the stability of the resulting evolving digital ecological network can be measured.\n\nEqually addressable using evolving digital ecological networks are many of the open questions concerning the coevolution of ecological interactions in multispecies communities. For example, do coevolutionary dynamics change as communities become richer? Is there any limit to their richness? Is the evolution of interactions between multispecies networks historically contingent? Why do some ecological scenarios lead to predictable network structures and others do not? Do genetic constraints play a large role in the evolution of ecological networks? These are only a few of many open questions concerning the coevolution of ecological interactions in multispecies communities.\n\nThese and many related questions require researchers to look across the evolutionary history of ecological network formation. For natural systems, those data are very difficult to collect. With digital organisms, watching both the coevolutionary process and ecological network formation is possible in real time. Data on the abundance of interacting phenotypes are recorded without error, hence the evolutionary implications of ecological processes can be explored in-depth.\n\nThe study of self-replicating and evolving computer programs offers a tantalizing glimpse into the evolution of interactions among organisms that do not share any ancestry with biochemical life of Earth. This comes with potential caveats in translating predictions of evolving digital networks to biological ones because mechanistic details differ substantially between interacting digital organisms and interacting biological organisms. Nevertheless, these digital networks contain the necessary components for ongoing coevolutionary dynamics in large webs of interacting organisms. In spite of the differences between biological and digital evolution, the study of evolving digital ecological networks can lead to a more predictive understanding of natural dynamics. Because the general operational processes (e.g., Darwinian evolution, mutualism, parasitism) do not differ, studies utilizing digital networks can uncover rules operating on and within ecological networks. Together with microbial experiments, they create opportunities for furthering the understanding of the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes among interacting species.\n"}

With respect to the universe, existential nihilism suggests that a single human or even the entire human species is insignificant, without purpose and unlikely to change in the totality of existence. According to the theory, each individual is an isolated being born into the universe, barred from knowing \"why\", yet compelled to invent meaning. The inherent meaninglessness of life is largely explored in the philosophical school of existentialism, where one can potentially create their own subjective \"meaning\" or \"purpose\". Of all types of nihilism, existential nihilism has received the most literary and philosophical attention.\n\nThe idea that meaning and values are without foundation is a form of nihilism, and the existential response to that idea is noting that meaning is not \"a matter of contemplative theory,\" but instead, \"a consequence of engagement and commitment.\"\n\nJean-Paul Sartre wrote in his essay \"Existentialism and Humanism\", \"What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards. If man as the existentialist sees him as not definable, it is because to begin with he is nothing. He will not be anything until later, and then he will be what he makes of himself.\" Here it is made clear what is meant by Existentialists when they say meaning is \"a consequence of engagement and commitment\".\n\nThe theory purports to describe the human situation to create a life outlook and create meaning, which has been summarized as, \"Strut, fret, and delude ourselves as we may, our lives are of no significance, and it is futile to seek or to affirm meaning where none can be found.\" Existential nihilists claim that, to be honest, one must face the absurdity of existence, that he/she will eventually die, and that both religion and metaphysics are simply results of the fear of death.\n\nAccording to Donald A. Crosby, \"There is no justification for life, but also no reason not to live. Those who claim to find meaning in their lives are either dishonest or deluded. In either case, they fail to face up to the harsh reality of the human situations\".\n\nExistential nihilism has been a part of the Western intellectual tradition since the Cyrenaics, such as Hegesias of Cyrene. During the Renaissance, William Shakespeare eloquently summarized the existential nihilist's perspective through Macbeth's mindset in the end of the eponymous play. Arthur Schopenhauer, Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche further expanded on these ideas, and Nietzsche, particularly, has become a major figure in existential nihilism.\n\nThe atheistic existentialist movement spread in 1940s France. Jean-Paul Sartre's \"Being and Nothingness\" and Albert Camus' \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" discussed the topic. Camus wrote further works, such as \"The Stranger\", \"Caligula\", \"The Plague\", \"The Fall\" and \"The Rebel\". Other figures include Martin Heidegger and Jacques Derrida. In addition, Ernest Becker's Pulitzer Prize winning life's work \"The Denial of Death\" is a collection of thoughts on existential nihilism.\n\n"}

Sustainability of an ageing society depends upon our effectiveness in creating technological environments, including assistive technology and inclusive design, for innovative and independent living and social participation of older adults in any state of health, comfort and safety. In short, gerontechnology concerns matching technological environments to health, housing, mobility, communication, leisure and work of older people. Research outcomes form the basis for designers, builders, engineers, manufacturers, and those in the health professions (nursing, medicine, gerontology, geriatrics, environmental psychology, developmental psychology, etc.), to provide an optimum living environment for the widest range of ages.\n\nGerontechnology, which has also been called gerotechnology is considered an adjunct to the promotion of human health and well-being. It pertains to both human development and aging with the aim to compress morbidity and to increase vitality and quality of life throughout the life-span. It creates solutions to extend the working phase in society by maximizing the vital and productive years in the later years of life, which consequently reduces the cost of care.\n\nThe overall framework of gerontechnology may be seen as a matrix of domains of human activity: (1) health & self-esteem, housing & activities of daily living, communication & governance, mobility & transport, work & leisure, and (2) technology interventions or impact levels (enhancement & satisfaction, prevention & engagement, compensation & assistance, care and care organisation). Underpinning all these elements are generic and applied evidence-based research. Such research supports the development of products and services.\n\nGerontechnology has much in common with other interdisciplinary domains, such as Assistive Technology (for the compensation & assistance and the care support & care organisation rows of the matrix), and Universal Design for the development of all products and services pertaining to gerontechnology.\n\nGerontological design focuses on providing effective solutions to improve the way of life for aging people, through gerontological knowledge and design research methods to obtain a better understanding of individuals' preferences and requirements.\n\nGerontological design also refers specifically to the study and practice of building design methods that support elderly users in the built environment. Some universities host professors, commonly in architecture or interior design departments, that specialize in the study and teaching of this design specialization. Not only does this include the examination of building design characteristics that impact older adults' physiological well-being, but it can also include the investigation of building design characteristics that impact informational needs (i.e. finding one's way around in a space) or social interaction needs (Campbell, 2012).\n\nBetween 2008 and 2030, Singapore will witness an age profile shift in its population's history. In 2005, one in 12 residents was 65 years or older. By 2030, one in five residents will be 65 years or older. Studies show that in 2002, 7% of the world's population is aged 65 and above. By 2050, it is envisaged that the percentage could rise to nearly 17%. The aging population and its impact on economics, politics, education and lifestyle is no longer an isolated issue but a global concern. Products and services relevant to the \"silver industry\" or the \"mature market\" increasingly abound in the marketplace. The demand for designers with a keen sense for the aging population's needs who employ gerontological design process knowledge concomitantly rises.\n\nAn international academic journal with delayed open-access, Gerontechnology , is published by the International Society for Gerontechnology (ISG) .\n\nA comprehensive edited book \"Gerontechnology\" has been published in 2016.\n\n The first ISG Masterclass for PhD students in 2006 produced a scheme to support gerontechnological research.\n\n\n"}

He has been head coach of Sogndal, Tromsø, Brann, Haugesund, Vålerenga and Aalesund, and has also served as an assistant coach for the Norwegian national football team.\n\nAabrekk made his debut for Sogndal in 1974 in the Norwegian Second Division (the third tier of Norwegian football). Except for a short spell at SK Brann, where he played a match in the Tippeligaen (the top division) in 1978, he played for Sogndal throughout his career and was a major contributor to their promotion to the Norwegian First Division in 1981. He scored Sogndal's first goal in that division, against Molde in 1982. He played a total of 133 league games from 1973 to 1982, including 22 matches in the First Division in 1982.\n\nAabrekk started his coaching career in his home county, Sogn og Fjordane, at lower-league clubs Eid, Sandane, and Stryn, before becoming head coach of Sogndal. In 1990, his first season with them, Sogndal was promoted to the Tippeligaen in spite of a 5–0 loss against Bryne in their first home match. He then served as head coach of Tromsø in the Tippeligaen from 1993 to 1995.\n\nIn 1995, during a match against Bodø/Glimt, Aabrekk tried to stall for time by acting as if he were injured after he was run down by Bodø/Glimt's physiotherapist Truls Karlsen. Although uninjured, he was taken by ambulance to hospital. In an interview with \"Verdens Gang\", he excused his behavior by saying, \"I felt I was lying on the ground a bit too long, and I did not dare to get up so I stayed on the ground. I lay there and was thinking, 'What's going on?' It was not planned, and it was definitely not very smart. I would rather call it a blackout.\" This episode, according to the Norwegian newspaper \"Dagbladet\", was the third worst case of acting in the history of football.\n\nAabrekk later worked for the Football Association of Norway as a coordinator for youth development in Western Norway. He also served as Nils Johan Semb's assistant coach for the Norwegian under-21 team from 1992 to 1998, and when Semb succeeded Egil Olsen as head coach of the Norwegian national team in 1998, Aabrekk became assistant coach of the national senior team. At the same time, he worked as Kjell Tennfjord's assistant in Brann, and in the summer of 1998 he became their head coach. After leading Brann to the finals of the 1999 Norwegian Cup, where they lost 2–0 against Rosenborg, he received a one-year leave of absence to work full-time as assistant coach of the national team during their preparations for the UEFA Euro 2000 football championship. He resigned from his job at Brann without returning, because Brann had already hired Teitur Thordarson as their head coach and offered Aabrekk a position in their youth department, a job Brann claimed it was impossible to combine with the position of assistant coach of the national team.\n\nIn 2002 Aabrekk joined Sogndal as Torbjørn Glomnes's assistant coach and saved the team from relegation. On 17 September 2002 Haugesund announced that Aabrekk would join them as head coach on 1 December. In a match against Start on 19 October 2003, Aabrekk told referee Bjørn Hansen that he was \"bought and paid for\" twice after Aabrekk was dismissed from the bench. He was at Haugesund until the end of the 2005 season, when he joined Vålerenga's coaching staff along with Egil Olsen and Petter Myhre. On 27 July 2007 Myhre resigned as head coach of Vålerenga and Aabrekk was appointed head coach as caretaker. Following two wins and a draw in the next three matches, Vålerenga gave him the job until the end of the season.\n\nIn 2008 Aabrekk was hired by Brann as a scout. Halfway through the season, the club wanted Aabrekk and the assistant coach, Espen Steffensen, to switch jobs. Steffensen did not accept this and was fired, and Aabrekk became the new assistant coach of Brann, against the wishes of head coach Mons Ivar Mjelde. Following Brann's bad performances and local press criticism of the lack of cooperation between Mjelde and Aabrekk, Mjelde announced on 7 October 2008 that he would resign as head coach at the end of the season. At the same time, the club announced that Aabrekk would return immediately to his job as scout, a position he kept until the contract expired.\n\nAabrekk was then hired as head coach of his old club, Sogndal from 1 January 2010, succeeding Karl Oskar Emberland. In his first season there, the team won promotion to the Tippeligaen, and in the next they avoided relegation. Following the 2011 season, Aabrekk retired.

It was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white cells. The universality of Langton's ant was proven in 2000. The idea has been generalized in several different ways, such as turmites which add more colors and more states.\n\nSquares on a plane are colored variously either black or white. We arbitrarily identify one square as the \"ant\". The ant can travel in any of the four cardinal directions at each step it takes. The \"ant\" moves according to the rules below:\n\nLangton's ant can also be described as a cellular automaton, where the grid is colored black or white and the \"ant\" square has one of eight different colors assigned to encode the combination of black/white state and the current direction of motion of the ant.\n\nThese simple rules lead to complex behavior. Three distinct modes of behavior are apparent, when starting on a completely white grid.\n\n\nAll finite initial configurations tested eventually converge to the same repetitive pattern, suggesting that the \"highway\" is an attractor of Langton's ant, but no one has been able to prove that this is true for all such initial configurations. It is only known that the ant's trajectory is always unbounded regardless of the initial configuration – this is known as the Cohen–Kung theorem.\n\nIn 2000, Gajardo et al. showed a construction that calculates any boolean circuit using the trajectory of a single instance of Langton's ant. Additionally, it would be possible to simulate an arbitrary Turing machine using the ant's trajectory for computation. This means that the ant is capable of universal computation.\n\nGreg Turk and Jim Propp considered a simple extension to Langton's ant where instead of just two colors, more colors are used. The colors are modified in a cyclic fashion. A simple naming scheme is used: for each of the successive colors, a letter \"L\" or \"R\" is used to indicate whether a left or right turn should be taken. Langton's ant has the name \"RL\" in this naming scheme.\n\nSome of these extended Langton's ants produce patterns that become symmetric over and over again. One of the simplest examples is the ant \"RLLR\". One sufficient condition for this to happen is that the ant's name, seen as a cyclic list, consists of consecutive pairs of identical letters \"LL\" or \"RR\" (the term \"cyclic list\" indicates that the last letter may pair with the first one). The proof involves Truchet tiles.\n\nThe hexagonal grid permits up to six different rotations, which are notated here as N (no change), R1 (60° clockwise), R2 (120° clockwise), U (180°), L2 (120° counter-clockwise), L1 (60° counter-clockwise).\n\nA further extension of Langton's ants is to consider multiple states of the Turing machine – as if the ant itself has a color that can change. These ants are called turmites, a contraction of \"Turing machine termites\". Common behaviours include the production of highways, chaotic growth and spiral growth.\n\nMultiple Langton's ants can co-exist on the 2D plane, and their interactions give rise to complex, higher-order automata that collectively build a wide variety of organized structures. There is no need for conflict resolution, as every ant sitting on the same square wants to make the same change to the tape. There is a YouTube video showing these multiple ant interactions.\n\nMultiple turmites can co-exist on the 2D plane as long as there is a rule for what happens when they meet. Ed Pegg, Jr. considered ants that can turn for example \"both\" left and right, splitting in two and annihilating each other when they meet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1301827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1301827", "title": "Last universal common ancestor", "text": "Last universal common ancestor\n\nThe last universal common ancestor (LUCA), also called the last universal ancestor (LUA), cenancestor, or (incorrectly) progenote, is the most recent population of organisms from which all organisms now living on Earth have a common descent. LUCA is the most recent common ancestor of all current life on Earth. LUCA is not thought to be the first living organism on Earth, but only one of many early organisms, whereas the others became extinct. \n\nWhile there is no specific fossil evidence of LUCA, it can be studied by comparing the genomes of its descendants, all organisms living today. By this means, a 2016 study identified a set of 355 genes inferred to have been present in LUCA. This would imply it was already a complex life form with many co-adapted features, including transcription and translation mechanisms to convert information between DNA, RNA, and proteins. However, some of those genes could have developed later and spread universally by horizontal gene transfer between archaea and bacteria.\n\nLUCA is estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago in the Paleoarchean era, a few hundred million years after the earliest evidence of life on Earth, for which there are several candidates. Microbial mat fossils have been found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone from Western Australia, while biogenic graphite has been found in 3.7 billion-year-old metamorphized sedimentary rocks from Western Greenland. Recent studies have tentatively proposed evidence of life as early as 4.28 billion years ago.\n\nCharles Darwin proposed the theory of universal common descent through an evolutionary process in his book \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859, saying, \"Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.\" Later biologists have separated the problem of the origin of life from that of the LUCA.\n\nBy analysis of the presumed LUCA's offspring groups, the LUCA appears to have been a small, single-celled organism. It likely had a ring-shaped coil of DNA floating freely within the cell, like modern bacteria. Morphologically, it would likely not have stood out within a mixed population of small modern-day bacteria. However, Carl Woese \"et al.\", who first proposed the currently-used three domain system based on an analysis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, stated that in its genetic machinery, the LUCA would have been a \"...simpler, more rudimentary entity than the individual ancestors that spawned the three [domains] (and their descendants)\".\n\nWhile the gross anatomy of LUCA can only be reconstructed with much uncertainty, its biochemical mechanisms can be described in some detail, based on the properties currently shared by all independently living organisms on Earth.\n\nThe genetic code was most likely based on DNA, though some studies suggest that LUCA may have been defined wholly through RNA. If DNA was present, it was composed exclusively of four nucleotides: deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine, deoxythymidine, and deoxyguanosine. The DNA was kept double-stranded by a template-dependent enzyme, DNA polymerase. The integrity of the DNA benefited from a group of maintenance and repair enzymes including DNA topoisomerase and DNA ligase. The DNA was also protected by DNA-binding proteins such as histones. The genetic code was composed of 64 three-nucleotide codons which redundantly coded for 20 amino acids.\nIf the code was DNA-based, its genetic code was expressed via single-stranded RNA intermediates. The RNA was produced by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase using nucleotides similar to those of DNA, with the exception that the DNA nucleotide thymidine was replaced by uridine in RNA.\n\nThe genetic code was expressed into proteins. These were assembled from free amino acids by translation of a messenger RNA via a mechanism of ribosomes, transfer RNAs, and a group of related proteins. The ribosomes were composed of two subunits, a big 50S and a small 30S. Each ribosomal subunit was composed of a core of ribosomal RNA surrounded by ribosomal proteins. Both types of RNA molecules (ribosomal and transfer RNAs) played an important role in the catalytic activity of the ribosomes. Only 20 amino acids were used, only in L-isomers, to the exclusion of countless other amino acids. ATP served as an energy intermediate. Several hundred protein enzymes catalyzed chemical reactions to extract energy from fats, sugars, and amino acids, and to synthesize fats, sugars, amino acids, and nucleic acid bases through various chemical pathways.\n\nThe cell contained a water-based cytoplasm effectively enclosed by a lipid bilayer membrane. The cell tended to exclude sodium and concentrate potassium by means of specific ion transporters (or ion pumps). The cell multiplied by duplicating all its contents followed by cellular division.\nThe cell used chemiosmosis to produce energy. It also reduced CO and oxidized H (methanogenesis or acetogenesis) via acetyl-thioesters.\n\nThe LUCA probably lived in the high-temperature conditions found in deep sea vents caused by ocean water interacting with magma beneath the ocean floor.\n\nIn 1859, Charles Darwin published \"On the Origin of Species\" in which he twice stated the hypothesis that there was only one progenitor for all life forms. In the summation he states, \"Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.\" The very last sentence begins with a restatement of the hypothesis: \"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one...\"\n\nWhen the LUCA was hypothesized, cladograms based on genetic distance between living cells indicated that Archaea split early from the rest of life. This was inferred from the fact that the archaeans known at that time were highly resistant to environmental extremes such as high salinity, temperature or acidity, leading some scientists to suggest that the LUCA evolved in areas like the deep ocean vents, where such extremes prevail today. Archaea, however, were later discovered in less hostile environments, and are now believed to be more closely related to the Eukaryota than to the Bacteria, although many details are still unknown.\n\nIn 2010, based on \"the vast array of molecular sequences now available from all domains of life,\" a formal test of universal common ancestry was published. The formal test favored the existence of a universal common ancestor over a wide class of alternative hypotheses that included horizontal gene transfer. Basic biochemical principles make it overwhelmingly likely that all organisms do have a single common ancestor. It is extremely unlikely that organisms descended from separate incidents of cell-formation would be able to complete a horizontal gene transfer without garbling each other's genes, converting them into noncoding segments. Further, many more amino acids are chemically possible than the twenty found in modern protein molecules. These lines of chemical evidence, incorporated into the formal statistical test point to a single cell having been the LUCA. While the test overwhelmingly favored the existence of a single LUCA, this does not imply that the LUCA was ever alone: instead, it was one of many early microbes but the only one whose descendents survived beyond the Paleoarchean Era. \n\nWith the later gene pool of the LUCA's descendants, with their common framework of the AT/GC rule and the standard twenty amino acids, horizontal gene transfer would have been feasible and could have been very common.\n\nIn an earlier hypothesis, Carl Woese (1988) had proposed that: (1) no individual organism can be considered a LUCA, and (2) the genetic heritage of all modern organisms derived through horizontal gene transfer among an ancient community of organisms. While the results described by Theobald (2010) and Saey (2010) demonstrate the existence of a single LUCA, Woese's argument can still be applied to Ur-organisms (initial products of abiogenesis) before the LUCA. At the beginnings of life, ancestry was not as linear as it is today because the genetic code had not evolved. Before high fidelity replication, organisms could not be easily mapped on a phylogenetic tree. However, the LUCA lived after the origin of the genetic code and at least some rudimentary early form of molecular proofreading.\n\nThe most commonly accepted tree of life, based on several molecular studies, has its root between a monophyletic domain Bacteria and a clade formed by Archaea and Eukaryota. However, a very small minority of studies place the root in the domain Bacteria, either in the phylum Firmicutes or state that the phylum Chloroflexi is basal to a clade with Archaea and Eukaryotes and the rest of Bacteria (as proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith).\n\nGround-breaking research by William F. Martin (2016) genetically analyzed 6.1 million protein-coding genes and 286,514 protein clusters from sequenced prokaryotic genomes of various phylogenetic trees, and identified 355 protein clusters that were probably common to the LUCA. The results \"depict LUCA as anaerobic, CO-fixing, H-dependent with a Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (the reductive acetyl-coenzyme A pathway), N-fixing and thermophilic. LUCA's biochemistry was replete with FeS clusters and radical reaction mechanisms.\" The cofactors also reveal \"dependence upon transition metals, ﬂavins, S-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A, ferredoxin, molybdopterin, corrins and selenium. Its genetic code required nucleoside modifications and S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylations.\" The results are \"quite specific\": they show that methanogenic clostria was a basal clade in the 355 lineages examined, and that the LUCA may therefore have inhabited an anaerobic hydrothermal vent setting in a geochemically active environment rich in H, CO, and iron. \n\nThese findings could mean that life on Earth originated in such hydrothermal vents, but it is also possible that life was restricted to such locations at some later time, perhaps by the Late Heavy Bombardment. The identification of these genes as being present in LUCA has also been criticized, as they may simply represent later genes which migrated via horizontal gene transfers between archaea and bacteria.\n"}

Griffin studied the trumpet and has a BA in Music from Morehead State University as well as an advanced degree in music from North Texas State University. Before becoming MC 900 Ft. Jesus, Griffin played in local Dallas bands The Telefones and Lithium X-Mas.\n\n\"Hell with the Lid Off\" (1990) was Griffin's first full-length release for MC 900 Ft. Jesus as well as the first time Griffin had appeared on a major record label. Featuring DJ Zero (Patrick Rollins) and the single \"Truth is Out of Style\" which gained a cult following.\n\nThe following year \"Welcome to My Dream\" (1991) was released. DJ Zero appears on \"Welcome to My Dream\" under his real name, Patrick Rollins, because of uncertainty about whether he would have been able to tour in support of the album. His subsequent single, \"The City Sleeps\", was featured in the album in which explored the mind of a serial arsonist. The song sparked controversy in Baltimore when a then ABC affiliate, WJZ, ran a report suggesting that a series of arson in the area was a result of WHFS allowing the song play time.\n\nHis final album, \"One Step Ahead of the Spider\", was released in 1994; it contained the single \"If I Only Had a Brain\", which became his best-known song. The song gained increased exposure from the music video directed for it by Spike Jonze, as well as exposure on MTV's \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" cartoon show. Rollins once again appears but is not listed in the credits.\n\nGriffin eventually became disillusioned with the music industry, and following unproductive sessions for his fourth album, felt he had taken his style of music as far as he wanted to go and overall losing interest in music citing alcoholism. Record label interest waned and eventually in 2001, Griffin officially retired. \nNeeding a new direction, he gained his commercial pilot's license, hoping to become a flight instructor. However, when the September 11 attacks occurred, demand plummeted for flight instructors and Griffin was unable to find a job. Eventually, Griffin took a job at a Borders bookstore.\n\nIn 2007, he began DJing weekly at a Dallas music venue, Lee Harvey's, located in the Cedars neighborhood next to downtown.\n\nOn November 26, 2016, Griffin announced via Facebook that he was set to perform a show at The Kessler Theater in Dallas with a quartet including Chris McGuire, Greg Beck, and Wanz Dover in hopes of kick-starting a tour as well as a possible fourth album with his former label Nettwerk of which had approached Griffin about. On February 3, 2017, the quartet played a sold-out concert performing several of the MC 900 songs, receiving a rapturous ovation.\n\nGriffin's stage name came from a sermon by Oral Roberts, in which the televangelist claimed that he had received a vision of a Jesus, who commanded him to build a hospital on the campus of Oral Roberts University.\n\n\n\n"}

Its flesh is pleasant-tasting, and anyone who eats it will attain remarkable longevity. However, catching a \"ningyo\" was believed to bring storms and misfortune, so fishermen who caught these creatures were said to throw them back into the sea. A \"ningyo\" washed onto the beach was an omen of war or calamity.\n\nOne of the most famous folk stories concerning \"ningyo\" is called or Happyaku Bikuni. The story tells how a fisherman who lived in Wakasa Province once caught an unusual fish. In all his years fishing, he had never seen anything like it, so he invited his friends over to sample its meat. \n\nOne of the guests, however, peeked into the kitchen, noticed that the head of this fish had a human face, and warned the others not to eat it. So when the fisherman finished cooking and offered his guests the \"ningyo's\" grilled flesh, they secretly wrapped it in paper and hid it on their persons so that it could be discarded on the way home. \n\nBut one man, drunk on \"sake\", forgot to throw the strange fish away.

Their ability and motivation to mate are primarily independent of day-length (photoperiod) and instead rely on cues from short-term changes in local conditions like rainfall, food abundance and temperature. Another factor is the presence of suitable breeding sites, which may only form with heavy rain or other environmental changes.\n\nThus, they are distinct from seasonal breeders that rely on changes in day length to induce entry into estrus and to cue mating, and continuous breeders like humans that can mate year-round. Other categories of breeders that perhaps can be subdivided under the heading \"opportunistic\" have been used to describe many species, such as many that are anurans like frogs. These include sporadic wet and sporadic dry, describing animals that breed sporadically not always under favorable conditions of rain or lack thereof.\n\nMany opportunistic breeders are non-mammals. Those that are mammals tend to be small rodents.\n\nSince changes in season can coincide with favorable changes in environment, the distinction between seasonal breeder and opportunistic can be muddled. In equatorial climes, the change in seasons is not always perceptible and thus, changes in day length not remarkable. Thus, the tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus) previously categorized as a seasonal breeder is now suspected to be an opportunistic breeder.\n\nAdditionally, opportunists can have qualities of seasonal breeders. The red crossbill exhibits a preference (not a requirement) for long-day seasonality, but requires other factors, especially food abundance and social interactions, in order to breed. Conversely, food availability by itself incompletely promotes reproductive development.\n\nOpportunistic breeders are typically capable of breeding at any time or becoming fertile within a short period of time. An example is the golden spiny mouse where changes in dietary salt in its desert habitat due to rainfall appear to cue reproductive function. Increased levels of salinity in drying vegetation cause females to experience a reproductive hiatus.\n\nWhile reproduction is generally independent of photoperiod, animals can still experience reduced fertility with changes in day-length.\n\n\n\nFrogs and toads including:\n\n"}
{"id": "55362208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55362208", "title": "Ovarian follicle activation", "text": "Ovarian follicle activation\n\nOvarian follicle activation can be defined as primordial follicles in the ovary moving from a quiescent (inactive) to a growing phase. The primordial follicle in the oocyte is what makes up the “pool” of follicles that will be induced to enter growth and developmental changes that change them into pre-ovulatory follicles, ready to be released during ovulation. The process of development from a primordial follicle to a pre-ovulatory follicle is called folliculogenesis.\n\nActivation of the primordial follicle involves the following: a morphological change from flattened to cuboidal granulosa cells, proliferation of granulosa cells, formation of the protective zona pellucida layer, and growth of the oocyte.\n\nIt is widely understood that androgens act primarily on preantral follicles and that this activity is important for preantral follicle growth. Additionally, it is thought that androgens are involved in primordial follicle activation. However, the influence of androgens on primordial follicle recruitment and whether this response is primary or secondary is still uncertain.\n\nPrimordial follicles are activated to grow into antral follicles. Communication between the oocytes and the surrounding somatic cells, such as the granulosa cells and the theca cells, is involved in the control of primordial follicle activation. There are various activator signalling pathways that are involved in the control of ovarian follicle activation, including: Neurotropin, nerve growth factor (NGF) and its tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK1), neurotrophin 4 (NT4), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and their receptor NTRK2. Additional ligands have a role in facilitating primordial follicle activation such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B), growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) and bone morphogenic protein 15 (BMP15).\n\nFollicular activation rate is increased in experiments where recombinant GDF9 is added. Additionally, in vitro addition of GDF9 to human ovarian cortical tissue causes enhanced activation and follicular survival. Removing GDF9 from mice, through knock-out experiments, halts follicle progression beyond the first stage, and prevents granulosa cell proliferation. However, these GDF9 null mice have accelerated oocyte growth, suggesting that GDF9 is partially responsible for granulosa cell recruitment, as well as inhibiting oocyte growth. GDF9 promotes follicular survival and growth as a result of dampened granulosa apoptosis and follicular atresia.\n\nAs discussed above TGF-β ligands, for example BMP4 and 7 have a role in follicular activation. SMADS are downstream molecules of the TGF-β signalling pathway, hence rely on TGF-β for activation. In the absence of SMADs, mice have decreased folliculogenesis, with decreased quantities of primordial follicles, as well as developed adult follicles at both developmental stages. BMP15 has been shown to stimulate granulosa cell growth by encouraging proliferation of undifferentiated granulosa cells. This is not dependent on FSH. It was shown that two proliferation markers, Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), are regulated by these factors. Additionally, PCNA has been suggested to act as a key regulator of ovarian follicle development. The temporal expression of PCNA in oocytes is coincident with the start of primordial follicle formation. PCNA promotes apoptosis of oocytes, which regulates primordial follicle assembly.\n\nAnother molecule that has been implicated in the activation of oocyte follicles is Forkhead boxL2 (Foxl2). In knock out studies, it has been shown that Foxl2 may be responsible for the cuboidal transition of the pre-granulosa cells. Hence, when Foxl2 is removed, the primordial follicles are unable to develop into secondary follicles.\n\nSpermatogenesis-and-oogenesis-specific basic helix-loop-helix containing protein 1 (Sohlh1) is expressed within germ cell clusters and in new primordial follicles. Knock out studies of this protein in mice show a reduced number of oocytes present at 7 weeks post birth and a malfunction in the transition from primordial to primary follicle.\n\nPhosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumour suppressor gene whose actions directly affect the activation of primordial follicles. It does this by negatively controlling the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This particular action of PTEN was initially discovered in an experiment using PTEN knockout mice. The absence of PTEN within the primordial follicles lead to an increase in AKT phosphorylation. This then creates a subsequent rise in FOXO3 export, as AKT is no longer inhibiting its production. This led to over-activation of the primordial follicles, which resulted in a premature decline of the primordial follicle pool.\n\nWhen Foxo3 is KO in mice models a huge uncontrolled activation of follicles is seen thus the mouse ovaries are deficient of the entire pool of primordial follicles because they have been prematurely activated. This action is regulated by phosphorylation, the unphosphorylated form is transcriptionally active in the nucleus. However, when phosphorylation occurs the protein is transported to the cytoplasm and loses its transcriptional activity. Pelosi et al. noted that the timing and level of the Foxo3 expression is very important to regulate ovarian follicle activation.\n\nAKt- PTEN-AKt and Foxo3 are all involved in the same pathway. PTEN is situated upstream of AKt. Therefore, if PTEN is deleted specifically from an oocyte this causes an increase in AKt activity resulting in large numbers of dormant ovarian follicles resuming their growth and differentiation. The TSC complex also plays an important role in this pathways by suppressing the activity of mTOR which has been proven to be essential for maintaining dormancy.\n\nTuberin/tuberous sclerosis complex is also thought to be important in the regulation of primordial follicle activation. TSC negatively controls the function of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). TSC knockout mice have a raised level of mTORC1 activity. Suppressing mTORC1 is a necessary process to prevent primordial follicles from being prematurely activated and therefore premature ovarian insufficiency.\n\nAMH (Anti-mullerian Hormone) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), that has a very important role in regulating both testicular and ovarian function. In the first instance AMH inhibits the initial enrollment of the resting primordial follicles. Secondly AMH prevents the regulation of preantral/small antral follicle growth by reducing their responsiveness to FSH.\n\nP27 inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase by preventing the action of cyclin E-Cdk2. Due to its’ important role in the cell cycle, it is found within the nucleus of mice oocytes in primordial and primary follicles. During puberty of p27 knock out mice, all primordial follicles are activated and leads to POF. This indicates that p27 is a vital regulator in maintaining a quiescent state in primordial follicles.\n\nPremature ovarian failure (POF), or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), is a female reproductive disorder characterised by at least 4 months of primary or secondary amenorrhea, before the age of 40. It is caused by either a decrease in the primordial follicle pool, accelerated atresia of follicles or altered maturation or recruitment of primordial follicles and is associated with menopausal levels of follicle stimulating hormones, exceeding 40 Ul/L. Specific activator and suppressor genes are implicated in ovarian follicle activation and recent research suggests that POF may be the consequence of a genetic mutation in one or more of these genes.\n\nFOXL2 - FOXL2 knockout mouse models showed failure of granulosa cell differentiation, which led to the premature activation and depletion of primordial follicles, characteristic of POF. Two different variations of mutations in the FOXL2 gene, which cause different forms of POF, one with earlier onset and the other with later onset and incomplete penetrance, have been identified. Additionally, mutations in the FOXL2 gene have been found in approximately 5% of nonsyndromic POF patients, which suggests that FOXL2 mutations are also associated with idiopathic POF.\n\nBMP15 and GDF9 - Mutations in BMP15 and GDF9 genes can be involved in POF, but are not major causes of the disease. For example, low GDF9 mutation frequency has been found in a large cohort of Indian cases of POF.\n\nSOHLH1 - Little is known about the causative association of SOHLH1 and POF, however three novel SOHLH1 variants have been found to potentially cause the disease and when studied, they were absent in controls.\n\nAMH - A decrease in AMH expression in POF antral follicles leads to defective antral development.\n\nmTORC1 and PI3K - Deregulation of mTORC1 and PI3K signaling pathways in oocytes results in ovarian pathological conditions, including POF and subsequent infertility.\n\nPTEN - Studies of mice with a deletion in PTEN in the oocytes showed early activation of the entire pool of primordial follicles, leading to a lack of primordial follicles in adulthood, resulting in a POF phenotype.\n\nFoxo3a - Studies into mice with complete and partial Foxo3a deletions also showed premature activation of the entire primordial follicle pool, destroying the ovarian reserve and leading to oocyte death. This led to a POF phenotype, seen in studies in a range of countries.\n\nTSC - In the oocytes of Tsc2 knockout mice, elevated mTORC1 activity causes the pool of primordial follicles to become activated prematurely. This results in follicle depletion in early adulthood, causing POF.\n\nAs well as having many genetic causes, premature ovarian failure has been shown to be a side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents. The damage suffered by ovaries appears to be dose-dependent, and a class of chemotherapy drugs known as alkylating agents, seem to cause the most damage to the ovary and follicles. There are two ways in which this damage occurs:\nChemotherapeutic agents, such as Cyclophosphamide, have been shown to activate the PI3K/PTEN/Akr pathway, which is the main pathway involved in keeping the follicles dormant and permitting them to grow - activation of this pathway encourages more primordial follicles to grow and develop. These growing follicles may then be destroyed in subsequent rounds of chemotherapy, which often target growing cells, which will then cause more primordial follicles to differentiate and grow to replace the destroyed cells. This concept, known as burnout, leads to a depletion of the ovarian reserve and results in premature ovarian failure.\n\nOocyte cryopreservation is a preservative process which can be used as a way of preserving fertility in children treated for childhood or adolescent cancer, and to avoid the damage caused to the ovaries caused by cytotoxic drugs often used in chemotherapy. There are several methods of cryopreservation, each with different levels of effectiveness. After cryopreservation, the ovarian tissue must be placed back into the patient, in order to allow the ovary to function normally again and regain fertility.\n\nRestoration of the ovarian function occurs in almost all cases of cryopreservation, but it takes a while for the ovarian follicles to regain full function. In all cases of successful function restoration, it took 3.5-6.5 months after reimplantation before a rise in oestrogen, a key hormone produced by the ovary, and a decrease in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were detected. The variation in time difference may be due to differences in the follicular reserves in the women at the time of cryopreservation.\n"}

In animals that undergo fast paratomy a chain of zooids packed in a head to tail formation may develop. Many oligochete annelids, acoelous turbellarians, echinoderm larvae and coelenterates reproduce by this method.\n\n\nThis paper has a detailed description of the changes during paratomy.\n"}

In the late 20th and 21st century, plants were often taken into space in low Earth orbit to be grown in a weightless but pressurized controlled environment, sometimes called space gardens. In the context of human spaceflight, they can be consumed as food and/or provide a refreshing atmosphere. Plants can metabolize carbon dioxide in the air to produce valuable oxygen, and can help control cabin humidity. Growing plants in space may provide a psychological benefit to human spaceflight crews. Usually the plants were part of studies or technical development to further develop space gardens or conduct science experiments. To date plants taken into space have had mostly scientific interest, with only limited contributions to the functionality of the spacecraft, however the Apollo Moon tree project was more or less forestry inspired mission and the trees part of a country's bicentennial celebration\n\nThe first challenge in growing plants in space is how to get plants to grow without gravity. This runs into difficulties regarding the effects of gravity on root development, providing appropriate types of lighting, and other challenges. In particular, the nutrient supply to root as well as the nutrient biogeochemical cycles, and the microbiological interactions in soil-based substrates are particularly complex, but have been shown to make possible space farming in hypo- and micro-gravity.\n\nNASA plans to grow plants in space to help feed astronauts, and to provide psychological benefits for long-term space flight. In 2017, aboard ISS in one plant growth device, the 5th crop of Chinese cabbage (\"Brassica rapa\") from it included an allotment for crew consumption, while the rest was saved for study. A Japanese artist took images of flowers and bonsai tree in a near-space flight using a balloon. An early discussion of plants in space, were the trees on the brick moon space station, in the 1869 short story \"The Brick Moon\".\n\nIn the 2010s there was an increased desire for long-term space missions, which lead to desire for space-based plant production as food for astronauts. An example of this is vegetable production on the International Space Station in Earth orbit. By the year 2010, 20 plant growth experiments had been conducted aboard the international Space Station..\n\nSeveral experiments have been focused on how plant growth and distribution compares in micro-gravity, space conditions versus Earth conditions. This enables scientists to explore whether certain plant growth patterns are innate or environmentally driven. For instance, Allan H. Brown tested seedling movements aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia in 1983. Sunflower seedling movements were recorded while in orbit. They observed that the seedlings still experienced rotational growth and circumnation despite lack of gravity, showing these behaviors are instinctual.\n\nOther experiments have found that plants have the ability exhibit gravitropism, even in low-gravity conditions. For instance, the ESA's European Modular Cultivation System enables experimentation with plant growth; acting as a miniature greenhouse, scientists aboard the International Space Station can investigate how plants react in variable-gravity conditions.The Gravi-1 experiment (2008) utilized the EMCS to study lentil seedling growth and amyloplast movement on the calcium-dependent pathways. The results of this experiment found that the plants were able to sense the direction of gravity even at very low levels. A later experiment with the EMCS placed 768 lentil seedlings in a centrifuge to stimulate various gravitational changes; this experiment, Gravi-2 (2014), displayed that plants change calcium signalling towards root growth while being grown in a several gravity levels.\n\nMany experiments have a more generalized approach in observing overall plant growth patterns as opposed to one specific growth behavior. One such experiment from the Canadian Space Agency, for example, found that white spruce seedlings grew differently in the anti-gravity space environment compared with Earth-bound seedlings; the space seedlings exhibited enhanced growth from the shoots and needles, and also had randomized amyloplast distribution compared with the Earth-bound control group.\n\nThe first organisms in space were \"specially developed strains of seeds\" launched to on 9 July 1946 on a U.S. launched V-2 rocket. These samples were not recovered. The first seeds launched into space and successfully recovered were maize seeds launched on 30 July 1946. Soon followed rye and cotton. These early suborbital biological experiments were handled by Harvard University and the Naval Research Laboratory and were concerned with radiation exposure on living tissue. In 1971, 500 tree seeds (Loblolly pine, Sycamore, Sweetgum, Redwood, and Douglas fir) were flown around the Moon on Apollo 14. These Moon trees were planted and grown with controls back on Earth where no changes were detected.\n\nIn 1982, the crew of the Soviet Salyut 7 space station conducted an experiment, prepared by Lithuanian scientists (Alfonsas Merkys and others), and grew some Arabidopsis using Fiton-3 experimental micro-greenhouse apparatus, thus becoming the first plants to flower and produce seeds in space. A Skylab experiment studied the effects of gravity and light on rice plants. The SVET-2 Space Greenhouse successfully achieved seed to seed plant growth in 1997 aboard space station \"Mir\". Bion 5 carried \"Daucus carota\" and Bion 7 carried maize (aka corn).\n\nPlant research continued on the International Space Station. Biomass Production System was used on the ISS Expedition 4. The Vegetable Production System (Veggie) system was later used aboard ISS. Plants tested in Veggie before going into space included lettuce, Swiss chard, radishes, Chinese cabbage and peas. Red Romaine lettuce was grown in space on Expedition 40 which were harvested when mature, frozen and tested back on Earth. Expedition 44 members became the first American astronauts to eat plants grown in space on 10 August 2015, when their crop of Red Romaine was harvested. Since 2003 Russian cosmonauts have been eating half of their crop while the other half goes towards further research. In 2012, a sunflower bloomed aboard the ISS under the care of NASA astronaut Donald Pettit. In January 2016, US astronauts announced that a zinnia had blossomed aboard the ISS.\n\nIn 2017 the \"Advanced Plant Habitat\" was designed for ISS, which was a nearly self-sustaining plant growth system for that space station in low Earth orbit. The system is installed in parallel with another plant grown system aboard the station, VEGGIE, and a major difference with that system is that APH is designed to need less upkeep by humans. APH is supported by the \" Plant Habitat Avionics Real-Time Manager\". Some plants that were to be tested in APH include Dwarf Wheat and Arabidopsis.. In December 2017 hundreds of seeds were delivered to ISS for growth in the VEGGIE system.\n\nin 2018 the Veggie-3 experiment was tested with plant pillows and root mats. One of the goals is to grow food for crew consumption. Crops tested at this time include cabbage, lettuce, and mizuna. In 2018, the PONDS system for nutrient deliver in microgravity was tested.\n\nPlants grown in space include:\n\nSome experiments to do with plants include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58582242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58582242", "title": "Repeated implantation failure", "text": "Repeated implantation failure\n\nRepeated Implantation failure (RIF) is the failure of the embryo to implant onto the side of the uterus wall following IVF treatment. Regularly, this happens at 6-7 days after conception and involves the embedding of the growing embryo into the mothers uterus and a connection being formed . A successful implantation can be determined by using an ultrasound to view the sac which the baby grows in, inside the uterus.\n\nHowever, the exact definition of RIF is debated. Recently the most commonly accepted definition is when a women under 40 has gone through 3 unsuccessful cycles of IVF, when in each cycle 4 good quality eggs have been transferred .\n\nRepeated implantation failure should not be confused with recurrent IVF failure. Recurrent IVF failure is a much more broad term and includes all repeated failures to get pregnant from IVF. Repeated implantation failure specifically refers to those failures due to unsuccessful implanting to the uterus wall. \n\nAn unsuccessful implantation can be down to either problems with the mother or with the embryo. It is essential that the mother and embryo are able to communicate with each other during all stages of pregnancy, and an absence of this communication can lead to an unsuccessful implantation and a further unsuccessful pregnancy . \n\nDuring implantation, the embryo must cross the epithelial layer of the maternal endometrium before invading and implanting in the stroma layer. Maternal factors, including congenital uterine abnormalities, fibroids, endometrial polyps, intrauterine adhesions, adenomyosis, thrombophilia and endometriosis, can reduce the chances of implantation and result in RIF.\n\nCongenital uterine abnormalities are irregularities in the uterus which occur during the mothers foetal development.\n\nTwo genes have been identified to assist in the development and receptivity of the uterus and endometrium, Hoxa10 and Hoxa11. Hoxa10 has been shown to change the upper uterine segment into oviduct-like structures, creating a smaller uterus that appears normal. Embryo transfer into the lower uterine segment does not allow for implantation, so the Hoxa10 gene has multiple effects throughout the uterus. Hoxa11 mutations alter the endometrial gland development and reduce the secretion of Leukaemia-Inhibitory factor (LIF) which is required for implantation.\nFibroids are benign tumours found in the smooth muscle of the uterus, they are often asymptomatic but can cause pelvic pain. They effect implantation rates by altering the shape and cytokine composition of the uterus. Removal of submucosal fibroids has shown to increase implantation rates.\n\nEndometrial polyps are benign tumours found in the endometrium which factor into female infertility. There has been limited research into if their removal increases the chances of implantation and pregnancy.\n\nIntrauterine adhesions (Asherman's Syndrome) occur from scar tissue within the uterus which cause the closure of part or all of the uterus. The adhesions prevent embryos from implanting by reducing the surface area and decreasing the receptivity. Intrauterine adhesions normally occur after damage has been caused to the endometrium, either through removal of unwanted pregnancies, miscarriage, infection, and surgical damage.\n\nThrombophilia is a condition which makes the blood more likely to clot and this increases cardiovascular risk, meaning the individual is at higher risk of heart attacks, strokes or DVTs . In pregnancy it can lead to a disruption in the flow of blood to the placenta and the uterus wall. This can lead to a decreased receptivity of the uterus wall for a pregnancy and can lead to a miscarriage further on. However, how significantly this contributes to RIF is not fully known but each case should be assessed on a personal basis by a clinician \n\nThe successful implantation of an embryo not only relies on a receptive uterine environment in the mother but also on the quality of the embryo itself. Embryo quality and probability of implantation can be affected by maternal and paternal genetic abnormalities as well as zona pellucida dysfunction and poor embryo transfer technique.\n\nThe quality of the sperm that fertilizes an egg is a key contributor to the overall quality of the embryo. Abnormalities in DNA fragmentation and chromosomal arrangements are the main source of genetic deviation in males that can affect embryo quality. DNA fragmentation occurs when the strands of DNA are separated to form two separate strands, this disrupts the genetic information that is coded in genes. Depending on the severity of the fragmentation, this can lead to the dysfunction of specific genes which may or may not be essential for embryo survival and in this case the initiation of implantation. DNA fragmentation can happen spontaneously in cells that undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) where DNA is broken apart by enzymes called endonucleases. However, since the male DNA isn't activated until around day 3 after fertilisation, it is often difficult to diagnose sperm genetic abnormalities because morphological studies could identify a good quality oocyte when initial transfer occurs, but due to DNA fragmentation in the sperm, the embryo will die after day 3 of growth.\n\nOocyte quality is also a main contributor to overall embryo quality since it is the DNA of the oocyte that is mainly involved in the first 3 days of embryo growth following fertilization. A major source of genetic abnormalities are balanced translocations (Figure 1).\n\nA translocation involves the exchange of segments of chromosomes that are not a homologous pair. In most cases, this leads to balanced translocations, in which no DNA is lost therefore is usually asymptomatic. However, as female gametes are formed, it is probable that 2/3 of embryos produced will have unbalanced translocations within their DNA if fertilised by sperm with a balanced translocation too. Translocation mutations can occur at any point during fertilization or even the first meiotic division that the oocyte undergoes during foetal life.\n\nThe female egg (oocyte) is surrounded by a layer of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida. Once fertilisation has occurred, this layer will harden to prevent further sperm entering and maintain the shape of the fertilized egg (zygote) as it divides to form a blastocyst (Figure 2). Once the inner cell mass - the group of cells within the blastocyst that go on to form the embryo - starts to expand, lysin enzymes secreted by the inner cell mass will act on the zona pellucida and weaken the hardened structure. Eventually, this will cause the rupture of the zona pellucida, allowing the blastocyst to hatch and begin to implant into the uterine wall.\n\nIf the zona pellucida fails to thin in preparation for rupture, this will prevent the blastocyst from hatching and therefore be unable to implant, therefore this is a probable cause of repeated implantation failure (RIF). This is supported by a study which showed that implantation rates in women who received assisted zona pellucida hatching - use of synthetic chemical to artificially weaken the zona pellucida - increased.\n\nWomen with RIF should undergo ovarian function testing to explore their levels of FSH, AMH and any other hormones or follicle counts which may indicate the overall behaviour of the ovarian reserve. Male partners may also be offered laboratory testing of sperm DNA integrity. \n\nIn the instance of genetic testing, karyotyping may be made available to couples with RIF to exclude the possibility of balanced chromosomal translocations. Ultrasounds may be used to oversee the morphological growth and development of follicles throughout IVF treatment, in addition to assessing endometrial thickness. \n\nHysteroscopy is an essential part of investigating a couple’s RIF pathology and is used as a diagnostic tool to examine the cervical canal and uterine cavity. \n\nIn depth reviews of the underlying causes of a couple's infertility should be undertaken with a qualified fertility specialist in order to make decisions regarding further management.\n\nModifiable risk factors include smoking, alcohol consumption and BMI. Women with RIF should be advised to abstain from both alcohol and smoking, and male partners may also consider cessation of smoking due to effects associated with weaker sperm counts and damage to sperm DNA and motility. An ideal BMI target for women with RIF is between 19 and 29; obese women may consider structured weight-loss programmes and regular exercise over bariatric surgery due to potential folate, iron, vitamin B12 and other nutritional deficiencies. \n\nTable below showing the main first-line treatments for couples undergoing RIF. \n"}
{"id": "26310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26310", "title": "Reproduction", "text": "Reproduction\n\nReproduction (or procreation or breeding) is the biological process by which new individual organisms – \"offspring\" – are produced from their \"parents\". Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known life; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. There are two forms of reproduction: asexual and sexual.\n\nIn asexual reproduction, an organism can reproduce without the involvement of another organism. Asexual reproduction is not limited to single-celled organisms. The cloning of an organism is a form of asexual reproduction. By asexual reproduction, an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself. The evolution of sexual reproduction is a major puzzle for biologists. The two-fold cost of sexual reproduction is that only 50% of organisms reproduce and organisms only pass on 50% of their genes.\n\nSexual reproduction typically requires the sexual interaction of two specialized organisms, called gametes, which contain half the number of chromosomes of normal cells and are created by meiosis, with typically a male fertilizing a female of the same species to create a fertilized zygote. This produces offspring organisms whose genetic characteristics are derived from those of the two parental organisms.\n\nAsexual reproduction is a process by which organisms create genetically similar or identical copies of themselves without the contribution of genetic material from another organism. Bacteria divide asexually via binary fission; viruses take control of host cells to produce more viruses; Hydras (invertebrates of the order \"Hydroidea\") and yeasts are able to reproduce by budding. These organisms often do not possess different sexes, and they are capable of \"splitting\" themselves into two or more copies of themselves. Most plants have the ability to reproduce asexually and the ant species Mycocepurus smithii is thought to reproduce entirely by asexual means.\n\nSome species that are capable of reproducing asexually, like hydra, yeast (See Mating of yeasts) and jellyfish, may also reproduce sexually. For instance, most plants are capable of vegetative reproduction—reproduction without seeds or spores—but can also reproduce sexually. Likewise, bacteria may exchange genetic information by conjugation.\n\nOther ways of asexual reproduction include parthenogenesis, fragmentation and spore formation that involves only mitosis. Parthenogenesis is the growth and development of embryo or seed without fertilization by a male. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in some species, including lower plants (where it is called apomixis), invertebrates (e.g. water fleas, aphids, some bees and parasitic wasps), and vertebrates (e.g. some\nreptiles, fish, and, very rarely, birds and sharks). It is sometimes also used to describe reproduction modes in hermaphroditic species which can self-fertilize.\n\nSexual reproduction is a biological process that creates a new organism by combining the genetic material of two organisms in a process that starts with meiosis, a specialized type of cell division. Each of two parent organisms contributes half of the offspring's genetic makeup by creating haploid gametes. Most organisms form two different types of gametes. In these anisogamous species, the two sexes are referred to as male (producing sperm or microspores) and female (producing ova or megaspores). In isogamous species, the gametes are similar or identical in form (isogametes), but may have separable properties and then may be given other different names (see isogamy). For example, in the green alga, \"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\", there are so-called \"plus\" and \"minus\" gametes. A few types of organisms, such as many fungi and the ciliate \"Paramecium aurelia\", have more than two \"sexes\", called syngens.\nMost animals (including humans) and plants reproduce sexually. Sexually reproducing organisms have different sets of genes for every trait (called alleles). Offspring inherit one allele for each trait from each parent. Thus, offspring have a combination of the parents' genes. It is believed that \"the masking of deleterious alleles favors the evolution of a dominant diploid phase in organisms that alternate between haploid and diploid phases\" where recombination occurs freely.\n\nBryophytes reproduce sexually, but the larger and commonly-seen organisms are haploid and produce gametes. The gametes fuse to form a zygote which develops into a sporangium, which in turn produces haploid spores. The diploid stage is relatively small and short-lived compared to the haploid stage, i.e. \"haploid dominance\". The advantage of diploidy, heterosis, only exists in the diploid life generation. Bryophytes retain sexual reproduction despite the fact that the haploid stage does not benefit from heterosis. This may be an indication that the sexual reproduction has advantages other than heterosis, such as genetic recombination between members of the species, allowing the expression of a wider range of traits and thus making the population more able to survive environmental variation.\n\nAllogamy is the fertilization of the combination of gametes from two parents, generally the ovum from one individual with the spermatozoa of another. (In isogamous species, the two gametes will not be defined as either sperm or ovum.)\n\nSelf-fertilization, also known as autogamy, occurs in hermaphroditic organisms where the two gametes fused in fertilization come from the same individual, e.g., many vascular plants, some foraminiferans, some ciliates. The term \"autogamy\" is sometimes substituted for autogamous pollination (not necessarily leading to successful fertilization) and describes self-pollination within the same flower, distinguished from geitonogamous pollination, transfer of pollen to a different flower on the same flowering plant, or within a single monoecious Gymnosperm plant.\n\nMitosis and meiosis are types of cell division. Mitosis occurs in somatic cells, while meiosis occurs in gametes.\n\nMitosis\nThe resultant number of cells in mitosis is twice the number of original cells. The number of chromosomes in the offspring cells is the same as that of the parent cell.\n\nMeiosis\nThe resultant number of cells is four times the number of original cells. This results in cells with half the number of chromosomes present in the parent cell. A diploid cell duplicates itself, then undergoes two divisions (tetraploid to diploid to haploid), in the process forming four haploid cells. This process occurs in two phases, meiosis I and meiosis II.\nIn recent decades, developmental biologists have been researching and developing techniques to facilitate same-sex reproduction. The obvious approaches, subject to a growing amount of activity, are female sperm and male eggs, with female sperm closer to being a reality for humans, given that Japanese scientists have already created female sperm for chickens. \"However, the ratio of produced W chromosome-bearing (W-bearing) spermatozoa fell substantially below expectations. It is therefore concluded that most of the W-bearing PGC could not differentiate into spermatozoa because of restricted spermatogenesis.\" In 2004, by altering the function of a few genes involved with imprinting, other Japanese scientists combined two mouse eggs to produce daughter mice and in 2018 Chinese scientists created 29 female mice from two female mice mothers but were unable to produce viable offspring from two father mice.\n\nThere are a wide range of reproductive strategies employed by different species. Some animals, such as the human and northern gannet, do not reach sexual maturity for many years after birth and even then produce few offspring. Others reproduce quickly; but, under normal circumstances, most offspring do not survive to adulthood. For example, a rabbit (mature after 8 months) can produce 10–30 offspring per year, and a fruit fly (mature after 10–14 days) can produce up to 900 offspring per year. These two main strategies are known as K-selection (few offspring) and r-selection (many offspring). Which strategy is favoured by evolution depends on a variety of circumstances. Animals with few offspring can devote more resources to the nurturing and protection of each individual offspring, thus reducing the need for many offspring. On the other hand, animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring; for these types of animals it is common for many offspring to die soon after birth, but enough individuals typically survive to maintain the population. Some organisms such as honey bees and fruit flies retain sperm in a process called sperm storage thereby increasing the duration of their fertility.\n\n\nOrganisms that reproduce through asexual reproduction tend to grow in number exponentially. However, because they rely on mutation for variations in their DNA, all members of the species have similar vulnerabilities. Organisms that reproduce sexually yield a smaller number of offspring, but the large amount of variation in their genes makes them less susceptible to disease.\n\nMany organisms can reproduce sexually as well as asexually. Aphids, slime molds, sea anemones, some species of starfish (by fragmentation), and many plants are examples. When environmental factors are favorable, asexual reproduction is employed to exploit suitable conditions for survival such as an abundant food supply, adequate shelter, favorable climate, disease, optimum pH or a proper mix of other lifestyle requirements. Populations of these organisms increase exponentially via asexual reproductive strategies to take full advantage of the rich supply resources.\n\nWhen food sources have been depleted, the climate becomes hostile, or individual survival is jeopardized by some other adverse change in living conditions, these organisms switch to sexual forms of reproduction. Sexual reproduction ensures a mixing of the gene pool of the species. The variations found in offspring of sexual reproduction allow some individuals to be better suited for survival and provide a mechanism for selective adaptation to occur. The meiosis stage of the sexual cycle also allows especially effective repair of DNA damages (see Meiosis and Bernstein et al.). In addition, sexual reproduction usually results in the formation of a life stage that is able to endure the conditions that threaten the offspring of an asexual parent. Thus, seeds, spores, eggs, pupae, cysts or other \"over-wintering\" stages of sexual reproduction ensure the survival during unfavorable times and the organism can \"wait out\" adverse situations until a swing back to suitability occurs.\n\nThe existence of life without reproduction is the subject of some speculation. The biological study of how the origin of life produced reproducing organisms from non-reproducing elements is called abiogenesis. Whether or not there were several independent abiogenetic events, biologists believe that the last universal ancestor to all present life on Earth lived about 3.5 billion years ago.\n\nScientists have speculated about the possibility of creating life non-reproductively in the laboratory. Several scientists have succeeded in producing simple viruses from entirely non-living materials. However, viruses are often regarded as not alive. Being nothing more than a bit of RNA or DNA in a protein capsule, they have no metabolism and can only replicate with the assistance of a hijacked cell's metabolic machinery.\n\nThe production of a truly living organism (e.g. a simple bacterium) with no ancestors would be a much more complex task, but may well be possible to some degree according to current biological knowledge. A synthetic genome has been transferred into an existing bacterium where it replaced the native DNA, resulting in the artificial production of a new \"M. mycoides\" organism.\n\nThere is some debate within the scientific community over whether this cell can be considered completely synthetic on the grounds that the chemically synthesized genome was an almost 1:1 copy of a naturally occurring genome and, the recipient cell was a naturally occurring bacterium. The Craig Venter Institute maintains the term \"synthetic bacterial cell\" but they also clarify \"...we do not consider this to be \"creating life from scratch\" but rather we are creating new life out of already existing life using synthetic DNA\". Venter plans to patent his experimental cells, stating that \"they are pretty clearly human inventions\". Its creators suggests that building 'synthetic life' would allow researchers to learn about life by building it, rather than by tearing it apart. They also propose to stretch the boundaries between life and machines until the two overlap to yield \"truly programmable organisms\". Researchers involved stated that the creation of \"true synthetic biochemical life\" is relatively close in reach with current technology and cheap compared to the effort needed to place man on the Moon.\n\nSexual reproduction has many drawbacks, since it requires far more energy than asexual reproduction and diverts the organisms from other pursuits, and there is some argument about why so many species use it. George C. Williams used lottery tickets as an analogy in one explanation for the widespread use of sexual reproduction. He argued that asexual reproduction, which produces little or no genetic variety in offspring, was like buying many tickets that all have the same number, limiting the chance of \"winning\" - that is, producing surviving offspring. Sexual reproduction, he argued, was like purchasing fewer tickets but with a greater variety of numbers and therefore a greater chance of success. The point of this analogy is that since asexual reproduction does not produce genetic variations, there is little ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment. The lottery principle is less accepted these days because of evidence that asexual reproduction is more prevalent in unstable environments, the opposite of what it predicts.\n\n\n\n"}

Aamer denies being involved in terrorist activity and his lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, said the leaked documents would not stand up in court. He claimed that part of the evidence came from an unreliable witness and that confessions Aamer made had been obtained through torture. Aamer's father-in-law, Saaed Ahmed Siddique, said: \"All of these claims have no basis. If any of this was true he would be in a court now.\" The Bush administration acknowledged later that it had no evidence against Aamer.\n\nAamer has never been charged with any wrongdoing, was never on trial, and his lawyer says he is \"totally innocent.\" He was approved for transfer to Saudi Arabia by the Bush administration in 2007 and the Obama administration in 2009. He has been described as a \"charismatic leader\" who spoke up and fought for the rights of fellow prisoners. Aamer alleges that he has been subject to torture while in detention. Campaigners allege that the US refused to release Aamer because it feared he would expose torture inside the Guantanamo prison.\n\nAamer has suffered decline in his mental and physical health over the years, as he participated in hunger strikes to protest his detention conditions, and was held in solitary confinement for much of the time. He claims to have lost 40 per cent of his body weight in captivity. After a visit in November 2011, his lawyer said, \"I do not think it is stretching matters to say that he is gradually dying in Guantanamo Bay.\" In 2015, despite Aamer's deteriorating health, the US denied a request for an independent medical examination. On 25 September 2015 the US government announced that Aamer would be released to the UK within thirty days. He was released to the UK on 30 October 2015.\n\nAamer was born on 21 December 1966 and grew up in Medina in Saudi Arabia. He left the country at the age of 17. He lived and traveled in the United States, Europe and the Middle East. Aamer lived and studied in Georgia and Maryland in 1989 and 1990. During the Gulf War, he worked as a translator for the U.S. Army.\n\nHe moved to the United Kingdom in 1996 where he met Zin Siddique, a British woman; they married in 1997 and he established legal residency in Britain. They have four British children, the youngest of whom Aamer had never met, due to his having been born after Aamer's imprisonment. Aamer had indefinite leave to remain in the UK, and was applying for British citizenship.\n\nAamer worked as an Arabic translator for London law firms. Some of the solicitors he worked for dealt with immigration cases. In his spare time, Aamer helped refugees find accommodation and offered them advice on their struggles with the Home Office.\n\nIn 2012, Aamer's family lived in Battersea, South London. His wife Zin Aamer suffered from depression and mental episodes since his arrest. Saeed Siddique, Aamer's father-in-law, said in 2011, \"When he was captured, Shaker offered to let my daughter divorce him, but she said, 'No, I will wait for you.' She is still waiting.\"\n\nAamer took his family to Afghanistan in 2001, where he was working for an Islamic charity when the U.S. invaded the country later that year. The Northern Alliance took him into custody in Jalalabad in December 2001, and passed him to the Americans. The US routinely paid ransom for Arabs handed over to them. They interrogated Aamer at Bagram Theater Internment Facility and transported him to Guantánamo on 14 February 2002.\n\nAccording to Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessments from 1 November 2007, the US military believed that Aamer was a \"recruiter, financier, and facilitator\" for al-Qaeda, based partly on spurious evidence given by the informant Yasim Muhammed Basardah, a fellow detainee. The leaked documents alleged that Aamer had confessed to interrogators that he was in Tora Bora with Osama bin Laden at the time of the US bombing. The documents further note that the Saudi intelligence Mabahith identified Aamer \"as a high priority for the government of Saudi Arabia, an indication of his law enforcement value to them.\"\n\nIn 2010 the Guantanamo Review Task Force released their report of the detainee assessments. In many instances, the Task Force largely agreed with prior threat assessments of the detainees and sometimes found additional information that further substantiated such assessments. In other instances, the Task Force found prior assessments to be overstated. Some assessments, for example, contained allegations that were not supported by the underlying source document upon which they relied. Other assessments contained conclusions that were stated categorically even though derived from uncorroborated statements or raw intelligence reporting of undetermined or questionable reliability. Conversely, in a few cases, the Task Force discovered reliable information indicating that a detainee posed a greater threat in some respects than prior assessments suggested.\n\nAamer denies being involved in terrorist activity and his attorney, Clive Stafford Smith of Reprieve, said the evidence against his client \"would not stand up in court.\" He pointed out that part of the evidence comes from Yasim Muhammed Basardah, whom American judges found to be \"utterly incredible\" and who was tortured and \"promised all sorts of things.\"\n\nThe Bush administration acknowledged later that it had no evidence against Aamer, and he was cleared for transfer in 2007. The clearance was for transfer to Saudi Arabia only.\n\nIn September 2009, Zachary Katznelson, a Reprieve lawyer, said that Aamer had told of suffering severe beatings at the Bagram facility. Aamer said that close to a dozen men had beaten him, including interrogators who represented themselves as officers of MI5, the United Kingdom's internal counter-terrorism agency. Following one severe beating, he recovered from being stunned to find that all the interrogators had left the room and put a pistol on the table. He did not determine if the pistol was loaded. He said it occurred to him that it had been left either so he could kill himself, or that, if he picked it up, he could be shot and killed on the excuse he was trying to shoot them.\n\nAamer says that the \"MI5\" interrogators told him he had two choices: (1) agree to spy on suspected jihadists in the United Kingdom; or (2) remain in US custody. He said that guards/agents repeatedly knocked his head against the wall while an MI5 officer was in the room.\n\nAll I know is that I felt someone grab my head and start beating my head into the back wall – so hard that my head was bouncing. And they were shouting that they would kill me or I would die.\n\nOther former detainees have alleged similar mistreatment by MI5 and MI6 agents, including torture. Seven detainees filed suit against the British government over their mistreatment and torture. In November 2010, the British government settled the suit, paying the detainees millions of pounds in compensation. Aamer is also on the compensation list and part of the deal, but details are not known as most of the deal is still secret.\n\nAamer has been described as an unofficial spokesman for the detainees at Guantanamo. He has spoken up for the welfare of prisoners, negotiating with camp commanders and organizing protests against cruel treatment. He organized and participated in a hunger strike in 2005 in which he lost half of his weight. He demanded the prisoners be treated according to the Geneva Convention, allowing the detainees to form a grievance committee. In negotiations, the camp administration promised a healthier diet for the prisoners after he agreed to end the hunger strike. His lawyer Stafford Smith said the grievance committee was formed, but that the camp authorities disbanded it after a few days. American spokesmen Major Jeffrey Weir denied that the Americans had ever agreed to any conditions resulting from the hunger strike.\n\nIn September 2006, Aamer's attorneys filed a 16-page motion arguing for his removal from isolation in Guantanamo Bay prison. They argued extended periods of isolation were detrimental to his mental and physical health.\n\nAamer continued to take part in additional hunger strikes and was held in solitary confinement for most of the time. His lawyers described his solitary confinement as \"cruel\" and said his health was affected to a point where they feared for his life. In 2011 Stafford Smith, director of the UK branch of Reprieve, said Aamer is \"falling apart at the seams.\"\n\nOn 18 September 2006, Aamer's attorneys filed a 16-page motion arguing for his removal from isolation in Guantanamo Bay prison. The motion alleges that Aamer had been held in solitary confinement for 360 days at the time of filing, and was tortured by beatings, exposure to temperature extremes, and sleep deprivation, which together caused him to suffer to the point of becoming mentally unbalanced. The next day Katznelson filed a motion to enforce the Geneva Conventions on his behalf.\n\nAfter President Barack Obama was elected, in 2009 he convened a six-agency task force to review the status of detainees at Guantanamo. It \"unanimously recommended\" transfer of Aamer. Security officials wanted to send him to Saudi Arabia, his country of citizenship, but his attorneys argued for him to be transferred to Great Britain, where he had been resident and had family.\n\nIn September 2011, Aamer's lawyer Brent Mickum, who saw him in Guantánamo, alleges that Aamer was repeatedly beaten before their meetings. He said that Aamer's mental and physical health is deteriorating. \"It felt like he has given up: that's what 10 years, mostly in solitary confinement will do to a person,\" he said.\n\nBinyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian prisoner who formerly occupied a cell one door down from Aamer, has said since his release that he knows why Aamer is still in the prison camps.\n\nI would say the Americans are trying to keep him as silent as they could. It's not that he has anything. What happened in 2005 and 2006 is something that the Americans don't want the world to know – hunger strikes, and all the events that took place, until the three brothers who died ... insider information of all the events, probably. Obviously, Shaker doesn't have it, but the Americans think he may have some of it, and they don't like this kind of information being released.\n\nClive Stafford Smith, his lawyer and director of human rights organisation Reprieve, came to a similar conclusion. He said:\n\nI have known Shaker for some time, because he is so eloquent and outspoken about the injustices of Guantanamo he is very definitely viewed as a threat by the US. Not in the sense of being an extremist but in the sense of being someone who can rather eloquently criticise the nightmare that happened there.\n\nOmar Deghayes, a former Guantanamo Detainee who knew Aamer, said of him,\n\nHe was always forward, he would translate for people, he'd fight for them, and if he had any problems in the block he'd shout at the guards... until he would get you your rights. And that's why he's still in prison... because he's very outspoken, a very intelligent person, somebody who would fight for somebody else's rights.\n\nIn an article published in 2010, Aamer said that he was beaten for hours and subjected to interrogation methods that included asphyxiation on 9 June 2006, the same day that three fellow prisoners died in Guantanamo. The United States claimed these deaths were suicides.\n\nDescribing his treatment, Aamer said that he was strapped to a chair, fully restrained at the head, arms and legs. When MPs pressed on pressure points all over his body: his temples, just under his jawline, in the hollow beneath his ears. They bent his nose repeatedly, pinched his thighs and feet. They inflicted pain to his eyes, bent his fingers until he screamed and then they cut off his airway and put a mask over him, so he could not cry out.\n\nThe law professor Scott Horton published an award-winning article on the 2006 deaths in \"Harper's Magazine\" in 2010, suggesting that these were cases of homicide caused by extended torture, rather than suicide. He said that Aamer had been brought to \"Camp No,\" a secret interrogation black site outside the camp, with the three men who died on the day of the event. Horton described Aamer's account of having his airways cut off as \"alarming\" and wrote, \"This is the same technique that appears to have been used on the three deceased prisoners.\" Colonel Michael Bumgarner, the commander of the camps during the incident and identified in Horton's article as having been present during the interrogations, denied Horton's claims.\n\nHorton wrote that Aamer's repatriation was being delayed so that he could not testify about his alleged torture in Bagram or the events on 9 June 2006. He wrote: \"American authorities may be concerned that Aamer, if released, could provide evidence against them in criminal investigations.\"\n\nIn 2013, Aamer told his attorneys that he was among the growing group of active hunger strikers. He said he had been refusing meals since February 15 and had lost 32 pounds. In previous hunger strikes guards force-fed him with tubes down his nose. His lawyer said Aamer spent 22 hours a day alone in his cell. Aamer was not permitted visitors except his attorneys. Aamer was among a group of detainees who filed a court challenge to the authorities' practice of force feeding those on hunger strikes. A United States appellate court ruled in 2014 \"that the judiciary could oversee conditions of confinement at the prison.\"\n\nIn 2014, his lawyers filed a motion on Aamer's behalf seeking his release on the grounds that his health is \"gravely diminished,\". They argued that his various health problems could not be treated in Guantanamo and \"\"even if he receives the intensive medical and therapeutic treatment his condition requires, Mr Aamer will take many years, if not a lifetime, to achieve any significant recovery\". His lawyers argued that both the Geneva Convention and Army Regulation 190-8, require the repatriation of chronically ill prisoners. In 2015 despite Aamer's deteriorating health, the US denied attorneys' request for an independent medical examination.\n\nThe United Kingdom government initially refused to intervene on the behalf of Guantánamo detainees who were legal British residents but were not British citizens. In August 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband requested the release of Aamer and four other men, based on their having been granted refugee status, or similar leave, to remain in Britain as residents prior to their capture by US forces. With the repatriation of Binyam Mohammed in February 2009, all British citizens and residents other than Aamer had been released.\n\nThe UK government officials repeatedly raised Aamer's case with the Americans. On a visit to the United States on 13 March 2009, when asked about Guantánamo captives, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said that the US administration has said they do not want to return Aamer to the UK. William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, raised Aamer's case again with Hillary Clinton, US Secretary of State, in November 2010, followed by meetings with other US officials. At the time, the US government had reached settlement with former detainees as a resolution for damages due to the use of torture in interrogation.\n\nIn September 2011, Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said that negotiations were ongoing and confidential. Supporters of Aamer criticized the UK government for not doing enough on his behalf; they urged the government to step up their efforts. In January 2012, \"The Independent\" revealed that the British government has spent £274,345 fighting in court to prevent Aamer's lawyers from gaining access to evidence which may prove his innocence. The newspaper reported that Aamer had several serious medical complaints from years of \"inhumane\" detention conditions, and that the UK gave false hope to his family.\n\n\nOn 30 October 2015, Aamer was flown from Cuba, stepping on British soil at 13.00 GMT. In a later interview he discussed his detention and family life. He also called upon jihadis to \"get the hell out\" of Britain, stating that civilian killings were \"not allowed\" in Islam, and went on to say that \"you cannot just go in the street and get a knife and start stabbing people\" in apparent reference to the murder of Lee Rigby.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2943008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2943008", "title": "Social alienation", "text": "Social alienation\n\nSocial alienation is \"a condition in social relationships reflected by a low degree of integration or common values and a high degree of distance or isolation between individuals, or between an individual and a group of people in a community or work environment\". It is a sociological concept developed by several classical and contemporary theorists. The concept has many discipline-specific uses, and can refer both to a personal psychological state (subjectively) and to a type of social relationship (objectively).\n\nThe term \"alienation\" has been used over the ages with varied and sometimes contradictory meanings. In ancient history it could mean a metaphysical sense of achieving a higher state of contemplation, ecstasy or union—becoming alienated from a limited existence in the world, in a positive sense. Examples of this usage have been traced to neoplatonic philosophers such as Plotinus (in the Greek \"alloiosis\"). There have also long been religious concepts of being separated or cut off from God and the faithful, alienated in a negative sense. The New Testament mentions the term \"apallotrioomai\" in Greek—\"being alienated from\". Ideas of estrangement from a Golden Age, or due to a fall of man, or approximate equivalents in differing cultures or religions, have also been described as concepts of alienation. A double positive and negative sense of alienation is broadly shown in the spiritual beliefs referred to as Gnosticism.\n\nAlienation has also had a particular legal-political meaning since at least Ancient Roman times, where to alienate property (\"alienato\") is to transfer ownership of it to someone else. The term alienation itself comes from the Latin \"alienus\" which meant 'of another place or person', which in turn came from \"alius\", meaning \"other\" or \"another\". An alienus in ancient Roman times could refer to someone else's slave. Another usage of the term in Ancient Greco-Roman times was by physicians referring to disturbed, difficult or abnormal states of mind, generally attributed to imbalanced physiology. In Latin \"alienatio mentis\" (mental alienation), this usage has been dated to Asclepiades. Once translations of such works had resurfaced in the West in the 17th century, physicians again began using the term, which is typically attributed to Felix Platter.\n\nIn medieval times, a relationship between alienation and social order has been described, mediated in part by mysticism and monasticism. The Crusades and witch-hunts have been described as forms of mass alienation.\n\nIn the 17th century, Hugo Grotius put forward the concept that everyone has 'sovereign authority' over themselves but that they could alienate that natural right to the common good, an early social contract theory. In the 18th century, Hutcheson introduced a distinction between alienable and unalienable rights in the legal sense of the term. Rousseau published influential works on the same theme, and is also seen as having popularized a more psychological-social concept relating to alienation from a state of nature due to the expansion of civil society or the nation state.\n\nIn the same century a law of alienation of affection was introduced for men to seek compensation from other men accused of taking away 'their' woman.\n\nIn the history of literature, the German Romantics appear to be the first group of writers and poets in whose work the concept of alienation is regularly found. Around the start of the 19th century, Hegel popularized a Christian (Lutheran) and Idealist philosophy of alienation. He used German terms in partially different senses, referring to a psychological state and an objective process, and in general posited that the self was an historical and social creation, which becomes alienated from itself via a perceived objective world, but can become de-alienated again when that world is seen as just another aspect of the self-consciousness, which may be achieved by self-sacrifice to the common good.\n\nAround the same time, Pinel was popularizing a new understanding of mental alienation, particularly through his 'medical-philosophical treatise'. He argued that people could be disturbed (alienated) by emotional states and social conditions, without necessarily having lost (become alienated from) their reason, as had generally been assumed. Hegel praised Pinel for his 'moral treatment' approach, and developed related theories. Nevertheless, as Foucault would later write, \"... in an obscure, shared origin, the 'alienation' of physicians and the 'alienation' of philosophers started to take shape—two configurations in which man in any case corrupts his truth, but between which, after Hegel, the nineteenth century stopped seeing any trace of resemblance.\"\n\nTwo camps formed following Hegel, the 'young' or 'left' Hegelians who developed his philosophy to support innovations in politics or religion, and the 'old' or 'right' Hegelians who took his philosophy in a politically and religiously conservative direction. The former camp has had a more lasting influence and, among them, Feuerbach differed from Hegel in arguing that worship of God is itself a form of alienation, because it projects human qualities on to an external idea, rather than realising them as part of the self.\n\nMarx was initially in the Young Hegelian camp and, like Feuerbach, rejected the spiritual basis, and adapted Hegel's dialectic model to a theory of (historical) materialism. Marx's theory of alienation is articulated most clearly in the \"Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844\" and \"The German Ideology\" (1846). The 'young' Marx wrote more often and directly of alienation than the 'mature' Marx, which some regard as an ideological break while others maintain that the concept remained central. There is generally held to be a transition from a philosophical-anthropological (Marxist humanism) concept (e.g. internal alienation from the self) to a structural-historical interpretation (e.g. external alienation by appropriation of labor), accompanied by a change in terminology from alienation to exploitation to commodity fetishism and reification. Marx's concepts of alienation have been classed into four types by Kostas Axelos: economic and social alienation, political alienation, human alienation, and ideological alienation.\n\nIn the concept's most prominent use, it refers to the \"economic and social alienation\" aspect in which workers are disconnected from what they produce and why they produce. Marx believed that alienation is a systematic result of capitalism. Essentially, there is an \"exploitation of men by men\" where the division of labor creates an economic hierarchy (Axelos, 1976: 58). His theory of alienation was based upon his observation that in emerging industrial production under capitalism, workers inevitably lose control of their lives and selves by not having any control of their work. Workers never become autonomous, self-realized human beings in any significant sense, except in the way the bourgeoisie wants the worker to be realized. His theory relies on Feuerbach's \"The Essence of Christianity\" (1841), which argues that the idea of God has alienated the characteristics of the human being. Stirner would take the analysis further in \"The Ego and Its Own\" (1844), declaring that even 'humanity' is an alienating ideal for the individual, to which Marx and Engels responded in \"The German Ideology\" (1845). Alienation in capitalist societies occurs because in work each contributes to the common wealth but they can only express this fundamentally social aspect of individuality through a production system that is not publicly social but privately owned, for which each individual functions as an instrument, not as a social being. Kostas Axelos summarizes that for Marx, in capitalism \"work renders man an alien to himself and to his own products.\" \"The malaise of this alienation from the self means that the worker does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy...The worker only feels himself outside his work, and in his work he feels outside himself...Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, it is avoided like the plague.\". Marx also wrote, in a curtailed manner, that capitalist owners also experience alienation, through benefiting from the economic machine by endlessly competing, exploiting others and maintaining mass alienation in society.\n\nThe idea of \"Political Alienation\" refers to the idea that \"politics is the form that organizes the productive forces of the economy\" in a way that is alienating because it \"distorts the logic of economic development\".\n\nIn \"Human Alienation\", individuals become estranged to themselves in the quest to stay alive, where \"they lose their true existence in the struggle for subsistence\" (Axelos, 1976: 111). Marx focuses on two aspects of human nature which he calls \"historical conditions.\" The first aspect refers to the necessity of food, clothes, shelter, and more. Secondly, Marx believes that after satisfying these basic needs people have the tendency to develop more \"needs\" or desires that they will work towards satisfying, hence, humans become stuck in a cycle of never ending wants which makes them strangers to each other.\n\nWhen referring to \"ideological alienation\", Axelos proposes that Marx believes that all religions divert people away from \"their true happiness\" and instead turn them towards \"illusory happiness\".\n\nThere is a commonly noted problem of translation in grappling with ideas of alienation derived from German-language philosophical texts: the word \"alienation\", and similar words such as \"estrangement\", are often used interchangeably to translate two distinct German words, \"\" and \"\". The former means specifically interpersonal estrangement, while the latter can have a broader and more active meaning that might refer also to externalization, relinquishment, or sale (alienation) of property. In general, and contrary to his predecessors, Marx may have used the terms interchangeably, though he also wrote \"\"Entfremdung\"...constitutes the real interest of this \"Entäußerung\".\"\n\nMany sociologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were concerned about alienating effects of modernization. German sociologists Georg Simmel and Ferdinand Tönnies wrote critical works on individualization and urbanization. Simmel's \"The Philosophy of Money\" describes how relationships become more and more mediated by money. Tönnies' \"Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft\" (\"Community and Society\") is about the loss of primary relationships such as familial bonds in favour of goal-oriented, secondary relationships. This idea of alienation can be observed in some other contexts, although the term may not be as frequently used. In the context of an individual's relationships within society, alienation can mean the unresponsiveness of society as a whole to the individuality of each member of the society. When collective decisions are made, it is usually impossible for the unique needs of each person to be taken into account.\n\nThe American sociologist C. Wright Mills conducted a major study of alienation in modern society with \"\" in 1951, describing how modern consumption-capitalism has shaped a society where you have to sell your personality in addition to your work. Melvin Seeman was part of a surge in alienation research during the mid-20th century when he published his paper, \"On the Meaning of Alienation\", in 1959 (Senekal, 2010b: 7–8). Seeman used the insights of Marx, Emile Durkheim and others to construct what is often considered a model to recognize the five prominent features of alienation: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation and self-estrangement (Seeman, 1959). Seeman later added a sixth element (cultural estrangement), although this element does not feature prominently in later discussions of his work.\n\nIn a broader philosophical context, especially in existentialism and phenomenology, alienation describes the inadequacy of the human being (or the mind) in relation to the world. The human mind (as the subject who perceives) sees the world as an object of perception, and is distanced from the world, rather than living within it. This line of thought is generally traced to the works of Søren Kierkegaard in the 19th century, who, from a Christian viewpoint, saw alienation as separation from God, and also examined the emotions and feelings of individuals when faced with life choices. Many 20th-century philosophers (both theistic and atheistic) and theologians were influenced by Kierkegaard's notions of angst, despair and the importance of the individual. Martin Heidegger's concepts of anxiety (angst) and mortality drew from Kierkegaard; he is indebted to the way Kierkegaard lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence and the importance of passionately affirming one's being-in-the-world. Jean-Paul Sartre described the \"thing-in-itself\" which is infinite and overflowing, and claimed that any attempt to describe or understand the thing-in-itself is \"reflective consciousness\". Since there is no way for the reflective consciousness to subsume the pre-reflective, Sartre argued that all reflection is fated to a form of anxiety (i.e. the human condition). As well, Sartre argued that when a person tries to gain knowledge of the \"Other\" (meaning beings or objects that are not the self), their self-consciousness has a \"masochistic desire\" to be limited. This is expressed metaphorically in the line from the play \"No Exit\", \"Hell is other people\".\n\nIn the theory of psychoanalysis developed around the start of the 20th century, Sigmund Freud did not explicitly address the concept of alienation, but other analysts subsequently have. It is a theory of divisions and conflicts between the conscious and unconscious mind, between different parts of a hypothetical psychic apparatus, and between the self and civilization. It postulates defense mechanisms, including splitting, in both normal and disturbed functioning. The concept of repression has been described as having functionally equivalent effects as the idea of false consciousness associated with Marxist theory.\n\nA form of Western Marxism developed during the century, which included influential analyses of false consciousness by György Lukács. Critics of bureaucracy and the Protestant Ethic also drew on the works of Max Weber.\n\nFigures associated with critical theory, in particular with the Frankfurt School, such as Theodor Adorno and Erich Fromm, also developed theories of alienation, drawing on neo-Marxist ideas as well as other influences including neo-Freudian and sociological theories. One approach applies Marxist theories of commodification to the cultural, educational and party-political spheres. Links are drawn between socioeconomic structures, psychological states of alienation, and personal human relationships. In the 1960s the revolutionary group Situationist International came to some prominence, staging 'situations' intended to highlight an alternative way of life to advanced capitalism, the latter conceptualized as a diffuse 'spectacle', a fake reality masking a degradation of human life. The Theory of Communicative Action associated with Jürgen Habermas emphasizes the essential role of language in public life, suggesting that alienation stems from the distortion of reasoned moral debate by the strategic dominance of market forces and state power.\n\nThis critical program can be contrasted with traditions that attempt to extract problems of alienation from the broader socioeconomic context, or which at least accept the broader context on its own terms, and which often attribute problems to individual abnormality or failures to adjust.\n\nAfter the boom in alienation research that characterized the 1950s and 1960s, interest in alienation research subsided (Geyer, 1996: xii), although in sociology it was maintained by the Research Committee on Alienation of the International Sociological Association (ISA). In the 1990s, there was again an upsurge of interest in alienation prompted by the fall of the Soviet Union, globalization, the information explosion, increasing awareness of ethnic conflicts, and post-modernism (see Geyer, 1996). Geyer believes the growing complexity of the contemporary world and post-modernism prompted a reinterpretation of alienation that suits the contemporary living environment. In late 20th and early 21st century sociology, it has been particularly the works of Felix Geyer, Lauren Langman and Devorah Kalekin-Fishman that address the issue of alienation in the contemporary western world.\n\nAlienation in the sense of a lack of power has been technically defined by Seeman as \"the expectancy or probability held by the individual that his own behaviour cannot determine the occurrence of the outcomes, or reinforcements, he seeks.\" Seeman argues that this is \"the notion of alienation as it originated in the Marxian view of the worker's condition in capitalist society: the worker is alienated to the extent that the prerogative and means of decision are expropriated by the ruling entrepreneurs\". More succinctly, Kalekin-Fishman (1996: 97) says, \"A person suffers from alienation in the form of 'powerlessness' when she is conscious of the gap between what she would like to do and what she feels capable of doing\".\n\nIn discussing powerlessness, Seeman also incorporated the insights of the psychologist Julian Rotter. Rotter distinguishes between internal control and external locus of control, which means \"differences (among persons or situations) in the degree to which success or failure is attributable to external factors (e.g. luck, chance, or powerful others), as against success or failure that is seen as the outcome of one's personal skills or characteristics\". Powerlessness, therefore, is the perception that the individual does not have the means to achieve his goals.\n\nMore recently, Geyer remarks that \"a new type of powerlessness has emerged, where the core problem is no longer being unfree but rather being unable to select from among an overchoice of alternatives for action, whose consequences one often cannot even fathom\". Geyer adapts cybernetics to alienation theory, and writes (1996: xxiv) that powerlessness is the result of delayed feedback: \"The more complex one's environment, the later one is confronted with the latent, and often unintended, consequences of one's actions. Consequently, in view of this causality-obscuring time lag, both the 'rewards' and 'punishments' for one's actions increasingly tend to be viewed as random, often with apathy and alienation as a result\".\n\nA sense of meaning has been defined by Seeman as \"the individual's sense of understanding events in which he is engaged\". Seeman (1959: 786) writes that meaninglessness \"is characterized by a low expectancy that satisfactory predictions about the future outcomes of behaviour can be made.\" Whereas powerlessness refers to the sensed ability to control outcomes, this refers to the sensed ability to predict outcomes. In this respect, meaninglessness is closely tied to powerlessness; Seeman (Ibid.) argues, \"the view that one lives in an intelligible world might be a prerequisite to expectancies for control; and the unintelligibility of complex affairs is presumably conducive to the development of high expectancies for external control (that is, high powerlessness)\".\n\nGeyer (1996: xxiii) believes meaninglessness should be reinterpreted for postmodern times: \"With the accelerating throughput of information [...] meaningless is not a matter anymore of whether one can assign meaning to incoming information, but of whether one can develop adequate new scanning mechanisms to gather the goal-relevant information one needs, as well as more efficient selection procedures to prevent being overburdened by the information one does not need, but is bombarded with on a regular basis.\" \"Information overload\" or the so-called \"data tsunami\" are well-known information problems confronting contemporary man, and Geyer thus argues that meaninglessness is turned on its head.\n\nNormlessness (or what Durkheim referred to as anomie) \"denotes the situation in which the social norms regulating individual conduct have broken down or are no longer effective as rules for behaviour\". This aspect refers to the inability to identify with the dominant values of society or rather, with what are perceived to be the dominant values of society. Seeman (1959: 788) adds that this aspect can manifest in a particularly negative manner, \"The anomic situation [...] may be defined as one in which there is a high expectancy that socially unapproved behaviours are required to achieve given goals\". This negative manifestation is dealt with in detail by Catherine Ross and John Mirowski in a series of publications on mistrust, powerlessness, normlessness and crime.\n\nNeal & Collas (2000: 122) write, \"Normlessness derives partly from conditions of complexity and conflict in which individuals become unclear about the composition and enforcement of social norms. Sudden and abrupt changes occur in life conditions, and the norms that usually operate may no longer seem adequate as guidelines for conduct\". This is a particular issue after the fall of the Soviet Union, mass migrations from developing to developed countries, and the general sense of disillusionment that characterized the 1990s (Senekal, 2011). Traditional values that had already been questioned (especially during the 1960s) were met with further scepticism in the 1990s, resulting in a situation where individuals rely more often on their own judgement than on institutions of authority: \"The individual not only has become more independent of the churches, but from other social institutions as well. The individual can make more personal choices in far more life situations than before\" (Halman, 1998: 100). These choices are not necessarily \"negative\": Halman's study found that Europeans remain relatively conservative morally, even though the authority of the Church and other institutions has eroded.\n\nOne concept used in regard to specific relationships is that of parental alienation, where a child is distanced from and expresses a general dislike for one of their parents (who may have divorced or separated). The term is not applied where there is child abuse. The parental alienation might be due to specific influences from either parent or could result from the social dynamics of the family as a whole. It can also be understood in terms of attachment, the social and emotional process of bonding between child and caregiver. Adoptees can feel alienated from both adoptive parents and birth parents.\n\nFamilial estrangement between parents and adult children \"is attributed to a number of biological, psychological, social, and structural factors affecting the family, including attachment disorders, incompatible values and beliefs, unfulfilled expectations, critical life events and transitions, parental alienation, and ineffective communication patterns.\" The degree of alienation has been positively correlated with decreased emotional functioning in the parent who feels a loss of identity and stigma.\n\nAttachment relationships in adults can also involve feelings of alienation. Indeed, emotional alienation is said to be a common way of life for many, whether it is experienced as overwhelming, or is not admitted to in the midst of a socioeconomic race, or contributes to seemingly unrelated problems.\n\nSocial isolation refers to \"The feeling of being segregated from one's community\". Neal and Collas (2000: 114) emphasize the centrality of social isolation in the modern world: \"While social isolation is typically experienced as a form of personal stress, its sources are deeply embedded in the social organization of the modern world. With increased isolation and atomization, much of our daily interactions are with those who are strangers to us and with whom we lack any ongoing social relationships.\"\n\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, migrants from Eastern Europe and the developing countries have flocked to developed countries in search of a better living standard. This has led to entire communities becoming uprooted: no longer fully part of their homelands, but neither integrated into their adopted communities. Diaspora literature depicts the plights of these migrants, such as Hafid Bouazza in Paravion. Senekal (2010b: 41) argues, \"Low-income communities or religious minorities may feel separated from mainstream society, leading to backlashes such as the civil unrest that occurred in French cities in October 2005. The fact that the riots subsequently spread to Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Switzerland, illustrates that not only did these communities feel segregated from mainstream society, but also that they found a community in their isolation; they regarded themselves as kindred spirits\".\n\nBecause of intense group solidarity and unique daily hardships brought by combat, many veterans feel alienated from citizens, family, and friends when they return. They often feel they have little in common with civilian peers; issues that concern friends and family seem trivial after combat. There is a clarity of focus and purpose that comes with war that few in civilian life will ever know. Afghanistan veteran Brendon O'Byrne says, \"We were really close. Physically and emotionally close. It's kind of terrifying being in such an emotionally safe environment and then suddenly be expelled into an alienated, fractured society.\" The challenges of re-entering a civilian life where few people have experienced combat may contribute to the sense of loneliness. As filmmaker and war correspondent Sebastian Junger says, \"They didn't want to go back because it was traumatic, but because it was a place where they understood what they were supposed to do. They understood who they were. They had a sense of purpose. They were necessary. All these things that young people strive for are answered in combat.\" Veterans often see their wartime experience as the most selfless and meaningful period of their lives. Some veterans have expressed the sentiment that \"even in the quiet moments, war is brighter, louder, brasher, more fun, more tragic, more wasteful. More. More of everything.\"\n\nThe experience of the Vietnam veteran was distinctly different from that of veterans of other American wars. Once he completed his tour of duty, he usually severed all bonds with his unit and comrades. It was extremely rare for a veteran to write to his buddies who were still in combat, and (in strong contrast to the endless reunions of World War II veterans) for more than a decade it was even rarer for more than two or more of them to get together after the war. Korean War veterans had no memorial and precious few parades, but they fought an invading army and they left behind them the free, healthy, thriving, and grateful nation of South Korea. No one spat on them or called them murderers or baby killers when they returned. Only the veterans of Vietnam have endured a concerted, organized, psychological attack by its own people. Never in American history, perhaps never in all of Western civilization, has an army suffered such an agony from its own people. The Vietnam War was a long, contentious conflict (1955–75) which in the mid to late 1960s started to lose political and domestic support, most notably in academia and film that often portrayed soldiers of this conflict as ignoble adding to their social alienation. That the Vietnam War was ultimately lost on April 30, 1975, furthered the sense of meaninglessness and malaise. It has been demonstrated that as the perception of community alienation increases, an individual's sense of confidence or mastery in decision making will decrease, and so too their motivation to socially engage.\n\nOne manifestation of the above dimensions of alienation can be a feeling of estrangement from, and a lack of engagement in, the political system. Such political alienation could result from not identifying with any particular political party or message, and could result in revolution, reforming behavior, or abstention from the political process, possibly due to voter apathy.\n\nA similar concept is policy alienation, where workers experience a state of psychological disconnection from a policy programme being implemented.\n\nSelf-estrangement is an elusive concept in sociology, as recognized by Seeman (1959), although he included it as an aspect in his model of alienation. Some, with Marx, consider self-estrangement to be the end result and thus the heart of social alienation. Self-estrangement can be defined as \"the psychological state of denying one's own interests – of seeking out , activities...\". It could be characterized as a feeling of having become a stranger to oneself, or to some parts of oneself, or alternatively as a problem of self-knowledge, or authenticity.\n\nSeeman (1959) recognized the problems inherent in defining the \"self\", while post-modernism in particular has questioned the very possibility of pin-pointing what precisely \"self\" constitutes. Gergen (1996: 125) argues that: \"the traditional view of self versus society is deeply problematic and should be replaced by a conception of the self as always already immersed in relatedness. On this account, the individual's lament of 'not belonging' is partially a by-product of traditional discourses themselves\". If the self is relationally constituted, does it make sense to speak of \"self-estrangement\" rather than \"social isolation\"? Costas and Fleming (2009: 354) suggest that although the concept of self-estrangement \"has not weathered postmodern criticisms of essentialism and economic determinism well\", the concept still has value if a Lacanian reading of the self is adopted. This can be seen as part of a wider debate on the concept of self between humanism and antihumanism, structuralism and post-structuralism, or nature and nurture.\n\nUntil early in the 20th century, psychological problems were referred to in psychiatry as states of mental alienation, implying that a person had become separated from themselves, their reason or the world. From the 1960s alienation was again considered in regard to clinical states of disturbance, typically using a broad concept of a 'schizoid' ('splitting') process taken from psychoanalytic theory. The splitting was said to occur within regular child development and in everyday life, as well as in more extreme or dysfunctional form in conditions such as schizoid personality and schizophrenia. Varied concepts of alienation and self-estrangement were used to link internal schizoid states with observable symptoms and with external socioeconomic divisions, without necessarily explaining or evidencing underlying causation. R. D. Laing was particularly influential in arguing that dysfunctional families and socioeconomic oppression caused states of alienation and ontological insecurity in people, which could be considered adaptations but which were diagnosed as disorders by mainstream psychiatry and society.(Laing,[1967] 1959). The specific theories associated with Laing and others at that time are not widely accepted, but work from other theoretical perspectives sometimes addresses the same theme.\n\nIn a related vein, for Ian Parker, psychology \"normalizes\" conditions of social alienation. While it could help groups of individuals emancipate themselves, it serves the role of reproducing existing conditions.(Parker, 2007). This view can be seen as part of a broader tradition sometimes referred to as critical psychology or liberation psychology, which emphasizes that an individual is enmeshed within a social-political framework, and so therefore are psychological problems. Similarly, some psychoanalysts suggest that while psychoanalysis emphasizes environmental causes and reactions, it also attributes the problems of individuals to internal conflicts stemming from early psychosocial development, effectively divorcing them from the wider ongoing context. Slavoj Zizek (drawing on Herbert Marcuse, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Lacan's psychoanalysis) argues that in today's capitalist society, the individual is estranged from their self through the repressive injunction to \"enjoy!\" Such an injunction does not allow room for the recognition of alienation and, indeed, could itself be seen as an expression of alienation.(Zizek, 1994).\n\nFrantz Fanon, an early writer on postcolonialism, studied the conditions of objectification and violent oppression (lack of autonomy) believed to have led to mental disorders among the colonized in the Third World (in particular Africans) (Fanon, ([2004] 1961).\n\nA process of 'malignant alienation' has been observed in regard to some psychiatric patients, especially in forensic units and for individuals labeled 'difficult' or who aren't liked by at least some staff, which involves a breakdown of the therapeutic relationship between staff and patients, and which may end in the suicide of the patient. Individuals with long-term mental disorders, which may have originally stemmed from social alienation, can experience particular social and existential alienation within their communities due to other people's and potentially their own negative attitudes towards themselves and 'odd' behavior.\n\nDifferences between persons with disabilities and individuals in relative abilities, or perceived abilities, can be a cause of alienation. One study, \"Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness\", found that among deaf adults one theme emerged consistently across all categories of life experience: social rejection by, and alienation from, the larger hearing community. Only when the respondents described interactions with deaf people did the theme of isolation give way to comments about participation and meaningful interaction. This appeared to be related to specific needs, for example for real conversation, for information, the opportunity to develop close friendships and a sense of family. It was suggested that the social meaning of deafness is established by interaction between deaf and hearing people, sometimes resulting in marginalization of the deaf, which is sometimes challenged. It has also led to the creation of alternatives and the deaf community is described as one such alternative.\n\nPhysicians and nurses often deal with people who are temporarily or permanently alienated from communities, which could be a result or a cause of medical conditions and suffering, and it has been suggested that therefore attention should be paid to learning from experiences of the special pain that alienation can bring.\n\nAlienation is most often represented in literature as the psychological isolation of an individual from society or community. In a volume of Bloom's Literary Themes, Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" is described as the 'supreme literary portrait' of alienation, while noting that some may argue for Achilles in the \"Iliad\". In addition, \"Bartleby, the Scrivener\" is introduced as a perfect example because so many senses of alienation are present. Other literary works described as dealing with the theme of alienation are: \"The Bell Jar\", \"Black Boy\", \"Brave New World\", \"The Catcher in the Rye\", \"The Chosen\", \"Dubliners\", \"Othello\", \"Fahrenheit 451\", \"Invisible Man\", \"Mrs Dalloway\", \"Notes from Underground\", \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", \"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\", \"The Stranger\" and \"The Myth of Sisyphus\", \"The Trial\", \"The Castle\", \"Waiting for Godot\", \"The Waste Land\", and \"Young Goodman Brown\". Contemporary British works noted for their perspective on alienation include \"The Child in Time\", \"London Fields\", \"Trainspotting\", and \"Regeneration\" (Senekal, 2008 & 2010b: 102–123).\n\nSociologist Harry Dahms has analysed The Matrix Trilogy of films in the context of theories of alienation in modern society. He suggests that the central theme of \"The Matrix\" is the \"all-pervasive yet increasingly invisible prevalence of alienation in the world today, and difficulties that accompany attempts to overcome it\".\n\nSee also Langman's study of \"punk, porn, and resistance\" (2008) and Senekal's (2011) study of Afrikaans extreme metal.\n\nBritish progressive rock band Pink Floyd's concept album \"The Wall\" (1979) and British alternative rock band Radiohead's album \"OK Computer\" (1997), both deal with the subject of alienation in their lyrics.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18899714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18899714", "title": "Sperm sorting", "text": "Sperm sorting\n\nSperm sorting is a means of choosing what type of sperm cell is to fertilize the egg cell. Several conventional techniques of centrifugation or swim-up. Newly applied methods such as flow cytometry expand the possibilities of sperm sorting and new techniques of sperm sorting are being developed.\n\nIt can be used to sort out sperm that are most healthy, as well as for determination of more specific traits, such as sex selection in which spermatozoa are separated into X- (female) and Y- (male) chromosome bearing populations based on their difference in DNA content. The resultant 'sex-sorted' spermatozoa are then able to be used in conjunction with other assisted reproductive technologies such as artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) to produce offspring of the desired sex - in farming animals but also in human medical practice.\n\nSeveral methods have been used to sort sperm before the advent of flow cytometry. Density gradient centrifugation (in a continuous or discontinuous gradient) can concentrate semen samples with low concentration of sperm, using the density of sperm as a measure of their quality. Similarly, so-called swim-up techniques apply a centrifugation step and then sperm is allowed to swim up into a medium, thus enriching a subpopulation of motile sperm. However, use of sperm centrifugation is detrimental to the sperm viability and elicits production of reactive oxygen species. Conventional techniques are routinely used in assisted reproductive technology.\n\nFlow cytometry is another method used to sort sperm and adaptations of this technique opens new opportunities in sperm sorting. However, because flow cytometry-based sperm sorting often uses fluorescent dyes that often stain DNA, the safety of this technique in human reproductive medicine is a matter of scientific discussion.\n\nHowever, flow cytometry is the only currently used technique able to determine the sex of future progeny by measuring DNA content of individual sperm cells. It evaluates if they contain the larger X chromosome (giving rise to a female offspring) or smaller Y chromosome (leading to male progeny). It then allows separation of X and Y sperm. The so-called \"Beltsfield Sperm Sexing Technology\" was developed by USDA in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, relying on the DNA difference between the X- and Y- chromosomes. Prior to flow cytometric sorting, semen is labeled with a fluorescent dye called Hoechst 33342 which binds to the DNA of each spermatozoon. As the X chromosome is larger (i.e. has more DNA) than the Y chromosome, the \"female\" (X-chromosome bearing) spermatozoa will absorb a greater amount of dye than its male (Y-chromosome bearing) counterpart. As a consequence, when exposed to UV light during flow cytometry, X spermatozoa fluoresce brighter than Y- spermatozoa. As the spermatozoa pass through the flow cytometer in single file, each spermatozoon is encased by a single droplet of fluid and assigned an electric charge corresponding to its chromosome status (e.g. X-positive charge, Y-negative charge). The stream of X- and Y- droplets is then separated by means of electrostatic deflection and collected into separate collection tubes for subsequent processing.\n\nAnother cytometric technique used in sperm sorting is magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) which is routinely applied in assisted reproduction hospitals to sort out sperm with fragmented DNA. This is achieved using antibodies to surface markers of programmed cell death (apoptosis) such as annexin V, coupled with magnetic beads. Following the binding of these antibodies, spermatozoa which undergo apoptosis are sorted by applying magnetic field to the sperm suspension. MACS obviates the need for fluorescent DNA binding molecules.\n\nDNA damage in sperm cells may be detected by using Raman spectroscopy. It is not specific enough to detect individual traits, however. The sperm cells having least DNA damage may subsequently be injected into the egg cell by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Many other methods for sperm sorting have been proposed or are currently tested.\n\nSperm undergoes a process of natural selection when millions of sperm enter vagina but only few reach the egg cell and then only one is usually allowed to fertilize it. The sperm is selected not only by its highest motility but also by other factors such as DNA integrity, production of reactive oxygen species and viability. This selection is largely circumvented in case of in-vitro fertilization which leads to higher incidence of birth defects associated with assisted reproductive techniques. Egg cells are often fertilized by sperm which would have low chance of fertilizing it in natural conditions. Sperm sorting could thus be used to decrease risks associated with assisted reproduction. Additionally, there is ongoing debate about using sperm sorting for choosing the child's sex.\n\nConventional methods of sperm sorting have been widely used to assess quality of sperm before subsequent artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilization. It has been verified that sperm sorted using these techniques is of superior quality than unsorted. However, important characteristics of sperm such as DNA integrity remain untested by these conventional methods. New flow-cytometry based techniques such as YO-PRO staining can discriminate apoptotic and dead spermatozoa from the viable ones. For example, annexin V staining followed by MACS can significantly improve pregnancy rates in couples with previous assisted reproduction failure.\n\nSperm sorting by flow cytometry is an established technique in veterinary practice, and in the dairy industry most female cows are artificially inseminated with sorted semen to increase the number of female calves (using sperm sorting is less common in other species of farm animals, however artificial insemination is common). Artificial insemination of farm animals with sorted sperm is recognized by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as a promising way of increasing efficiency of agriculture needed to produce enough food for the growing human population. Utilizing artificial insemination with sorted sperm is seen as a way to create an optimal ratio of male and female calves to increase dairy milk production.\n\nChoosing the sex of children might help prevent sex-associated heritable diseases such as Duchene muscular dystrophy or haemophilia in families with a history of these diseases. On the other hand, sperm sorting in humans raises the ethical concerns implicit to the idea of sex selection. If applied large-scale, it has a potential to elicit a sex-ratio imbalance. It could also have implications on gender equality if parents consistently choose to have a boy as their first-born (first-borns were shown to be more likely to succeed in life).\n\nDuring the early to mid-1980s, Glenn Spaulding was the first to sort viable whole human and animal spermatozoa using a flow cytometer, and utilized the sorted motile rabbit sperm for artificial insemination. Subsequently, the first patent application disclosing the method to sort \"two viable subpopulations enriched for x- or y- sperm\" was filed in April 1987 as US Application Serial Number 35,986 and later became part of US Patent 5,021,244; and the patent included the discovery of haploid expression (sex-associated membrane proteins, or SAM proteins) and the development of monoclonal antibodies to those proteins. Additional applications and methods were added, including antibodies, from 1987 through 1997. At the time of the patent filing, both Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories and the USDA were only sorting fixed sperm nuclei, after the Application Serial Number 35,986 patent filing a new technique was utilized by the USDA where \"sperm were briefly sonicated to remove tails\".\n\nThere is no country in the world which explicitly permits sex selection for non-medical purposes. There were 31 countries in 2009 which allowed sex selection in case of sex-linked disease risk or other medical purpose. In the US, for humans, the application of sperm sorting in sex selection is tightly regulated by the FDA. After the establishment of the MicroSort technique, it was offered to parents as a part of a clinical trial. The procedure was made available to a limited number of participants each month, in addition to fulfilling certain criteria, such as having a disease with sex linkage or having at least one child (for family balancing). There are currently MicroSort laboratories and collaborating physicians in several countries (some for general purposes, some only offering service in case of genetic disease risks associated with one sex).\n\nWhile highly accurate, sperm sorting by flow cytometry will not produce two completely separate populations. That is to say, there will always be some \"male\" sperm among the \"female\" sperm and vice versa. The exact percentage purity of each population is dependent on the species being sorted and the 'gates' which the operator places around the total population visible to the machine. In general, the larger the DNA difference between the X and Y chromosome of a species, the easier it is to produce a highly pure population. In sheep and cattle, purities for each sex will usually remain above 90% depending on 'gating', while for humans these may be reduced to 90% and 70% for \"female\" and \"male\" spermatozoa, respectively.\n\n"}
{"id": "51472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51472", "title": "Spore", "text": "Spore\n\nIn biology, a spore is a unit of sexual or asexual reproduction that may be adapted for dispersal and for survival, often for extended periods of time, in unfavourable conditions. Spores form part of the life cycles of many plants, algae, fungi and protozoa. Bacterial spores are not part of a sexual cycle but are resistant structures used for survival under unfavourable conditions. Myxozoan spores release amoebulae into their hosts for parasitic infection, but also reproduce within the hosts through the pairing of two nuclei within the plasmodium, which develops from the amoebula.\n\nSpores are usually haploid and unicellular and are produced by meiosis in the sporangium of a diploid sporophyte. Under favourable conditions the spore can develop into a new organism using mitotic division, producing a multicellular gametophyte, which eventually goes on to produce gametes. Two gametes fuse to form a zygote which develops into a new sporophyte. This cycle is known as alternation of generations.\n\nThe spores of seed plants, however, are produced internally and the megaspores, formed within the ovules and the microspores are involved in the formation of more complex structures that form the dispersal units, the seeds and pollen grains.\n\nThe term \"spore\" derives from the ancient Greek word σπορά \"spora\", meaning \"seed, sowing\", related to σπόρος \"sporos\", \"sowing,\" and σπείρειν \"speirein\", \"to sow.\"\n\nIn common parlance, the difference between a \"spore\" and a \"gamete\" (both together called gonites) is that a spore will germinate and develop into a sporeling, while a gamete needs to combine with another gamete to form a zygote before developing further.\n\nThe main difference between spores and seeds as dispersal units is that spores are unicellular, while seeds contain within them a multicellular gametophyte that produces a developing embryo, the multicellular sporophyte of the next generation. Spores germinate to give rise to haploid gametophytes, while seeds germinate to give rise to diploid sporophytes.\n\nVascular plant spores are always haploid. Vascular plants are either homosporous (or isosporous) or heterosporous. Plants that are homosporous produce spores of the same size and type. \n\nHeterosporous plants, such as seed plants, spikemosses, quillworts, and ferns of the order Salviniales produce spores of two different sizes: the larger spore (megaspore) in effect functioning as a \"female\" spore and the smaller (microspore) functioning as a \"male\". Such plants typically give rise to the two kind of spores from within separate sporangia, either a megasporangium that produces megaspores or a microsporangium that produces microspores. In flowering plants, these sporangia occur within the carpel and anthers, respectively.\n\nFungi commonly produce spores, as a result of sexual, or asexual, reproduction. Spores are always haploid and grow into mature haploid individuals through mitotic division of cells. In multicellular species, the visible fungus is composed entirely of haploid cells. Only during sexual reproduction are diploid cells present, as a result of the fusion of two haloid gamate cells. These diploid cells produce the haploid spores.\n\nSpores can be classified in several ways:\n\nIn fungi and fungus-like organisms, spores are often classified by the structure in which meiosis and spore production occurs. Since fungi are often classified according to their spore-producing structures, these spores are often characteristic of a particular taxon of the fungi.\n\n\n\nSpores can be differentiated by whether they can move or not.\n\nUnder high magnification, spores can be categorized as either monolete spores or trilete spores. In monolete spores, there is a single line on the spore indicating the axis on which the mother spore was split into four along a vertical axis. In trilete spores, all four spores share a common origin and are in contact with each other, so when they separate, each spore shows three lines radiating from a center pole.\n\nEnvelope-enclosed spore tetrads are taken as the earliest evidence of plant life on land, dating from the mid-Ordovician (early Llanvirn, ~), a period from which no macrofossils have yet been recovered.\nIndividual trilete spores resembling those of modern cryptogamic plants first appeared in the fossil record at the end of the Ordovician period.\n\nIn fungi, both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores of many fungal species are actively dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as travelling through the air over long distances. Many fungi thereby possess specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms as well as spore-surface structures, such as hydrophobins, for spore ejection. These mechanisms include, for example, forcible discharge of ascospores enabled by the structure of the ascus and accumulation of osmolytes in the fluids of the ascus that lead to explosive discharge of the ascospores into the air.\n\nThe forcible discharge of single spores termed \"ballistospores\" involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000 g. Other fungi rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces, exemplified by puffballs. Attracting insects, such as flies, to fruiting structures, by virtue of their having lively colours and a putrid odour, for dispersal of fungal spores is yet another strategy, most prominently used by the stinkhorns.\n\nIn Common Smoothcap moss (\"Atrichum undulatum\"), the vibration of sporophyte has been shown to be an important mechanism for spore release.\n\nIn the case of spore-shedding vascular plants such as ferns, wind distribution of very light spores provides great capacity for dispersal. Also, spores are less subject to animal predation than seeds because they contain almost no food reserve; however they are more subject to fungal and bacterial predation. Their chief advantage is that, of all forms of progeny, spores require the least energy and materials to produce.\n\nIn the spikemoss \"Selaginella lepidophylla\", dispersal is achieved in part by an unusual type of diaspore, a tumbleweed.\n\n"}
{"id": "25816276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25816276", "title": "Sugarscape", "text": "Sugarscape\n\nSugarscape is a model for artificially intelligent agent-based social simulation following some or all rules presented by Joshua M. Epstein & Robert Axtell in their book \"Growing Artificial Societies\".\n\nFundaments of Sugarscape models can be traced back to the University of Maryland where economist Thomas Schelling presented his paper titled \"Models of Segregation\". Written in 1969, Schelling and the rest of the social environment modelling fraternity had their options limited by a lack of adequate computing power and an applicable programming mechanism to fully develop the potential of their model.\n\nJohn Conway's agent-based simulation \"Game of Life\" was enhanced and applied to Schelling's original idea by Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell in their book \"Growing Artificial Societies\". To demonstrate their findings on the field of agent-based simulation, a model was created and distributed with their book on CD-ROM. The concept of this model has come to be known as \"the Sugarscape model\". Since then, the name \"Sugarscape\" has been used for agent-based models using rules similar to those defined by Epstein & Axtell.\n\nAll Sugarscape models include the agents (inhabitants), the environment (a two-dimensional grid) and the rules governing the interaction of the agents with each other and the environment.\n\nThe original model presented by J. Epstein & R. Axtell (considered as the first large scale agent model) is based on a 51x51 cell grid, where every cell can contain different amounts of sugar (or spice). In every step agents look around, find the closest cell filled with sugar, move and metabolize. They can leave pollution, die, reproduce, inherit sources, transfer information, trade or borrow sugar, generate immunity or transmit diseases - depending on the specific scenario and variables defined at the set-up of the model.\n\nSugar in simulation could be seen as a metaphor for resources in an artificial world through which the examiner can study the effects of social dynamics such as evolution, marital status and inheritance on populations.\n\nExact simulation of the original rules provided by J. Epstein & R. Axtell in their book can be problematic and it is not always possible to recreate the same results as those presented in \"Growing Artificial Societies\".\n\nThe Sugarscape model has had several implementations, some of which are available as open source software.\n\nAn original implementation was developed in Ascape, Java software suitable for agent-based social simulation. The Sugarscape model remains part of the built-in library of models distributed with Ascape.\n\nNetLogo has been used to build Sugarscape models. Three Sugarscape scenarios are included in the NetLogo Models Library: \"Immediate Growback\", \"Constant Growback\" and \"Wealth Distribution\". Besides these three scenarios lies Iain Weaver's Sugarscape NetLogo model, which is part of the User Community Models Library. \"It builds on Owen Densmore's NetLogo community model to encompass all rules discussed in \"Growing Artificial Societies\" with the exception of the combat rule (although trivial to include, it adds little value to the model).\" The model is equipped with rich documentation including instructions for successful replication of the original Sugarscape rules.\n\nDue to the emergent nature of agent-based models (ABMs), it is critical that the population sizes in the simulations match the population sizes of the dynamic systems being modelled. However, the performance of contemporary agent simulation frameworks has been inadequate to handle such large population sizes and parallel computing frameworks designed to run on computing clusters has been limited by available bandwidth. As computing power increases with Moore's law, the size and complexity of simulation frameworks can be expected to increase. The team of R. M. D’Souza, M. Lysenko and K Rahmani from Michigan Technological University used a Sugarscape model to demonstrate the power of Graphics processing units (GPU) in ABM simulations with over 50 updates per second with agent populations exceeding 2 millions.\n\nAnother implementation can be found written in Mathematica.\n\nGMU's MASON project, available under the Academic Free License, also includes an implementation of Sugarscape.\n\n"}

Chirality may arise in a supramolecular system if one of its component is chiral or if achiral components arrange in a non symmetrical way to produce a supermolecule that is chiral.\n\n \n"}
{"id": "20058880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20058880", "title": "The Myth of Male Power", "text": "The Myth of Male Power\n\nThe Myth of Male Power: Why Men are the Disposable Sex is a 1993 book by Warren Farrell, in which Farrell argues that the widespread perception of men having inordinate social and economic power is false, and that men are systematically disadvantaged in many ways.\n\nLike Herb Goldberg's \"The Hazards of Being Male\", Farrell's \"The Myth of Male Power\" is considered a standard of the men's movement, and has been translated into several languages, including German and Italian.\n\nIn \"The Myth of Male Power\", Warren Farrell offered his first in-depth outline of the thesis he would eventually apply in his subsequent books—books on communication (\"Women Can’t Hear What Men Don’t Say\"), parenting (\"Father and Child Reunion\"), and the workplace (\"Why Men Earn More\").\nAs \"The Myth of Male Power's\" title implies, Farrell challenges the belief that men have the power by challenging the definition of power. Farrell defines power as \"control over one's life.\" He writes that, \"In the past, neither sex had power; both sexes had roles: women's role was [to] raise children; men's role was [to] raise money.\"\nOne of the examples that Farrell uses to illustrate male powerlessness is male-only draft registration. He writes that if any other single group (the examples he lists are Jews, African-Americans, and women) were selected based on their birth characteristics to be the only group required by law to register for potential death, we would call it anti-Semitism, racism or genocidal sexism. Men, he says, have been socialized to call it \"glory\" and \"power,\" and as a result do not view this as a negative.\n\nFarrell contends that this viewpoint creates psychological problems for both sexes: that \"men's weakness is their facade of strength; women's strength is their facade of weakness.\" He adds that societies have generally socialized boys and men to define power as, in essence, \"feeling obligated to earn money someone else spends while we die sooner.\" Feeling obligated, he contends, is not power.\n\nThe subtitle of the book is \"Why Men are the Disposable Sex.\" Farrell argues that historically both sexes were disposable in the service of survival: women risked death in childbirth; men risked death in war. However, Farrell notes, there is a key difference: women's disposability emanated more from biology; men's expendability required socialization.\n\nFarrell observes various characteristics of modern US society, such as the tendency to assign higher-risk jobs - soldier, firefighter, coal miner, and so on - to men: almost all of the most hazardous professions are all-male, and segments within professions have higher percentages of men as their level of hazard increases. Other statistics, in conjunction with the lack of public outcry or mobilization around them, point in the same direction of male expendability. Men are victims of violent crime twice as often as women and are \"three times more likely to be murder victims\". Suicide rates are much higher for men than for women. While the death rates for breast cancer and prostate cancer are comparable, the US spends six times as much on breast cancer.\n\nThese statistics, Farrell suggests, can only be explained if US society places greater value on the lives of women than of men. Todd Jones cites this as an example of abductive reasoning: rightly or wrongly, Farrell assumes that such behavior is rational, and the only explanation then is that \"women are actually perceived as the valuable gender (especially in evolutionary terms) who need to be protected and preserved at all cost, while men (a dime a dozen in evolutionary terms) are thought of as essentially disposable\".\n\nFarrell posits that men and women need to make an evolutionary shift from a focus on survival to a focus on a proper balance between survival and fulfillment.\n\nHe claims that the women's movement has led to the re-socialization of girls to become women who balance survival with fulfillment but that there has been no similar re-socialization of boys to become men who pursue that balance once they take on the responsibility of children. Thus, Farrell believes, boys and men are decades behind girls and women psychologically and socially, and increasingly behind women academically and economically.\nIn Farrell's recent presentations on this topic, he estimates that men are in 2011 where women were in 1961.\n\nFarrell's political solution is \"neither a women's movement blaming men nor a men's movement blaming women, but a gender transition movement.\" He defines a gender transition movement as one that fosters a transition from the rigid roles of our past to more flexible roles for the future.\n\nMen, Farrell posits, learn to earn money to gain the approval of their parents and the respect of other men; heterosexual men also learn to earn money to earn their way to female love (\"Women don't marry men reading \"Why Men Are the Way They Are\" in the unemployment line.\")\n\nFarrell introduced in \"The Myth of Male Power\" a thesis that he pursued in-depth in \"Why Men Earn More\" in 2005: that earning money involves forfeiting power. He goes on to describe his theory that earning money is less about power, and more about trade-offs. Farrell proposes that \"the road to high pay is a toll road--you earn more when you pay 25 specific tolls such as working more hours, or taking less-fulfilling or more-hazardous jobs...\"\n\nAcademic Kenneth Clatterbaugh, in an overview of literature of the men's movement, comments that \"eventually, [Farrell's] arguments reach absurd heights, as when Farrell actually argues against sexual harassment laws and child molestation laws on the grounds that they give even more power (to abuse men) to (women) employees and children\".\n\nSocial critic Camille Paglia, writing for \"The Washington Post\", sais \"The Myth of Male Power\" \"attacks the unexamined assumptions of feminist discourse with shocking candor and forces us to see our everyday world from a fresh perspective\", though she added that Farrell is sometimes guilty of \"questionable selectiveness or credulity about historical sources\". Paglia nevertheless concludes that the book \"is the kind of original, abrasive, heretical text that is desperately needed to restore fairness and balance to the present ideology-sodden curriculum of women's studies courses.\"\n\nReviewer Robert Winder describes the book as \"shock-horror hyperbole posing as scholarship\" and goes on to write \"...Farrell might be right to see the gender conflict as a war to which only one side has turned up, but this is only a sarcastic way of confessing to an authentic male worry: the twinge of jealousy men sometimes feel when confronted by feminine solidarity. Farrell, however, just like some of his female opposite numbers, prefers accusation to self-examination\".\n\nLinda Mealey notes that the book is recommended reading for educators in the social sciences, particularly gender studies; she does critique Farrell, for easily seeing causality in correlation.\n\nAcademic Margot Mifflin, writes that \"most of Farrell’s tit-for-tat theories about man’s greater societal burden are slanted, self-serving, and absurdly simplistic.\"\n\nAnthropologist Melvin Konner writes that, like Christina Hoff Sommers' \"Who Stole Feminism?\" (1994), \"The Myth of Male Power\" is a good antidote to the way in which \"real knowledge about sex roles...tends to get buried in postmodernist rhetoric.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Times notes that \"...some critics say 'The Myth of Male Power' goes beyond the nurturing rituals of the male movement to mount an outright assault on the victories of the modern women's movement.\"\n\nAn article in Mother Jones notes that the book \"...has spawned a network of activists and sites that take Farrell’s ideology in a disturbing direction.\"\n\nThe book includes several factual errors concerning murderer Laurie Dann, who is used as an example of violence against men by women. Farrell states that all of her victims were male, that she burned down a Young Men's Jewish Council, burned two boys in a basement, shot her own son, and alleged that she killed an eight-year old rapist. Some men's rights activists, academics, and media figures have repeated Farrell's errors and conclusion. Farrell later issued a correction on his web site.\n\n\n"}
